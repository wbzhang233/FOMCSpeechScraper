Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Bank of Japan-Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies Conference\nPrice Dynamics and Monetary Policy Challenges – Lessons Learned and Going Forward\nTokyo, Japan\nMay 28, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Governor Ueda, the Bank of Japan, and its Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies for\ninviting me to participate on this panel. In the brief time allotted for my prepared remarks, I will discuss\nforward guidance. My basic point will be that the effectiveness of forward guidance as a policy tool in\nextraordinary times can be enhanced by improving monetary policy communications in normal times.\nTwo phrases you often hear in real life are “use your words” and “connect the dots.” In my view, both\nshould be applied to the FOMC’s monetary policy communications. Of course, the views I will present\nas a panelist will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nForward Guidance as a Policy Tool\nIn extraordinary times, in particular, when the policy rate has been lowered to its effective lower bound,\ntheory suggests that explicit forward guidance about the future path of policy can be used as a policy tool\nand not just for the purpose of transparency and communications. It has the potential to increase the\ncurrent degree of monetary policy accommodation by influencing the public’s expectations. By reducing\nuncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance can help lower interest rates by reducing the\npremiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty. In addition, in theory, if the\ncentral bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be held lower and for longer\nthan would be consistent with the central bank’s past behavior, this can put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, thereby adding accommodation. It has the potential to spur current economic activity\nbecause if people believe that the central bank is committed to keeping interest rates very low, they will\nexpect higher economic activity and higher inflation in the future and that will induce them to make\ninvestments in capital and labor today. Note, though, that for forward guidance to have this effect, the\npublic must believe that the central bank is committed to setting policy differently than it has in the past.\nIf the public doesn’t understand this but, instead, believes that the central bank is behaving as usual, it\n\n\f2\ncould misinterpret a very low policy rate as suggesting a gloomier outlook, and this misinterpretation\nwould work to depress current activity – the exact opposite of the intended effect.1\n\nThe Fed, along with other central banks, used forward guidance as a policy tool during the global\nfinancial crisis and during the pandemic.2 As the FOMC gained experience, the form of its forward\nguidance during the global financial crisis changed over time, from qualitative guidance giving a\nqualitative characterization of the length of time economic conditions would warrant keeping the policy\nrate exceptionally low, to calendar-date guidance, to state-contingent guidance giving thresholds for the\nunemployment rate and inflation that would need to be met before moving off of the effective lower\nbound on the policy rate.3 In the pandemic, the FOMC used state-contingent forward guidance, indicating\nthat it expected to keep the funds rate target at 0 to 1/4 percent until the economy had reached maximum\nemployment, and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for\nsome time. It put this guidance in place in September 2020, after the August release of the results of the\nFOMC’s framework review and revised long-term strategy statement. And it kept this guidance in place\nuntil December 2021, when PCE inflation had been running over 3 percent since April 2021.\n\nChallenges to Using Forward Guidance as a Policy Tool\nReviews undertaken after the global financial crisis suggest that forward guidance was, in general, a\nuseful monetary policy tool, partly as a communications device and partly because it helped to support\nother unconventional actions taken by central banks.4 But the reviews also suggest that forward guidance\n\n1\n\nSee Woodford (2012).\n\nThese were not the Fed’s first experiences of providing some communication about future interest rates. The\nFOMC began releasing policy statements in 1994, and 2003 was the first time it included forward guidance on the\nexpected future path of the policy rate. For a discussion of earlier episodes of very low interest rates in the U.S., see\nCarlson, Eggertsson, and Mertens (2008).\n2\n\nOther central banks used forward guidance before the global financial crisis, including the Bank of Japan, which\nintroduced forward guidance in April 1999, two months after lowering its policy rate to zero in the wake of\ndeflation. See Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS, BIS) (2019).\n3\n\nFor a timeline of the forward guidance that the Fed used during the global financial crisis, see Mester (2018).\n\n4\n\nSee Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS, BIS) (2019).\n\n\f3\nwas challenging to design and estimates of the resultant reduction in long-term interest rates differ over\nstudies. The changing nature of the forward guidance used during the global financial crisis and the\nformulation of forward guidance during the pandemic when inflation rose to unanticipated levels support\nthe view that implementing the guidance is not an easy thing to do.\n\nTwo inherent difficulties come to mind. First, theory suggests that to be effective as a policy tool,\nforward guidance involves committing the policymaker to a future policy path that differs from one\nimplied by the policymaker’s usual policy reaction function. In other words, it commits the policymaker\nto using a different reaction function. But policymakers are loath to make those types of commitments –\ntime-inconsistency problems loom large.5 Contingencies can be included in the guidance, but that tends\nto limit the commitment, thereby watering down the potential effectiveness. Also, it is not clear that\nmarket participants pay enough attention to the conditional nature of the guidance. If they do not, then a\nchange in policy, even if implicit in the guidance, could lower the central bank’s credibility. Given the\ntime-inconsistency problems, it is challenging for central banks to credibly commit to a policy path that\ndiffers from normal policy without a temporary change in the framework, e.g., price-level targeting. This\nsuggests that explicit forward guidance about the rate path should be used judiciously and only in\nextraordinary times.\n\nA second difficulty is that the effectiveness of forward guidance in extraordinary times depends on the\npublic understanding that the policy path in the forward guidance is a deviation from normal behavior,\nwhich means the public needs to understand the policymakers’ normal reaction function, which conveys\nhow policy normally reacts to changes in economic conditions, whether those changes were anticipated or\n\n5\n\nEvans (2017) discusses the time-inconsistency problems inherent in what he calls Odyssean forward guidance,\nwhich involves commitment, in contrast to Delphic forward guidance, which central banks use in normal times.\nThe literature has suggested different mechanisms for increasing the credibility of the commitment inherent in\nforward guidance, including temporarily increasing the inflation target, targeting nominal GDP instead of inflation,\nand targeting the price level instead of inflation. See the discussion of forward guidance and other policies at the\nzero lower bound in Woodford (2012).\n\n\f4\nnot. It has been challenging to convey how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy\nevolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular policy path regardless of how the\neconomy actually evolves.\n\nEnhancements to Monetary Policy Communications in Normal Times\nThe Fed has been enhancing its communications over time. Still, there are times when market\nparticipants’ policy expectations differ from the FOMC’s, which raises the question about the\neffectiveness of our communications in terms of their transparency and/or credibility. Market\nparticipants’ expectations of the path of policy can differ from policymakers’ expected path because\nmarket participants have a different economic outlook despite seeing the same data or because they don’t\nunderstand policymakers’ reaction function or don’t view it as credible. Similarly, research suggests that\nthe public also doesn’t necessarily understand or pay attention to central bank communications, thus\nlimiting the effectiveness of those communications.6 But recent research using randomized trials suggests\nthat the general public’s belief that the central bank will maintain price stability can be enhanced with\neffective policy communication.7 To the extent that enhancements to policy communications strengthen\nthe public’s understanding of the Fed’s reaction function in normal times, it would make explicit forward\nguidance more effective when it is used in extraordinary times. I will make two recommendations for\nFOMC communications: use your words and connect the dots.\n(1) Use your words: The FOMC policy statements have become shorter over time, giving less\ninformation about the FOMC’s medium-run outlook and risks around that outlook, which form the basis\nof our policy decisions. While simpler is often seen as a virtue, it can also be a detriment, since\npolicymaking has to be done in an uncertain world, one in which the economy is constantly being\nbuffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated.8 With short\n\n6\n\nSee Knotek, et al. (2024).\n\n7\n\nIn a study using randomized information treatments in the six largest euro area countries, Ehrmann, Georgarakos,\nand Kenny (2024) find that communicating information about the inflation target can increase the central bank’s\ncredibility to maintain price stability over the medium term, even in periods in which inflation has risen.\n8\n\nI discuss uncertainty and monetary policymaking in Mester (2016).\n\n\f5\nstatements, each word takes on added significance. Short statements suffer from what I call a “Hotel\nCalifornia” problem: we are reluctant to change particular words because of the possible signal that doing\nso may send. Words “check in” but it is hard to get them to “check out” even when it is desirable. One\ncould argue that the use of “transitory” to describe inflation stayed in the FOMC statement far too long,\ngiven economic conditions.9 Short statements also make it harder for the public to see the linkage\nbetween economic developments and policy action or inaction. When members of the public don’t\nunderstand the rationale for policy decisions, it can leave them with the impression that policymakers are\nacting in a discretionary manner and that lessens credibility.\n\nIn my view, it would be preferable for policymakers to take control of the narrative by using more words\nto describe the current assessment of economic developments, how they have influenced the outlook, and\nthe risks to that outlook. Putting somewhat less weight on the modal outlook and more on potential risks\nto the outlook would help the public understand that if certain risks are realized, policy may have to\ndeviate from the previously communicated modal path. It would give market participants and the general\npublic a better sense of the contingent, data-dependent nature of policymaking and would raise the central\nbank’s credibility in that a change in policy would be seen less as a breach of promise. Scenario analysis\nshould also be incorporated as a standard part of communications.10 This could be particularly useful in\nperiods like today when the underlying structural elements of the economy may have changed.\n(2) Connect the dots: My second suggestion is for the FOMC to connect the participants’ policy\npath dots and their economic projections in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).11 In other\nwords, the FOMC should publish the anonymized matrix of economic and policy projections so that\n\n“Transitory” was removed as a characterization of inflation in the FOMC’s December 2021 statement. Year-overyear PCE inflation had been running above 3 percent since April 2021.\n9\n\n10\n\nI discussed this recommendation in Mester (2023).\n\nIn his review of the Bank of England’s forecasting and communications, Bernanke (2024) suggests including\nanalyses of alternative scenarios in both internal discussions and as part of communications to the public. Such\nalternative scenarios could illuminate salient risks to the outlook when economic conditions evolve differently than\nexpected or the underlying structure of the economy differs from what is assumed in the models.\n11\n\nI discussed this recommendation in Mester (2018).\n\n\f6\nmarket participants can see the linkage between each participant’s outlook and his or her view of\nappropriate monetary policy associated with that outlook. Currently, the variables in the SEP are not\nlinked across participants, and the median paths provided don’t necessarily represent a coherent forecast.\nFor example, there is no guarantee that someone projecting the median inflation path would necessarily\nbe projecting the median output path. There is no way for the public to know whether a person low in the\nrange of unemployment rate forecasts is high in the range of inflation projections. And two participants\ncould project the same federal funds rate paths, but those paths could be associated with very different\neconomic forecasts. If we were to connect the dots to the forecasts within the SEP, the public would get a\nbetter sense of each individual policymaker’s reaction function.\n\nOf course, broader enhancements to communications should be considered, including reconsidering the\nformulation of a consensus forecast of the FOMC, providing more information on how the FOMC\nconsiders financial stability issues when setting monetary policy, the interplay between balance-sheet\npolicy and interest-rate policy, and the use of simple monetary policy rules as benchmarks for explaining\npolicy decisions.12 Enhancements to communications would make monetary policy more effective in\nnormal times and also improve the effectiveness of nonconventional policy tools, such as forward\nguidance, in extraordinary times. I expect that the FOMC will consider communications as part of its\nnext monetary policy framework review, given the central role communications play in the\nimplementation of monetary policy.\n\n12\n\nIn 2012, the FOMC experimented with developing a forecast representing the consensus of the Committee. I\ndiscuss the benefits and challenges of formulating a consensus FOMC forecast in Mester (2016).\n\n\f7\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., “Forecasting for Monetary Policy Making and Communication at the Bank of England:\nA Review,” April 12, 2024.\n(https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/independent-evaluation-office/forecasting-for-monetary-policymaking-and-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review/forecasting-for-monetary-policy-makingand-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review)\nCarlson, Mark, Gauti Eggertsson, and Elmar Mertens, “2.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBriefings for Business\nWayne Economic Development Council\nWooster, OH\nMay 16, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Wayne Economic Development Council for inviting me to speak on the economy and\nmonetary policy in the council’s Briefings for Business series. The council’s work to foster economic\ndevelopment in the region aligns with the Federal Reserve’s mission to foster a strong economy.\n\nEddie Steiner is an active member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Board of Directors, and\nchairs the Board’s Audit Committee, and Steve Matthew, who will be moderating the question-andanswer portion of today’s session, is an active member of our Northeast Ohio Business Advisory Council.\nI will take this opportunity to thank them for their public service, which helps our Bank fulfill its mission.\nI also thank the many others in this room who regularly provide us with insights into economic\nconditions. These insights help to inform the Cleveland Fed’s section of the Beige Book, the summary of\nregional economic developments published by the Federal Reserve prior to each FOMC meeting. The\nreconnaissance that you provide on business activity, the labor market, community conditions, and\nfinancial conditions is often more timely than the official data, and it helps us evaluate not only where the\neconomy is but where it is going. You play a role in monetary policymaking because the information you\nprovide informs my views of the economy and monetary policy, and it helps the FOMC make more\ninformed monetary policy decisions in pursuit of its statutory goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment.\n\nI am especially looking forward to the question-and-answer portion of our session because I learn a lot\nfrom hearing what is on your mind. But before we get into today’s dialogue, I thought it would be helpful\nto frame the discussion by offering some remarks about the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the\nviews I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f2\nEconomic Developments\nAt our FOMC meeting about two weeks ago, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the\nfederal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings. We have held our policy rate at this restrictive level since July of last year.\n\nThe FOMC reiterated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until the\nCommittee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our goal of 2\npercent. Substantial progress has been made on the inflation front since inflation peaked in 2022, in the\nrange of 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure. In the second half of last year, inflation readings came\nin lower than expected, and PCE inflation was running at about our 2 percent goal over those six months.\nBut the year-over-year measures of inflation remained elevated, and we knew it was too soon to declare\nvictory over inflation. Over the first three months of this year, we have seen no further progress on PCE\ninflation. In fact, measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation moved up to 2.7 percent in March and\ncore PCE inflation remained at 2.8 percent. The three-month changes are running considerably above the\nlevels seen over the second half of last year. Over the past three months, PCE inflation in core goods and\nPCE inflation in core services excluding housing have moved up, and housing services inflation has\nmoved sideways. Yesterday’s CPI inflation report is the first inflation reading for April. We saw a\nwelcome tick down in the monthly readings for total and core CPI inflation, though those readings were\nhigher than those we saw in the second half of last year.\n\nI had expected the progress on inflation to slow this year compared to last year, because I didn’t think we\nwould get as much help from supply-side adjustments. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have\nimproved over the past three years and the labor market has been normalizing. People have returned to\nthe labor force over time, and immigration has also increased the supply of labor. The healing of the\nsupply side of the economy contributed to last year’s disinflation, and we are not likely to get as much\n\n\f3\nhelp on inflation from the supply side as we saw last year. Progress will depend more on moderating\ndemand.\n\nStill, the lack of progress on inflation so far this year has been disappointing. I think it is too early to\nconclude that progress on inflation has stalled out or that inflation is poised to reverse course: the journey\nback to price stability was never expected to follow a smooth path. But the recent readings have not\ninspired greater confidence in me, and we will need to accumulate further data over the coming months to\nhave a clearer picture of the inflation outlook. I now believe that it will take longer to reach our 2 percent\ngoal than I previously thought. But the Fed remains strongly committed to returning the economy to\nprice stability.\n\nThe good news is that the economy is well positioned to allow us to accumulate those data without\nconcern that monetary policy is overly restrictive. A remarkable thing about last year’s disinflation is that\nit occurred in the midst of strong economic growth and labor markets. Last year, the economy grew at a\npace above 3 percent, which is higher than my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. Indicators point to\ncontinued underlying momentum in the economy this year. According to the advance estimate, GDP\ngrowth did moderate to a 1.6 percent pace in the first quarter. But that step down reflected the inventory\nand trade components, which are often revised in subsequent releases as more data come in. Final sales to\nprivate domestic purchasers, which is a better indicator of underlying demand, continued to rise at a pace\nof around 3 percent. Consumer spending has remained healthy, despite rising credit card delinquency\nrates, and business fixed investment in equipment and software has strengthened, consistent with the\nanecdotal evidence from business contacts. Indeed, leading up to the FOMC meeting two weeks ago,\nthere was a significant change in tone from the contacts in our District. Many reported that economic\nactivity had strengthened and by more than they had anticipated.\n\n\f4\nLabor market conditions also remain strong. Payroll job growth has been remarkably resilient. Job gains\naveraged about 270 thousand per month in the first quarter of this year compared to around 210 thousand\nper month the previous quarter. Employment did moderate last month to a still healthy gain of 175\nthousand. The unemployment rate remains low, at 3.9 percent in April. Still, the labor market has come\ninto better balance over time as demand for workers has moderated while the supply has increased. The\ngap between the number of open jobs and the number of unemployed workers has narrowed. It is now\nabout 1.3, only slightly above the 1.2 level seen in the strong labor market conditions in 2019. Our\nregional contacts report that while it remains difficult to find candidates with the skills needed for some\njobs, in general, it has become easier to hire over time.\n\nAs labor demand has come into better balance with labor supply, wage pressures have eased. Firms in\nour District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down from 5 percent a year\nago. And the wage premium workers can get from switching jobs compared to staying in their current\njobs has moved back down to pre-pandemic levels.1 It had shot up after the pandemic shutdown when\nfirms were in desperate need of workers.\n\nWhether wage growth adds to price pressures depends on whether wages adjusted for inflation are\ngrowing faster than the growth in labor productivity. Based on current estimates of trend productivity\ngrowth, which lie in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range, wage growth is still above the level consistent with 2\npercent inflation.2 But there is the possibility that changes in technology are leading to higher trend\nproductivity growth. The scarcity of workers during the pandemic gave firms a great incentive to invest\n\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker at https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growthtracker.\n1\n\n2\n\nCurrent estimates suggest that trend productivity growth remains relatively low, in the 1 to 1.5 percent range. See\nthe website https://sites.google.com/view/james-a-kahn-economics/home/trend-productivity-update, which provides\nthe latest estimates of trend productivity growth based on the model in James A. Kahn and Robert W. Rich,\n“Tracking the New Economy: Using Growth Theory to Detect Changes in Trend Productivity,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 54, September 2007, pp. 1670-1701. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2006.07.008)\n\n\f5\nin automation, and new technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing productivity\nover the medium to longer run. If the higher productivity growth readings we saw last year are sustained,\nthen current levels of wage growth could continue without adding to price pressures.\n\nThe Economy in Ohio\nThe current developments in activity, employment, and inflation at the national level are also reflected in\nOhio’s economy. As in the nation, labor market conditions in the state remain strong but show some\nsigns of moderating. The state’s unemployment rate has ticked up this year, but stood at 3.8 percent in\nMarch, which is near its historical low. Employment growth over the first three months of the year has\nslowed from last year’s strong pace. And as I mentioned, employers in the state tell us it is easier to hire\nnow. Immigration has likely contributed to that easing. Last year, immigration was the main driver of an\nincrease in Ohio’s population, the first yearly rise in population since the pandemic.3 All in all, we have\nseen strong labor market performance in the state.\n\nOhio is the seventh largest economy in the nation in terms of gross state product. Manufacturing and,\nwithin manufacturing, auto and auto parts constitute an important sector of Ohio’s economy, and\ncompared to the nation, manufacturing represents a larger share of payroll jobs in Ohio. But that\ndifferential has fallen over time as the economy here has diversified from one largely dependent on\nmanufacturing and heavy industry to one in which healthcare and education play a significant role. In the\n1990s, manufacturing represented about 20 percent of Ohio’s jobs and “eds and meds” represented about\n12 percent. Those shares have now nearly reversed. In the past decade, the share of jobs in\n\nSee William H. Frey, “Immigration is Driving the Nation’s Modest Post-Pandemic Population Growth, New\nCensus Data Shows,” The Brookings Institution, January 4, 2024 (https://www.brookings.edu/articles/immigrationis-driving-the-nations-modest-post-pandemic-population-growth-new-census-data-shows/).\n3\n\n\f6\nmanufacturing has fallen to under 13 percent and the share in “eds and meds” has risen to nearly 17\npercent.4\n\nRegions that have diversified their industrial base have generally fared better over time and have proven\nto be more resilient. But the types of shocks that hit the economy can have differential effects on regions\nbecause of differences in their industrial makeup. For example, the healthcare sector was particularly\nhard hit by the pandemic. The labor market in healthcare remains particularly tight, with nurses expected\nto remain in short supply for some time to come. But, even within healthcare, our contacts report that\nthey have seen some improvement in hiring and some normalization in wage growth.\n\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nIn my view, the most likely scenario for the overall economy and that of the region is that the current\nrestrictive stance of monetary policy will continue to help moderate growth and labor market conditions\nand that this moderation will contribute to the further easing of price pressures. So I expect progress on\ninflation over time, but at a slower pace than we saw last year. Analysis at the Cleveland Fed indicates\nthat the past slowdown in wage growth will pass through to lower price inflation in core services and that\nthe declines that have occurred in rents in new leases will pass through to slower inflation in housing\nservices. Both of these effects will be needed in order to get back to 2 percent inflation, but they will take\nsome time.\n\nSetting monetary policy in this environment will take careful consideration of the risks to both parts of\nour dual mandate as the economy evolves. Recent data showing solid growth and labor market indicators\n\n4\n\nOver the past decade (2014Q2 through 2024Q1), the share of jobs in manufacturing was 8.5 percent for the U.S.\nand 12.5 percent for Ohio. In the 1990s (1990Q1 through 1999Q4), the share of jobs in manufacturing was 14.8\npercent for the U.S. and 19.9 percent for Ohio.\n\n\f7\nsuggest that risks to the employment part of our mandate have diminished. But the recent inflation\nreadings suggest that risks to the inflation part of our mandate have risen.\n\nI am particularly attuned to the upside risks to inflation. Geopolitical tensions have the potential to\nfurther raise oil prices and other commodity prices, or to disrupt supply chains. The shortage of housing\ncould keep housing services inflation elevated even though rents have been falling. Medium- and longerterm inflation expectations are important determinants of actual inflation. These expectations have\nremained reasonably well-anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal throughout this\nhigh-inflation episode, and that anchoring has been an important contributor to the disinflation we have\nseen over time. Nonetheless, recent readings on short-term inflation expectations have moved up again.\nWere this increase to spread to longer-term expectations, it would be considerably harder to reach our\ninflation goal. So setting monetary policy to ensure that those expectations remain well-anchored will be\nvery important.\n\nThe FOMC’s job continues to be to assess the implications of economic and financial developments for\nthe outlook and risks around the outlook and, given that assessment, to calibrate monetary policy so that\ninflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy. The actual path\nmonetary policy takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves; this is the data dependence\npolicymakers often refer to. Our current monetary policy stance puts us in a good position for managing\nthe risks that could be realized. Moving rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence to\ngive us confidence that inflation is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent would risk undoing\nthe progress we have made on inflation. And with labor markets and economic growth both being very\nsolid, we do not need to take that risk.\n\nIncoming economic information indicates that it will take longer to gain that confidence; holding our\nrestrictive stance for longer is prudent at this point as we gain clarity about the path of inflation. Once the\n\n\f8\nFOMC gains confidence that inflation is moving sustainably back to 2 percent, it will be in a position to\nbegin to gradually normalize policy back to a neutral level as the economy returns to price stability and\nmaximum employment. While it is not my base case, should developments in inflation and inflation\nexpectations warrant it, policymakers will need to be open to tightening policy further. On the other\nhand, if the labor market unexpectedly deteriorates, policy could ease sooner and by more than currently\nanticipated. So monetary policy is well positioned for risk management as we gather more evidence on\nhow the economy is evolving.\n\nThe FOMC remains fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal because price stability is\ncritical for the long-run health of the labor market, the overall economy, and the stability of the financial\nsystem. As we have seen since the pandemic, high inflation can badly affect people’s lives and their view\nof the country’s economic well being. At a recent meeting of our Business Advisory Council, we\ndiscussed the fact that even though the labor market is strong and inflation is down from its peak, many\npeople are not very happy about the economy. Indeed, consumer sentiment and confidence indices are\nwell below their pre-pandemic levels. I believe dissatisfaction with the economy partly reflects the fact\nthat even though inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been relatively high for some\npeople, prices for many things are higher now than before the pandemic and many workers’ wages\nhaven’t kept up with inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price\nlevel is moving up faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higherthan-desired prices. As inflation has been moving down, wages adjusted for inflation, that is, real wages,\nhave begun to move up. As the disinflation process continues, it will help to close the gap between the\ncumulative increase in prices and the cumulative increase in wages, and people will then begin to feel\nthey have made up for lost ground.5\n\n5\n\nSince the first quarter of 2021, when inflation began to rise, PCE inflation has been running at an annualized pace\nof 4.7 percent. Workers’ compensation (as measured by the employment cost index for civilian workers’\ncompensation) has risen at an annualized rate of 4.5 percent. So there is still a gap, but that gap has been closing\nover time as inflation has moved down.\n\n\f9\n\nI believe another reason people are not happy with the economy is that it is much harder to purchase a\nhouse than it used to be. The median price of a home in the U.S. is now almost 50 percent higher than it\nwas prior to the pandemic.6 Thirty-year mortgage rates are now over 7 percent; prior to the pandemic\nthey were under 4 percent. A recent survey of consumers by the New York Fed found that renters believe\nthe probability of their ever owning a home has fallen to 40 percent, which is the lowest level since the\nquestion was first asked in 2015.7 Owning a house is an important avenue for building wealth but many\npeople feel this part of the American dream is out of reach, at least for now, and that isn't a good feeling.\n\nI am hopeful, though, that the economy will evolve as expected and as inflation returns to our target,\neconomic conditions continue to normalize, and labor markets remain healthy, more people will be able\nto enjoy the benefits of what a strong U.S. economy has to offer.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n6\n\nAccording to data from the National Association of Realtors, the median price of an existing single-family home\nwas $272,800 in February 2020 and was $397,200 in March 2024. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price\nindex, which is a repeat-sales index and so controls for the composition of single-family homes sold, is also up\nalmost 50 percent over its pre-pandemic level.\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations Housing Survey at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/housing%20.html#/.\n7\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNational Association for Business Economics, Cleveland Association for Business Economics,\nand Team NEO\nCleveland, OH\nApril 2, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a real pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. I thank the National\nAssociation for Business Economics, its Cleveland Chapter, Team NEO, David Altig, and Bill Koehler\nfor the opportunity to speak with you about the economy. Dave and I go back a long way – perhaps too\nlong for me to admit to. We worked together when we were both research directors, Dave at the Atlanta\nFed and me at the Philadelphia Fed. Dave is a first-rate economist, so I know he will keep me on my toes\nas he moderates this session.\n\nBefore we get into today’s question and answer portion, I thought it would be helpful to frame the\ndiscussion by offering a few brief remarks about the economy and monetary policy. I will start by\nreminding everyone that what I say today will be my views and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Developments\nSubstantial progress has been made on the inflation front since inflation peaked in 2022, in the range of 7\nto 9 percent, depending on the measure. But inflation is still above our 2 percent objective. PCE\ninflation is now running about 2-1/2 percent, whether it is measured year-over-year or over the past six\nmonths, annualized. And core PCE inflation is running about 2-3/4 percent, measured year-over-year,\nand near 3 percent, annualized, over the past six months. The monthly inflation readings in January and\nFebruary came in firmer than the readings over the second half of last year and are a good reminder of\nwhat we already knew: that the disinflation process will not be a smooth path back to 2 percent.\n\nIn my view, the inflation picture has not changed very much since the start of the year, because I had\nalready thought that the pace of disinflation would slow down this year. I continue to think that the most\nlikely scenario is that inflation will continue on its downward trajectory to 2 percent over time. But I\nneed to see more data to raise my confidence. Some further monthly readings will give us a better sense\n\n\f2\nof whether the disinflation process is stalling out or whether the start-of-the-year readings reflect a\ntemporary detour on the downward path back to price stability. I do not expect I will have enough\ninformation by the time of the FOMC’s next meeting to make that determination.\n\nA remarkable thing about the disinflation is that it has occurred in the midst of strong labor markets and\neconomic growth. While the broader tightening in financial conditions over time has led to some\nmoderation in the growth of output and employment, both have remained stronger than expected. That\nrelatively strong demand confronts a supply side of the economy that is healing. Supply chain disruptions\nand bottlenecks have improved over the past three years and the labor market is normalizing. People have\nreturned to the labor force over time, and immigration has also increased the supply of labor. With\nimbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets easing, inflation has\nbeen easing as well. Now that pressures on supply chains are approaching normal and the labor market is\ncoming into better balance, we are not likely to get as much help on inflation from the supply side as we\nsaw last year.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nI have revised up my projection of growth for the year based on the incoming economic information,\nincluding the official statistics and also the reports we receive from our directors and regional contacts,\nwhich are forward looking. In the most likely scenario, I still expect growth to moderate compared to last\nyear’s very rapid pace. But instead of the economy growing under trend this year, I now expect it will\ngrow a bit above my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. I expect the labor market to continue to come\ninto better balance this year, with a slight uptick in the unemployment rate from its current very low level.\nAnd I expect further progress on inflation but at a slower pace than we saw last year. If the economy\nevolves as expected, then in my view it will be appropriate for the FOMC to begin reducing the fed funds\nrate later this year, as inflation continues on its downward path toward 2 percent, and labor markets and\neconomic growth remain solid. These reductions should be viewed as a normalization of policy back to a\n\n\f3\nneutral level as the economy returns to price stability and maximum employment. But, of course, the\nactual path of policy will depend on how the economy actually evolves.\n\nMy forecast is similar to the median among the FOMC participants in the Summary of Economic\nProjections that were released after our March meeting,1 except that I see somewhat higher inflation this\nyear. In my projection, I have also raised my estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate to 3 percent\ncompared with 2.5 percent, which had been my estimate for some time. I raised my estimate to reflect the\ncontinued resilience in the economy despite high nominal interest rates and higher model-based estimates\nof the equilibrium interest rate, r-star.\n\nI have been discussing my view of the most likely scenario, but there are several risks to the forecast,\nincluding continued heightened geopolitical tensions, slow growth of the Chinese economy, potential\ndeterioration in conditions in commercial real estate markets, renewed stresses in financial markets, and,\non the upside, the possibility of stronger than expected productivity growth.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAt its meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to keep the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and reiterated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until\nthe Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\n\nWith inflation now moving closer to our goal, the risks to achieving both parts of our dual mandate have\nbecome more balanced. When we were tightening policy, we needed to focus on the inflation part of our\nmandate, because inflation was so high and the labor market was strong. Now, risk management with\nrespect to both parts of our mandate will need to be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going\n\n1\n\nSee Summary of Economic Projections, March 20, 2024.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20240320.pdf)\n\n\f4\nforward. If year-ahead inflation expectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the\nnominal fed funds rate for too long would effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would\npose an increasing risk to the maximum employment part of our mandate. On the other hand, moving\nrates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence to give us confidence that inflation is on a\nsustainable and timely path back to 2 percent would risk undoing the progress we have made on inflation.\nAt this point, I think the bigger risk would be to begin reducing the funds rate too early. And with labor\nmarkets and economic growth both being very solid, we do not need to take that risk.\n\nOur current monetary policy stance puts us in a good position for managing risks that could manifest\nthemselves on either side. If the labor market deteriorates, we can move rates down sooner and more\nquickly than in our baseline. Rather than view this as a normalization, the intention would be to return to\nan accommodative stance of monetary policy to support the economy. On the other hand, if inflation\nappears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we can hold our restrictive stance for longer than in the\nbaseline.\n\nIn contrast to where we are now, our policy was not well positioned when we started our tightening cycle\nbecause the policy rate was so low and inflation was moving up persistently. We needed to raise rates\nfairly aggressively. At this point, we are seeking to calibrate our policy well to economic developments\nso we can avoid having to act in an aggressive fashion. Indeed, if the economy evolves as I expect, I\nanticipate that we will be able to move rates down gradually as inflation and inflation expectations move\ndown, allowing us to continue to manage the risks to both sides of our mandate.\n\nBut let me reiterate: the actual path of policy will depend on how the economy actually evolves. The\nFOMC’s job continues to be to assess the implications of economic and financial developments for the\noutlook and risks around the outlook and, given that assessment, to calibrate monetary policy so that\ninflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy.\n\n\f5\n\nThis concludes my brief prepared remarks. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe European Economics and Financial Centre\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\nLondon, U.K.\n(via videoconference)\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a real pleasure to speak with the European Economics and Financial Centre once again. I especially\nlook forward to taking your questions because I learn a lot from hearing what is on your mind. Let me\nhelp frame our discussion by giving some brief remarks about the U.S. economy and monetary policy. Of\ncourse, these will be my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe economy and monetary policy have been on quite a journey since I last spoke to you two years ago.\nToday, I would say that both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place. Inflation is still\nabove our goal of 2 percent, but it has moved down a lot from its peak in 2022, when inflation hit a 40year high, in the range of 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure. Remarkably, this disinflation has\noccurred in the midst of strong labor markets and economic growth. The FOMC’s job now is to ensure\nthat the economy reaches an even better place by calibrating monetary policy so that inflation returns\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy.\n\nEconomic Developments\nOver the past four years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been the major forces shaping economic\ndevelopments and the major sources of uncertainty about the economy. Those forces have made it hard to\ntrack the economy because both supply and demand have been affected. Usually, it’s all about demand.\nBut the pandemic affected global supply chains, the supply of and demand for labor, and the mix of\nhousehold and business spending on housing, goods, and services.\n\nImbalances between supply and demand in both product and labor markets led to significant upward\npressure on prices, and inflation began to rise in April 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February\n2022, an ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and\nother commodities. In response to the high inflation, the FOMC began raising its policy rate, the federal\nfunds rate, in March 2022, and over the two years since, the Committee significantly tightened the stance\n\n\f2\nof monetary policy by raising the fed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. The Fed is also\nreducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the\nplan announced in May 2022. The tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in\nfinancial conditions over time, and, in response, aggregate demand has begun to moderate. The supply\nside of the economy is also healing. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have improved\nsignificantly, and firms have invested in diversifying their supply chains, making them more resilient to\ndisruptions. The labor market is normalizing. People have returned to the labor force over time, and the\nlabor force participation rate of people aged 25 to 54 is now slightly above its pre-pandemic level. With\nimbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets easing, inflation has\nbeen easing, too.\n\nI expect growth to moderate this year compared to its strong pace last year. Consumer spending has held\nup well, but in the wake of high prices, many families, especially those with lower incomes, are being\nmore cautious with their spending. There has been an uptick in credit card debt, suggesting that some\nhouseholds have exhausted their ready cash balances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have also edged\nup, although they are still at low levels. Businesses also slowed their spending on equipment and\nsoftware last year, and this spending is expected to continue to moderate given restrictive credit\nconditions. Tighter financial conditions have restrained investment in housing. Sales of existing homes\nare at low levels, but sales of new single-family homes were fairly resilient given the longer-term\nshortage of available housing. The shortfall in housing supply has kept home prices relatively high, but\nrents, especially for new tenants, have moved down and that should lead to the continued tempering of\ninflation in housing services.\n\nJob growth has been remarkably resilient. The unemployment rate has been 3.7 percent over the past\nthree months and it has been within range of its 50-year low for almost two years. I expect conditions in\nlabor markets to remain healthy but to moderate a bit. Our contacts tell us that, except for the healthcare\n\n\f3\nsector, it is easier to hire than it was a year ago and that they are getting more applicants per job opening.\nThe pace of job quits has also declined since peaking in 2022.\n\nBetter balance between the supply and demand for workers has meant wage growth has slowed. Firms in\nour District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down from 5 percent a year\nago, but still above pre-pandemic levels. Based on current estimates of trend productivity growth, wage\ngrowth is still a bit above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation. But it could be that trend\nproductivity growth has moved higher than what it was before the pandemic. Workers were scarce during\nthe pandemic, giving firms a great incentive to do more with fewer workers; many companies invested in\nautomation. New technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing productivity over the\nmedium to longer run. If so, then wages would be able to rise at a faster rate and still be consistent with\nprice stability.\n\nIt is interesting that despite the labor market’s strong performance, until recently, surveys of consumers\nindicated that most people were not very happy about the economy. I believe that partly reflects the fact\nthat even though inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been relatively high, prices for\nmany things are higher than they were before the pandemic and many people’s wages haven’t kept up\nwith inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is moving\nup faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higher-than-desired prices.\nWith inflation moving down, wages adjusted for inflation, that is, real wages, have begun to move up, and\nthis is helping to close the gap between the cumulative increase in prices and the cumulative increase in\nwages. This may be partly why consumers are feeling better about the economy now.\n\nInflation\nInflation moved down faster than expected last year even as the economy remained strong. Measured\nyear-over-year, as of January, total PCE inflation was 2.4 percent, core PCE inflation was 2.8 percent, and\nthe Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure was 3.5 percent.\n\n\f4\n\nBut the January inflation report shows that we need to be cautious in assuming that inflation will continue\nto fall at the same pace as last year. Restrictive monetary policy has played an important role in moving\ninflation down, but supply-side adjustments have also been important. Now that pressures on supply\nchains are approaching normal and the labor market is coming into better balance, I don’t think we should\ncount on as much help from the supply side as we saw last year.\n\nEven so, I do expect inflation to continue to move down over time to our 2 percent goal, even if it proves\nto be somewhat more persistent this year than last year. Anchored inflation expectations are an important\ncomponent of that forecast. Medium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably wellanchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. One-year-ahead inflation\nexpectations have also moved down over time but are still above their 2019 averages. Continued progress\non inflation will help ensure that these expectations move down to our goal. Progress depends on\nappropriate monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAt its meeting in January, the FOMC kept the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent,\nwhere it has been since last July. The Committee said that it does not expect it will be appropriate to\nreduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2\npercent. The Fed has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. When we began this\ntightening cycle, inflation was far above our goal and labor markets were strong. So it was clear we\nneeded to focus on the price stability part of our mandate. Now, with inflation moving closer to our goal,\nwe need to balance the risks to achieving both sides of our dual mandate when determining the\nappropriate stance of policy.\n\nRisk management will be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going forward. If year-ahead\ninflation expectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the nominal fed funds rate for\n\n\f5\ntoo long would effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would pose an increasing risk to the\nmaximum employment part of our mandate. But at this point, I think the bigger mistake would be to\nmove rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence that inflation is on a sustainable and\ntimely path back to 2 percent. Doing so would undermine all of the good work that has gone into getting\ninflation to this point. We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where we begin easing too soon,\nundo some of the progress we have made on inflation, potentially destabilize inflation expectations, and\nthen have to reverse course. And with labor markets and economic growth both being very solid, we\ndon’t need to take that risk.\n\nMy baseline forecast is that output and employment will moderate somewhat this year and inflation will\ncontinue to move closer to our 2 percent goal over time. I will gain confidence when I see inflation\ncontinuing to move down. The FOMC will then be in a position to start reducing the level of\nrestrictiveness by moving the fed funds rate down. If the economy performs as anticipated, I expect we\nwill find ourselves in that position sometime later this year. My base case is that when we do begin to\nmove rates down, we will do so at a gradual pace so that we can continue to manage the risks to both\nsides of our mandate.\n\nBut this all depends on the economy evolving as expected. And there are a number of risks around this\nforecast. Heightened geopolitical tensions pose potential implications for financial markets, oil prices,\nand global demand and supply. Easing financial conditions could spur a resurgence in activity, leading\nonce again to imbalances that fuel inflation. The stress generated by the bank failures last March has\nsubsided and many banks have diversified their sources of liquidity, making them less vulnerable. But\nstress could come again to banks that continue to rely on uninsured deposits for their funding while\nhaving sizable exposures to commercial real estate assets that will need to be repriced at higher interest\nrates. We also know that monetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial\nconditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature\nof the shocks that have hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment. So while labor\n\n\f6\nmarkets are currently strong and are expected to only gradually moderate, we need to remain attentive to\nthe possibility that conditions could deteriorate faster than expected. On the other hand, the strong output\nand employment growth could be an indication that the neutral rate of interest, which rose during the\npandemic, might remain high. This would mean policy might be less restrictive than we think it is and\nthat restrictive policy may be needed for longer than anticipated to achieve our goals of price stability and\nmaximum employment.\n\nThe good news is that monetary policy is in a good place from which to assess and respond to these risks\nto the outlook. Because of the current strength in labor market conditions and the strong spending data,\nwe have the luxury of keeping rates where they are as we gather more evidence that inflation truly is on a\nsustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. If downside risks materialize, we would have the\nopportunity to move rates down more quickly, just as we raised rates more aggressively than usual to\ncombat rising inflation. On the other hand, if inflation appears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we\nwould have the opportunity to maintain a restrictive stance for longer. Our policy actions will depend on\nhow the economy and the risks actually evolve. When our goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment are achieved, the economy will be in an even better place than it is today.\n\nOperating Framework\nLet me conclude with some remarks about the Fed’s balance sheet. At our meeting later this month, the\nFOMC will begin to discuss reducing the pace of the runoff in its balance-sheet assets. Since June 2022,\nthe Fed has been allowing maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to run off its\nbalance sheet at a fairly good clip according to the plan announced in May 2022. The Fed’s holdings of\nsecurities total about $7 trillion and have declined by about $1.4 trillion since the runoff began.\n\nWe are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating regime. In this regime, reserve\nlevels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is\nexecuted primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates: the interest rate paid on bank reserves,\n\n\f7\nthe interest rate offered on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs), and the primary credit\nrate on discount window loans. Under this framework, active management of the supply of reserves is\nnot needed.\n\nAs assets run off our balance sheet, Fed liabilities move down. So far, rather than a reduction in reserves,\nrunoff has resulted in a reduction in ON RRPs, with balances currently under $575 billion. In aggregate,\nreserve balances are about $3.5 trillion, which is about 15 percent of banking system assets. What\nconstitutes an ample level of reserves is uncertain. It depends on the banking sector’s demand for\nreserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. The\ncurrent level is more than ample, but as balance-sheet runoff continues and ON RRP volume reaches a\nminimum level, reserves will begin declining, too, and more redistribution of reserves will need to occur\nacross institutions. So at some point the FOMC will slow the pace of runoff and then stop the runoff\nwhen reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample. This will help\nensure that we can continue to reduce our balance sheet to its efficient size for effectively implementing\nmonetary policy. It will also help us move toward our longer-run goal of holding primarily Treasury\nsecurities, thereby minimizing the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. I note that the\nrunoff pace pertains to how we implement monetary policy and not to the stance of monetary policy. Our\nmain tool of monetary policy is the fed funds rate target, and balance-sheet runoff can continue even after\nwe begin to lower the funds rate.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Address\nColumbia University/Bank Policy Institute 2024 Bank Regulation Research Conference\nColumbia University\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Trish Mosser and the organizers at Columbia University and the Bank Policy Institute for inviting\nme to speak today. I received my undergraduate degree from Barnard College, and it is nice to be back\non campus. I appreciate that this conference brings together academic researchers, industry practitioners,\nand policymakers to discuss research pertinent to financial regulation. I am a firm believer that research\nshould inform policymaking. Academic research has greatly expanded our understanding of how\nsystemic risks can build up and propagate throughout the economy. It informed the regulatory reforms\nput in place after the global financial crisis, and it should continue to guide regulatory changes going\nforward. At the same time, we know that models cannot capture all aspects of the real-world financial\nsystem. Decisions have to be made in a world that doesn’t match our models and without all the\ninformation we would like to have. So the experience of practitioners, in addition to research, has to\ninform regulation and policy. There are many open issues regarding best practices and policies to\npromote financial resilience, and my hope is that academic researchers will continue to push the frontier\nforward. This conference provides an excellent forum to capture the synergies between research,\npractice, and policy.\n\nToday I will speak about financial system resilience, with a focus on the banking system. The views I\npresent will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Resilience in a Dynamic Economy\nIn less than two decades, the world has experienced two historically deep negative shocks to the global\neconomy and financial system. While their causes were different, the global financial crisis of 2008 and\nthe COVID-19 pandemic that hit in 2020 each necessitated the intervention of central banks in ways not\ncontemplated in earlier decades. Last spring, the Fed was required to intervene again to address stresses\nin the banking system precipitated by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.\n\n\f2\n\nThe global financial crisis followed a period of low interest rates in the first half of the 2000s. The\nstresses of last March occurred in an environment of high and rising interest rates. This is a reminder that\nregardless of the interest-rate environment, financial system vulnerabilities can help propagate adverse\nshocks across the financial system and sometimes very quickly. Indeed, both bankers and supervisors\nwere caught off guard by the speed with which deposits flowed out of Silicon Valley Bank. Over $40\nbillion of deposits left the bank on March 9, 2023, and another $100 billion was expected to leave the\nnext day, making the two-day total about 85 percent of the bank’s deposits. In comparison, when\nWachovia failed in 2008, the deposit outflow was lower and slower: about $10 billion flowed out over\neight days.\n\nThe failure of SVB was a classic situation but in a new environment. An underlying factor in SVB’s\nfailure was the bank’s poor management of interest-rate risk, one of the traditional risks we look to banks\nto manage. But the poor management was revealed as the Fed raised interest rates more aggressively than\nusual in response to very high inflation: in the year before the bank failed, the Fed had raised its policy\nrate by 450 basis points. Similarly, SVB suffered a classic bank run, but instead of people lining up at the\nbank to withdraw deposits, the run was aided and abetted by social media that quickly spread news about\nthe bank and by depositors’ ability to move money electronically and very quickly.\n\nAn important lesson is that bankers’ risk management and supervisors’ risk monitoring need to be much\nmore dynamic than they used to be because the economic and financial environment has become more\ndynamic. The demarcation between illiquidity and insolvency is fluid. A temporary liquidity problem at\none institution, if not addressed in a timely manner, can morph into a solvency problem that can spread to\nother institutions and become amplified throughout the system. And this can happen more rapidly than in\nthe past given the rise in interconnectedness and changes in technology. In other words, “timely manner”\nis quicker than it used to be. Bank supervisors need to monitor not only risks that are developing at\n\n\f3\nindividual institutions but also risks that are seen across similar types of institutions throughout the\nsystem; supervisors need to emphasize both micro- and macro supervision.\n\nWhile risk management was at the heart of the bank failures of last year, weaknesses in supervision were\nalso revealed.1 As the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision noted in recent remarks at the Columbia Law\nSchool, the Federal Reserve is taking steps to improve the speed, force, and agility of its supervision so\nthat supervisors take action as risks build up and pay greater attention to changes in the environment that\ncreate new risks.2\n\nRisk management and monitoring are part of a financial resilience framework aimed at ensuring that\nindividual financial institutions are able to withstand the inevitable economic and financial shocks that hit\nover time and that the entire financial system is resilient. Better resilience means less chance of fire sales\nof assets, runs on financial firms, shortages of liquid assets, or contraction of credit in the face of\nunknown counterparty risk. Better resilience will mean banks can continue to offer their important credit,\nliquidity, and payment services to creditworthy businesses and households during economic downturns\nand financial markets can continue intermediating in an orderly fashion during periods of stress.\n\nA resilient financial system also limits the times during which monetary policy and financial stability\ngoals come into conflict, so that monetary policy is not disrupted by financial system stress and can\ncontinue to transmit to the broader economy. Last March, financial stability tools were used to address\nstresses in the banking system. This allowed the Fed to continue to use its monetary policy tools for\n\nSee Michael S. Barr, “Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank,” April\n28, 2023 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf).\n1\n\nFor further discussion, see Michael S. Barr, “Supervision with Speed, Force, and Agility,” remarks at the Annual\nColumbia Law School Banking Conference, New York, NY, February 16, 2024\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/barr20240216a.pdf), and Michael S. Barr, “Supervision\nand Regulation,” testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate,\nWashington, D.C., November 14, 2023 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/barr20231113a.htm).\n2\n\n\f4\nmacroeconomic purposes, and we proceeded with an increase in the federal funds rate at our March 2023\nmeeting. But those financial stability tools involved regulators invoking the systemic risk exception and\nimplementing a new lending facility.3\n\nA more resilient financial system would diminish the need for the Fed and other regulators to have to step\nin, whether it be to reduce market dysfunction by buying Treasury assets, as we had to do in October\n2019 and March 2020, or having to set up special facilities to serve as the lender of last resort, actions that\nhave the potential to change the Fed into the lender of first resort.\n\nThe question is: how do we design a framework that promotes financial resilience in a dynamic economy?\nI believe that three principles from monetary policy can provide a useful starting point: (1) setting a wellarticulated and achievable goal for financial resilience, (2) being more systematic and less discretionary\nas we apply the tools of supervision and regulation, and (3) being more transparent so that market\ndiscipline can work in tandem with regulation and supervision. Let me turn to each of these.\n\nFinancial Resilience Goal\nI would like to see the U.S. articulate a goal for financial resilience. Markus Brunnermeier, a professor at\nPrinceton University, defines resilience as the ability to recover from a shock, like a reed that is able to\nwithstand strong winds by bending without breaking.4 He makes a distinction between risk management,\nwhich is concerned with how to manage potential shocks of different magnitudes and frequencies, and\nresilience management, which is concerned with how to adapt and recover once a shock hits. I think this\n\n3\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) on March 12, 2023\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm). The BTFP will cease making\nnew loans on March 11, 2024 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240124a.htm).\n4\n\nSee Markus K. Brunnermeier, The Resilient Society, Colorado Springs, CO: Endeavor Literary Press, 2021\n(https://markus.scholar.princeton.edu/news/resilient-society), and Markus K. Brunnermeier, “Macrofinance and\nResilience: 2024 American Finance Association Presidential Address,” San Antonio, TX, January 6, 2024\n(https://afajof.org/2024-annual-meeting-and-panel-sessions/).\n\n\f5\nis a useful distinction, and it reminds me of the evolution in the approach taken to address cybersecurity\nrisks. In the past, efforts focused squarely on building up the defenses around IT systems to prevent an\nattack. But as systems have become more complex and the avenues of attack have multiplied, efforts now\npay equal attention to resilience. Improving cybersecurity is now viewed as a battle on two fronts. You\nmust take actions to minimize the chances that your IT systems will be infiltrated but recognize that\nregardless of your strong defenses, some attackers will infiltrate; so, design your systems so that it is\nharder for the incursion to spread and so that you can resume operations quickly. Analogously, the\nregulatory reforms instituted after the global financial crisis were framed in terms of financial “stability.”\nNow, the discussion is framed in terms of “resilience.”\n\nIn the case of the financial system, a resilience goal has to recognize that banks are able to provide their\nvaluable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services because they are designed to take on risk and\nleverage. The goal of regulation and supervision cannot be to eliminate all volatility in markets or\nprevent all bank failures, since this would negate banking’s benefits to the economy, which come through\ntaking and managing risk. Instead, the goal should be to limit tail and systemic risks so that the financial\nsystem absorbs shocks rather than amplifies them, and so that the system can recover quickly and\ncontinue to provide its services across the business and financial cycles. Regulation and supervision can\ncontribute to financial system resilience, first, by lowering the probability that a shock will become\nsystemic, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the\nfinancial system.\n\nAppropriately calibrating regulation and supervision involves recognizing a tradeoff: tight regulation will\nlimit bank failures, but it will also limit risk-taking and innovation, raise the cost of intermediation, and\nput regulated institutions at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated firms, all of which\ncould undermine the banking system’s ability to serve its customers and support longer-run economic\ngrowth. Loose regulation will lead to a higher probability of multiple failures and/or more costly\n\n\f6\nsystemic events. This adversely affects economic growth in both the short and the longer run; research\nindicates that financial crises tend to make recessions worse and lead to permanent losses of output.5 It is\nalso important to recognize that the nature of the tradeoff is affected by the degree of resilience.\nIncreasing resilience will allow for more risk-taking and innovation ex ante because the financial system\nwill be able to recover from the shock with less cost to the real economy.\n\nTailoring regulation and supervision to risk\nThe reforms in regulation and supervision since the global financial crisis have increased the resilience of\nthe U.S. financial system. But the financial system is dynamic, and the nature of the shocks can change\nover time. So, continued focus on building resilience is warranted. To get the balance right between\nregulation and innovation, capital and liquidity requirements need to be tailored to the risks a banking\norganization poses to the financial system. Research and practice suggest these risks are likely to vary\naccording to the bank’s size, range of activities and funding sources, domestic and global\ninterconnectedness, complexity, and the extent to which there is a lack of readily available substitutes for\nthe services provided by the institution. Note that a matrix of factors determines riskiness, not a single\ncharacteristic. Tailoring helps to ensure that supervisory resources and attention are allocated efficiently.\nBut because the financial system and economic environment are dynamic, periodic reviews of the\ntailoring and calibration of regulatory requirements should be undertaken to ensure that the regulatory and\nsupervisory framework still delivers the same level of resilience as new products, business models, and\npotential sources of risk are introduced.\n\nSee, e.g., Valerie Cerra and Sweta C. Saxena, “The Economic Scars of Crises and Recessions,” IMF Blog, March\n21, 2018 (https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2018/03/21/the-economic-scars-of-crises-and-recessions). Markus\nBrunnermeier points out that real GDP has not returned to its trend line since the great financial crisis. See Markus\nBrunnermeier, “Macrofinance and Resilience: 2024 American Finance Association Presidential Address,” San\nAntonio, TX, January 6, 2024 (https://afajof.org/2024-annual-meeting-and-panel-sessions/).\n5\n\n\f7\nBank capital\nIn my view, at the larger banks, current minimum capital standards are still below the level where an\nincrease would be counterproductive in terms of thwarting productive risk-taking, beneficial innovation,\nor economic growth. Bank capital forms the solid foundation for bank lending. Empirical research finds\nthat well-capitalized banks tend to lend more than poorly capitalized ones, to grow their loan and deposit\nmarket shares during crises by purchasing assets from less well-capitalized banks,6 and to have more\naccess to market funding during downturns than do less capitalized banks.7 High leverage has been\nshown to be a major contributor to the severity of financial crises, while a well-capitalized banking\nsystem – reflecting both the amount and the quality of the capital – is less likely to amplify negative\nmacroeconomic shocks and is more resilient. I view the Basel III endgame capital proposal as a\nrecalibration aligned with this view.8\n\nLiquidity\nWhile much of regulation and supervision has focused on credit risk, last year’s bank stresses shined a\nbright light on the importance of managing liquidity and interest-rate risks. Providing banks with\nincentives to choose less risky funding sources, such as tightening the liquidity coverage ratio\nrequirement so that banks have to hold higher levels of liquid assets to cover potential cash outflows,\nwould reduce the probability of a run. We have also learned that even if there is considerable liquidity in\nthe system, impediments that limit the system’s ability to effectively redistribute liquidity to banks that\nneed it can raise systemic risk. The Federal Reserve System serves as lender of last resort by lending\nagainst good collateral to healthy banks facing temporary liquidity problems, but last year’s bank failures\n\nAllen N.

This undermines the\ndiscount window’s ability to limit bank runs and promote resilience. Instead of the discount window,\nbanks have relied on the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) as a reliable source of funding. That is\npartly because FHLB advances offer some advantages to banks over discount window loans: advances\ncan be longer term; they are cheaper, especially in periods of stress; FHLBs typically give higher lendable\nvalue against collateral; and advances are not disclosed, whereas discount window loans are, with a twoyear lag. Yet as we saw, FHLB funding was not reliable during the stresses seen last March.\n\nProposed changes to the FHLBs, if enacted, will place some limits on banks’ ability to borrow, especially\nthose banks in a weakened state.9 This likely will increase banks’ demand for alternative funding sources,\nperhaps making them rely more on uninsured deposits, thereby increasing the potential for bank runs in\nresponse to a shock. This increases the need for banks to be prepared to use the discount window as a\nsource of contingency funding.\n\nCurrently, the Reserve Banks are encouraging eligible financial institutions to ensure that they have the\nlegal agreements and collateral in place and have tested their ability to use the discount window in a\ntimely way should the need arise. Testing at this time is not mandatory, but I support requiring such\ntesting as part of sound liquidity management. It is also worth considering requiring banks to pre-position\ncollateral at the window in proportion to their short-term runnable funding, including uninsured deposits,\nso they would be ready to borrow at the discount window should that funding start to run.10 This\nrequirement would be consistent with a tiered approach to regulation, since banks that are less reliant on\nrunnable funds and that therefore pose fewer risks, a category that includes many smaller banks, would be\n\nSee Federal Housing Finance Agency, “The FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future,” November 2023\n(https://www.fhfa.gov/PolicyProgramsResearch/Programs/Pages/FHLBank-Focusing-on-the-Future.aspx).\n9\n\nThe G30 makes such a recommendation. See the G30’s Working Group on the 2023 Banking Crisis, “Bank\nFailures and Contagion: Lender of Last Resort, Liquidity, and Risk Management,” January 2024\n(https://group30.org/images/uploads/publications/G30_Lessons-23-Crisis_RPT_Final.pdf).\n10\n\n\f9\nrequired to post less collateral. And it would provide some incentive for those banks that find the\nconstraint binding to adjust to a lower-risk funding structure.\n\nSystematic Financial Resilience Policy\nI am a proponent of systematic monetary policy, and I would like us to apply our regulatory and\nsupervisory tools in a more systematic manner, too. The benefit of taking a systematic approach to\nmonetary policy is well established. It allows the public to better understand the rationale for the Fed’s\npolicy decisions so that their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This\nalignment helps households, firms, and financial market participants make better financial and\nemployment decisions, thereby making monetary policy more effective.\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which\npolicymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. That is, being\nsystematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems. Incentives – those of both financial\ninstitutions and regulators – take a central role in the financial system so time-inconsistency and moral\nhazard problems loom large. This makes it even more important to be systematic in the application of\nregulatory policy and supervisory actions.\n\nIn times of financial stress, regulators find themselves with a time-inconsistency problem. Forcing one\nbank to take actions to raise capital or address other risk-management concerns during a period of stress\ncould precipitate a widespread reevaluation of the banking industry by investors and depositors resulting\nin a systemic event. In such cases, regulators and supervisors might lean toward interventions and\nforbearance even if this creates bad incentives for financial institutions to manage risks in the future.\nTime-inconsistency problems mean regulators face a tradeoff between what is better in the short run and\nwhat is better over the long run. Adherence to a systematic approach can serve as a commitment device\nfor regulators to focus on long-run goals. This would help to limit moral hazard so that banks themselves\n\n\f10\ninternalize more of the risks they are taking and self-insure against losses rather than expect government\nsupport. Of course, if the shock were large enough, policymakers would need to step in, but there would\nlikely be fewer situations in which the government would need to offer such support. But getting to this\npoint requires having the right tools in order to align regulatory incentives and reduce the timeinconsistency problem.\n\nThe stresses in the banking system last March underscored the challenge of ensuring that financial\ninstitutions can rebuild their capital when their assets decline in value. SVB’s attempt to raise capital\nafter selling assets at a loss raised concerns about the bank’s health among depositors and precipitated the\nrun. Cyclical macroprudential tools aim to solve this problem by having banks build up capital in good\ntimes that can be used in bad times. In the U.S., these tools are basically limited to the countercyclical\ncapital buffer (CCyB) and the stress test.\n\nCountercyclical capital buffer\nThe CCyB is intended to require banks to hold more capital during periods of high credit growth, which\noften coincides with the accumulation of system-wide risk. However, the lead times needed to use this\ntool limit its effectiveness in addressing vulnerabilities that may develop rapidly or that can be detected\nonly after they are far along. This suggests the need to raise the buffer in good times before we see the\nvulnerabilities, yet we have never raised the CCyB above zero in the U.S. The CCyB would be more\neffective and time consistent if it were recalibrated to be a positive level in normal times, and then raised\nwhen credit growth moves up and lowered when credit growth moves down based on a systematic rule\nthat is agreed to in advance of stress.\n\nStress tests\nSimilarly, the current stress tests should be redesigned with an eye to making them a more effective\ncountercyclical capital tool so that banks have to build up their capital buffers when they are better able to\n\n\f11\ndo so. In addition, an expanded set of risks should be incorporated into the scenarios. For example,\ntypically, the stress tests focus on recession scenarios, in which interest rates are assumed to decline.\nIncorporating rising-interest-rate scenarios into the stress tests would be prudent. To augment the stress\ntests, the Fed is now doing exploratory analysis of the effects that different economic and financial\nconditions have on the banking system, including scenarios with high inflation and rising interest rates.11\n\nResolution mechanism\nBut the most effective way to limit moral hazard problems and the time-inconsistency problem regulators\nface with an insolvent bank is to create an effective, credible, and time-consistent bank resolution\nmechanism that can be applied systematically when a bank fails. If regulators were able to confidently\nresolve large financial institutions in a way that limits spillovers and avoids causing system-wide\ninstability, they would be in a much better position when the inevitable shock hits the financial system.12\nSuch a mechanism would also provide bankers with the incentive to better manage their risks. However,\nwhile certain steps have been taken, such a credible resolution mechanism remains elusive even as it\nbecomes more important given the speed with which banks can run into problems.\n\nTransparency\nLet me finish with a few comments about transparency, another tenet of sound monetary policymaking\nthat I believe should be brought into the realm of financial system regulation and supervision. The\nfinancial system is complex, with various types of institutions and multiple regulators. In addition,\nregulators are likely to have more private information on which to base their policy decisions, making it\n\nSee Federal Reserve System, “Exploratory Analysis of Risks to the Banking System: Summary of Analysis\nParameters,” February 2024 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/exploratory-analysis-of-risks-to-thebanking-system-20240215.pdf)\n11\n\n12\n\nIn August 2023, the federal banking regulators requested comments on a proposed rule to require large banks with\ntotal assets of $100 billion or more to maintain a minimum level of long-term debt that could be used to absorb\nlosses were the bank to fail. See the announcement of the request for comment on the long-term debt proposal and\naccompanying materials at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230829a.htm.\n\n\f12\nmore difficult for the public and elected officials to assess whether the decisions are appropriate ones.\nThere has been a long-standing view that supervisory information should be kept private so as not to be a\nsource of instability, but greater transparency and more disclosure by both banks and regulators would\nprovide better incentives for risk management and would allow for more market discipline. We have seen\nmore transparency around the stress tests and that has been a positive development.\n\nMuch of bank regulation is tied to book values instead of market values. Moving toward market-value\naccounting for more of a bank’s balance sheet, basing more of bank regulation on market values, and\ndisclosing more market-value information about a bank’s balance sheet would help align regulation and\nsupervision with market discipline.13 While banks have to account for securities held in their trading\nbooks at market values, the current accounting rules allow some banks to classify securities held on their\nown books as hold-to-maturity assets and account for them according to their book value instead of their\nmarket value. In the current environment, many longer-term securities were purchased when interest\nrates were low, but when rates rose, the market value of these assets fell. Thus, many banks have\nunrealized losses on their balance sheets. This is not a problem if the bank can, indeed, hold these assets\nuntil maturity. But if a bank needs to sell the assets, it will have to realize the loss and take the hit to\ncapital. This is the position SVB found itself in.\n\nEven if accounting regulations are not changed, having supervisors pay more attention to market values\nwould likely spur earlier actions on their part to ensure sound risk management at banks and would help\nfocus supervisory attention on areas of highest vulnerability.14 Requiring banks to be transparent with\n\n13\n\nEdward L. Golding and Deborah J. Lucas have recommended that medium-size and large banks disclose\ninformation on the duration gap between their assets and liabilities. See Edward L. Golding and Deborah J. Lucas,\n“Duration Gap Disclosure: A Modest Proposal to Prevent Another SVB,” Shadow Open Market Committee,\nOctober 20, 2023 (https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/somc/Lucas-Golding-SOMC2023.pdf).\n14\n\nHow best to move to market-value accounting is not straightforward because of the difficulty of accounting for\nthe market value of deposits. See, e.g., Philip Bond, Itay Goldstein, and Edward Simpson Prescott, “Market-Based\nCorrective Actions,” The Review of Financial Studies 23, 2010, pp. 781–820 (https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhp059).\n\n\f13\ntheir supervisors about the underlying assumptions in their risk-management models would also increase\nsupervisors’ ability to better evaluate risk management at the bank. SVB assumed interest rates would be\nfalling; instead they rose, which increased the risk of SVB’s position. In addition, banks and supervisors\nshould incorporate more scenario analysis into their risk management and monitoring. Looking at various\nstress scenarios involving relevant risks can make banks and supervisors better prepared for what could\nhappen even if it is not viewed as the most likely situation at the time. And the more uncertain the\nenvironment, the wider the set of possible scenarios that should be examined.\n\nI have been speaking about the banking system today, but we also need to take steps to increase the\nstructural resilience of nonbank financial firms and markets. To do that, regulators need increased\nvisibility into the nonbank financial sector. Not having the data needed to adequately measure the risks\nand vulnerabilities in a particular segment of the financial system should not lure us into thinking that the\nvulnerabilities are small or do not exist. Better risk monitoring will require more disclosure in many\nsegments, including data on the assets backing many stablecoins, central counterparties’ member\nconcentrations, principal trading firms, and nonbank funders.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, a resilient financial system plays an important role in ensuring a strong economy. After the\nglobal financial crisis, steps were taken to shore up the resilience of the banking system. Systemically\nimportant banking institutions have higher capital and liquidity buffers and better risk-management\nsystems than they did. The sound banking system was able to lend important support to households and\nbusinesses throughout the pandemic. But the financial system is dynamic, with new products, business\nmodels, and technologies being introduced, and the economic environment can change rapidly. Last\nyear’s bank stress underscores the importance of not becoming complacent. We need to look holistically\nat the regulations, our methods of supervision, and our lender of last resort function to address the\nvulnerabilities that were revealed. This holistic approach should consider the interactions among various\n\n\f14\nregulations, leaning toward simplification when possible. Recalibration should be informed by careful\ncost-benefit analyses. Identifying and addressing weaknesses will improve the underlying resilience of\nthe financial system, so that we can continue to rely on it to provide its important services across the\nbusiness and financial cycles and limit the need for government interventions.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nOhio Bankers League\nEconomic Summit\nColumbus, OH\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Michael Adelman, CEO of the Ohio Bankers League, for the opportunity to speak at this year’s\nEconomic Summit. Of course, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe last time I spoke at an OBL event was in September 2021. At that time, a strong economic recovery\nwas underway, but it was an uneven one and there were still many challenges and risks, including the\nDelta variant of the coronavirus, which was emerging. People were starting to return to the workforce but\nonly slowly. The number of payroll jobs and the labor force participation rate were still well below where\nthey were prior to the pandemic, and the unemployment rate, while down from its peak of nearly 15\npercent early in the pandemic, was still near 5 percent. Inflation had moved up to over 4 percent. It was\nexpected to rise further and remain elevated until supply constraints and pent-up demand eased, which\nwould take some time. Monetary policy had not yet begun to tighten.\n\nThe economy and monetary policy have certainly been on quite a journey since then. Characterizing both\ntoday, I would say that the economy and monetary policy are in a good place. Inflation is still above our\ngoal of 2 percent, but it has moved down considerably from its high level in 2022 and labor markets and\neconomic growth remain strong. The FOMC’s job now is to ensure that the economy reaches an even\nbetter place by calibrating monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate goals of price stability and\nmaximum employment. In order to do that calibration, we will need to continue to monitor and assess\nincoming economic and financial information and its implications not only for the baseline forecast but\nalso for the risks around that forecast. Risk management will take center stage.\n\nBankers have played an important role in determining where the economy is today and where it is going.\nBy providing valuable credit, risk-management, liquidity, and payments services to your customers, you\nsupport a strong economy. Ohio bankers supported families, businesses, and communities throughout the\n\n\f2\npandemic, and they continue to do so, even as the industry faces its own challenges. I want to thank you\nfor managing through the balance-sheet impacts of the sharp rise in interest rates over the past two years\nand the liquidity stresses that manifested themselves last March. Just as the Fed will be carefully\nmanaging risks in determining its appropriate policy stance, banks will need to do so as well, so that they\ncan continue to contribute to a strong economy.\n\nI also want to thank the bankers in Ohio and throughout the Fourth District for the timely information and\ninsights on the economy and banking conditions that they have provided to me in my role as a Federal\nReserve policymaker. Several of the Cleveland Fed’s current and former directors and members of our\nCommunity Depository Institutions Advisory Council are here today, and they can attest to the rich set of\ninsights provided by our bankers. This information plays a crucial role in helping us better understand\nwhat is really happening on the ground in real time and what could be coming.\n\nSo let me now turn to my assessment of the where the economy and monetary policy are and where they\nare likely going.\n\nEconomic Developments\nOver the past four years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been the major forces shaping economic\ndevelopments and the major sources of uncertainty about the economy. When the pandemic hit, the\neconomy shut down in March 2020, and fiscal and monetary policymakers took aggressive actions to\nsupport households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow and limiting lasting damage to\nthe economy. The economy began to reopen in May 2020 when public health statistics began to improve.\nBut it wasn’t business as usual. The pandemic had affected global supply chains, the supply of and\ndemand for labor, and the composition of household and business spending on housing, goods, and\nservices. Imbalances between supply and demand in both product and labor markets led to significant\nupward pressure on prices, and inflation began to rise in April 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in\n\n\f3\nFebruary 2022, an ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil,\nfood, and other commodities. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to\n9 percent, depending on the measure. In response, the FOMC began raising its policy rate, the federal\nfunds rate, in March 2022, and over the two years since, the Committee has significantly tightened the\nstance of monetary policy by raising the fed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. The Fed\nis also reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to\nthe plan announced in May 2022.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions over time and, in\nresponse, aggregate demand has begun to moderate. In addition, the supply side of the economy has been\nhealing. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have improved significantly, and firms have invested\nin diversifying their supply chains, making them more resilient to disruptions. Growing tensions in the\nMiddle East might undermine supply-chain improvements, but our business contacts tell us that so far\nthere has been minimal effect on their operations and that they expect the increase in shipping costs\nthrough the Red Sea to be temporary, but this is a risk worth watching.\n\nThe pandemic had profound effects on the labor market, but the labor market is normalizing. People have\nreturned to the labor force over time, and the labor force participation rate of people aged 25 to 54 is now\nslightly above its pre-pandemic level.\n\nOver time, the imbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets, which\nhelped fuel high inflation, have lessened, and inflation has moved down. This disinflation has happened\neven as the economy has remained very resilient, with both economic growth and the labor market\noutperforming relative to expectations. As you’ll recall, many CEOs and economists thought that growth\nlast year would be below trend. But the economy didn’t agree. Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter\nstepped down from its very strong pace in the third quarter, but it was still a solid 3-1/4 percent annual\n\n\f4\nrate. Growth last year is estimated to have been a bit over 3 percent, above my 2 percent estimate of trend\ngrowth. The change in firms’ inventories was expected to subtract from growth last quarter, but instead\nmade a slight positive contribution. Growth in final sales, which excludes the change in inventories, was\nquite strong.\n\nConsumer spending makes up about 70 percent of GDP. Strong income growth and healthy balance\nsheets have continued to support household spending, and the savings rate has moved below its prepandemic level, reflecting strong spending. It is interesting that despite the economy’s strong\nperformance, including strong consumer spending, until recently surveys of consumers indicated that\nmost people were not very happy about the economy. I believe that partly reflects the fact that even\nthough inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been high, many people’s wages haven’t\nkept up with inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is\nmoving up faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higher-thandesired prices. With inflation moving down, wages adjusted for inflation have begun to move up, and\nthis is helping to close the gap between the cumulative increase in inflation and the cumulative increase in\nwages.1 This may be partly why consumers are feeling better about the economy.\n\nI expect household spending to moderate somewhat this year. In the wake of high prices, many families,\nespecially those with lower incomes, have spent the savings accumulated during the pandemic. There has\nbeen an uptick in credit card debt, suggesting that some households have exhausted their ready cash\nbalances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have also edged up, although they are still at low levels.\n\n1\n\nSince the first quarter of 2021, when inflation began to rise, PCE inflation has been running at an annualized pace\nof 4.8 percent. Workers’ compensation (as measured by the employment cost index for civilian workers’\ncompensation) has risen at an annualized rate of 4.5 percent. So there is still a gap, but that gap has been closing\nover time as inflation has moved down.\n\n\f5\nTighter financial conditions have restrained investment in housing and business spending. Businesses\nslowed their spending on equipment and software last year, and it is expected to continue to moderate\ngiven restrictive credit conditions. The regional manufacturing surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks\nand the national ISM survey indicate weaker manufacturing activity. Fourth District manufacturers tell us\nthat their order backlogs are diminishing. In the housing market, residential investment declined in 2022\nand was flat last year. Sales of existing homes are at low levels, but sales of new single-family homes\nwere fairly resilient given the longer-term shortage of available housing. The shortfall in housing supply\nhas kept home prices relatively high, but rents, especially for new tenants, have moved down and that\nshould lead to continued tempering of inflation in housing services.\n\nLast Friday’s labor market report for January shows that the labor market has been remarkably resilient.\nPayroll job growth rose by about 350 thousand jobs in January. Even if some of that reflects seasonal\nadjustment issues, it was an unexpectedly strong reading, and the job numbers for October, November,\nand December were revised up. The unemployment rate has been 3.7 percent over the past three months,\nnear a 50-year low. This is very strong performance. Other indicators point to some moderation in the\nlabor market. Our contacts tell us that, except for the healthcare sector, it is easier to hire than it was a\nyear ago and that they are getting more applicants per job opening. The pace of job quits has also\ndeclined since peaking in 2022. Now, workers are quitting jobs at about the same pace as before the\npandemic and the number of job openings has been declining. There are now about 1.5 openings per\nunemployed worker. This is above the level we saw in 2019, another period of strong labor market\nconditions, but it has come down a lot since March 2022 when we began to tighten monetary policy.2\nAnd on the supply side, as I mentioned, the labor force participation rate for workers aged 25 to 54 has\nnormalized.\n\n2\n\nIn 2019, the ratio of openings per unemployed workers averaged 1.2 percent; in March 2022 it was 2.0.\n\n\f6\nAs the demand for and the supply of workers have started to come into better balance, wage growth has\nmoderated. Firms in our District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down\nfrom 5 percent a year ago, but still above pre-pandemic levels. The employment cost index rose at an\nannualized rate of 3-1/2 percent over the last three months of 2023, down from about 4-3/4 percent in the\nfirst quarter of last year. And the gap between the wages of job switchers and job stayers in the Atlanta\nFed’s Wage Growth Tracker narrowed last year to about its average over 2015 to 2019, another sign that\nthe labor market is coming into better balance.3\n\nCurrent estimates of trend productivity growth suggest that the current level of wage growth is still a bit\nabove the level consistent with 2 percent inflation. But the strong recent readings on productivity raise\nthe possibility that trend productivity growth has moved higher than it was before the pandemic. The\nscarcity of workers during the pandemic gave firms a great incentive to do more with fewer workers and\nmany invested in automation. New technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing\nproductivity over the medium to longer run. If so, then wages would be able to rise at a faster rate and\nstill be consistent with price stability. At this point, though, I suspect we will see further moderation of\nwage growth, with a gradual slowing in job growth and an uptick in the unemployment rate over the year\nfrom its very low level.\n\nInflation\nWhile inflation is still above the Fed’s goal of 2 percent, the news on inflation is encouraging. Inflation\nmoved down faster than expected last year even as the economy remained strong. Measured year-overyear, as of December, total PCE inflation is 2.6 percent and core PCE inflation is 2.9 percent. Over the\npast six months, the levels are even lower. Other measures of inflation, including the median and\n\n3\n\nThe gap between the 12-month moving average wage growth of job switchers and job stayers in the Atlanta Fed’s\nWage Growth Tracker was 2.2 percentage points at the start of last year and 0.9 percentage point by the end of last\nyear. These data are available at https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.\n\n\f7\ntrimmed-mean measures, have also moved down from their peaks. Retailers in the Fourth District say\nthat consumers are more price-sensitive than they have been. Many of our contacts across sectors have\nnoted that after making frequent price adjustments over the past two years, they have reverted to their\nusual pre-pandemic practice of setting prices once a year, a sign of easing price pressures.\n\nThe largest declines in inflation have come in goods prices. In fact, core goods prices have been\ndeclining, as they were before the pandemic. Inflation in housing services, measured by rents and the\nimputed rents for owner-occupied housing, and inflation in core services excluding housing, which makes\nup about half of the consumption basket, have eased less but have improved over time.\n\nThere are reasons to be cautious in assuming that last year’s rapid pace of disinflation will be maintained\nas inflation gets closer to the 2 percent goal. While restrictive monetary policy has played an important\nrole in moving inflation down, supply-side adjustments were also important. Now that pressures on\nsupply chains are approaching normal and the labor market is coming into better balance, we should not\ncount on as much help from the supply side as we saw last year.\n\nWhile inflation may prove to be more persistent this year, my baseline forecast is that under appropriate\nmonetary policy, inflation will continue to move down over time to our 2 percent goal. Anchored\ninflation expectations are an important component of that forecast. Medium- and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent\ninflation. One-year-ahead inflation expectations from the University of Michigan and New York Fed\nsurveys have also moved down, although they are still about a quarter to a half percentage point,\nrespectively, above their 2019 averages. Continued progress on inflation will help ensure that these\nexpectations move down to our goal. And that progress depends on appropriate monetary policy.\n\n\f8\nMonetary Policy\nAt its meeting last week, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and to continue running off the Fed’s securities holdings. The FOMC judges that the risks\nto achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance, but it remains highly\nattentive to inflation risks. The FOMC does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range\nuntil it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. When we\nbegan this tightening cycle, inflation was far above our goal and labor markets were strong. So it was\nclear we needed to focus on the price stability part of our mandate. Now, with inflation moving closer to\nour goal, we need to balance the risks to achieving both sides of our dual mandate when determining the\nappropriate stance of policy.\n\nIt would be a mistake to move rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence that\ninflation was on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. Doing so would undermine all of the\ngood work that has gone into getting inflation to this point. On the other hand, if year-ahead inflation\nexpectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the nominal fed funds rate for too long\nwould effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would pose an increasing risk to the\nmaximum employment part of our mandate.\n\nRisk management will be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going forward. Our job is to\ncalibrate monetary policy to the evolving outlook and risks around the outlook so that inflation returns\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy. My baseline forecast is that output\nand employment will moderate this year and inflation will continue to move closer to our 2 percent goal\nover time. But there are a number of risks around this forecast. Heightened geopolitical tensions have\n\n\f9\npotential implications for financial markets, oil prices, and global demand and supply. A continued\neasing in financial conditions could spur activity, leading once again to imbalances that fuel inflation.\nThe stress generated by the bank failures last March has subsided. Many banks have diversified their\nsources of liquidity, making them less vulnerable. But stress could come again to banks that continue to\nrely on uninsured deposits for their funding while having sizable exposures to CRE assets that will need\nto be repriced at higher interest rates.\n\nMonetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial conditions, but the\nmagnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature of the shocks that\nhave hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment. So while labor markets are\ncurrently strong and are expected to only gradually moderate, we need to remain attentive to the\npossibility that conditions could deteriorate faster than expected. On the other hand, the strong output and\nemployment growth could be an indication that the neutral rate of interest, which rose during the\npandemic, might remain high, which would mean restrictive policy may be needed for longer to achieve\nour goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nMonetary policy is in a good place from which to assess and respond to these risks to the outlook. The\ncurrent strength in labor market conditions and the strong spending data give us the opportunity to keep\nthe nominal funds rate at its current level while we gather more evidence that inflation truly is on a\nsustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. This is better than finding ourselves in a situation where\nwe begin easing too soon, undo some of the progress we have made on inflation, potentially destabilize\ninflation expectations, and then have to reverse course. If the economy evolves as expected, I think we\nwill gain that confidence later this year, and then we can begin moving rates down. My base case is that\nwe will do so at a gradual pace so that we can continue to manage the risks to both sides of our mandate.\nOf course, if downside risks materialize, we would have the opportunity to move rates down more\nquickly, just as we raised rates more aggressively than usual to combat rising inflation. Or if inflation\n\n\f10\nappears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we would have the opportunity to maintain a restrictive\nstance for longer. Our policy actions will depend on how the economy and the risks evolve. When our\ngoals of price stability and maximum employment are achieved, the economy will be in an even better\nplace than where it is today.\n\nOperating Framework\nLet me conclude with some remarks about the Fed’s balance sheet. As Chair Jay Powell indicated at his\npress briefing last week, the FOMC will be discussing reducing the pace of the runoff in its balance-sheet\nassets at its next meeting in March. Since June 2022, the Fed has been allowing maturing Treasuries and\nagency mortgage-backed securities to run off its balance sheet at a fairly good clip according to the plan\nannounced in May 2022. The Fed’s security holdings total about $7 trillion and have declined by about\n$1.3 trillion since the runoff began.\n\nWe are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating regime in which reserve levels are\nample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is executed\nprimarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates: the interest rate paid on bank reserves, the interest\nrate offered on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs), and the primary credit rate on\ndiscount window loans. Under this framework, active management of the supply of reserves is not\nneeded. As assets run off our balance sheet, Fed liabilities move down. So far, the balance-sheet runoff\nhas resulted in a reduction in ON RRPs, with balances currently under $575 billion, rather than a\nreduction in reserves. In aggregate, reserve balances are about $3.5 trillion, which is about 15 percent of\nbanking system assets.\n\nWhat constitutes an ample level of reserves is uncertain. It depends on the banking sector’s demand for\nreserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. The\n\n\f11\nSeptember Senior Financial Officer Survey4 indicated that for most banks, their reserve levels are above\ntheir preferred level of reserves, and money market rates and spreads suggest little in the way of funding\npressures. And the Fed’s Standing Repo Facility provides a backstop against such pressures. So the\ncurrent level and distribution of reserves are more than ample. But as balance-sheet runoff continues and\nON RRP volume reaches a minimum level, reserves will begin declining, too, and more redistribution of\nreserves will need to occur across institutions. As our balance-sheet reduction plan noted, the FOMC will\nslow and then stop the runoff when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is consistent\nwith ample. This will help ensure that we can continue to reduce our balance sheet to its efficient size for\neffectively implementing monetary policy and move toward our longer-run goal of holding primarily\nTreasury securities, thereby minimizing the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. I note that\nthe runoff pace pertains to how we implement monetary policy and not to the stance of monetary policy.\nOur main tool of monetary policy is the fed funds rate target, and balance-sheet runoff can continue even\nafter we begin to lower the funds rate.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Senior Financial Officer Survey Results,” September\n2023.

Kaufman Center for Financial Policy Studies\nQuinlan School of Business, Loyola University Chicago\nChicago, IL\nNovember 29, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Doug Evanoff and the George G. Kaufman Center for Financial Policy Studies at Loyola\nUniversity Chicago for inviting me to speak today. It is a particular honor to be part of a program\norganized by the Kaufman Center. As a researcher working on banking issues, I had the great\nopportunity to meet George Kaufman early in my career. He was generous with his advice about how to\nestablish a productive research agenda and the importance of participating in conferences like this one.\nEven though I was not one of his students, George was a role model who inspired me and other\nresearchers to do their best work to help further the safety and soundness of the banking system and foster\nfinancial stability.\n\nToday I will speak about financial system resilience, its interactions with monetary policy in the context\nof today’s economy, and some recommendations for increasing the resilience of the banking system. The\nviews I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIn less than two decades, the world has experienced two historically deep negative shocks to the global\neconomy and financial system. While their causes were different, the global financial crisis of 2008 and\nthe COVID-19 pandemic that hit in 2020 each necessitated the intervention of central banks in ways not\ncontemplated in earlier decades. This spring, the Fed was required to intervene again to address stresses\nin the banking system that were precipitated by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature\nBank. This stress episode was a painful reminder that whether we are operating in a low-interest-rate\nenvironment or in a high-interest-rate environment, financial system vulnerabilities can lead to adverse\nshocks being propagated across the financial system and sometimes very quickly. The episode also\nunderscored that to promote financial system resilience, financial institutions must properly manage risks\nand supervisors must effectively monitor risks. In the wake of the SVB failure, the Federal Reserve is\ncurrently evaluating and taking appropriate steps to improve its supervision, including its speed, force,\n\n\f2\nand agility.1 An underlying factor in SVB’s failure was the bank’s poor management of interest rate risk.\nThis poor management was revealed as the Fed raised interest rates in response to very high inflation in\nthe aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nThe Economy\nAlthough the pandemic is over, in many ways its effects are still with us. The changes in household and\nbusiness spending patterns, workforce participation, housing demand, and supply chains, all of which\narose during the pandemic, are in many ways still shaping the economy.\n\nThese changes led to a situation in which demand in both product markets and labor markets became out\nof balance with supply in those markets. These imbalances occurred in an environment of\naccommodative fiscal and monetary policy, which helped to sustain the significant increase in inflation\nthat started in 2021. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9\npercent, depending on the measure.\n\nTo combat high inflation, the Fed has tightened monetary policy, raising the fed funds rate, starting in\nMarch 2022, by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s balance\nsheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022.\nThis balance-sheet reduction is also firming the stance of monetary policy through its effect on the term\npremium on long-term bond yields.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions, which has been\ntransmitting through the economy, helping to moderate demand. At the same time, supply conditions\n\nFor further discussion, see Michael S. Barr, “Supervision and Regulation,” testimony before the Committee on\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C., November 14, 2023.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/barr20231113a.htm)\n1\n\n\f3\nhave improved. Economic activity and employment growth have slowed, although they have remained\nmore resilient than most forecasters, including FOMC participants, had expected earlier this year.\n\nInflation has been running well above the Fed’s goal for more than two years. While it is still above our 2\npercent goal, there has been discernible progress on inflation even while the overall economy has\nremained relatively strong. It will take some time to get inflation back down to 2 percent, but the FOMC\nis committed to doing so. Monetary policy is in a good place for policymakers to assess incoming\ninformation on the economy and financial conditions and judge whether policy is well calibrated to\nensure that inflation is on a timely path back to 2 percent. Whether the fed funds rate needs to go higher\nthan its current level and for how long policy needs to remain restrictive will depend importantly on\nwhether the economy is evolving as expected, how the risks are changing, and the progress being made\non our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The Israel-Hamas war is a human tragedy, as is\nthe ongoing war in Ukraine. Heightened geopolitical tensions pose risks to the medium-run outlook, with\nimplications for financial markets, oil prices, and global demand. The slowdown in the Chinese economy\nalso poses a risk to the outlook.\n\nAs the FOMC has communicated, two important considerations for calibrating monetary policy going\nforward are how much of the past tightening is yet to transmit through the economy and how restrictive\nmonetary policy is. There is some uncertainty around both of these. Monetary policy transmits to the\nbroader economy by affecting overall financial conditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with\nwhich it affects the economy vary with the nature of the shocks that have hit the economy and other\naspects of the economic environment.2 While the policy stance is currently widely viewed as restrictive,\n\n2\n\nRomer and Romer provide estimates of the effects of contractionary monetary policy shocks on real GDP, the\nunemployment rate, and inflation in various tightening cycles. See Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer,\n\n\f4\nthe resilience the economy has shown in the face of high interest rates has underscored the difficulty of\nknowing precisely how restrictive policy is partly because of the uncertainty about the level of the neutral\nreal interest rate, so-called r-star.\n\nWhen policymakers are confronted with uncertainty, scenario analysis can be a helpful guide. In an\nuncertain economic environment, it is important to look at various models and various scenarios, because\nthe economy could evolve quite a bit differently than expected. If it does, monetary policy will need to be\nnimble and respond appropriately to the evolving outlook and to the risks to achieving both parts of our\ndual mandate. I believe the current level of the funds rate positions us well to do that.\n\nFinancial System Vulnerabilities\nThe stress in the banking industry generated by the bank failures in March has subsided, but the\nunderlying conditions and causes of this stress remain. As interest rates began rising in 2022, funding\nrisks for banks increased and they remain elevated.\n\nMany banks are holding longer-term securities, which if they had to be sold and marked-to-market would\nresult in losses. Some of these banks have sizable exposure to the segments of commercial real estate that\nare particularly under stress, such as office buildings, and over the next year many of the CRE assets at\nbanks will need to be refinanced at higher interest rates.\n\nAt some banks, the declines in the fair value of fixed-rate assets have been large relative to their\nregulatory capital levels, especially for some large but non-globally-systemically-important banks and\n\n“Presidential Address: Does Monetary Policy Matter? The Narrative Approach after 35 Years,” American Economic\nReview 113, 2023, pp. 1395-1423. (https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.113.6.1395)\n\n\f5\nsome regional banks. A portion of these banks have above-average reliance on uninsured deposits,\nmaking them particularly vulnerable to shocks.\n\nOf course, it isn’t only banks that are vulnerable to shocks. After the bank failures this spring, some\nmoney market funds also experienced high redemptions. Reforms adopted by the SEC in July aim to\nincrease the resilience of money market funds, but they have not yet been put to the test.3\n\nFinancial System Resilience\nIn times of banking and financial stress, regulators find themselves with a time-inconsistency problem.\nForcing one bank to take actions to raise capital or address other risk-management concerns during a\nperiod of stress could precipitate a widespread reevaluation of the banking industry by investors and\ndepositors resulting in a systemic event. In such cases, regulators and supervisors might lean toward\nforbearance even if this creates bad incentives for financial institutions to manage risks in the future.\n\nAvoiding this potential bias requires fostering a financial system that is resilient to shocks across the\nbusiness and financial cycles. Financial system resilience supports the attainment of our macroeconomic\ngoals. A resilient financial system is one in which banks may tighten their credit standards but they are\nable to continue lending to creditworthy businesses and households during economic downturns, financial\nmarkets are able to continue intermediating in an orderly fashion during periods of stress, and monetary\npolicy continues to transmit to the broader economy and is not disrupted by financial system stresses.\n\nIncreased resilience has the added benefit of limiting the times in which monetary policy and financial\nstability goals come into conflict. Usually, these goals are complementary. An unstable financial system\ncan propagate adverse macroeconomic shocks over broad economic sectors and over time to the detriment\n\n3\n\nSee the SEC press release announcing the reforms at https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-129.\n\n\f6\nof macroeconomic stability. In the other direction, well-formulated and well-communicated monetary\npolicy supports financial stability by allowing households, firms, and financial institutions to make better\ninvestment, saving, borrowing, and lending decisions, and price stability eliminates a source of asset-price\nvolatility.\n\nBut there may be times when the goals come into conflict. Since monetary policy actions affect financial\nconditions, they can also affect financial stability risks. For example, a prolonged period of very low\ninterest rates may contribute to financial vulnerabilities by spurring search-for-yield behavior,\nencouraging higher debt levels, or eroding lending standards. Similarly, a period of rapidly tightening\nfinancial conditions raises the risk of increased volatility, market dysfunction, and the potential that a\nshock could be amplified by known vulnerabilities in the financial system or reveal previously unknown\nvulnerabilities, including high levels of leverage. This means that, at times, policymakers may be faced\nwith intertemporal tradeoffs between their monetary policy and financial stability policy goals, and these\ntradeoffs will vary over the business and credit cycles.\n\nThe question is how best to limit these tradeoffs. A general consensus has emerged that it is better to use\nsupervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools to address financial stability concerns and monetary\npolicy tools to address macroeconomic stability concerns. This is a desirable separation; indeed, it is\noptimal in some theoretical models. Increased financial system resilience will help limit the times this\nseparation cannot be maintained.\n\nIn March, financial stability tools were used to address stresses in the banking system. This allowed the\nFed to continue to use its monetary policy tools for macroeconomic purposes, and we proceeded with an\n\n\f7\nincrease in the federal funds rate at our March meeting. But those financial stability tools involved\nregulators invoking the systemic risk exception and implementing a new lending facility.4\n\nIncreasing the overall resilience of the financial system would diminish the need for the Fed and other\nregulators to have to step in, whether it be to reduce market dysfunction by buying Treasury assets, as we\nhad to do in October 2019 and March 2020, or having to set up special facilities to serve as the lender of\nlast resort, actions that have the potential to change us into the lender of first resort.\n\nRecommended Steps to Increase the Resilience of the Banking System\nThe stresses in the banking system earlier this year underscored the challenge of ensuring that financial\ninstitutions have enough capital when their assets decline in value. Cyclical macroprudential tools aim to\nsolve this problem by mitigating the systemic risk that can build up over the business cycle. In the U.S.,\nthese tools are basically limited to the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) and the stress test. The\nCCyB is intended to require banks to hold more capital during periods of high credit growth, which often\ncoincides with the accumulation of system-wide risk.\n\nHowever, the lead times needed to use this tool limit its effectiveness in addressing vulnerabilities that\nmay develop rapidly or that can be detected only after they are far along. This suggests the need to raise\nthe buffer in good times before we see the vulnerabilities, yet we have never raised the CCyB above zero\nin the U.S.\n\nTo make the CCyB more effective and time consistent, it should be recalibrated to be at a positive level in\nnormal times, and then raised when credit growth moves up and lowered when credit growth moves down\n\n4\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) on March 12, 2023.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm)\n\n\f8\nbased on a systematic rule. In my view, being systematic about financial stability policy, including\nsupervision and regulation, is perhaps even more important than it is for monetary policy because of the\nimportant role played by incentives and asymmetric information in financial markets and institutions.\nApplying policy systematically could help tame some of the moral hazard and time-inconsistency\nproblems that policymakers face when promoting financial resilience.5\n\nWith respect to the other main macroprudential tool, I believe that the current stress tests should be\nredesigned with an eye to making them a more effective countercyclical capital tool so that banks would\nneed to build up their capital buffers when they are better able to do so.\n\nUntil we create more effective macroprudential tools and show that we are willing to use them, we should\nset standards for the through-the-cycle structural resilience tools, including capital and liquidity\nrequirements, somewhat higher than they otherwise would be. I view the Basel III endgame capital\nproposal as aligned with this view.6\n\nBanks’ capital positions affect their lending, which in turn affects the macroeconomy. Research indicates\nthat well-capitalized banks tend to lend more than poorly capitalized ones, to grow their loan and deposit\nmarket shares during crises by purchasing assets from less well-capitalized banks,7 and to have more\naccess to market funding during downturns than do less capitalized banks.8 A well-capitalized banking\n\nI discuss the benefits of systematic financial stability policy in Loretta J.

This is not to say that ever-increasing\nlevels of required capital would be optimal. There would come a point where the requirement would so\nthwart risk-taking and beneficial innovation that it would undermine longer-run economic growth.9\nIndeed, a recent research paper presents a theoretical model in which the distribution of capital across\nbanks and not just the level determines the socially optimal capital structure for the banking system.10\nBut in my view, we are still below the level of capital where increasing it would be counterproductive.\n\nThe stresses in the banking system earlier this year point to other reforms that should be considered.\nFirst, much of bank regulation is tied to book values instead of market values. Moving toward marketvalue accounting for more of a bank’s balance sheet and basing more of bank regulation on market values\nwould help align regulation and supervision with market forces. Even if regulations are not changed,\nhaving supervisors pay more attention to market values would likely spur earlier actions to ensure\nadequate risk management at banks and would help focus supervisory attention on areas of highest\nvulnerability.11\n\nSecond, much of bank regulation aims to lower the probability of financial system instability. But we\nshould also take steps to reduce the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the\nfinancial system. Resilience is a combination of both of these. More effort needs to be expended on\ncreating an effective, credible, and time-consistent bank resolution mechanism. If regulators were able to\n\nSee Paul Tucker, “Microprudential versus Macroprudential Supervision: Functions That Make Sense Only as Part\nof an Overall Regime for Financial Stability,” remarks at the 59 th Economic Conference: Macroprudential Monetary\nPolicy, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 2-3, 2015.\n(https://www.bostonfed.org/macroprudential2015/agenda/index.htm;\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/macroprudential2015/papers/Tucker.pdf)\n9\n\nFenghua Song and Anjan V.

See, e.g., Philip Bond, Itay Goldstein, and Edward Simpson Prescott,\n“Market-Based Corrective Actions,” The Review of Financial Studies 23, 2010, pp. 781–820.\n(https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhp059)\n\n\f10\nconfidently resolve systemically important financial institutions in a way that avoids causing system-wide\ninstability, they would be in a much better position when the inevitable shock hits the financial system.\n\nThird, while much regulation and supervision focuses on credit risk, more attention should be given to\nliquidity risk and interest rate risk. SVB lost over $40 billion of deposits, about one-quarter of its total\ndeposits, in a day, showing that money can flow out of a bank much more quickly than ever imagined.\nAs lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve System promotes financial stability by lending against good\ncollateral to healthy banks facing temporary liquidity problems. Currently, the Reserve Banks are\nencouraging eligible financial institutions to ensure that they have the legal agreements and collateral in\nplace and have tested their ability to use the discount window in a timely way should the need arise.\nTesting at this time is not mandatory, but requiring such testing as part of sound liquidity management is\nworth considering, as is tightening the liquidity coverage ratio requirement so that banks have to hold\nhigher levels of liquid assets to cover potential cash outflows. Another idea worth consideration is\nrequiring banks to post collateral in proportion to their short-term funding, so they would be ready to\nborrow at the discount window should that funding start to run.\n\nI have been speaking mostly about banks, but we also need to take steps to increase the structural\nresilience of nonbank financial firms and markets, ensure that the financial system’s supervisory and\nregulatory structure keeps pace with innovations, and improve our visibility in the nonbank financial\nsector. Not having the data needed to adequately measure the risks and vulnerabilities in a particular\nsegment of the financial system should not lure us into thinking that the vulnerabilities are small or don’t\nexist. For example, there is a general lack of transparency and lack of verifiable information around the\nassets backing many stablecoins, leading to the possibility of sharp changes in prices and substantial\nlosses for their investors. Stablecoins are one example, but there are several parts of the financial system\non which we do not have sufficient data to make a clear assessment of the risks. This includes data on\ncentral counterparties’ member concentrations, principal trading firms, and nonbank funders. The fact\n\n\f11\nthat we can’t put the risks on a dashboard doesn’t mean the risks don’t exist. The Financial Stability\nBoard has recognized the need to better understand the interconnections between bank and nonbank\nintermediation, the amplification of shocks, and the overall resilience of the nonbank financial sector.12\n\nCyber resilience is also an area that requires continued focus. All aspects of the financial system,\nincluding markets, nonbanks, and banks, are subject to cyber risk and to operational risks more generally.\nThese are not potential risks; these risks are actually being realized. Continued supervisory focus on\nensuring that financial institutions are making the investments needed to prevent cyber incidents and the\ninvestments needed to ensure they can recover in a timely way when the inevitable cyber event occurs is\nvery important, especially in the current environment when bank profits are under pressure and banks are\ntaking actions to cut costs.\n\nAs with monetary policy, scenario analysis can play an important role in understanding the financial\nsystem’s vulnerabilities to various shocks. Looking at various stress scenarios involving relevant risks\ncan make policymakers better prepared for what could happen even if it is not viewed as the most likely\nsituation at the time. And the more uncertain the environment, the wider the set of possible scenarios that\nshould be examined.\n\nIt is important to remember that in a situation of significantly increasing financial stability risks, the\nblurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals increases as well: if the risks to\nfinancial stability are sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also be\nin jeopardy over the medium run. More work needs to be done to determine how best to handle the nexus\nbetween monetary policy and financial stability. The FOMC’s current statement on its monetary policy\n\nSee Financial Stability Board, “Promoting Global Financial Stability: 2023 FSB Annual Report,” October 11,\n2023. (https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P111023.pdf)\n12\n\n\f12\nstrategy says that “sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable\nfinancial system” and that the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions do reflect its “assessments of the\nbalance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the\nCommittee’s goals.”13 I would like the FOMC’s next framework review, which Chair Jay Powell has\nrecently indicated will start in the latter half of 2024,14 to develop that further. The revised statement\nshould clarify the strategy for handling the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability\npolicy, shedding more light on how the FOMC takes into account the potential impact of monetary policy\non financial stability risks and how those risks influence the Committee’s monetary policy decisions.\n\nFinally, I would also like to encourage the Kaufman Center to continue furthering research on the\nfinancial system and its role in promoting economic growth and financial stability. Good policymaking is\ninformed by good research. Advances in research will help ensure that our financial system remains\nresilient, which is fundamental for a strong economy.\n\nSee “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012; as\nreaffirmed effective January 31, 2023.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\n13\n\nJerome H.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nShadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting\nNew York, NY\nOctober 20, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Shadow Open Market Committee for inviting me to speak today. The SOMC is known for\nfostering an active exchange of diverse views on the economy and monetary policy, with the aim of\ncontributing to better policy decisions. I believe robust policy discussions and deliberations are very\nconstructive, and I am looking forward to the question-and-answer portion of this session. To help frame\nthat discussion, let me start with a review of economic developments and my perspectives on monetary\npolicy. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nJane Austen is often (erroneously) credited with having written: “It isn’t what we say or think that defines\nus, but what we do.” That sentiment is only partially true in monetary policymaking. It is true in the\nsense that a central bank will lose its credibility with the public if it merely says it is committed to 2\npercent inflation but does not take action to bring high inflation down. In this case, high inflation could\nbecome embedded in people’s view of the economy and affect their behavior in ways inconsistent with\nprice stability, making it much harder for the central bank to achieve its policy goals. But the quote does\nnot fully apply to monetary policymaking because how and what policymakers communicate are very\nimportant in aligning the public’s expectations with policy actions, and this alignment can make these\nactions more effective.\n\nThe FOMC’s policy actions and communications have contributed to discernible progress on inflation.\nAs we calibrate policy to finish the job, both word and deed will continue to be important. This is\nparticularly true because the economic environment is quite uncertain. The events in the Middle East are\nstill unfolding, adding uncertainty to what was already an uncertain geopolitical environment. The IsraelHamas War is a human tragedy. It is too soon to determine the full economic and financial market\nramifications of the war for the global economy, but they will need to be considered as we chart the future\npath of monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate goals.\nOver the past three years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been a major source of uncertainty.\n\n\f2\nWhen the pandemic hit, the economy shut down in March 2020, and fiscal and monetary policymakers\ntook aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow and\nlimiting lasting damage to the economy. When public health statistics began to improve in May 2020, the\neconomy began to reopen. But it was not business as usual. Spending patterns had shifted from services\nto goods early in the pandemic and have only gradually been shifting back to pre-pandemic trends. Many\npeople decided to leave the workforce when the pandemic hit and only gradually decided to rejoin. The\nparticipation rate of workers between the ages of 25 and 54 has now surpassed what it was in 2019, but\nthe overall participation rate is still below its pre-pandemic level. Remote work became much more\ncommon. This led to changes in the demand for housing, and sales of new and existing single-family\nhomes surged in 2020 and 2021. In addition, supply chains were disrupted, making it much harder for\nfirms to keep up with the demand for their products.\n\nThe changes in spending patterns, workforce participation, housing demand, and supply chains that arose\nduring the pandemic are in many ways still shaping the economy. They led to a situation in which\ndemand in both product markets and labor markets became out of balance with supply. Those imbalances\noccurred in an environment of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, which helped to sustain the\nsignificant increase in inflation that started in 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,\nanother ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and\nother commodities. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9 percent,\ndepending on the measure.\n\nEconomic Developments in Response to Monetary Policy\nWhen inflation began moving up in April 2021, the FOMC communicated in its post-meeting statements\nthat elevated inflation largely reflected factors that the Committee expected would be transitory. By\nDecember 2021, the FOMC’s view had changed and it no longer referred to inflation as transitory. In\nJanuary 2022, the FOMC said that with inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the\nCommittee expected it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.\n\n\f3\nFinancial conditions tightened in reaction to this forward guidance. Following through on its guidance,\nthe Fed took action by raising the fed funds rate by 25 basis points in March 2022 and has now raised the\nfed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May\n2022. This balance-sheet reduction is also firming the stance of monetary policy through its effect on the\nterm premium on long-term bond yields.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions and, in response,\naggregate demand has begun to moderate. At the same time, supply chain disruptions have improved and\nimbalances between supply and demand are easing. While demand has moderated, economic activity has\nbeen considerably more resilient than most forecasters, including FOMC participants, were expecting.\nConsumer spending makes up about 70 percent of GDP. It has been increasing at a solid pace, supported\nby strong income growth and the still-elevated savings accumulated during the pandemic. Bankers in the\nFourth District report there has been an uptick in usage of home equity lines of credit and credit card debt,\nsuggesting that some households have exhausted ready balances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have\nalso edged up, although they are still at historically low levels. As savings balances normalize and credit\nconditions remain restrictive, consumer spending is expected to moderate.\n\nBusinesses have slowed their spending on equipment and software this year, and it is expected to continue\nto moderate given restrictive credit conditions. In the housing market, activity has slowed but the longerterm shortage of available housing has meant less of a slowdown than one would have expected given\nthat the 30-year mortgage rate is near 8 percent. The shortfall in housing supply has kept rents and house\nprices high.\n\n\f4\nIn response to the evolving picture, FOMC participants’ projections of economic growth this year were\nrevised up in September.1 Earlier in the year, FOMC participants projected that growth would be well\nbelow trend in 2023. In September, the median projection was that growth will be a bit over 2 percent,\nwhich is somewhat above trend. Still, growth is expected to slow to below trend next year as tighter\ncredit and financial conditions and waning fiscal support for households weigh on spending.\n\nLabor market conditions also paint a picture of moderation and resilience. Firms have reduced their job\npostings and more people are coming back into the job market. Firms report it is easier to find the\nworkers they need. Still, labor market conditions remain quite strong. The unemployment rate is low, at\n3.8 percent. Job growth has slowed over the course of the year, but the strong reading in September and\nrevisions to the July and August data suggest the slowdown has been less than once thought. Payroll\ngains averaged about 300 thousand per month over the first three months of the year compared with about\n270 thousand per month on average over July through September. Restrictive financial conditions should\nhelp to continue to moderate labor demand, bringing demand into better balance with supply. The\nunemployment rate is likely to move up somewhat as this rebalancing occurs, but I expect overall labor\nmarket conditions to remain solid.\n\nDespite strong job growth in September, wage pressures are easing by some measures. Our business\ncontacts expect wage increases to be less over the coming year than last year, except for workers with\nhard-to-find skills. But at 4 percent, expected wage increases are higher than before the pandemic and\nwell above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation, based on current estimates of trend productivity\ngrowth. Wage-price dynamics can be quite complicated. An open question is whether inflation leads\nwage growth or whether it is the other way around. One wage Phillips curve model from the Cleveland\nFed suggests that inflation leads wage growth, with the model attributing much of the high wage growth\n\nFour times a year, the FOMC summarizes Committee participants’ projections of output growth, the\nunemployment rate, inflation, and the associated appropriate policy path. For the September 2023 Summary of\nEconomic Projections, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20230920.htm.\n1\n\n\f5\nsince the pandemic to the passthrough of higher inflation.2 On the other hand, other research from the\nCleveland Fed that uses data from our business survey finds that firms are highly attuned to wage costs\nwhen setting prices.3 My conclusion is that we need to continue monitoring both wages and prices to\nassess whether inflation is moving down in a sustainable and timely way to our longer-run goal of 2\npercent.\n\nInflation\nInflation has been running well above the Fed’s goal for more than two years, and it is still too high. That\nsaid, it is important to acknowledge the discernible progress that has been made on inflation even while\nthe overall economy has remained relatively strong. As of August, the headline PCE inflation rate is\nrunning at 3-1/2 percent, which is half of its peak rate in June of last year. The underlying measures of\ninflation, including the core, median, and trimmed-mean measures, have also moved down from their\npeaks. The progress is easier to see when you look at the price changes over shorter time horizons, such\nas three-month or six-month annualized inflation rates. But the CPI report for September is a reminder\nthat we cannot count on the progress continuing at the same good pace we have seen in recent months.\nThe larger declines in inflation have come in goods prices. Inflation in housing services, measured by\nrents and the imputed rents for owner-occupied housing, has begun to come down, but the recent CPI\ninflation report suggests that the adjustment could be gradual. The most stubborn part of the index has\nbeen inflation in core services excluding housing. This component, which makes up about half of the\nconsumption basket, has shown little improvement over time.\n\nSee Martin DeLuca and Willem Van Zandweghe, “Postpandemic Nominal Wage Growth: Inflation Pass-Through\nor Labor Market Imbalance?” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Economic Commentary, No. 023-13, August 14,\n2023.

When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level\nis moving up faster than we would like and households and businesses are having to pay those higherthan-desired prices. In addition, high inflation distorts investment decisions, imposing longer-run costs\non the economy.4 In my view, the risks to the inflation forecast remain tilted to the upside. Oil prices are\nup, on net, since July and may pass through to other core prices. In addition, gasoline prices are higher\nthan at the start of the year and are particularly prominent for households that have to fill up their cars or\ntrucks once or twice a week. Rising gasoline prices could begin to make consumers think inflation will\nbe rising again. I don’t expect that this is going to move inflation back up to the very high levels we saw\nlast year, but it could stall the progress we have seen over the past few months.\n\nA distinguishing feature of this high-inflation episode compared with those in the 1970s and early 1980s\nhas been the fact that despite high inflation rates, medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have\nremained reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. There\ncould be several reasons for this, but one likely factor is that the Fed now has an explicit numerical\nlonger-term inflation goal of 2 percent. In addition, over this episode, we have communicated our\ncommitment to achieving this goal, and we have taken actions to support this commitment. Our\ncommunications have been an important policy tool, reinforcing the actions we have taken and making\nthem more effective by anchoring inflation expectations. Ensuring that the public views the commitment\nas credible can reduce the costs of disinflation. Indeed, research indicates that the disinflation that thenFed Chair Paul Volcker had to engineer in the 1980s was costly in terms of cumulative output losses not\nonly because the Fed had to tighten monetary policy enough to get inflation down from high levels, but\nalso because the Fed had to make the public understand that it would not abandon its commitment to price\nstability as inflation started to come down. Regaining credibility was important in moving the public’s\n\nL’Huillier Bowles and DeLuca discuss some of the channels through which high inflation can affect economic\nwelfare and impose longer-run costs on the economy.

Appropriate words and deeds will continue to be crucial as we finish the job. This\nbrings me to monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy Calibration\nAt its September meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Fed’s securities holdings. In determining the extent of\nadditional policy firming that may be appropriate, the FOMC will be assessing incoming economic and\nfinancial developments, as well as the cumulative effects of the tightening done so far, since we know that\nmonetary policy affects the economy with a lag. The economic projections released by the FOMC in\nSeptember indicated that the median participant thought that another rate increase would be appropriate\nthis year and that monetary policy would likely have to be held sufficiently restrictive for a while in order\nto get inflation back down to 2 percent. This is consistent with my own reading of economic conditions,\nthe outlook, and the risks to the outlook.\n\nBut whether the fed funds rate needs to go higher than its current level and for how long policy needs to\nremain restrictive will depend importantly on how the economy evolves relative to the outlook and how\nthe risks are changing. To guide my policy views, I will be carefully assessing incoming evidence to\ndetermine whether the economy is evolving as expected. Risk management considerations are becoming\nincreasingly important as we set monetary policy in a way that balances the costs over time of potentially\nover-tightening vs. under-tightening monetary policy. Tightening too much would slow the economy\nmore than necessary and entail higher costs than needed to get inflation back to our goal. Tightening too\nlittle would allow high inflation to persist, with short- and long-run consequences, and would necessitate\na much longer and more costly journey back to price stability.\n\nMarvin Goodfriend and Robert G. King, “The Incredible Volcker Disinflation,” Journal of Monetary Economics\n52, pp. 981-1015, 2005.

In\naddition to upside risks to inflation, geopolitical uncertainty has risen, with implications for financial\nmarkets, oil prices, and global demand. The slowdown in the Chinese economy, the possibility of an\nextended UAW strike, and the potential for a government shutdown later this year all pose some risks\naround the outlook. The structural changes to the economy since the pandemic, including changes to the\nlabor market and supply chains, also complicate the picture. Indeed, our models are trained on past data,\nbut the pandemic was unprecedented and that has complicated forecasting. Post-pandemic, it has become\neven more important to look at several models, examine different scenarios, and collect real-time\ninformation from regional contacts to inform policymaking.\n\nLags and Stance\nAs the FOMC has communicated, two important considerations for calibrating monetary policy going\nforward are how much of the past tightening is yet to transmit through the economy and how restrictive\nmonetary policy is. Monetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial\nconditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature\nof the shocks that have hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment.6 It is possible\nthat the Fed’s use of forward guidance has sped up the transmission of monetary policy to the broader\neconomy, affecting financial conditions before the actual changes in monetary policy have occurred.7 For\nexample, tightening in financial conditions occurred several months in advance of the first Fed rate\nincrease in March 2022. Other research suggests that even controlling for the increased use of forward\nguidance and balance-sheet policy, the lag in the effect of monetary policy on inflation shortened in the\n\n6\n\nRomer and Romer provide estimates of the effects of contractionary monetary policy shocks on real GDP, the\nunemployment rate, and inflation in various tightening cycles.

This suggests\nthat past changes in monetary policy may be felt for some time to come in the economy. Since the lags\nvary across cycles, the benchmark against which “shorter” or “longer” is evaluated is not well defined; so\na definitive conclusion about the length of the lag in this tightening cycle will remain elusive.\n\nA second policy consideration is the stance of monetary policy. While monetary policy is currently\nwidely viewed as restrictive, the resilience the economy has shown in the face of high interest rates has\nunderscored the difficulty of knowing precisely how restrictive policy is partly because of the uncertainty\nabout the level of the neutral real interest rate, so-called r-star. In economic models, the longer-term\nneutral real interest rate is determined by the long-run growth rate of consumption and, therefore, output,\nand is influenced by the trend rate of productivity growth, the growth rate of the labor force, and the\ndemand for safe assets, among other factors. Before the pandemic, estimates showed that the longer-run\nneutral rate in advanced economies had been declining for more than two decades, reflecting the aging of\nthe population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth.9 But in the aftermath of the\npandemic, estimates of the short-run neutral rate rose; whether the increase will persist is an open\nquestion. Projected longer-run fiscal imbalances are unlikely to be sustainable, and the government will\nneed to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced benefits, increased taxes, and\nprogram restructuring. In the meantime, higher projected U.S. fiscal deficits, requiring higher\ngovernment debt issuance, will put upward pressure on the neutral rate. If new technologies like\ngenerative AI produce significant productivity gains, this would also put upward pressure on the longer-\n\nSee Taeyoung Doh and Andrew T.

I think the jury is still out. I have not yet raised my\nestimate of the long-run equilibrium interest rate but will consider doing so depending on how the\neconomy evolves.\n\nIn light of the cyclical and structural uncertainties and the need to balance risks, policy decisions will\nneed to be guided by actual progress on our dual mandate goals, in particular, whether the rate of progress\nwe have seen on inflation in recent months is sustained and whether labor market conditions remain\nhealthy as they moderate. Because the outlook and balance of risks can change, policymakers will need\nto be nimble in order to appropriately calibrate policy in the midst of such changes. This will require us\nto carefully monitor economic, banking, and financial market developments.\n\nHigher long yields\nOne such recent development is the tightening in financial conditions since our September FOMC\nmeeting. Restrictive monetary policy is intended to tighten financial conditions, but the increase in the\nnominal 10-year Treasury yield since the last meeting was larger than expected and reflects several\nfactors. Like the Fed, market participants have revised up their expectations for growth this year. They\nhave also likely taken on board the communications from the FOMC that monetary policy is likely to\nremain restrictive for some time based on the outlook for inflation and employment. Both of those factors\nsuggest a higher expected path of short-term real interest rates and therefore higher longer-term yields.\nRising term premia, the compensation that investors require to hold longer-term debt, have also\ncontributed to the increase in Treasury yields. The New York Fed’s estimate of the term premium on 10year Treasuries, which had been in negative territory since mid-2021, turned positive toward the end of\n\n10\n\nCurrent estimates suggest that trend productivity growth remains relatively low, in the 1 to 1.5 percent range. See\nthe website https://sites.google.com/view/james-a-kahn-economics/home/trend-productivity-update, which provides\nthe latest estimates of trend productivity growth based on the model in James A. Kahn and Robert W. Rich,\n“Tracking the New Economy: Using Growth Theory to Detect Changes in Trend Productivity,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 54, September 2007, pp. 1670-1701. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2006.07.008)\n\n\f11\nSeptember.11 The recent focus on the U.S. fiscal situation, which will likely necessitate higher issuance\nof Treasury debt, likely contributed to the rise in the term premium. One factor that does not appear to\nhave contributed to the rise in yields since September is inflation expectations, which have remained\nrelatively stable. If sustained, the increase in longer-term yields will help to moderate demand, and as one\nof the financial conditions we monitor, it will be one of the factors I consider when evaluating the\nappropriate path of monetary policy going forward.\n\nPhases of Monetary Policy and Communications\nRegardless of the decision made at our next meeting, if the economy evolves as anticipated, in my view,\nwe are likely near or at a holding point on the funds rate as we accumulate more information on economic\nand financial developments and assess the effects of the tightening in financial conditions that has already\noccurred. I think it is useful to think of monetary policy during this tightening cycle in phases, although\nthe shifts from one phase to another depend on the evolution of the economy.\n\nPhase one: How fast to raise the policy rate\nDuring the first phase of this tightening cycle, the monetary policy narrative centered on how fast we\nshould raise the policy rate. We began with a 25-basis-point increase in March 2022, then moved the\nfunds rate up by 50 basis points at our next meeting, and then followed with 75-basis-point increases at\neach of our next four meetings. We then slowed rate increases, with a 50-basis-point increase at the\nDecember 2022 meeting and a 25-basis-point increase at the first meeting of this year. Over this phase,\nthe Committee communicated that it anticipated that ongoing increases in the funds rate target would be\nappropriate.\n\n11\n\nSee Treasury Term Premia, Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/data_indicators/term-premia-tabs#/overview)\n\n\f12\nPhase two: How high to raise the policy rate\nAt that point, the policy narrative entered a second phase, which centered on how high rates would have\nto go. The policy language changed to signal that the FOMC would be assessing the extent to which\nadditional policy firming may be appropriate. If the economy evolves as expected, I believe we are\nnearing the end of this phase.\n\nPhase three: How long will monetary policy need to remain restrictive\nThe narrative would then be entering a third phase focused on how long monetary policy will need to\nremain restrictive. Getting away from the meeting-to-meeting guessing game of will they or won’t they\nincrease the funds rate would seem to add some beneficial stability allowing firms and financial markets\nto absorb the increases in the pipeline. But communicating how the FOMC is thinking about the\neconomy and monetary policy in this policy phase will be a challenge because it requires some nuance.\nThe FOMC is committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal, and we would not be content with\ninflation settling in at a level above our goal. But as we travel the last mile of getting inflation back to 2\npercent, the balance of risks to our dual mandate goals will continue to shift and it is important that the\npublic understand that the commitment to price stability doesn’t mean ignoring the maximum\nemployment part of the mandate or deliberately taking actions to drive the economy into recession for the\nsake of achieving price stability as soon as possible. The balance of risks will change over time, and the\nFed will continue to calibrate its policy in pursuit of both goals.\n\nGiven the outlook, I anticipate it will be appropriate to keep the funds rate at its peak for some time.\nSome commentators have suggested that this will result in a passive tightening of policy as inflation\nmoves down. Essentially, they are measuring the real fed funds rate as the nominal funds rate minus\nactual inflation, which is backward looking. A better measure is the nominal rate minus expected\ninflation, which is forward looking. While I expect year-ahead inflation expectations to move down as\ninflation declines, this may take some time, and maintaining the nominal funds rate in order to achieve\nthat decline in inflation expectations is appropriate. Indeed, the projected decline in inflation is\n\n\f13\nconditioned on maintaining restrictive monetary policy. A failure to do so could jeopardize achieving that\ndecline.\n\nPhase four: Reducing the fed funds rate and moving monetary policy toward a more neutral stance\nEventually, policy will enter a fourth phase, in which it is appropriate to begin reducing the fed funds rate\nand moving monetary policy toward a more neutral stance. Given the lags with which monetary policy\naffects the economy, monetary policymakers will need to be forward looking and begin reducing the\nfunds rate when inflation is still somewhat above our goal. At that point, it will be important for the\nFOMC to communicate that the Fed is not abandoning its 2 percent target and is not content with inflation\nremaining persistently above target. Rather, the message will be that the Fed is more confident that\ninflation is on its way back down to 2 percent so less policy restraint is needed.\n\nLonger-term improvements in communications\nLonger term, I believe communications could be more effective if the FOMC’s post-meeting statement\nprovided more information on the Committee’s economic outlook, its view of the risks around the\noutlook, and its evaluation of progress on its goals. Doing so would give the public a better sense of the\nFOMC’s reaction function. This would be particularly helpful in uncertain times, like today, when it is\nimportant to maintain some policy optionality. Policy decisions should be guided in a systematic way by\nhow the economy is evolving relative to our outlook, as well as the shifting risks around the outlook. But\nbecause the economy could evolve differently than expected, we need to preserve some policy\noptionality. This “systematic optionality” is different from setting monetary policy in a discretionary\nmanner in which the policy reaction function is changing. A fuller post-meeting statement would help the\npublic understand this difference and give them a sense of how the FOMC is likely to react if some of the\nrisks are realized or new risks emerge.\n\nLastly, when uncertainty is high, as it has been during and since the pandemic, scenario analysis, as\nadvocated by SOMC members Mike Bordo, Andy Levin, and Mickey Levy, can be a helpful guide to\n\n\f14\nmonetary policymaking and communications.12 The FOMC does look at alternative scenarios and\nalternative interpretations of intermeeting economic developments as part of our meeting preparations,\nwhich can help us avoid “group-think” and be better prepared if the economy evolves differently than\nanticipated. But recasting our SEP submissions to incorporate participants’ views of potential salient\nscenarios rather than focusing only on the modal outlook could be quite helpful, especially in uncertain\ntimes. I essentially did this with my SEP submissions during the pandemic. In this period, forecasting\nhow the economy would evolve was particularly challenging given the uncertainties about the course of\nthe virus and how households and businesses might respond. Indeed, in March 2020, given the immense\nuncertainty to the outlook, the FOMC refrained from collecting and publishing the SEP. When the SEP\nresumed in June 2020, I began formulating my outlook conditional on different scenarios on the path of\nthe pandemic and our success at containing it. This approach gave a clearer picture of my view on the\neconomy as distinct from my views on the course of the disease. A similar type of scenario analysis for\ndifferent kinds of uncertainty would not be too difficult to incorporate into the SEP, and it could form a\nbasis for policy communications that preserve optionality without suggesting that policy is being set in a\ndiscretionary manner.\n\nTo conclude, word and deed are important monetary policy tools. And the Fed will be using both to\nachieve its dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. This concludes my prepared\nremarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\nMichael D. Bordo, Andrew T. Levin, and Mickey D.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe 50 Club\nCleveland, OH\nOctober 2, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Dan Walsh and the 50 Club for inviting me to speak this evening. The FOMC, which sets\nmonetary policy in the U.S., met less than two weeks ago. So this is an excellent time to give you an\nupdate on the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed is only a couple of blocks away from here. We are celebrating the 100th anniversary\nof our building this year, and we are very proud to be part of the architectural history of Cleveland. We\nare even prouder to be part of the civic landscape. I feel privileged to represent the Fourth Federal\nReserve District, which comprises the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West\nVirginia, at our policy meetings in Washington. Many of you also play an important role in the monetary\npolicymaking process because you generously provide us with insights into economic conditions, whether\nit be through our surveys, as members of our advisory councils, or as directors. The reconnaissance that\nyou provide on business activity, the labor market, and financial conditions is often more timely than the\nofficial data, so it helps us evaluate not only where the economy is but where it is going. This kind of\ninformation helps me formulate my economic outlook and my views on monetary policy to foster the\nFed’s statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. Thank you for this public service.\n\nThe Journey So Far\nBefore I turn to the outlook for the economy, it’s good to recap where we’ve been. Before the pandemic\nhit in early 2020, the U.S. economy had been on very solid ground. It was the 11th year of the expansion\nand the labor market was very strong. The unemployment rate was at historically low levels, jobs were\ngrowing at a strong pace, and participation in the labor force was solid. After being too low for some\ntime, inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nOf course, the pandemic changed all that.\n\n\f2\nThe economy shut down in March 2020, and fiscal and monetary policymakers took aggressive actions to\nsupport households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow and limiting lasting damage to\nthe economy. When public health statistics began to improve in May 2020, many parts of the country\nbegan to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, and the economy began to reopen.\n\nBut it was not business as usual. The mandated shutdowns and the voluntary pullback in demand for\nhigh-contact services led consumers to shift spending from services to goods early in the pandemic. As\nhealth conditions improved and the economy reopened, demand surged and was supported by fiscal\ntransfers and accommodative monetary policy. Spending has been shifting back from goods to services,\nalthough the spending levels in both of these sectors are not yet back to their pre-pandemic trends. The\npandemic also led many people to leave the workforce, making it much more difficult for firms to find the\nworkers they needed. Remote work became much more common. This led to changes in the demand for\nhousing, and sales of new and existing single-family homes surged in 2020 and 2021. In addition, supply\nchains were disrupted, making it much more difficult for firms to keep up with demand for their products.\nThe changes in spending patterns, workforce participation, housing demand, and supply chains led to a\nsituation in which demand in both product markets and labor markets became out of balance with supply.\nThose imbalances occurred in an environment of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, which led to\na significant increase in inflation starting in the spring of 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February\n2022 added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and other commodities. In\n2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9 percent, depending on the\nmeasure.\n\nEconomic Developments\nIn response to the sharp rise in inflation, the Fed began tightening the stance of monetary policy in March\nof last year. Since then, the FOMC has raised the target range of the federal funds rate, its policy rate, by\n5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to\nroll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022. This balance-sheet reduction\n\n\f3\nis also firming the stance of monetary policy. The tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader\ntightening in financial conditions. Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and credit spreads have risen. Banks\nhave been tightening their credit standards, making credit less available to businesses and households, but\nthe contraction in credit has not been sharper than what one might expect given the rise in interest rates.\n\nAs this tighter monetary policy has transmitted to the broader economy, demand has begun to moderate.\nAt the same time, supply chain disruptions have improved. Our business contacts report that bottlenecks\nhave eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have shortened. Businesses have also told us that\nthey have learned how to better navigate supply issues. So demand and supply are adjusting and coming\ninto better balance.\n\nReal output growth has slowed from its robust pace in 2021, but the economy appears to have more\nunderlying momentum than was apparent at the end of last year. Consumers have been particularly\nresilient. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of GDP; it has been increasing at a solid pace\nthis year, supported by strong income growth and savings accumulated during the pandemic. Businesses\nhave moderated their spending on equipment and software as demand has slowed, but our business\ncontacts are more optimistic than they were at the beginning of the year that the economy will avoid a\nrecession. In the housing market, there is a longer-term shortage of available housing; so despite the\nsharp increase in mortgage rates over the past two years, with the 30-year rate now nearing 8 percent,\nhousing starts and sales of existing homes have stabilized and sales of new single-family homes are\nbeginning to pick up again. This overall performance suggests there is more underlying momentum in the\neconomy than we thought even just three months ago. In fact, FOMC participants’ projections of\neconomic growth this year were revised up at our recent meeting.1 Now, instead of projecting that growth\nwill be well below trend this year, the median projection is that growth will be a bit over 2 percent, which\n\nFour times a year, the FOMC summarizes Committee participants’ projections of output growth, the\nunemployment rate, inflation, and the associated appropriate policy path. For the September 2023 Summary of\nEconomic Projections, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20230920.htm.\n1\n\n\f4\nis somewhat above trend. Growth is expected to slow to below trend next year as tighter credit and\nfinancial conditions and waning fiscal support for households weigh on spending.\n\nLabor market conditions remain strong but are moderating, bringing labor demand and supply into better\nbalance. The unemployment rate in Ohio is 3.4 percent, near its historical low. But our business contacts\nsay they are seeing some easing in the labor market, with increases in job applications and in the number\nof candidates coming in for interviews. Only a small number of firms told us that they plan to lay off\nworkers this year. But many firms said they are slowing their hiring and fewer businesses are hoarding\nworkers since it has become easier to hire. We are seeing the same thing in the national job market. The\nnational unemployment rate is low, at 3.8 percent, with August’s rise in the unemployment rate mainly\nreflecting an increase in labor force participation. Job growth has slowed over the course of the year, with\npayroll gains averaging 150 thousand per month over the past three months compared to about 300\nthousand per month over the first three months of the year. The number of job openings has also been\ndeclining, but the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is 1.5, which is still above the 1.2 level\nseen in the strong labor market conditions in 2019.\n\nWage pressures are easing by some measures. Firms in our District tell us they are not having to adjust\ncompensation as frequently as in the last few years except for those workers with specialized skills and in\nsectors with shortages, including nursing. Expected wage increases among our contacts have moved\ndown, but at 4 percent, they remain higher than wage gains seen before the pandemic. In the nation, wage\ngrowth is still well above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation given current estimates of trend\nproductivity growth. While increased labor force participation by prime-age workers is helping to ease\nthe imbalance between labor demand and supply, it seems likely that labor demand conditions will also\nneed to ease further to bring wage growth down to levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. In the\nSeptember FOMC projections, the median participant expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next\nyear, but only a little, to 4.1 percent, which is consistent with a moderating but still solid labor market.\n\n\f5\nInflation\nThe Fed’s inflation goal is 2 percent, measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. Inflation has been running well above the Fed’s goal for\nmore than two years. The good news is that the overall economy remains relatively strong, and at the\nsame time, we are making discernable progress on the journey back to price stability. Inflation levels,\nboth the headline numbers, which include food and energy prices, and measures of underlying inflation,\nincluding the core, median, and trimmed-mean measures, have moved down from their peaks. Measured\nyear-over-year, total PCE inflation peaked at 7 percent in June of last year. As of this August, it has\nfallen to about 3-1/2 percent, despite the recent rise in oil prices. Other measures that strip out the\ncomponents with the most extreme price movements each month and which tend to give a better\nindication of the inflation trend are also improving. The Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research\nproduces and tracks a number of inflation indicators.2 The Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation\nmeasure peaked at just over 6 percent in March and is now down to 4-1/2 percent. And core PCE\ninflation, which omits food and energy prices, peaked at over 5-1/2 percent last year and moved down to\nunder 4 percent in August. The progress is even easier to see when you look at the price changes over\nshorter time horizons, such as three-month or six-month annualized inflation rates, and when you look at\ninflation in the prices of goods excluding food and energy.\n\nDespite the progress, inflation remains too high. We will need to see continued progress on inflation in\ngoods prices. Since consumers spend a larger share of their income on services, services have a higher\nweight in the inflation indices.3 So we also need to see more progress on inflation in the prices of\nservices. Inflation in housing services, measured by rents and the imputed rents for owner-occupied\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses\nof inflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/center-for-inflation-research).\n2\n\n3\n\nAbout 65 percent of the total consumption basket is core services compared to about 23 percent for core goods.\nThe rest of the basket comprises energy (4 percent) and food at home (8 percent). Housing services, a component of\ncore services, constitute about 15 percent of consumers’ total spending.\n\n\f6\nhousing, remains elevated but has begun to slow, reflecting moderating rent inflation in new leases. But\ninflation in core services excluding housing has shown little improvement over time.\n\nMoreover, the risks to the inflation forecast remain tilted to the upside. We have been helped on the\ninflation journey by the fact that despite high inflation rates, medium- and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent\ninflation. But oil prices are now increasing. There is the potential that they will pass through to other\ncore prices and stall progress. In addition, because gasoline prices are particularly salient for households\nthat have to fill up their cars or trucks once or twice a week, rising gasoline prices could begin to make\nconsumers think inflation will be rising again. If so, higher inflation could become embedded in people’s\nview of the economy and affect their behavior in ways inconsistent with price stability.4 In fact, when we\nasked our regional business contacts their expectations for inflation, the mean response was nearly 4\npercent for the year ahead and 3.2 percent for the next five years, considerably higher than our target.\n\nWhile we have not yet completed the journey back to price stability, there should be no doubt that the\nFOMC will get the job done. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation in a sustainable and\ntimely way, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation and that will likely require further\nmoderation of demand in both product and labor markets. This brings me to monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAt its recent meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Fed’s securities holdings. In determining the extent of\nadditional policy firming that may be appropriate, the FOMC will be assessing incoming economic and\n\n4\n\nCleveland Fed researchers find that households form their expectations of inflation based on their lifetime\nexperience of inflation, which means that acting to bring down inflation in a timely way to limit experience with\nhigh inflation will yield longer-term benefits.

Pedemonte, Hiroshi Toma, and Esteban Verdugo,\n“Aggregate Implications of Heterogeneous Inflation Expectations: The Role of Individual Experience,” Working\nPaper No. 23-04, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, January 2023. (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202304)\n\n\f7\nfinancial developments as well as the cumulative effects of the tightening done so far, since we know that\nmonetary policy affects the economy with a lag. The economic projections released by the FOMC in\nSeptember indicate that the median participant thinks another rate increase will be appropriate this year\nand that monetary policy will have to be held sufficiently restrictive for a while in order to get inflation\nback down to 2 percent.\n\nThis is consistent with my own reading of economic conditions, the outlook, and the risks to the outlook.\nAt this point, I suspect we may well need to raise the fed funds rate once more this year and then hold it\nthere for some time as we accumulate more information on economic developments and assess the effects\nof the tightening in financial conditions that has already occurred. But whether the fed funds rate needs to\ngo higher than its current level and for how long policy needs to remain restrictive will depend on how\nthe economy evolves relative to the outlook. There is considerable uncertainty around the outlook: for\nexample, the slowdown in the Chinese economy, the possibility of an extended UAW strike, and the\npotential for a government shutdown later this year all pose some risks around the outlook. So policy\ndecisions will need to be guided by actual progress on our dual mandate goals, in particular, whether the\ngood rate of progress we have seen on inflation over the past three months is sustained and whether labor\nmarket conditions remain healthy as they moderate. This will require us to carefully monitor economic,\nbanking, and financial market developments and to collect reports from our regional contacts, so that we\ncan set monetary policy in a way that balances the costs over time of over-tightening vs. under-tightening\nmonetary policy. Tightening too much would slow the economy more than necessary and entail higher\ncosts than needed to get inflation back to our goal. Tightening too little would allow high inflation to\npersist, with short- and long-run consequences, and would necessitate a much longer and more costly\njourney back to price stability.\n\nA Timely Return to Price Stability\nLet me conclude by explaining why I think it is important that we return the economy to price stability in\na timely way. I want to guard against becoming complacent with moderating inflation if the pace of that\n\n\f8\nmoderation implies it is going to take longer and longer to achieve the Fed’s 2 percent goal. Many\nforecasters have been underestimating the persistence of inflation since the beginning of this highinflation episode. FOMC participants have been pushing out the date of when inflation is expected to\nreturn to our goal. For example, the June 2021 median FOMC projection had core inflation moving down\nto 2.1 percent in 2022. A year later, the median projection had core inflation not reaching our goal until\nafter 2024, and now, according to the median projection in September, our 2 percent goal is not expected\nto be reached until 2026.\n\nWhen inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is moving up faster than\nwe would like and households and businesses have to pay those higher-than-desired prices. Since the first\nquarter of 2021, when inflation began to rise, inflation has been running at an annualized pace of nearly\n5-1/2 percent, while worker compensation (as measured by the employment cost index for private\nworkers’ compensation) has risen less, at an annualized rate of just over 4-1/2 percent. This means that\ndespite sizable increases in nominal wages, compensation adjusted for inflation hasn’t been keeping up\nwith the high rate of inflation over this episode. This is likely part of the reason Cleveland Fed surveys\nfind that people have a strong dislike of high inflation.5\n\nHigh inflation also imposes longer-run costs on the economy. It makes it harder to plan for the future,\nand it affects people’s decisions about getting an education or training for a new job and businesses’\ndecisions about whether to invest in new plants and equipment. These types of investments in human and\nphysical capital help determine our economy’s pace of innovation and productivity growth and therefore\nits potential growth rate and our longer-run standard of living. It is costly to our economy in both the\nshort and the long run to allow inflation to remain so high for so long.\n\n5\n\nSee Ina Hajdini, Edward S. Knotek II, John Leer, Mathieu Pedemonte, Robert W. Rich, and Raphael S. Schoenle,\n“Low Passthrough from Inflation Expectations to Income Growth Expectations: Why People Dislike Inflation,”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper No. 22-21R, March 2023 (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp202221r).\n\n\f9\nFinally, getting inflation back to 2 percent in a timely way puts the economy in a better position to\nweather the next shock, whenever it occurs. An economy that is at maximum employment and price\nstability is a stronger economy and one that is more resilient to shocks.\n\nSummary\nSo, in summary, the economy is on a good path. Demand is moderating and supply conditions are\nimproving. Labor market conditions remain strong, but the imbalance between labor demand and supply\nis narrowing and firms are finding it easier to find the workers they need. Progress is being made on\ninflation, but the level of inflation remains too high. We are likely near or possibly at the peak of the fed\nfunds tightening cycle. Now our task turns to ensuring that we keep monetary policy restrictive for long\nenough to be confident that inflation returns to our 2 percent goal in a timely way. We are not there yet,\nbut we will get there because price stability is critical for the long-run health of the labor market, the\noverall economy, and the stability of the financial system.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nClosing Remarks\nInflation: Drivers and Dynamics Conference 2023\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research and the European Central Bank\nFrankfurt am Main, Germany\nSeptember 1, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI appreciate the opportunity to present closing remarks at the Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics\nConference. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me start by thanking the organizers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the European\nCentral Bank for putting together such a strong program and the ECB for its hospitality. It has been a\nvery productive two days focused on frontier research on inflation. High inflation has been the major\nchallenge facing many central banks over the past two years. Returning the economy to price stability in\na sustainable and timely way has driven monetary policy decisions.\n\nThe U.S. Economy\nIn the U.S., since early last year, the Federal Reserve has been tightening the stance of monetary policy.\nWe have raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing\nthe size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan\nannounced in May 2022, which also helps to firm the stance of monetary policy. The tightening of\nmonetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions. Banks, which play an important\npart in monetary policy transmission, have been tightening their credit standards, making credit less\navailable to businesses and households. In addition, Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and credit spreads\nhave risen.\n\nThe monetary policy actions taken to date are helping to moderate demand in both product and labor\nmarkets and to alleviate some of the imbalances that have contributed to price pressures. Real output\ngrowth has slowed from its robust pace in 2021. Supply is also adjusting, with disruptions in supply\nchains having generally improved over time. In the labor market, some progress is being made in\nbringing demand and supply into better balance, but the job market is still strong. Job growth has slowed\nand job openings are down, but the unemployment rate is low, at 3.8 percent, and the vacancy-to-\n\n\f2\nunemployment ratio is still above its level during the strong labor market conditions in 2019. Labor\nsupply conditions are helping to rebalance the labor market; the labor market participation rate of\nworkers between the ages of 25 and 54 is above what it was before the pandemic.\n\nProgress continues to be made on inflation, with total PCE inflation down significantly from its\npeak. Underlying measures of inflation have also improved but less so. Despite high inflation rates,\nmedium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent\nwith the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. Although there has been some progress, inflation\nremains too high. The FOMC is committed to moving inflation down to 2 percent. The monetary policy\nquestions are whether the current level of the federal funds rate is sufficiently restrictive and how long\npolicy will need to remain restrictive to keep inflation moving down in a sustainable and timely way to\nour goal of 2 percent. Future policy decisions will be about managing the risks and the intertemporal\ncosts of over-tightening vs. under-tightening monetary policy. This assessment will require close\nmonitoring of economic, banking, and financial market developments and using all of that economic\nreconnaissance to determine whether the economy is evolving in line with the outlook or not. The\noutlook will need to be informed not only by the incoming data but also by our models of and\nunderstanding of inflation dynamics, which has been the topic of this conference.\n\nInflation Research\nThe period of high inflation has highlighted that there are many things we do understand about inflation.\nIn particular, when demand is outpacing supply, in an environment of very accommodative fiscal and\nmonetary policy – the conditions that characterized the economy in 2021 after the pandemic-induced\nshutdown – inflation will begin to rise and it will remain persistent until monetary policy is recalibrated to\nmoderate demand. Nonetheless, making such assessments in real time is difficult, especially when supply\nconditions are not stable, and forecasting inflation remains challenging. Indeed, FOMC participants\nunderestimated inflation for much of the high-inflation period. But policymakers are required to make\ndecisions based on the available, albeit limited information.\n\n\f3\n\nFurther research is needed on many facets of inflation and inflation dynamics. Since I am in a room full\nof researchers, I want to highlight some of the questions whose answers would help inform monetary\npolicy decisions. I took the same route when I presented keynote remarks at this conference in 2014, and\nit turns out that several of the questions I asked are still relevant.1 Don’t be too discouraged: Progress has\nbeen made in addressing them. But the period of high inflation and structural changes to the economy\nduring the pandemic and its aftermath have presented new questions and different takes on old questions.\nFurther research will be needed to answer these questions, furthering our understanding of inflation as an\naid to monetary policymaking.\n\nResearch Questions\nThe first question I asked in 2014 remains relevant: How can we best estimate the underlying trend in\ninflation?\n\nMonetary policymakers are charged with keeping inflation at its longer-run goal and monetary policy\naffects the economy with long and variable lags. Both factors mean that policymakers need to be able to\nforecast inflation over the medium and longer run. So they need a method to separate temporary changes\nfrom changes that are more persistent. When the economy reopened after the pandemic-induced\nshutdown, U.S. monetary policymakers attributed much of the increase in inflation to supply shocks that\nwere expected to be transitory, with inflation expected to return to its low pre-pandemic trend. It took\nsome time and repeated under-forecasts of inflation for policymakers to realize that the conditions for\nhigh inflation were in place and that aggressive policy action was required. Better understanding of the\nfactors that affect the medium-run inflation trend and ways to separate temporary changes from changes\nthat are more persistent would have helped to avoid the situation.\n\n1\n\nSee Mester (2014).\n\n\f4\nSeparating temporary from more persistent factors is challenging to do in real time, not only because\nsome of the inflation data get revised (including the PCE inflation measure that the Fed targets), but also\nbecause measured inflation reflects a combination of factors: idiosyncratic factors, broader but temporary\nmacroeconomic factors, and more persistent movements that affect the underlying inflation trend. One\napproach to estimating the underlying trend is to remove items that are often the sources of temporary\nmovements in inflation. The traditional core measures of inflation in the U.S. exclude the prices of food\nand energy because they are thought to be very volatile. Another approach recognizes that other\ncomponents can show more volatility than food and energy and derives measures that exclude\ncomponents with the most extreme movements each month. The median and trimmed-mean inflation\nrates are of this type.2 Some papers have shown that these types of measures can help to identify the\nunderlying trend and may outperform measures of core inflation in forecasting total (aka headline)\ninflation.3\n\nThere are also statistical models that try to isolate the trend from the noise and identify the cyclical and\nacyclical components of core inflation, where the cyclical components are, by definition, those associated\nwith labor market tightness.4\n\nThe literature has not discerned a best way to isolate the inflation trend; so, in practice, to forecast\ninflation, policymakers tend to look at all the measures of inflation, data on the real side of the economy,\nanecdotal reports from community and business contacts, and various models. Many of the forecasting\nmodels being used are informed by theoretical models of inflation dynamics.\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/center-for-inflation-research).\n3\n\nSee Bryan and Pike (1991), Bryan and Cecchetti (1993), and Bryan, Cecchetti, and Wiggins (1997) for CPI, and\nMeyer, Venkatu, and Zaman (2013), Meyer and Zaman (2019), and Smith (2004) for PCE. An exception is Crone,\net al. (2013), who find that headline PCE inflation can beat the core measure in predicting future PCE inflation.\n4\n\nSee Stock and Watson (2020) and Zaman (2019).\n\n\f5\n\nWhich brings me to my second question: Can we reconcile the actual pricing behavior of firms with\npredictions from the New Keynesian model, the workhorse inflation model used by many central bank\neconomists?\n\nIn recent years, a considerable amount of research has examined the real-world pricing behavior of firms\nand incorporated these facts into macroeconomic models.5 In fact, several papers presented at the\nconference explicitly incorporate micro data into macro models.6 I view this as a continuation of the\ndesirable approach of ensuring that our macro models are based on sound micro foundations.\n\nThe availability of data on individual prices has made advances possible. New surveys are also being\nused to better understand firms’ pricing behavior. For example, a survey conducted by researchers from\nthe Cleveland, Atlanta, and New York Feds found that firms’ prices are strongly influenced by their\nperceptions about demand for their products, a desire to maintain steady profit margins, and their labor\ncosts.7 The paper based on the survey, and included in the conference’s poster session, estimates that\ncost-price passthrough at firms was about 60 percent on average, but that there was considerable\nheterogeneity across the firms. Interestingly, although firms do tend to raise their prices when wages rise,\nother research from the Cleveland Fed indicates that consumers do not expect their wage growth to keep\nup with inflation. The researchers find that a 1 percentage point increase in inflation expectations causes\nexpectations of income growth to rise by only two-tenths of a percentage point; in other words,\nrespondents expect rising inflation to hurt their real income. This might help to explain why people\ndislike high inflation even when the labor market is strong.8\n\n5\n\nKlenow and Malin (2010) review the literature.\n\n6\n\nThese papers include Adam, Alexandrov, and Weber (2023), Gagliardone et al. (2023), Lan, Li, and Li (2023), and\nSara-Zaror (2021).\n7\n\nSee Dogra, et al. (2023).\n\n8\n\nSee Hajdini, et al. (2023).\n\n\f6\nResearch such as this can help to close the gap between the macro models we use to inform our monetary\npolicy decisions and the microeconomic data. In addition, research on actual pricing behavior can also\ninform the framework for setting monetary policy. For example, at first blush it might seem that having a\nhigher inflation target, all else equal, gives monetary policymakers more room to move the nominal\ninterest rate down before hitting the effective lower bound; they could then provide more stimulus to the\neconomy, if needed. But Cleveland Fed research suggests that all else would not be equal.9 In particular,\na higher inflation target would not provide as much policy room as one might expect; raising the inflation\ntarget would be subject to the Lucas critique. With higher steady-state inflation, firms would change their\nprice-setting behavior and adjust their prices more frequently. Because monetary policy’s ability to affect\nreal activity depends on the degree of price stickiness, a higher inflation target would make monetary\npolicy less effective because firms would be changing their prices more frequently. The research’s\nquantitative result suggests that to increase policy space by 2 percentage points, instead of increasing the\ninflation target from 2 percent to 4 percent, one would need to increase the target to 5 percent. If you add\nto this the costs of having to change posted prices more often, the higher level of relative price distortions\nbecause everything is not indexed, higher shoe-leather costs from searching for the lowest prices, and the\nhigher inflation volatility associated with higher inflation, the benefits of setting a higher inflation target\nare not compelling.\n\nThe Fed’s inflation target is 2 percent, and we are committed to returning inflation to 2 percent in a\nsustainable and timely way. This explicit target was first established in the FOMC’s statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy in January 2012, and it has been reaffirmed every year since then.\nThe 2 percent target was taken as given when the FOMC undertook its review of the monetary policy\nframework in 2019. The revised statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which\nreflects the outcome of the review, recognizes the importance of keeping inflation expectations well-\n\n9\n\nSee L’Huillier and Schoenle (2023).\n\n\f7\nanchored at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.10 And by “well-anchored” I mean longer-term\ninflation expectations that are insensitive to data.\n\nOne of the big lessons from the 1970s is that it is much more difficult and costly to bring inflation down\nonce it has become embedded in the economy, that is, once businesses and households expect inflation to\nremain elevated and those expectations influence their savings and investment decisions and price-setting\nand wage-setting behavior. Indeed, inflation expectations have been a central factor in models of\ninflationary dynamics since the 1960s and 1970s.11 The theory indicates that well-anchored longer-term\ninflation expectations can help to mitigate the pull of resource gaps on inflation, and therefore, the\ncyclical movements in interest rates that policymakers induce to maintain price stability need not be as\nlarge as when inflation expectations are not well-anchored.\n\nPutting the theory into practice brings me to my third question: For the purposes of setting monetary\npolicy, how should inflation expectations be measured and over what time horizon?\n\nOne difficulty in moving from theory to practice is that while the models talk about “inflation\nexpectations,” these expectations are not directly observable. So policymakers look at a number of\nmeasures that differ by type of agent and time horizon. These include measures based on surveys of\nconsumers, businesses, and professional forecasters; measures derived from financial markets; and\ncomposite indices that combine various measures. A clear signal is not always forthcoming because the\ninflation expectations of different groups of agents can behave differently from one another. Even within\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, revised in 2020 and reaffirmed since\nthen, says that the Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well-anchored at 2 percent\ncontribute to achieving its monetary policy goals. See Federal Open Market Committee (2023).\n10\n\n11\n\nSee Phelps (1967), Friedman (1968), and Lucas (1972). For further discussion see Mester (2022a,b).\n\n\f8\ngroups there can be variation, and the literature has not firmly established whose expectations are most\nimportant for inflation dynamics.12\n\nHouseholds may find it challenging to answer questions about the economic concept of inflation. Recent\nCleveland Fed research found that when consumers are asked about what they think inflation will be in\nthe future for the various categories of consumer spending, their answers do not aggregate up using any\nplausible weighting scheme to what they expect overall inflation will be.13 Aggregated inflation\nexpectations over categories tend to be lower than expectations of overall inflation, and the bottom-up\naggregated expectations explain a greater share of planned consumer spending. This inconsistency\nreinforces the approach taken by policymakers to look at various measures of inflation expectations.\n\nIndeed, several new measures are increasing our understanding of inflation expectations. Researchers at\nthe Cleveland Fed have developed a measure of inflation expectations that does not require the\nrespondents to understand the economic concept of aggregate inflation. The Cleveland Fed’s indirect\nconsumer inflation expectations (ICIE) measure, which started in 2021, is based on a nationwide survey\nwith more than 10,000 responses and is updated on a weekly basis. Instead of asking consumers directly\nabout overall inflation, the survey asks consumers how they expect the prices of the things they buy to\nchange over the next 12 months and how much their incomes would have to change for them to be able to\nafford the same consumption basket and be equally well-off.14 According to this measure, women’s\ninflation expectations have tended to run higher than those of men, and older respondents and more\neducated respondents also have reported higher inflation expectations than their counterparts.\n\n12\n\nCandia, Coibion, and Gorodnichenko (2021) find that the mean inflation forecasts of firms often deviate\nsignificantly from those of professional forecasters and households.\n13\n14\n\nSee Dietrich, et al. (2022).\n\nThe ICIE series is available on the Central Bank Research Association (CEBRA) website at\nhttps://cebra.org/indirect-consumer-inflation-expectations/. For background on the survey and results using the\nsurvey, see Hajdini, et al. (2022a,b).\n\n\f9\nLess information has been available on firms’ inflation expectations, even though firms are the price\nsetters. But new data series are being developed. For example, the Cleveland Fed has begun publishing\nthe Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE), a nationally representative, quarterly survey of\nCEOs and other top business executives, which was started by academics in 2018.15 The survey data\nindicate that the year-ahead inflation expectations of these business executives rose as inflation increased\nin 2021 and 2022. Their expectations began to decline in 2023 but remain elevated at 4.3 percent as of\nJuly. Perhaps more troubling is that when respondents were asked in April what they thought the Fed’s\ninflation target was, the mean response was 3.1 percent. This is higher than our target of 2 percent and\nalso nearly a percentage point above the mean response before the pandemic.\n\nMonetary policymakers typically focus on medium- to longer-term inflation expectations because this is\nthe time horizon over which monetary policy can be expected to affect the economy and is more\nreflective of consumers’ perceptions of the Fed’s commitment and ability to return the economy to price\nstability. Ample research shows that changes in the prices of particular salient items, including gasoline\nand food, which are independent of monetary policy, can have an outsized effect on households’ shorterrun inflation expectations.16 However, recent research by Cleveland Fed economists indicates that\npolicymakers should not ignore persistently elevated levels of shorter-term inflation expectations and\nfocus only on longer-term expectations. The researchers find persistent differences in inflation\nexpectations across consumers of different ages and that households form their expectations of inflation\nbased on their lifetime experience of inflation.17 When this mechanism is incorporated into a\nconventional New Keynesian model, inflation shocks are more persistent than otherwise, and the optimal\nresponse is for monetary policy to tighten when short-run inflation expectations rise even if longer-run\n\nThe Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE) was created by Professors Olivier Coibion and Yuriy\nGorodnichenko; it is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/survey-of-firms-inflation-expectations. For background on the\nsurvey, see Garciga et al. (2023).\n15\n\n16\n\nFor the effect of salient prices on inflation expectations, see Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), Cavallo, Cruces,\nand Perez-Truglia (2017), D’Acunto, et al. (2021), and Campos, McMain, and Pedemonte (2022).\n17\n\nSee Pedemonte, Toma, and Verdugo (2023).\n\n\f10\nexpectations are stable. Doing so helps to limit the experience households have with high inflation, which\nhelps to keep inflation expectations anchored in the future.\n\nBetter understanding of how households and firms form their inflation expectations will help inform how\nmonetary policymakers should respond when inflation deviates from the target. This brings me to my\nfourth and final question: How should monetary policymakers respond to supply shocks?\n\nThe current episode of high inflation has been a challenging one. In the U.S., inflation began rising in the\nspring of 2021. A sequence of supply shocks, driven first by the pandemic and then the war in Ukraine\ncontributed to the high inflation. These supply shocks were concentrated in the goods sector, which was\nalready seeing a surge in demand as consumers shifted spending from services to goods during the\npandemic-induced shutdown and when they continued to take social distancing measures once the\neconomy reopened. The supply shocks exacerbated the imbalances between demand and supply, which,\nin an environment of very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, led to a significant and persistent\nincrease in inflation.\n\nThe episode has called into question the conventional view that monetary policy should always look\nthrough supply shocks. The thinking is that supply shocks tend to be transitory, and while they raise the\nprice level for a time, they do not lead to a persistent increase in inflation or inflation expectations.\nMoreover, since monetary policy acts with a lag, if policymakers were to react to a transitory supply\nshock, it would be counterproductive, affecting the economy after the supply shock had dissipated. But to\nthe extent that supply shocks are more persistent or there is a sequence of supply shocks, this thinking\nneed not apply because such shocks can threaten the stability of inflation expectations and this would\nrequire policy action. Indeed, when inflation expectations are not firmly anchored, if monetary policy\n\n\f11\nfails to react in an appropriate way, what starts out as a potentially temporary shock could lead to more\npersistent effects on inflation.18\n\nThis brings up the possibility that monetary policy may want to react differently depending on the nature\nof the shock that has led to a rise in inflation, with the reaction dependent on the size and persistence of\nthe shock, because different shocks have different implications for inflation expectations. An interesting\npaper presented at the conference suggests that in an environment where prices are more flexible than\nwages and agents have bounded rationality rather than fully rational expectations with respect to inflation,\npolicy may want to respond more aggressively to supply shocks when inflation is already high and less\naggressively when inflation is low.19 This can lead policymakers to first look through supply shocks and\nthen respond more aggressively as inflation moves up, which arguably characterizes the current highinflation episode. However, other interesting research shows that optimal monetary policy responses\ndepend critically on how inflation expectations are formed and how well they are anchored. In one\nmodel, when expectations differ from rational expectations and are not well-anchored, policymakers are\nbetter off responding earlier to signs that inflation is rising rather than delaying and only then responding\naggressively.20 The implication is that when there is uncertainty, policymakers should overestimate the\ndegree of persistence of inflation shocks rather than underestimate it.\n\nMore research on the timing and magnitude of the optimal monetary policy response in the face of\ndifferent types of shocks and when inflation expectations deviate from rational expectations would be\nhelpful to policymakers.\n\n18\n\nReis (2021) and Walsh (2022) discuss the importance of anchored inflation expectations, drawing on the\nexperience of the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s.\n19\n\nSee Beaudry, Carter, and Lahiri (2022).\n\n20\n\nSee Walsh (2022)\n\n\f12\nConclusion\nTo conclude, let me again thank the organizers at the European Central Bank and at the Cleveland Fed for\nputting together such a strong conference program. When we started the Cleveland Fed’s Center for\nInflation Research in December 2018, some people raised an eyebrow. They questioned the center’s\nfocus because inflation had been so benign for quite some time. It turned out to be precisely the right\ntime to further the research agenda on inflation. Maintaining price stability is the responsibility of the\ncentral bank and only the central bank can deliver on this goal over time. While considerable progress\nhas been made on developing inflation models and measures that can better inform monetary\npolicymaking, we still have much to learn about inflation dynamics.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSummer Institute 2023\nMacro, Money, and Financial Frictions\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\nCambridge, MA\nJuly 12, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to update you on the FedNow® Service, the Federal Reserve’s new\ninstant payments service. When the FedNow Service begins to roll out later this month, it will be the first\nnew Fed payments rail in 50 years. Before I continue, I note that the views I present will be my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\nFigure 1. The Fed’s Role in Payments\nThe payment system is a crucial part of the infrastructure of the U.S., and a well-functioning and secure\npayment system is vital for a sound economy. The Federal Reserve System has responsibility for\nfostering a safe, efficient, and widely accessible payments infrastructure, and the Reserve Banks have\nprovided payments and settlement services alongside the private sector for more than 100 years. The Fed\nhas this responsibility because as the country’s central bank, it can uniquely provide interbank settlement\nwithout introducing liquidity or credit risks. Settlement refers to the debiting and crediting of accounts to\ntransfer funds for a payment. Settlement is the foundation for most payment systems, allowing the\nsender’s depository institution to settle a payment by moving funds to the receiver’s depository\ninstitution. The Fed’s payment services include check processing, automated clearinghouse (ACH)\nservices, and wire transfers. In addition to settlement, these services include clearing, which refers to the\nexchange of information about a payment.\n\nThe Fed offers its payment services on behalf of the public in competition with and in support of similar\nservices provided by the private sector. Unlike central banks in other countries, the Fed has not been\ngiven complete regulatory or supervisory authority over the U.S. payment system. But by offering\npayment services, the Fed has been able to promote accessibility, safety, efficiency, and innovation in the\npayment system.\n\n\f2\nFigure 2. Demand for faster digital payments: Value of noncash payments\nOne of those innovations has been technology, which has been driving the increased use of electronic\npayments. Because the current payment system works well, most people have spent little time thinking\nabout the backbone that makes these payments possible and ensures that the payment system is reliable\nand secure. But with new technologies and new service providers, more people are seeking new ways to\nexecute transactions and they want to execute them much faster.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Federal Reserve Payments Study, the value of noncash payments has accelerated\nsignificantly over time. These payments grew at an annualized rate of 9.5 percent between 2018 and\n2021, reaching a value of $128.5 trillion in 2021.1 In 2021 about 205 billion noncash transactions were\nmade in the U.S., over 600 payments for every American.2 According to a Fed survey, in 2022 nearly 75\npercent of consumers used mobile payment devices to send or receive payments, and usage spanned\nconsumers of all ages.3 This is a considerable increase from 2013, when only 10 percent of consumers\nhad made a mobile payment. Over half of the consumers surveyed in 2022 are using nonbank mobile\napps to make faster payments, and 38 percent are using digital wallets.4\n\nFigure 3. Demand for faster digital payments: Share of retail sales made electronically\nThe share of retail sales made electronically jumped during the pandemic, but this share began increasing\nmuch earlier. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales accounted for about 6 percent of\ntotal U.S. retail sales in 2013. That share has now risen to 15 percent.5 Consumers have become more\n\n1\n\nNoncash payments include debit and credit card transactions, checks, and direct deposit and automatic payment\ntransactions that go through the automated clearinghouse system. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2023a).\n2\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023a).\n\n3\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2023).\n\n4\n\nIn the survey, faster payments include instant payment services, same-day ACH, push to card, and digital wallet\napps. See FedPayments Improvement (2023).\nSee U.S. Census Bureau (2023). In this report, e-commerce sales are defined as “sales of goods and services where\nthe buyer places an order, or the price and terms of the sale are negotiated over an Internet, mobile device (M5\n\n\f3\ncomfortable making online payments, but they also want up-to-the minute information on their payments\nand accounts, including information on when their payments have cleared and what their account balance\nis in real time. Businesses are also demanding quicker access to their funds and the ability to automate\ntheir accounting processes.\n\nThis demand is being met by private-sector services and providers, including banks and fintech\ncompanies, that are offering consumers and businesses more modern and convenient methods for making\npayments. But while it appears that the payments are moving in real time, in most cases, the actual\nclearing and settlement of payment instructions on both sides of these transactions take place through the\ntraditional system: transactions are settled in periodic batches, processed one or more days later, and\navailable only during regular banking hours. Of course, this creates some risk because banks might\nchoose to make final funds available to the customer before receiving the covering funds from the payer’s\nbank.\n\nFigure 4. The FedNow® Service\nAfter several years of planning and consulting with the payment industry and other stakeholders, in 2019,\nthe Fed announced it was developing the FedNow® Service.6 FedNow will provide the infrastructure for\ninstant payments, linking banks and credit unions of all sizes. FedNow will not be offered directly to\nindividuals and businesses, but it will allow the customers of financial institutions offering the service to\nsend and receive payments within seconds around the clock on every day of the year and to get full access\nto those funds immediately, with instant finality of payment. The service is being designed as a flexible\nand neutral cloud-based platform, which is unique among central bank instant payment services, and that\n\ncommerce), extranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) network, electronic mail, or other comparable online\nsystem. Payment may or may not be made online.”\n6\n\nMester (2022) discusses the path that led to the decision to move forward with FedNow. The FedNow website and\nthe FedNow blog contain additional information on the new service.\n\n\f4\ndesign will make it easier to reach scalability and geographic resiliency. Cloud-based does not mean it is\ndesigned using distributed ledger technology. Instead, the FedNow Service settles payments in Federal\nReserve Bank master accounts, so it relies on a centralized ledger.\n\nThe FedNow Service is expected to yield several economic benefits for individuals and businesses and\nthese benefits were taken into account when deciding to move ahead with the service. FedNow will\nprovide the public with more flexibility to manage their money and to make time-sensitive payments\nwhenever needed. This may be especially beneficial for households and businesses that are less liquid,\nhelping them avoid late fees when making payments. It could help individuals who aren’t on a regular\npayroll, such as gig workers, get faster access to their wages. It could help the federal government\ndisburse support payments faster during emergencies. It is expected to provide the public benefit of\nincreased resiliency by offering an alternative payments rail. FedNow is also expected to increase access\nto instant payments for more people because the country’s more than 10,000 banks and credit unions of\nall sizes will be able to use their existing electronic connections to the Fed and their existing Fed\nsettlement accounts to process real-time retail payments for consumers and businesses. Because the\nplatform is flexible and neutral, the FedNow instant payments rail is also expected to spur additional\ninnovations from banks, payment processors, and other providers of payment services to meet the specific\nneeds of their customers.\n\nFedNow will operate alongside the private sector’s instant payments service, The Clearing House’s RealTime Payments (RTP®) service. This competition is expected to help promote efficiency in instant\npayments. Consistent with its public-service mission, in addition to FedNow, the Fed is providing direct\nsupport for the development of private-sector faster payments. For example, in 2017, the Board of\nGovernors approved final guidelines for evaluating requests for joint accounts at the Reserve Banks.7\n\n7\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017).\n\n\f5\nThese joint accounts facilitate the settlement of payments between and among the banks that participate in\nthe private sector’s instant payments service. The Fed has also worked to expand the operating hours of\nits current ACH and funds systems.\n\nFigure 5. Features included in the FedNow Service at rollout\nThe FedNow Service is being tested and certified with a diverse group of first adopters that were part of\nthe pre-launch pilot program; the group includes financial institutions, processors, service providers, and\nthe U.S. Treasury.8\n\nAt rollout, the FedNow Service will include features that focus on clearing and settlement.9 At its most\nbasic level, the FedNow platform provides interbank settlement that enables funds to be transferred from\na payment sender’s bank account to a receiver’s bank account immediately and at any time. No\nprefunding is required. The limit per customer credit transaction will be $500,000, but the initial setting\nof the transaction limit will be $100,000. A participating institution will be able to adjust that default\nlimit down or up, to a maximum of $500,000, depending on its preferences. Participants will be able to\ndecide whether they want to both receive and send payments or whether they want to only receive\npayments. And they will be able to specify a list of suspicious accounts to and from which they neither\nwant to send or receive payments.\n\nAlso included at the rollout will be request-for-payment functionality that will support bill payment; the\nability to include information about a payment along with the payment, e.g., invoice information; and\ncertain fraud-mitigation tools.\n\n8\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023b).\n\n9\n\nSee Federal Reserve Financial Services, “FedNow Service,” Product Sheet.\n\n\f6\nWhen the FedNow Service rolls out, the Fed will also offer liquidity management transfers that will allow\nfinancial institutions to move funds between their Federal Reserve accounts during hours when the\ntraditional payment and settlement services and the discount window are not open.10 These transfers will\nsupport both FedNow and private-sector real-time settlement.\n\nThe Fed intends to build in more features as the FedNow Service develops and matures.\n\nFigure 6. Steps in a FedNow transaction\nFinancial institutions will be able to connect to the service either directly, via their core processors, or\nthrough a technology service provider. Let me walk you through a simple FedNow transaction in which\nboth sending and receiving banks are directly connected to the service.\n\nFirst, an individual or business uses an end-user interface to initiate a payment with their financial\ninstitution. The sender’s bank validates the payment according to its own internal processes and\nrequirements.\n\nSecond, the sender’s bank submits the payment message to the FedNow Service.\n\nThird, the FedNow Service validates the payment message, checking to see that it meets the proper format\nspecifications and complies with applicable controls.\n\n10\n\nLiquidity management transfers will be available from 7 pm to 7 am Eastern time on weekdays, and 24 hours per\nday on weekends and holidays. The transaction value limit will be $2.5 million, although financial institutions can\nset their send limit at a lower level if they prefer. A financial institution’s cumulative daily send limit will be $10\nmillion. For more information on liquidity management and account balance reporting, see Federal Reserve\nFinancial Services (2021) and Federal Reserve Financial Services.\n\n\f7\nFourth, the FedNow Service sends the payment information to the receiver’s financial institution and asks\nthat bank to confirm that it intends to accept the payment message. It can accept, or reject, or accept\nwithout posting, which means some of the pre-checks of the transaction are pending or delayed. In this\nstep, the receiver bank will want to verify that it maintains an account for the recipient identified in the\ncontents of the payment message.\n\nFifth, if the payment is accepted, the receiving bank sends notification to the FedNow Service confirming\nthat it intends to accept the payment message.11\n\nSixth, the FedNow Service settles the payment, debiting and crediting the designated master accounts of\nthe sender and receiver banks, respectively.\n\nAll of this is expected to be completed within a few seconds. (The Fed has set an upper limit of 20\nseconds to give banks clarity on the maximum time allowed for a payment to either settle or be rejected.)\n\nFinally, to complete the process, the FedNow Service sends an advice to the receiver bank and an\nacknowledgement to the sender bank, executing the payment order and notifying each that the Federal\nReserve Banks have settled the payment. The receiving financial institution makes funds immediately\navailable to the recipient.\n\nFigure 7. Next steps on the agenda\nThe rollout of the FedNow Service is only the beginning of the journey. Enhancements will be made to\nthe FedNow Service over time to support safety, resiliency, and innovation. There are several items on\n\n11\n\nSteps 4 and 5 are intended to reduce the number of misdirected payments and resulting exception cases that can\noccur in high-volume systems.\n\n\f8\nthe agenda after the official rollout. Some of these are near- to medium-term efforts and others longerterm considerations. So let me conclude with a few of these.\n\nGrowing the number of financial institutions using the FedNow Service\nSince the value of a payment service ultimately depends on the number of users, the Fed will be focused\non growing the number of institutions that use the FedNow Service for sending and receiving payments.\nThe U.S. does not have a mandate that financial institutions offer the service, unlike other countries,\nincluding Brazil, which mandated that banks offer its Pix instant payments service. In addition, we have a\ncomplex financial industry, with a variety of different types and sizes of institutions. For many financial\ninstitutions, getting ready to use FedNow will take some investment. Some organizations will need to\nupgrade older payment infrastructures, accounting procedures, and other back-office processes to\naccommodate the expanded 24×7 operating hours. But these investments will allow them to offer this\nnew instant payment service to customers, who are increasingly demanding faster payments.\n\nEducating the public and financial institutions: Fraud mitigation and depositor runs\nGrowing the network will also require increasing public awareness so that it understands not only the\nbenefits of instant payments but also the implications of fast finality of payments. Financial institutions\nthat participate in FedNow, as in other payment services, serve as a primary line of defense in protecting\ntheir customers against fraud. The initial release of the FedNow Service will include features to help\nbanks manage fraud risk and mitigate fraud losses. It will include tools that allow participants to reject\npayments to and from accounts they have designated as suspicious and to put limits on the amount of the\ntransaction. In addition, there will be tools that help a financial institution investigate erroneous or\nsuspected fraudulent transactions. Combating fraud is a dynamic endeavor, so the service will be offering\nmore fraud-prevention tools over time.\n\n\f9\nEducating financial institutions about the value of the service and all tools offered within the service is\nalso on the agenda. For example, in the aftermath of the bank closures earlier this year, some have raised\nconcerns that the ability to move money quickly at all times of the day and night might exacerbate a bank\nrun. It is true that FedNow and other payment services can be used to move money; however, banks have\ntools they could use to mitigate large outflows of deposits. For example, within FedNow they could\nlower their transaction limit, restrict access to the service to certain non-wholesale customers, or change\nto “receive payments only” status. They could also design their own controls to limit the total volume of\ntransfers to manage their risks while serving their customers. Future releases of the FedNow Service may\nallow configurable transaction limits by customer type, if such limits are deemed useful. In addition to a\nbank being able to borrow from the Fed during the hours the discount window is open, a bank could use\nliquidity management transfers to replenish its master account balance from private funding sources on\nthe weekend when the discount window is not accessible, which would help to mitigate the effects of\ndeposit outflows on the health of the bank.\n\nInteroperability\nAnother issue on the agenda is interoperability. The Fed is committed to working toward interoperability\nbetween instant payment systems. FedNow is designed on the ISO 20022 standard, which is already used\nby RTP and other payment systems globally, and that will help support interoperability through routing.\nPayment industry stakeholders have told us they want a real-time payment capability so that any payer\ncan reach any payee, regardless of which faster payment system their banks use. Such interoperability\nhas not always been a given in the U.S.; it took decades to achieve that for ACH and credit and debit\ncards and no doubt it will be a challenge for instant payments. But the Fed continues to engage with RTP\nto discuss how best to accomplish this goal.\n\n\f10\nPerson-to-person and cross-border payments\nFinancial institutions would like to be able to use FedNow to offer person-to-person (P2P) payment\nservices whereby customers can originate a payment using an alias such as an email address or phone\nnumber. The initial release of FedNow will not include a directory service that would be needed for P2P\npayments. Instead, a bank could use a private-sector directory to access routing information in order to\ntransmit alias-based payments on FedNow. The Fed is looking at various approaches to provide aliasbased payments as a way to enhance the FedNow Service in the future.\n\nAnother use case is cross-border payments. There continue to be frictions in moving retail payments\nacross borders. FedNow is for domestic payments, but it has the potential to be used for cross-border\npayments in the future if legal, policy, and operational challenges can be solved.\n\nPayment rails\nA longer-run issue has to do with the payment rails themselves. It seems likely that over time those\npayments that are time-sensitive will shift from the traditional payment rails of check, ACH, and wire to\nthe instant payment rails of FedNow and RTP. The timing and extent of such movements across payment\nrails are difficult to predict and will be affected by the pricing of payments services by market\nparticipants, as well as other factors. In thinking about the evolution of the payment rails, it may seem\nmore efficient to have fewer rails for smaller-transaction payments, but those efficiencies need to be\nbalanced with ensuring that the payment system has sufficient redundancy to remain resilient.\n\nConclusion\nA well-functioning and secure payment system is vital to our economy. As we modernize the payment\nsystem, it is important to remember that the foundation of a successful payment system is the public’s\nconfidence in it. The public needs to be confident that the system will be: available whenever the\ncustomer needs it; efficient at routing and settling payments; resilient against cyberattacks and fraudulent\n\n\f11\nactors; and reliable without the public having to know the intricacies of the infrastructure behind it. As\nthe payment system evolves, the Fed, the industry, and end users will need to continue to collaborate to\nensure that the modern payment system lives up to its promise of being efficient, safe, resilient, and\navailable to all. That’s the best way to maintain the confidence of the public the Fed serves.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidelines for Evaluating Joint Account Requests,” 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/joint_requests.htm)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The Federal Reserve Payments Study: 2022 Triennial Initial\nData Release,” April 21, 2023a.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fr-payments-study.htm)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Names Organizations Certified as Ready for\nFedNow® Service,” press release, June 29, 2023b.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230629a.htm)\nFedNow blog.\n(https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/blog)\nFedNow website.\n(https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow)\nFedPayments Improvement, “Faster Mobile Payments Go Mainstream as Gen X Usage Catches Up to Millenials,”\nFederal Reserve Market Readiness Brief, May 18, 2023.\n(https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/051823-consumer-research-brief-1.pdf)\nFederal Reserve Financial Services, “FedNow Features: Settlement, Reporting, and Liquidity Management,”\nFedNow blog, July 9, 2021.\n(https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/blog/fednow-features-settlement-reporting-liquiditymanagement.html)\nFederal Reserve Financial Services, “FedNow Service Guide to Liquidity Management Transfers.”\n(https://explore.fednow.org/resources?page=11&id=84&resourceRole=fi&resourceTitle=guide-to-liquiditymanagement-transfers)\nFederal Reserve Financial Services, “FedNow Service,” Product Sheet.\n(https://www.frbservices.org/binaries/content/assets/crsocms/financial-services/fednow/fednow-product-sheet.pdf)\nMester, Loretta J., “An Update on the Federal Reserve’s Efforts to Modernize the Payment System,” 2022 Chicago\nPayments Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, October 4, 2022.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/collections/speeches/2022/sp-20221004-an-update-on-the-federal-reserves-efforts-tomodernize-the-payment-system)\nU.S. Census Bureau, “Quarterly Retail E-Commerce Sales Report,” May 18, 2023.\n(https://www.census.gov/retail/ecommerce.html)\n\n\fFigures for\n“An Update on the Federal Reserve’s Instant Payments Service:\nFedNow®”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2023 UC San Diego Economics Roundtable\nSan Diego, CA\n(via videoconference)\nJuly 10, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Jim Hamilton and the University of California San Diego for inviting me to speak today. I am\nlooking forward to your questions because hearing what is on your minds helps me hone my own views\nabout the economy. But let me start with a review of economic developments and my perspectives on\nmonetary policy. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n[Figure 1. Federal funds rate and SLOOS]\nSince early last year, the Federal Reserve has been tightening the stance of monetary policy. We have\nraised the target range of the federal funds rate by 5 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced\nin May 2022, which also helps to firm the stance of monetary policy. At its meeting last month, the\nFOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5 to 5-1/4 percent to allow the\nCommittee time to assess incoming economic information and the cumulative effects of the tightening\ndone so far. The tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions.\nBanks have been tightening their credit standards, making credit less available to businesses and\nhouseholds, and Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and credit spreads have risen.\n\nThe FOMC has taken these policy actions to combat high inflation, which is well above our policy goal of\n2 percent. While higher interest rates have made it harder for some households and businesses to borrow,\nhigh inflation is a hardship for everyone. In fact, at our recent Fed Listens1 event, we heard from many\ncommunity development practitioners that lower-income workers are now able to find jobs paying\n\n1\n\nThe Fed Listens initiative began in 2019. It includes a series of events held across the country with a wide variety\nof participants to provide Fed policymakers with information on how monetary policy affects people in their daily\nlives. Our recent Fed Listens event was held with Federal Reserve Governor Miki Bowman in Cleveland as part of\nthe Cleveland Fed’s Policy Summit, a conference that focuses on issues affecting low- and moderate-income\ncommunities and households. More information on the Fed Listens initiative is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/fedlistens.htm. More information on the Policy Summit is available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/events/policy-summit/2023/ev-20230621-policy-summit-2023.\n\n\f2\nconsiderably more than what they earned before the pandemic, but those higher wages haven’t kept up\nwith inflation. These workers are having to make some hard choices to make ends meet.\n\nHigh inflation also imposes longer-run costs on the economy. It makes it harder to plan for the future,\naffecting people’s decisions about getting an education or training for a new job, and businesses’\ndecisions about whether to invest in new plants and equipment. These types of investments in human and\nphysical capital help determine our economy’s pace of innovation and productivity growth and therefore\nits potential growth rate and our longer-run standard of living. It is costly to our economy in both the\nshort and the long run to allow inflation to remain so high for so long. And the Fed is committed to\nreturning the economy to price stability.\n\nThe monetary policy question is whether the current level of the federal funds rate is sufficiently\nrestrictive to keep inflation moving down in a sustainable and timely way to our goal of 2 percent. To\nassess that, let’s review how the economy got to where it is today and the progress that’s been made.\n\nEconomic Developments\nAt the start of 2020, before the pandemic, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. It was the 11th\nyear of the expansion, and things looked quite good from the perspective of our monetary policy goals.\nThe unemployment rate was at historically low levels, employment growth was strong, participation in\nthe labor force was solid, and inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nBut the pandemic changed all of that. The economy shut down in March 2020. Fiscal and monetary\npolicymakers took aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit\ncontinued to flow, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. When public health statistics began to\nimprove in May 2020, many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions,\nand the economy began to reopen. But spending patterns had changed, people had left the work force,\nand supply chains were disrupted. These forces are still affecting the economy today. The imbalances\n\n\f3\nbetween demand and supply, in an environment of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, led to an\nincrease in inflation starting in the spring of 2021.\n\n[Figure 2. GDP growth and sectors]\nThe good news is that the monetary policy actions taken to date are helping to moderate demand and\nalleviate some of the imbalances that have contributed to price pressures. Real GDP grew at a belowtrend pace of less than 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021.\nThe slowdown in activity is most apparent in interest-rate sensitive sectors, including housing,\nmanufacturing, and business investment. For example, some business contacts in Cleveland’s Federal\nReserve District, which includes the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West\nVirginia, tell us that they are pulling back on construction projects due to high interest rates and general\neconomic uncertainty.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, disruptions in supply chains have generally improved. Our contacts\nreport that bottlenecks have eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have shortened.\nBusinesses also say that over time they have learned how to better navigate supply issues. This is\nwelcome news because price pressures can be alleviated through both further moderation in demand and\nfurther improvement in supply.\n\nIn many respects the economy has been more resilient than many people were anticipating late last year.\nAt that point, many of our business contacts were telling us they expected the economy to enter a\nrecession this year. Now, most think there won’t be a recession this year, and many think that, even if\ndemand slows down some more, a recession will be avoided or will be very mild.\n\nThe economic outlook has been difficult to pin down partly because the pandemic and the responses to it\nfrom households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers are still affecting the economy. For\nexample, consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of GDP, has been particularly resilient. It\n\n\f4\nhas been growing at an annualized pace of about 3-1/2 percent so far this year, a pickup from last year’s\npace. Spending has been supported by strong income growth and the savings accumulated during the\npandemic.\n\n[Figure 3. Goods and services spending]\nThe pandemic also affected the pattern of spending. The mandated shutdowns and the voluntary pullback\nin demand for high-contact services led to a shift in spending from services to goods early in the\npandemic. When the economy reopened, demand surged and was supported by fiscal transfers and\naccommodative monetary policy. Since early 2021, spending has been shifting back from goods to\nservices, but neither spending level is back to its pre-pandemic trend. Adjusted for inflation, spending on\ngoods remains elevated and spending on services remains below its trend level.\n\n[Figure 4. Housing starts and sales]\nHousing has also behaved somewhat differently than might have been expected. Many people wanted to\nchange their living arrangements early in the pandemic, and sales of new and existing single-family\nhomes surged in 2020 and 2021. In response, new home construction also moved up sharply. Last year,\nhigher mortgage rates led to a sharp decline in housing starts. But now, conditions appear to be\nbottoming out and housing activity has started to move up again. This likely reflects structural issues,\nincluding a long-term shortage of available housing. So housing construction and prices have held up\nbetter than one might have expected given the level of interest rates. Contacts in construction tell us that\nthey expect public-sector and infrastructure spending to also support construction activity.\n\n[Figure 5. Employment growth and the unemployment rate]\nThe pandemic has had profound effects on the labor market. When the economy reopened, labor demand\nwell outpaced labor supply, putting upward pressure on wages and price inflation. Progress is now being\nmade in bringing demand and supply into better balance, but it is slow progress and demand is still\noutpacing supply. The monthly pace of job growth has been slowing over the past year. However, it\n\n\f5\nremains robust, with payroll gains averaging more than 240 thousand per month from April to June. The\nunemployment rate is 3.6 percent, near its 50-year low, and it has been basically at that level for over a\nyear. The number of job openings has been moving down but the ratio of job openings to the number of\nunemployed workers is more than 1.6. That is well above the 1.2 level seen in the strong labor market\nconditions in 2019.\n\n[Figure 6. Labor force participation]\nWe have seen an adjustment in labor supply over time. When the pandemic hit, many people left the\nwork force. Some needed to take on the responsibilities of caring for children or elderly members of the\nfamily and others chose to retire. Since then, labor force participation rates have been improving. While\nthe total labor force participation rate is below what it was before the pandemic, the participation rate of\nprime-age workers, i.e., workers between the ages of 25 and 54, is now higher than its pre-pandemic level\nand this has helped to ease some of the imbalance between labor demand and supply.\n\nThese strong labor market conditions are not necessarily a problem; in fact, they provide a basis for a\nscenario in which inflation moves back down to 2 percent without a recession. The question is whether\nthe current strength in labor demand relative to supply is consistent with price stability.\n\n[7. Employment cost index and average hourly earnings]\nHere we need to look at wage trends. By some measures, wage pressures have moderated, and firms tell\nus they are not expecting the outsized wage gains of the last couple of years to persist except for those\nwith skills particularly in demand. Nonetheless, wages are still growing at an annual rate of about 4-1/2\nto 5 percent. This is well above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation given current estimates of\ntrend productivity growth. Indeed, for wage growth at the current pace to be consistent with price\nstability, trend productivity growth would need to be 2-1/2 to 3 percent, instead of the current estimates of\n1 to 1-1/2 percent. We have not seen any evidence that trend productivity growth is rising; in fact,\nproductivity has declined over the past year.\n\n\f6\n\n[Figure 8. Total PCE inflation, and energy and food inflation]\nThe pandemic and the response to it by households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers\nalso had profound effects on inflation in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., inflation began to move up\nsharply in the spring of 2021, reflecting pandemic-induced imbalances in supply and demand in an\nenvironment of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February\n2022 led to additional inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and other commodities.\nThis high and broad-based inflation is very different from what the U.S. experienced during the long prepandemic expansion. Until late in that expansion, the concern was that inflation was running below our\nlonger-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nProgress is being made on inflation. Inflation levels, both the headline numbers, which include food and\nenergy prices, and measures of underlying inflation, including the core, median, and trimmed-mean\nmeasures, have moved down from their peaks. Measured year-over-year, total PCE inflation peaked at 7\npercent in June of last year. As of May of this year, it has fallen to just under 4 percent, reflecting sharp\ndeclines in energy prices and a deceleration in food prices.\n\n[Figure 9. Core inflation and components]\nUnfortunately, we see less progress with core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. Core\nPCE inflation peaked in February 2022 at 5.4 percent. It has moved down a bit since then, but progress\nhas stalled, with core inflation running about 4.6 percent over the past six months. Of course, food and\nenergy prices matter for consumers. The Fed’s inflation target is defined in terms of total PCE inflation,\nwhich includes food and energy prices. But economists look at measures that exclude these components\n\n\f7\nbecause they often give a better reading on where inflation is headed. And currently the core measure\nindicates that inflation is stubbornly high and broad-based.\n\nWhen we look at components, we see that inflation in both core goods and core services remains high.\nThis is very different from the pre-pandemic expansion, when core goods inflation was slightly negative\non average and falling goods prices were pulling inflation down. Currently, while core goods inflation\nhas declined over the past year, it remains above 2 percent.\n\nConsumers spend a larger share of their income on services than on goods: about 65 percent of the total\nconsumption basket is core services compared to about 24 percent for core goods. (The rest of the basket\ncomprises energy (4 percent) and food at home (7 percent).) Because its expenditure share is higher,\nservices have a higher weight in the inflation indices than goods. Services inflation also tends to be more\npersistent than goods inflation. Housing services, measured by rents and the imputed rents for owneroccupied housing, constitutes about 15 percent of people’s total consumption spending, and it is a large\nand cyclically sensitive component of services inflation.\n\nHousing services inflation remains elevated. When the economy reopened in 2021, housing demand\nsurged and so did rents. Last year, rent inflation began to come down, and the growth rate of rents in new\nleases, which helps predict housing services inflation, fell and has remained low. Cleveland Fed research\nindicates that it typically takes about a year for this deceleration to show up in the measures of housing\ninflation.2 So we are expecting to see housing services inflation to move down this year.\n\n2\n\nResearchers at the Cleveland Fed have produced a new tenant repeat-rent index, which they show leads the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics’ rent inflation measure by four quarters. For the data and analysis see Brian Adams, Lara\nLoewenstein, Hugh Montag, and Randal J. Verbrugge, “Disentangling Rent Index Differences: Data, Methods, and\nScope,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Working Paper No. 22-38, December 2022.\n(https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202238).\n\n\f8\nInflation in core services excluding housing, which accounts for 50 percent of total consumption, tends to\nbe sticky and correlated with wage inflation and the strength in the labor market. Although inflation in\nthis component slowed in May, it has shown little improvement over time. To achieve our longer-run\ngoal of 2 percent inflation, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation in the prices of goods,\nhousing, and core services excluding housing. And to achieve that we will need to see further moderation\nof demand in both product and labor markets. This brings me to monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThe FOMC has come an appreciable way in moving policy from a very accommodative stance to a\nrestrictive one. We are closer to the end of our tightening phase than the beginning. Because monetary\npolicy affects the broader economy with a lag, some of the tightening already in place will help to further\nmoderate demand in both product and labor markets, thereby easing price and wage pressures. So I do\nexpect inflation to move down further this year, although it will take longer to reach our 2 percent goal.\n\nThat said, the economy has shown more underlying strength than anticipated earlier this year, and\ninflation has remained stubbornly high, with progress on core inflation stalling. In order to ensure that\ninflation is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent, my view is that the funds rate will need to\nmove up somewhat further from its current level and then hold there for a while as we accumulate more\ninformation on how the economy is evolving.\n\n[Figure 10. SEP federal funds rate path]\nThis view accords with the median view among FOMC participants in the June Summary of Economic\nProjections.3 Those projections indicate that all but two participants anticipate that further rate increases\nwill be appropriate this year.\n\nFour times a year, the FOMC summarizes Committee participants’ projections of output growth, the\nunemployment rate, inflation, and the associated appropriate policy path. For the June 2023 SEP, see\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20230614.htm.\n3\n\n\f9\n\nIn addition to the current economic situation, risk management considerations also influence my current\nthinking that policy will need to tighten somewhat further to put inflation on a sustainable and timely path\nback to 2 percent.\n\n[Figure 11. Real rates]\nFirst, while policy is now in restrictive territory, it is less restrictive compared to many historical\ntightening cycles. That partly reflects the fact that when we started tightening in March 2022, policy was\nvery accommodative; so much of the tightening was to move policy to a neutral stance. Until recently,\nthe real policy rate, i.e., the nominal rate adjusted for inflation, has been below 0.5 percent, the median\nprojection among FOMC participants of the long-run real fed funds rate. As inflation falls, the real rate\nwill rise even without further increases in the nominal fed funds rate. Waiting for that passive tightening\nto happen, though, risks allowing inflation to remain elevated for longer.\n\n[Figure 12. SEP inflation]\nInfluencing my view is that inflation has surprised us on the upside for some time. According to the June\nSEP, the median FOMC participant now expects inflation to remain slightly above 2 percent at the end of\n2025, which is the farthest out the projections go. If so, then inflation will have been above our goal for\nover 4 years. And that is ignoring the risks that could play out, which most participants see as tilted to the\nupside for inflation.\n\n[Figure 13. Inflation expectations]\nA more timely path back to 2 percent inflation, which would be encouraged by somewhat tighter\nmonetary policy, is desirable because the longer inflation remains elevated, the higher the risk that\ninflation expectations could become unanchored from our 2 percent goal. Once households and\nbusinesses believe that inflation will remain elevated, those expectations influence their savings and\n\n\f10\ninvestment decisions, and wage- and price-setting behavior, and this makes it much harder to bring\ninflation down.\n\nSo far, most measures of medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have remained reasonably well\nanchored in a range consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, although they are at the upper end of that\nrange. These measures suggest that even though inflation is high, people are expecting it to return to 2\npercent over time. However, other evidence suggests some caution. As part of the Cleveland Fed’s\nSurvey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations, in April, we asked top business executives what they thought the\nFed’s inflation target was. The mean response was 3.1 percent. This is higher than our target of 2 percent\nbut also nearly a percentage point above the response before the pandemic.4\n\nIn addition, recent research by Cleveland Fed economists indicates that although short-run inflation\nexpectations tend to move with gasoline prices and the prices of other salient items like food, we\nshouldn’t ignore their persistently elevated levels entirely and focus only on longer-term expectations.\nThe researchers find persistent differences in inflation expectations across consumers of different ages\nand that households form their expectations of inflation based on their lifetime experience of inflation.5\nWhen this mechanism is incorporated into a conventional New Keynesian model, inflation shocks are\nmore persistent than otherwise, and the optimal response is for monetary policy to tighten when short-run\ninflation expectations rise even if longer-run expectations are stable. Doing so helps to limit the\nexperience households have with high inflation, which helps to keep inflation expectations anchored in\nthe future.\n\nThe Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE) was created by Professors Olivier Coibion and Yuriy\nGorodnichenko, and is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/survey-of-firms-inflation-expectations.\n4\n\nFor background on the survey, see Christian Garciga, Edward S. Knotek II, Mathieu Pedemonte, and Taylor\nShiroff, “The Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary,\nMay 22, 2023. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/ec-202310-the-survey-of-firmsinflation-expectations)\nMathieu O. Pedemonte, Hiroshi Toma, and Esteban Verdugo, “Aggregate Implications of Heterogeneous Inflation\nExpectations: The Role of Individual Experience,” Working Paper No. 23-04, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\nJanuary 2023. (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202304)\n5\n\n\f11\n\nI believe a somewhat tighter policy stance will help achieve a better balance between the risks of\ntightening too much against the risks of tightening too little. Tightening too much would slow the\neconomy more than necessary and entail higher costs than needed to get inflation back to our goal.\nTightening too little would allow high inflation to persist, with short- and long-run consequences, and\nnecessitate a much more costly journey back to price stability. A slightly higher policy rate would\nroughly equate the probabilities that the next policy move will be a tightening move versus a loosening\nmove. This would be a good holding point as we accumulate more information about whether the\neconomy is evolving as expected. If it is not, then we can adjust our policy rate either up or down, as\nappropriate.\n\nOf course, while this is my current assessment, there continues to be uncertainty about the outlook, and\nthe economy could evolve differently than anticipated. My policy views will be informed by all of the\nincoming economic and financial information, not only official government statistics but also regional\ninformation gathered from our business, labor market, and community contacts; a variety of surveys on\neconomic and banking conditions; and higher-frequency data such as credit card spending. All of this\ninformation can help determine not only where the economy is but also where it is going, and therefore,\ninform our policy decisions.\n\nI also recognize that others may assess the outlook and the risks to the outlook somewhat differently than\nI do. One benefit of attending FOMC meetings is hearing how other policymakers are evaluating things.\nWhile individual FOMC participants may at times have different assessments of appropriate policy, there\nshould be no doubt that we all share a strong commitment to setting monetary policy to achieve our\nstatutory goals of price stability and maximum employment on behalf of the public.\n\nThat concludes my summary of economic and policy developments. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\fFigures for\n“An Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy”\nLoretta J.

Although we bring\ndifferent perspectives to the table, we share a common goal: to strengthen communities by improving the\nopportunities for all people to productively engage in our economy. I thank all of the organizers for\nputting together such a strong program.\n\nThe discussions over the last two days have focused on many of the challenges that face our communities,\nboth long-standing ones and new ones that reflect our changing economy. There are still significant\nimpediments limiting those in low- and moderate-income households and communities from fully\nbenefiting from a strong economy. Not everyone has access to affordable education, transportation,\nbroadband, housing, credit, and other financial services, which are the foundational elements that allow\npeople to achieve the American dream and secure a better living standard for their children. I applaud\neach and every one of you for persevering in your efforts to improve our economy for all. At times it\nmust be quite discouraging given what still needs to be done. But I have decided to end the summit on a\npositive note by providing some examples of the progress that has been achieved in supporting\ncommunities through partnership and perseverance. Before I continue, I note that the views I present will\nbe my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nCommunity Development and the Federal Reserve System\nMy examples of progress come from two areas in which the Federal Reserve System has been particularly\ninterested: housing and workforce development. As many of you know, the origin of the Fed’s\ncommunity development work lies with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in\n\n\f2\n1977.1 The CRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which\nthey are chartered to do business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and\nneighborhoods. The Fed and other federal financial supervisory agencies were charged with\nimplementing the act. Today, through its research and outreach efforts, the community development\nfunction within the Fed provides information about the economic health of low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds and communities, and small businesses. This information is particularly helpful in tracking\nemerging developments and monitoring the economy in real time, since this information is available\nbefore many of the official statistics are released. It proved particularly useful during the pandemic,\nwhich had a disproportionately negative effect on lower-income people and people of color, as well as the\npost-pandemic economy, which has been characterized by high inflation, a particularly onerous burden\nfor people and businesses with fewer resources. Some of the information gathered is now included in the\nBeige Book, which is published two weeks before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nwhich sets monetary policy.\n\nAnother important source of information is the Federal Reserve Banks’ Small Business Credit Survey,\nwhich the Cleveland Fed now leads on behalf of the System.2 The survey provides information from a\nlarge sample of small businesses on their credit performance, financing needs and choices, and borrower\nexperiences.3 The survey allowed the Fed to document the disparate impact the pandemic had on small\nBlack-owned and women-owned businesses, track the post-pandemic recovery of small businesses, and\nsee how differences in access to credit have changed over time. The data on access to credit have\n\n1\n\nThis survey was launched in 2010 by the New York Fed and has been a collaboration among all 12 Reserve Banks\nsince 2016. For more discussion, see Mester (2017).\n2\n\nBetween September and November 2022, almost 14,000 small business owners participated in the survey, almost\n8,000 employer firms – small businesses with between 1 to 499 employees – and almost 6,000 nonemployer firms –\nsmall businesses without employees. The survey’s web page at www.fedsmallbusiness.org provides background on\nthe survey, survey data, and analyses using the data. See Federal Reserve Banks (2023a and 2023b).\n3\n\nSee Federal Reserve Banks (2023a, 2023b, and 2023c).\n\n\f3\ninformed the work being done by the federal banking regulators to modernize the regulations to\nimplement the CRA in light of the changes in banking since the 1970s.4\n\nIn addition to real-time reconnaissance, the Fed’s community development function also works to\nunderstand the longer-run trends that present challenges and opportunities for lower-income households\nand communities. At the Cleveland Fed we collect information in a variety of ways, including meeting\nwith our community contacts and our Community Advisory Council, conducting surveys of nonprofits\nand small businesses, and convening listening sessions and roundtables. An example is yesterday’s Fed\nListens event, which allowed Governor Bowman and me to directly hear how lower-income communities\nare experiencing the post-pandemic economy. Equally important for our work is the collaboration we\nhave with many of your organizations. We have learned over the years that much more can be\naccomplished by bringing together diverse perspectives to identify problems and then working together as\npartners with perseverance to solve them.\n\nProgress\nLet me turn to examples of progress, first, in the area of housing and neighborhood development.\nHousing and neighborhood development: A modern land bank and lead remediation\nSince the urban decline of the 1970s, vacant and abandoned properties have posed a problem for\nneighborhood revitalization. The global financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-2009 exacerbated\nthis challenge.5 Ohio had one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country during this time. In Slavic\nVillage, a neighborhood in southeast Cleveland, foreclosures affected as many as one in four homes.\n\nFor the latest information on the rulemaking process, see the section titled “Interagency Community Reinvestment\nAct Proposed Rulemaking,” on the Community Reinvestment Act web page of the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System.\n4\n\n5\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2008).\n\n\f4\nBetween 1990 and 2010, the number of vacant properties more than doubled in places like Cleveland,\nDetroit, and Baltimore, but increases were also seen in Sun Belt cities, including Atlanta and Miami.6\n\nTo help solve the large number of vacant and abandoned properties in Ohio in the 2000s, a “next\ngeneration” land bank was set up, the Cuyahoga Land Bank. Instead of relying on government agencies,\nthis land bank entrusted nongovernmental entities to acquire distressed properties and they were able to\nconvert these properties to alternate uses more efficiently than local governments could.7 This land bank\ncontinues to be an important avenue for revitalizing neighborhoods in Cleveland.\n\nAnother example of progress is the remediation of lead in the housing stock in Cleveland. While in some\nparts of the country lead contamination has come through the drinking water system, in Cleveland, a\ndeteriorating housing stock in distressed neighborhoods was the main contributor to high levels of lead\ntoxicity in children. Even though it has been 45 years since lead paint was banned in 1978, in the mid2000s, lead testing in Cleveland revealed that a significant share of the city’s children had elevated levels\nof lead in their bloodstream, and these children disproportionately lived in lower-income and majority\nminority neighborhoods.8 At elevated levels, lead can cause brain damage that is irreversible and has\nsignificant adverse effects on a child’s ability to learn, which can threaten the child’s attachment to the\nworkforce and long-term economic well-being. Lead is a health problem, but it is also an educational\nproblem, a workforce and economic development problem, and a barrier to economic opportunity and an\ninclusive economy.\n\n6\n\nSee Finn, Nelson, and Stein (2021), pp. 7-23.\n\n7\n\nThe Cuyahoga Land Bank was modeled after one in Genesee County, Michigan. See Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland (2008) and Finn, Nelson, and Stein (2021).\n8\n\nSee Nelson (2016), Johnson (2019), and Coulton, et al. (2020). A study of Chicago neighborhoods found that even\nthough the incidence of lead poisoning in children has fallen significantly over time as a result of public health\npolicy, it is still the case that those neighborhoods with the highest levels of toxicity are predominantly Black\nneighborhoods. See Sampson and Winter (2016).\n\n\f5\nAs more people became aware of the dangerous effects of lead in homes, research institutions, hospitals,\nnonprofits, and foundations joined with the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County to form a publicprivate partnership called the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition. For the past six years, the Coalition has\nhelped with screening, testing, public outreach, and engagement with residents and landlords, as well as\nlead paint remediation in homes and clearance. Over time, the group has expanded to include more\norganizations and state and local governments, and families affected by lead. Many of our Policy Summit\npartners, including the United Way, Enterprise Community Partners, Cleveland Neighborhood Progress,\nand the Urban League, are members.9\n\nIn 2016, the Cleveland Fed convened parties interested in solving the lead problem, and in 2022 we\nhosted a Lead Safe Home Fund investor forum at the Bank. It was clear that a lot of tangible progress had\nbeen made over those six years. As of January 2022, $115 million of funding has been designated for\nmaking Cleveland homes lead-safe and the City of Cleveland requires all rental properties built before\n1978 to have a Lead Safe certification, which requires the property to have been inspected by a certified\nprofessional and not have any current lead hazards. The share of tested children who have elevated blood\nlevels of lead has also fallen substantially since the 2000s.10 Still, we should not tolerate any level of\ntoxicity. There is more work to be done, but I am convinced that with perseverance and continued\npartnership we can make even more progress.\nWorkforce development: Training and early childhood education\nThe second set of examples is in the area of workforce development. Workforce development plays a\ncritical role in helping people and communities further their economic well-being. Currently, our\neconomy is experiencing a skills gap: not enough workers have the skills necessary to fill the jobs in\ndemand. This means that the country is not living up to its economic potential. A skilled workforce that\n\n9\n\nSee the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition’s website.\n\n10\n\nData from the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition show that from 2017 to 2021, this share has fallen from about 13\npercent to about 9 percent. See the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition’s dashboard.\n\n\f6\ncan adapt to change is an essential ingredient in a healthy economy. The Federal Reserve System has\nworked on several initiatives to promote investment in workforce development and encourage\npartnerships.11 I use the word “investment” on purpose. There is a growing understanding among\nbusinesses that expenditure on employees should not just be viewed as a short-run input cost. Employees\nare important assets to an organization and investing in employees can pay off in the long run by creating\na more attached and productive workforce. Regions are also realizing that investments to draw a highly\nskilled workforce can pay off by attracting more employers to the region and making the region more\ncompetitive when opportunities arise. Workforce development and regional economic development are\nlinked and should be viewed as a common goal.\n\nEven before the pandemic, technological change, automation, and digitalization were driving rapid\nchanges in the nature of work: what we do and how we do it.12 The types of jobs and the skills needed for\ndoing them are changing. Over the past decade, skills-based hiring has become more common and has\nprovided a practical solution for matching employers with workers who have the necessary skills and\nproviding better career paths for more people. According to a Fed survey of young workers, more than 30\npercent of young adults did not get information about jobs and careers in high school or college.13 The\nFederal Reserve has been working to fill this information gap. For example, recognizing that a majority\nof adults, disproportionately people of color, do not have at least a bachelor’s degree, researchers at the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, and Philadelphia have been documenting the types of\n\n11\n\nThe Federal Reserve System worked with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers\nUniversity, the Ray Marshall Center of the Lyndon B. Johnson School at the University of Texas, and the W.E.\nUpjohn Institute for Employment Research on an initiative called Investing in America’s Workforce. The Federal\nReserve Banks have also participated in recent national initiatives, including the Worker Voices Project, which\nraised the public’s awareness of the experiences of lower wage workers during the pandemic, and the Advancing\nCareers for Low-Income Families Initiative, based at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which is raising the\npublic’s awareness about benefits cliffs, which refer to situations in which families lose access to some public\nassistance benefits as their income rises.\n12\n\nSee Mester (2021).\n\n13\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016).\n\n\f7\noccupations that do not require a four-year college degree but that do pay a decent wage (at or above the\nmedian wage).14 Examples of these types of “opportunity occupations” include nurses, sales\nrepresentatives, truck drivers, carpenters, and electricians. An examination of the skills in demand for\nlower-wage and for opportunity occupations led to the development of the Occupational Mobility\nExplorer tool.15 This tool helps workers in 33 different metro areas learn how the skills used in their\ncurrent occupation are similar to those used in a higher-paying occupation in their same labor market. For\nexample, if you are a cashier in Cleveland, you have the skills to be a customer service representative, a\njob that pays, on average, 135 percent more.16\n\nAs the skills gap has widened, community colleges and businesses have partnered to tailor training and\ncurriculums. The Federal Reserve and other evaluators have identified several examples of successful\npartnerships that have increased opportunity, reduced worker turnover, and increased productivity and\nwages.17 Many of these programs are sector specific. The Cuyahoga County Workforce Funders Group,\na public-private partnership, is working with various local partners on programs in information\ntechnology, healthcare, manufacturing, and hospitality. Towards Employment, a nonprofit workforce\ndevelopment organization involved in this effort, bases its work on the WorkAdvance model to help build\ncareer paths in high-demand sectors. This model includes pre-screening to ensure that participants\nunderstand a sector’s job requirements, occupational skills training, placement services, and postemployment coaching. The model has been shown to be effective, with participants working more\nregular hours, staying in the workforce, and earning higher salaries.18\n\n14\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\n\n15\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\n16\n\nThis is based on using the Occupational Mobility Explorer tool, which is available at\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/community-development-data/occupational-mobility-explorer.\n17\n\nSee Fee, Klesta, and Nelson (2016) and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia (2021).\n18\n\nSee Fund for Our Economic Future and Hendra, et al. (2016).\n\n\f8\n\nOf course, to be able to perform well at a job or in a skills-based development program, one needs to have\nhad a good foundation. It has become increasingly clear through research and experience that early\nchildhood education is critically important for advancement. The benefit comes not only from acquiring\nskills like reading and math but also from behavioral skills.19 We now know that when children fall\nbehind early on, it is difficult to catch up, and progress has been made in identifying which type of early\nchildhood education programs work.20 The research has shown that well-focused investment in early\nchildhood development pays off for both individuals and the community overall,21 that enrollment in\npre-K programs has helped to lower racial and income disparities in students’ readiness for\nkindergarten,22 and that home environment matters, too. For example, a study by a Cleveland Fed\neconomist showed that the number of books at home has a significant impact on achievement in\nelementary school.23\n\nThe research findings have driven action and the action has led to progress. In 2014, the Cleveland\nMetropolitan Area School District (CMSD) expanded pre-K education through its PRE4CLE program.\nIn the year prior to its establishment, only 16 percent of children were entering kindergarten fully\nprepared, as measured by Ohio’s Kindergarten Readiness Assessment, and only about 26 percent of\npreschool-age children in Cleveland were participating in high-quality preschool. From the program’s\nlaunch through 2019, enrollment in high-quality preschool increased by 72 percent, with nearly half of\nCleveland’s 3- to 5-year-olds enrolled. Unfortunately, as was true for many childhood education\n\n19\n\nOne study found that a main way in which the influential Perry Preschool Program, which predates HeadStart,\naffected longer-run outcomes was by affecting the social skills of the participants, e.g., lowering aggressive and antisocial behaviors. See Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev (2013).\n20\n\nSee, for example, Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev (2013), and Almond and Currie (2010).\n\n21\n\nSee Rolnick and Grunewald (2003).\n\n22\n\nSee Reardon and Portilla (2016).\n\n23\n\nSee Aliprantis (2014).\n\n\f9\nprograms, the pandemic caused the enrollment in PRE4CLE to fall significantly, but it did begin to\nrecover last year.\n\nThe Cincinnati Preschool Promise is also working to expand access to high-quality preschool to prepare\nstudents for kindergarten. And Akron’s I Promise School has also been successfully implementing a\nwrap-around approach that ensures that students have access not only to education but also to healthy\nfood and transportation to get to school. Another sign of progress is that policymakers increasingly\nrecognize that they need to take a holistic approach to effectively address the challenges facing lowerincome households.\n\nWhat is critically important now is to persevere in educating our children, make up the ground lost during\nthe pandemic, and increase access, so that all of our children will be ready for the changing workforce of\nthe future.24\n\nConclusion\nThese are only a few examples of progress. I could point to many others that show what can be achieved\nthrough partnership and perseverance. I hope that what you have learned and who you have met at this\nyear’s Policy Summit will inspire you to form new partnerships and to persevere with the important work\nyou are doing. If we remain committed and work together, I am convinced we will make further progress\ntoward a more inclusive economy in which all people benefit. Thank you again for participating in this\nyear’s Policy Summit.\n\n24\n\nThe pandemic was a setback for childhood education.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nDublin, Ireland\nMay 16, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak in its Central Banking Series and the\nCentral Bank of Ireland for hosting this event. I have had many great opportunities to participate in GIC\nprograms. So when I was offered the chance to speak at this event I jumped at it because I knew that\nwhat I learn today will give me insights into the economy, which will prove valuable in setting monetary\npolicy.\n\nToday, rather than focus on the current economic outlook and monetary policy, I will focus on the longer\nrun. While I will frame my discussion in terms of the U.S. economy, many of the trends I will discuss\naffect other advanced economies, too. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nPolicy economists often talk about the longer run as if it were a destination, but we speak less frequently\nabout the factors that will influence what that destination will look like and how it will evolve. These\nslower-moving trends include longer-run potential output growth, labor force growth, demographic\nchanges, and productivity growth. While these trends might get less attention in current policy\ndiscussions, they have significant implications for the future health of the U.S. economy. And while\nmonetary policy cannot directly affect these longer-run trends, it needs to take them into account.\n\nLong-Run Growth\nLet me start with long-run potential growth. Living standards, as measured by income per person, are\ninextricably tied to an economy’s long-run growth rate. Over time, even small differences in growth can\ntranslate into large differences in average income per person. For example, if real GDP were to grow at\n2-1/4 percent per year over the next 20 years, instead of 1-3/4 percent, the difference in income at the end\n\n\f2\nof that period would amount to about $10,000 per person in today’s dollars, which is about 13 percent of\ntoday’s per capita income level in the U.S.1\n\nOver the long term, the U.S. economy has enjoyed solid economic performance. Save for the Great\nDepression, sustained growth of per capita real GDP of around 2 percent per year has been a hallmark of\nthe U.S. economy over the past 150 years.2 But this average obscures the fact that long-run growth in the\nU.S. has been falling over time. From the end of World War II through the end of the 1990s, real GDP\ngrowth averaged 3-1/2 percent per year. If we concentrate on recent economic expansions, we see that\ngrowth averaged about 4-1/4 percent over the 1982-1990 expansion and about 3-1/2 percent over the\n1991-2001 expansion. In contrast, average growth over the pre-pandemic expansion and the current\nexpansion, excluding the rebound quarter after the economic shutdown, has been about 2-3/4 percent.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that real GDP will grow by about 2-1/4 percent per year\nfrom 2025 to 2030. This is somewhat above the CBO’s 1-3/4 percent estimate of maximum sustainable\nor potential growth over that period.3 And that estimate of potential growth is considerably lower than the\nCBO’s potential growth estimate of 2-3/4 percent for the 1991-2007 period, a period prior to the Great\nRecession.4\n\nIndeed, economists have been revising down their estimates of longer-run growth since the start of the\nGreat Recession. When the FOMC began releasing longer-run economic projections in January 2009, the\ncentral tendency of the participants’ projections of longer-run real GDP growth was 2-1/2 to 2-3/4\n\n1\n\nThis calculation is based on Census Bureau projections of population growth.\n\n2\n\nSee Jones (2016).\n\n3\n\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2023).\n\n4\n\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2023), Figure 2.5.\n\n.\n\n\f3\npercent. In the projections released in March of this year, the central tendency was down to 1-3/4 to 2.0\npercent.\n\nLabor Force Growth\nThe key determinants of an economy’s longer-run growth rate are structural productivity growth – how\neffectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output – and labor force growth.\nDuring the pandemic many people left the workforce. Some found it necessary to leave for health reasons\nor because they had to take care of children or other family members, and many decided to retire. In fact,\nthe share of the U.S. population that is retired is about 1-1/2 percentage points above what it was before\nthe pandemic, an increase of more than 3-1/2 million people.5 While prime-age labor force participation\nhas now returned to pre-pandemic levels, total labor force participation has not, partly reflecting these\n“excess retirements.”\n\nBut even before the pandemic, labor force growth had been slowing. In the 1970s, the labor force grew\nabout 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered the workforce. Labor\nforce growth has slowed since then, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over the prepandemic expansion, from 2009-2019. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that labor\nforce growth will average 1/2 percent per year over 2021-2031.6\n\nThe downward trend in labor force growth largely reflects slower population growth, which results from\ndemographic factors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, as well as reduced net\ninternational migration when compared to earlier decades. Demographic change can have significant\neffects on the economy, influencing not only population and labor force growth, but also savings rates,\n\n5\n\nSee Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).\n\n6\n\nSee U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (September 8, 2022) and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (November 2022).\n\n\f4\nthe long-run unemployment rate, the equilibrium interest rate, and the demand for financial assets.7 The\nBLS estimates that the U.S. population will grow less than 3/4 percent a year on average from 2021 to\n2031, one of the slowest paces since the series started in the 1960s. The median age of the U.S.\npopulation is about 37 years old, about 10 years older than in 1970.8 By 2050, the U.N. projects that the\nmedian age in the U.S. will be over 43 years old and that the number of people age 65 or older per 100\nworking-age people (those ages 25 to 64) will be more than double what it was in 1970.9\n\nIncreased immigration can partially offset the effects of an aging domestic population. According to the\nBLS, about 18 percent of the U.S. labor force is foreign born and those who are foreign-born participate\nin the labor force at a higher rate than native-born Americans.10 Yet immigration flows to the U.S. have\nslowed since the 2000s.11\n\nProductivity Growth\nThe dampening effect of slower labor force growth on the potential growth of the economy could be\noffset by more rapid increases in productivity growth. Indeed, sustained increases in output and\nincreasing standards of living are determined by productivity growth.12 Over the five years prior to the\npandemic, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, grew\nat an annual rate of only about 1-1/2 percent; over the current expansion productivity has not grown much\n\n7\n\nSee Mester (2018).\n\n8\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the median age in the U.S. was 27.2 in 1970 and 43.1 in 2020, and it is estimated\nto be 43.1 in 2050. See United Nations (2022).\nThis is the inverse of the United Nation’s potential support ratio. Calculations based on the data in United Nations\n(2022) indicates that the number of people age 65 or older per 100 working-age people (those ages 25 to 64) was 22\nin 1970 and 31 in 2020, and it is expected to rise to 47 by 2050.\n9\n\n10\n\nCalculated as the average of the monthly shares for 2022. In 2022, the labor force participation rate for foreignborn workers was 65.9 percent compared with 61.5 percent for native-born people. Data are from the U.S. Bureau\nof Labor Statistics, “Employment Situation” (monthly).\n11\n\nFor example, the number of persons obtaining legal permanent resident status per 1,000 residents has fallen to\naround 2.2 from about 3.5 over 2000-2009. See U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n12\n\nMester (2017) discusses the endogenous growth model.\n\n\f5\nat all. This is quite a step down from the 2-1/4 percent pace seen over the two expansions prior to the\nGreat Recession. Some of the slowdown in productivity growth during the current expansion likely\nreflects the difficulty in measuring productivity given the unusual effects of the pandemic on the labor\nmarket. Some of those effects will likely abate over time, but structural factors have likely been weighing\non productivity growth, as well.\n\nEconomic dynamism\nOne such factor is a reduced level of economic dynamism. New firms play a particularly important role\nin the U.S. economy. In fact, young firms disproportionately contribute to both overall job creation and\njob destruction in the U.S.13 An enviable aspect of the U.S. economy around the globe has been our spirit\nof innovation, entrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility. This\ndynamism has contributed to economic growth and well-being in the U.S. by allowing resources to be\nreallocated from less-productive to more-productive businesses and allowing workers to move up the\ncareer ladder.\n\nBefore the pandemic, a cause for concern about the U.S. economy was that the start-up rate of new\nbusinesses had been generally declining at least since 2000.14 Business start-ups were accounting for a\nsmaller share of firms and a smaller share of employment than they once did.15 This slow pace of startups and more general decline in business and labor market dynamism likely contributed to the slowdown\n\n13\n\nFor further discussion of the role of small businesses in the U.S. economy, see Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda\n(2013) and Mester (2022). Additional information on small businesses is available in the Federal Reserve System’s\nSmall Business Credit Survey, an annual national survey of small-business owners, which is led on behalf of the\nSystem by a team from the Cleveland Fed.\n14\n15\n\nFor further discussion of the decline in dynamism, see Haltiwanger (2015).\n\nOver the 1990s to the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 10 percent of all firms and an\naverage of over 2-1/2 percent of total employment each year. Over 2010 through 2019, those numbers fell: start-ups\naccounted for about 8 percent of all firms and an average of under 2 percent of total employment each year. (My\ncalculations are based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics and its Firm Age Table,\nBDSFAGE.)\n\n\f6\nin productivity growth of the American economy.16 Indeed, by some estimates, if the pace of job\nreallocation had remained the same as in the 1980s, total factor productivity growth in the U.S. would\nhave been a third higher.17\n\nThe onset of the pandemic hit many small businesses very hard. From February to April 2020, the\nnumber of active small business owners dropped by 3.3 million, a record 22 percent decline.18 But\nsurprisingly, starting in May 2020, there has been a significant increase in new business registrations.19\nWhile down from the May 2021 level, monthly business applications remain considerably higher than\nthey were before the pandemic. Some of these new businesses were likely established out of necessity by\npeople who had lost their jobs during the pandemic or by people who felt dissatisfied with their work\nsituation. Others were likely formed by people who saw and took advantage of an opportunity. It is not\nclear at this point how many of these new businesses will prosper and whether this represents a\nresurgence of dynamism in the U.S. economy.20 If it does, that will be a positive sign.\n\nInvestment in technology and human capital\nIn addition to dynamism, productivity trends can be influenced through investment. Indeed, economists\nhold different views about the future growth prospects of the U.S. economy largely because they have\ndifferent assessments of the prospects for investments in technology and human capital, factors that\ninfluence productivity growth.21\n\n16\n\nSee Haltiwanger (2015).\n\n17\n\nSee Decker, et al. (2020).\n\n18\n\nSee Fairlie (2020).\n\n19\n\nHaltiwanger (2021) and Lettieri and Fikri (2022) discuss the increase in start-ups during the pandemic.\n\n20\n\nSee Dinlersoz, et al. (2021)\n\n21\n\nFor further discussion about the pessimistic and optimistic camps, see Mester (2015).\n\n\f7\nThere have been significant advances in technology, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum\ncomputing, and machine learning. But not all technological change is obviously productive: note the\ncurrent discussions about artificial intelligence. However, changes in technology with widespread\napplicability can lead to higher levels of productivity growth and output growth.22 But even with\nproductive technology, it takes time to adapt to the change. Indeed, the disruption caused by technology\ncan have negative effects at first. Workers need to retrain and some industries may be pushed out by the\nnew technology. Eventually, as the economy adapts, there are gains, but not all people, industries, and\ncommunities will automatically share in the benefits. It is still too early to tell whether the pandemic has\nchanged trend productivity growth. There has been some speculation that the increased investments in\ntechnology that enabled remote work necessitated by the pandemic might eventually do so, but the\noffsetting effect is the increase in resources needed to manage remote workers.23\n\nHuman capital\nHuman capital and technology are linked. For technology to enhance productivity, workers need to have\nthe abilities and knowledge to apply it. So, technological change can spur increased investments in\nhuman capital. The reverse is true, too. The availability of a more highly skilled workforce can induce\nhigher investment in innovation and new technology, since firms know they will be able to hire workers\nwith the requisite skills to use it.\n\nMany studies have documented the importance of investment in human capital to a nation’s economic\ngrowth and well-being. Individuals benefit as well, since higher levels of education are correlated with\n\n22\n\nEichengreen (2015) distinguishes between two dimensions of technology: the range of applicability and the range\nof adaptation. A technology that has only a limited range of applicability won’t have a large effect on productivity\nand growth because it is used only in a narrow range of sectors or activities. A technology that requires a large\nrange of adaptation of other processes in the economy will take longer to have a positive effect on productivity and\ngrowth.\n23\n\nSee Fernald, Inklaar, and Ruzic, 2023.\n\n\f8\nhigher wages – a skill premium – and lower unemployment rates.24 Cleveland Fed economists\ninvestigated the overall increase in U.S. wage inequality in the last 30 years and found not only that\ndifferences in educational attainment are a key driver of wage inequality, but that education has become\nfundamental to boosting worker productivity.25\n\nTechnological change is not only driving a rising skill premium but also shifting the distribution of jobs.\nComputers are less suited to replacing workers in occupations that require abstract thinking, high levels of\ncognition, and higher levels of education or workers in non-routine manual types of work. But computers\ncan replace medium-skill jobs that involve routine non-physical work.26 This shift in the distribution of\njobs helps to explain the rising gap in wages for highly skilled vs. low-skill workers, and the increasing\nreturn to gaining the education needed to acquire those skills. The adoption of artificial intelligence apps\nmay speed up these distributional changes.\n\nDespite the benefits of education, the U.S. is likely under-investing in it. Educational attainment levels,\nwhich had been rising over successive generations in the first half of the twentieth century, have now\nflattened out for recent cohorts.27 The U.S. is lagging behind other advanced economies in terms of\neducational achievements and skill levels. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment’s (OECD) latest available survey assessing adult skills indicates that the U.S. ranks 15th in\nterms of literacy and 24th in terms of numeracy among the 32 OECD countries that participated in the\nassessment of these skills, and 15th in terms of problem-solving out of the 29 OECD countries that\n\n24\n\nSee Mester (2021).\n\n25\n\nSee Pinheiro and Tasci (2019).\n\n26\n\nSee Acemoglu and Restrepo (2022) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011).\n\n27\n\nSee Goldin and Katz (2007).\n\n\f9\nparticipated in that part of the assessment.28 You may be interested in the comparable rankings for\nIreland. Ireland ranks 22nd in terms of literacy and 23rd in terms of both numeracy and problem-solving.\nIn a different OECD survey of the skills of 15-year-olds, the U.S. ranked 9th out of 36 OECD countries in\nreading, 31st out of 37 OECD countries in math, and 13th out of 37 OECD countries in science. Irish\nstudents did considerably better in terms of reading and math, ranking 4th in terms of reading and 15th in\nterms of math; Irish students ranked 17th in terms of science.29 The pandemic has also had significant\nnegative effects on the math and reading achievement scores of elementary school students in the U.S.30\n\nThese results are troubling given the higher skills that will be needed to drive innovation and productivity\ngrowth, and they suggest that investments in making high-quality education and training available at all\nage levels would reap important benefits for the longer-run health of the economy and increased living\nstandards.\n\nLonger-Run Trends and Their Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Policy\nLet me now turn to some implications of longer-run trends for monetary policy and financial stability\npolicy.\n\nMonetary policy implications\nMonetary policy cannot directly affect the long-run growth rate of the economy, but it can contribute to\nthe economy’s ability to reach that potential growth rate by achieving and maintaining price stability.\n\nA sharp rise in inflation in the U.S. began in the spring of 2021, reflecting both demand and supply\n\n28\n\nThe survey was conducted in three rounds: 2011-2012, 2014-2015, and 2017-2018. See the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development’s PIAAC and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(2019).\n29\n\nThe latest results from this triennial survey are from 2018. See the OECD’s PISA.\n\n30\n\nSee Kuhfeld, Soland, and Lewis (2022).\n\n\f10\nfactors. In the wake of high and persistent inflation, the FOMC began raising the target range of its\npolicy rate, the federal funds rate, in March of last year. Including the 25-basis-point increase made two\nweeks ago, the cumulative increase in the fed funds rate is 5 percentage points in a little over a year. In\naddition, the Fed has been allowing assets to run off its balance sheet in a systematic way according to the\nplan announced last May, and this is also helping to firm the stance of monetary policy. The Fed is\ncommitted to returning inflation to its 2 percent goal. We all know that high inflation makes it very hard\nfor people to make ends meet. It is a particularly onerous burden for people and businesses with fewer\nresources.\n\nBut high inflation also has long-run costs. High inflation diverts the attention of households and\nbusinesses from productive activities to having to protect the purchasing power of their money, and it\ninterferes with their ability to make long-term plans and commitments because of uncertainty about the\nvalue of their money. High inflation distorts the decisions individuals make about getting an education or\ntraining for a new job and the decisions firms make about investing in R&D or plants and equipment. As\nI just discussed, these investments in human and physical capital determine the pace of innovation in our\neconomy, productivity growth, and the potential growth rate, and our longer-run standard of living.\nWhile these longer-run impacts of high inflation are not always discussed, they underscore the imperative\nof getting the economy back to price stability in a timely way.\n\nMonetary policy also needs to consider longer-run trends in the economy because these trends affect the\ngeneral level of interest rates consistent with stable prices and maximum employment. In economic\nmodels, the longer-term equilibrium interest rate is determined by the long-run growth rate of\nconsumption and, therefore, output. In the near term, the equilibrium interest rate can fluctuate around its\nlonger-run trend, and this equilibrium interest rate is an important benchmark for monetary policymakers\nin assessing the stance of monetary policy.\n\n\f11\nFor advanced economies, empirical estimates of the longer-run equilibrium real policy rate, so-called rstar, while highly uncertain, have been declining for more than two decades.31 This decline reflects\nseveral factors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity\ngrowth. In the aftermath of the pandemic, estimates of the short-run equilibrium interest rate rose.\nWhether the equilibrium rate will revert to the low level we saw prior to the pandemic remains an open\nquestion, but some current estimates suggest that it will.32 If trend productivity growth were to pick up, it\nwould have a positive effect on the long-run equilibrium interest rate, all else equal. Higher productivity\ngrowth would increase the potential return on new investment, and raise firms’ demand for capital,\nthereby raising the equilibrium interest rate. But demographic forces could offset that. Static analysis\nsuggests that as longevity increases, people want to accumulate more assets to fund their retirements,\nputting upward pressure on asset prices and, therefore, downward pressure on returns. Moreover, because\npeople prefer to reduce their exposure to risk as they age, we could see a shift toward assets with fixed\nreturns, putting upward pressure on risk premia and downward pressure on risk-free rates.33 One\ncountervailing effect is that older people tend to save less because once people reach retirement age, they\nneed to draw down their savings and perhaps sell assets to fund their retirement. This dissaving puts\nupward pressure on interest rates.34\n\nAnother factor that could put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer run is fiscal financing.\nThe rising share of older people will put significant pressure on Social Security and Medicare in the U.S.,\nwhich are structured as pay-as-you-go programs, with current workers providing support for current\n\n31\n\nSee Mester (2020).\n\n32\n\nSee Bailey (2022).\n\n33\n\nBernanke (2005) discusses how a global savings glut could push down longer-term interest rates.\n\n34\n\nThe simulation results in Fehr, Jokisch, and Kotlikoff (2008) show an increase in interest rates along the baseline\npath of demographic change projected for the U.S., the European Union, and Japan. Goodhart and Pradhan (2017)\nargue that demographic change will lead to increases in the equilibrium interest rate. Bailey (2022) discusses\nsimulation results for the U.K. economy in which the demographic trends exert their influence mainly through\nincreased longevity, with relatively higher wealth accumulated by older people putting downward pressure on the\nequilibrium interest rate.\n\n\f12\nretirees. According to CBO projections, under current policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will\nmore than double over the next 30 years, from almost 4 percent in 2022 to about 11 percent in 2052.35\nFederal debt held by the public as a percent of GDP rises dramatically in the CBO estimates, from 98\npercent in 2022 to 185 percent in 2052, well above its historical high of 106 percent during World War II.\nRising debt-to-GDP levels would raise the general level of interest rates, potentially crowd-out productive\ninvestments, and lower economic growth. It would also mean that countercyclical fiscal policy would be\nconstrained, increasing business cycle volatility. These projected longer-run fiscal imbalances are\nunlikely to be sustainable and will need to be addressed by some combination of policies to increase\nrevenues and reduce costs. Policies that increase the growth and productivity of the workforce and that\nencourage R&D, innovation, and investment would help address fiscal imbalances and also partly offset\nthe downward pressure on longer-run growth from demographics or other sources.\n\nFinancial stability policy implications\nLonger-run trends also need to be considered in policies aimed at ensuring the stability of our financial\nsystem. Technological change and innovation are apparent in the financial services industry, with the\nrapid digitalization that is occurring and the entry of fintech and big data firms. Digitalization holds the\npromise of increasing the efficiency, productivity, and inclusiveness of the financial sector, thereby\nincreasing the economic welfare of households and businesses. But these digital tools need to be welldesigned so that they do not have unintended effects and customers need to have sufficient financial\nliteracy to be able to assess their value.\n\nThe changing landscape will require a rethinking of the regulatory framework to ensure that the financial\ninnovations led by digitalization are a net positive. Such innovations do not reduce the need for risk\nmanagement, financial regulation and supervision, and good governance, although the form each takes is\n\n35\n\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2022).\n\n\f13\nlikely to be different than what has been effective in the past. Existing regulatory and supervisory\nstructures will need to adapt to keep up with the new ways that financial services are being delivered and\nthe new players delivering them. Under the principle “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s\na duck,” a regulatory approach that shifts the focus from the type of institution offering the service to the\ntype of activity would likely be more effective in fostering the stability of the financial system by\nimproving our ability to monitor risks in the nonbank financial sector and limiting regulatory arbitrage.\n\nWith the entry of big data and fintech firms into the financial services field, the public policy approach\nwill need to change to include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data\nprivacy regulation. To ensure that the benefits of technological innovation are captured and the risks\nmanaged will require not only cooperation across these types of regulators within each country, but also\neffective international coordination among regulators and supervisors through the Financial Stability\nBoard and other international entities.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, current trends point to slow long-run growth for the U.S. economy. But steps can be taken\nto address some of the factors underlying these trends in order to improve the economic health of\nindividuals and communities and to maintain and enhance our future standard of living. Government\npolicies, if they are well-designed and focused on spurring productive investments in human and physical\ncapital, R&D, and innovation, can lead to higher productivity growth and higher longer-run growth.\nEnsuring a resilient financial system, through appropriate regulation and supervision that keeps up with\nchanges in technology, is also an essential part of a healthy economy. While monetary policy cannot\naffect the economy’s long-term growth rate, it can do its part by returning the economy to price stability,\nwhich is necessary for the longer-run health of labor markets, the financial system, and the overall\neconomy.\n\n\f14\nReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, and David Autor, “Skills, Tasks, and Technologies: Implications for Employment and\nEarnings,” in Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 4B, David Card and Orley Ashenfelter, eds.,\nAmsterdam: Elsevier-North Holland, 2011, pp. 1043-1171.\n(https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-7218(11)02410-5)\nAcemoglu, Daron, and Pascual Restrepo, “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality,”\nEconometrica 90 (September 2022), pp. 1973-2016.\n(https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA19815)\nBailey, Andrew, “The Economic Landscape: Structural Change, Global R*, and the Missing-Investment\nPuzzle,” speech at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, London, U.K., July 12, 2022.\n(https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2022/july/andrew-bailey-speech-at-omfif-the-economiclandscape)\nBernanke, Ben S. “The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit,” remarks at the\nSandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, Virginia, March 10, 2005.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/)\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO), “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2023 to 2033,” February 15,\n2023.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Akron Roundtable Signature Series\nAkron, OH\nApril 20, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Akron Roundtable for inviting me to speak in the Signature Series today about the economy\nand monetary policy. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Akron Roundtable’s work to foster community dialog aligns very well with the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland’s own efforts to engage with the public. I like that word “dialog.” At the Cleveland\nFed we strive to provide our communities with useful research, data, and analysis. For example, our\nCenter for Inflation Research provides various resources to policymakers, researchers, and the general\npublic on inflation and its drivers.1 And in return, we receive economic reconnaissance from a wide\nvariety of contacts from throughout our region. I firmly believe that the Fed’s engagement with the\npublic leads us to make better policy decisions. I also believe that the structure of the Federal Reserve\nSystem supports that engagement. So before turning to the outlook, I will give a brief overview of the\nFed’s structure.\n\nThe Structure of the Federal Reserve System\nCongress established the Fed in 1913 after a period of financial instability as an institution to promote the\nhealth of the U.S. economy and the financial system. Congress designed the Fed to operate in the public\ninterest as a decentralized central bank: the Fed is independent within the government but not independent\nfrom the government. At the time, there were concerns that the central bank would become dominated by\nfinancial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. So the Fed was designed to include\nrepresentation from across the country and to balance public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall\nStreet and Main Street concerns.\n\nFor more information, see the web pages of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research\nat https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C. that oversees those Banks. The governors are appointed by the president of the United\nStates and confirmed by the Senate.2\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks are distributed around the country in locations that were the centers of economic\nactivity back when the Fed was established. Each Reserve Bank has a board of directors whose nine\nmembers are chosen in a nonpolitical process, with three representing banks and six representing\nbusiness, agricultural, industrial, and public interests in the Districts they serve. One important\nresponsibility of the nonbank directors on a Reserve Bank’s board is selecting the Bank’s president, who\nis subject to approval by the Fed’s Board of Governors. Some Reserve Banks also have Branches with\nfive- to seven-member boards. The Cleveland Fed represents the Fed’s Fourth District and includes the\nstate of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia; we have Branches in Cincinnati\nand Pittsburgh. In addition, we have a number of advisory councils that draw their membership from\nvarious sectors and geographies in our District.3\n\nThis regional structure of the Fed has served the country well for more than 100 years. The U.S. is very\ndiverse, encompassing large cities, small towns and communities, and rural areas, with a mix of different\nindustries and occupations, and some places more prosperous than others. The Fed’s structure helps to\nensure that a variety of information from all sectors of the economy and all parts of the country is taken\n\n2\n\nGovernors serve staggered terms of up to 14 years. These terms span several terms of the president and members\nof Congress, a structure that is intended to insulate the governors from short-term political influence and which\nallows them to take a longer-run perspective when setting monetary and financial regulatory policy. The chair and\nvice chair of the Board of Governors, and the governor who serves as vice chair of supervision, are chosen by the\npresident and confirmed by the Senate from among the sitting governors for four-year terms. The chair and vice\nchairs can be reappointed until their terms as governors expire.\n3\n\nMore information about the Cleveland Fed’s board of directors and advisory councils is available on our web site\nat https://www.clevelandfed.org/about-us/directors and https://www.clevelandfed.org/about-us/advisory-councils,\nrespectively.\n\n\f3\ninto account in our monetary policy decisions.4 The Cleveland Fed is continuously gathering information\nfrom a diverse group of business, consumer, community, and labor contacts throughout our District. This\ninformation helps me to formulate my views on the regional and national economies and monetary policy,\nand I bring this information to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is\nthe body within the Fed that is responsible for setting monetary policy.5 Other Reserve Bank presidents\nare doing the same thing. So the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a mosaic of economic\ninformation and analysis from all parts of the country. And this regional information, along with\neconomic and financial data and analysis, informs the FOMC’s setting of national monetary policy in\npursuit of its statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.6\n\nThe Economic Journey So Far\nSo, what does the economic information we have been gathering tell us about the economy and what are\nthe implications for monetary policy? I titled my remarks today “Progress and Prudence.” It may sound\nlike the title of a Jane Austen novel, but I think it is a good characterization of where we are and what will\nbe needed to ensure that the economy returns to price stability. To see the progress, it will help to briefly\nreview how the economy got to where it is today.\n\n4\n\nThe regional structure also allows the Fed to carry out its other responsibilities including supervising and\nregulating certain banks, promoting the stability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the\nnation’s payments system, providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, and promoting economic\nprogress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and the people who live there.\n5\n\nThe FOMC holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year in Washington, D.C. The FOMC was established by\nthe Banking Act of 1935 and has 12 members: the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the\nNew York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. As president of the\nCleveland Fed, I vote every other year, rotating my vote with that of the president of the Chicago Fed. Other than\nNew York, Cleveland, and Chicago, the other presidents vote every third year. All presidents, whether voting or\nnonvoting, participate in FOMC meetings.\nThe Federal Reserve Act says that the Fed should conduct monetary policy to “promote effectively the goals of\nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” When prices are stable and the\neconomy is at maximum employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels, so it is often said that\nCongress has given the Fed a dual mandate.\n6\n\n\f4\nAt the start of 2020, before the pandemic, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. It was the 11th\nyear of the expansion, and things looked quite good from the perspective of our monetary policy goals.\nThe unemployment rate was at historically low levels, employment growth was strong, participation in\nthe labor force was solid, and inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nThe pandemic changed all of that. The economy shut down in March 2020. Fiscal and monetary\npolicymakers took aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit\ncontinued to flow, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. When public health statistics began to\nimprove in May 2020, many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions,\nand the economy began to reopen. As the reopening progressed, it became clear that shutting down an\neconomy can happen much more swiftly than reopening one. Spending patterns had changed, people had\nleft the workforce, and supply chains were disrupted. And these forces are still having an effect on the\neconomy today.\n\nThe economy expanded rapidly in 2021 as demand rebounded. But that strong demand confronted very\nconstrained supply in both product and labor markets. The imbalances in demand and supply led to\nsignificant upward pressures on prices in an environment of very accommodative monetary and fiscal\npolicy. A sharp rise in inflation began in the spring of 2021. Russia’s war against Ukraine, which began\nin February of last year, led to sizable increases in food and commodity prices, also contributing to rising\ninflation.\n\nHigh inflation makes it harder for people to make ends meet, and it also imposes longer-run costs on our\neconomy by affecting the decisions people make about getting an education or training for a new job, and\nthe decisions businesses make about undertaking R&D or investing in new plants and equipment. These\ntypes of investments in human and physical capital help determine our economy’s pace of innovation and\nproductivity growth and its potential growth rate, and so our longer-run standard of living.\n\n\f5\n\nThe Fed is responsible for ensuring price stability. So in March of last year in the wake of high and\nstubborn inflation, the Fed began significantly increasing its policy rate, the fed funds rate. The rate has\nmoved up a cumulative 4-3/4 percentage points and the target range of the funds rate is now 4-3/4 to 5\npercent. The Fed has also been allowing assets to run off its balance sheet in a systematic way according\nto the plan announced last May, which is also helping to firm the stance of monetary policy. These\nmonetary policy actions aim to tighten financial conditions to moderate demand, which will help to\nreduce price pressures and bring inflation down.\n\nProgress Is Being Made\nThe good news is that progress is being made. Underlying demand remains resilient but economic\nactivity has begun to slow. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a\nvery robust pace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021. The slowdown in activity is seen most clearly in the\nhousing sector, which is quite sensitive to interest rates, but also in manufacturing and business\ninvestment. Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, has been supported by strong\nhousehold balance sheets and income growth, but it too is moderating. On the supply side of the\neconomy, disruptions in supply chains have generally improved. Our contacts report that bottlenecks\nhave eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have shortened. This is welcome news because\nprice pressures can be alleviated both through further moderation in demand and further improvement in\nsupply.\n\nProgress is also being made in rebalancing the labor market. Overall labor market conditions remain\nstrong. Payroll job gains averaged 345 thousand per month over the first three months of this year, a\npickup from the average monthly gain in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment rate remains\na very low 3-1/2 percent, near where it has been for much of the past year. These tight labor market\nconditions have made it challenging for businesses to attract and retain all the workers they need to meet\n\n\f6\ndemand for their products and services. But we are beginning to see some moderation. Employment\ngrowth has slowed over the past year and firms report that it is somewhat easier to find workers now. In\naddition, the rate at which people are quitting their jobs is moving down, which is usually a sign of a\nmoderating labor market. On the supply side, there have been gains in prime-age labor force\nparticipation. So progress is beginning to be made in rebalancing labor demand and supply. As this\ncontinues, it should ease wage pressures, which have contributed to high inflation.\n\nTurning to inflation, the good news is that progress is being made here as well. In February, the yearover-year measures of both total PCE inflation and core PCE inflation were in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent\nrange. They had peaked last year in the 5-1/4 to 7 percent range. Similarly, CPI inflation is also down.\nMeasured year-over-year, CPI inflation was 5 percent in March, down sharply from its peak of 9 percent\nlast summer. Core CPI inflation is now about 5-1/2 percent, down about 1 percentage point from its peak.\n\nDespite this progress, inflation is still too high. And it is proving to be stubborn. Some measures of\nunderlying inflation, such as the median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, have shown little\nimprovement since their peaks.7 The disaggregated data show that the stubbornness is due mainly to the\nprices of services. Inflation in core PCE services excluding shelter has not improved. It tends to be\nsticky, is correlated with wage inflation, and is a much larger share of the overall index than goods or\nhousing, since consumers spend a larger share of their income on these services.\n\n7\n\nMedian and trimmed-mean inflation measures exclude components with the most extreme movements each month.\nMeasured year-over-year, as of February, the median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation measures are still between\n4-1/2 and 6 percent, and as of March, the median CPI measure is around 7 percent. These rates are all about where\nthey were at their recent peaks. As of March, the trimmed-mean CPI measure is now slightly above 6 percent, down\nabout 1 percentage point from its peak. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmedmean CPI inflation rate and the median PCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the\ntrimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. See more data and information about inflation on the web pages of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research at https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/centerfor-inflation-research.aspx.\n\n\f7\nMonetary Policy and the Outlook\nSo, what are the implications for monetary policy? We have moved interest rates up significantly over\nthe past year and it is yielding progress. Yet demand is still outpacing supply in both product and labor\nmarkets and inflation remains too high. In order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2\npercent, I anticipate that monetary policy will need to move somewhat further into restrictive territory this\nyear, with the fed funds rate moving above 5 percent and the real fed funds rate staying in positive\nterritory for some time. Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and\nfor how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on economic and financial developments.\n\nWith tighter financial conditions, I expect that demand in product and labor markets will continue to\nmoderate and inflation will continue to move down. Output growth will likely be well below trend this\nyear and pick up a bit next year. I expect that employment growth will continue to slow and the\nunemployment rate, which is very low, will begin to rise, to about 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent by the end of the\nyear. I expect to see meaningful improvement in inflation this year, with inflation moving down to about\n3-3/4 percent this year, continuing to improve next year, and reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025.\n\nThe Economy in Ohio\nIn Ohio, I expect to see similar trends. Ohio is the seventh largest economy in the nation in terms of real\ngross state product. The path of a regional economy reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the\nshocks that hit the broader U.S. economy. Manufacturing and, within manufacturing, auto and auto parts\nstill constitute an important sector of Ohio’s economy. Compared to the nation, manufacturing represents\na larger share of payroll jobs in Ohio, but that differential has fallen over time.8 Ohio’s economy has\nbeen transitioning from one that is largely dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one that is\n\n8\n\nOver the past decade (2013Q1 through 2022Q4), the share of jobs in manufacturing was 8.6 percent for the U.S.\nand 12.5 percent for Ohio. In the 1990s (1990Q1 through 1999Q4), the share of jobs in manufacturing was 14.8\npercent for the U.S. and 19.9 percent for Ohio.\n\n\f8\ndiversifying into health care and education. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 20 percent of\nOhio’s jobs and “eds and meds” represented about 12 percent. Those shares have now nearly reversed.\nIn the past decade, the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen to under 13 percent and the share in “eds\nand meds” has risen to nearly 17 percent. Regions that have diversified their industrial base have\ngenerally fared better over time. And in general, since the pandemic, the economy in Ohio has performed\nsimilarly to the national economy. Employers have struggled to find workers throughout the postpandemic expansion, and since workforce growth tends to be slower in Ohio than in the nation because of\nslower population growth, it has been a quite challenging period for our employers. Rising inflation has\nalso plagued businesses and households here, too. But as is true in the nation, progress is being made.\nEmployers tell us they are finding it a bit easier to hire and retain workers now and their input costs are\nbeginning to moderate.\n\nPrudence\nOf course, I think we all recognize that there is heightened uncertainty around the economic outlook. We\nhave come a long way in tightening monetary policy, and some of those effects are yet to be felt in the\neconomy. In such an environment a policymaker has to be very prudent in collecting and assessing the\nwhole panoply of incoming information, not only official government statistics but also regional\ninformation gathered from our business, labor market, and community contacts; a variety of surveys on\neconomic and banking conditions; and higher-frequency data such as credit card spending. All of this\ninformation helps to determine not only where the economy has been but also where it is going, which is\nimportant since monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. As we gather and assess this\ninformation, I am prepared to change my views on the economy and appropriate monetary policy as\nchanges in conditions warrant.\n\nOne of the developments I will be particularly looking at is lending conditions. The U.S. banking system\nis sound and resilient. But in March, stresses emerged in a small number of banks, and Silicon Valley\n\n\f9\nBank and Signature Bank failed. The Fed, the Treasury, and the FDIC took swift action to ensure that\nthese stresses did not spill over to the rest of the U.S. banking and financial system.9 Had such contagion\noccurred, it could have undermined the public’s confidence in healthy banks and prevented them from\ndoing their important work to support the savings and credit needs of households and businesses. Banks\nnow have access to liquidity through a new Fed lending facility, as well as the traditional discount\nwindow, where they can borrow against sound collateral to ensure that they have sufficient liquidity to\nserve their customers.10 The stresses experienced in the banking system in March have eased, but the Fed\nis prepared to take further steps as necessary to ensure financial stability. In addition, Chair Powell has\ndirected the Federal Reserve Board’s vice chair of supervision, Michael Barr, to conduct an internal\nreview and to report by May 1 on Silicon Valley Bank’s failure, including the Federal Reserve’s\nsupervision and regulation of the bank.\n\nEven before the recent stresses, as interest rates moved up, banks had begun to tighten their credit\nstandards, making credit less available. This is the typical way in which monetary policy tightening\ntransmits to the broader economy. The recent tensions in the banking system could well result in banks\ntightening their credit standards even more, which could result in slower spending by households and\nbusinesses and a pullback in hiring. This would work in the same direction as tighter monetary policy.\nSo we will need to continue to assess the magnitude and duration of these effects on credit conditions to\nhelp us calibrate the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward. This is the prudent thing to do.\n\nSee the “Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC,” March 12, 2023.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm)\n9\n\n10\n\nMore information on the Bank Term Funding Program is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bank-term-funding-program.htm. More information on the discount\nwindow is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discountrate.htm.\n\n\f10\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, there has been significant tightening of monetary policy over the last year, and as a result,\nwelcome progress is being made in bringing demand into better balance with supply in product and labor\nmarkets and reducing inflation. This is good news. But inflation remains too high.\n\nGiven that some of the increases in rates and tightening in financial conditions have yet to be felt in the\neconomy, we need to be prudent in assessing all of the incoming economic and financial information\nwhen determining the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward. We are much closer to the end\nof the tightening journey than the beginning, and how much further tightening is needed will depend on\neconomic and financial developments and progress on our monetary policy goals.\n\nThat said, price stability is critical for the long-run health of the labor market, the overall economy, and\nthe stability of the financial system. So it would be a mistake to declare victory before the job is done.\nHere, I am reminded of the words of former Fed Chair Paul Volcker when he fought inflation in the\n1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation will only make any subsequent effort\nmore difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”11\n\nPaul A Volcker, “No Time for Backsliding,” remarks at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C., September\n25, 1981, p. 2.\n(https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/statements-speeches-paul-a-volcker-451/time-backsliding-8243)\n11\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMoney Marketeers of New York University, Inc.\nNew York, NY\nApril 4, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to speak this evening. I look\nforward to hearing what is on your minds, but first, I would like to present some prepared remarks on the\neconomy and monetary policy. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nAt its meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. Since the Fed began raising rates in March of last year, the cumulative\nincrease has been 475 basis points. In addition, the Fed has been allowing assets to run off its balance\nsheet in a systematic way according to the plan announced last May, and this is also helping to firm the\nstance of monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed has taken these monetary policy actions because inflation is too high and it is eroding U.S. living\nstandards. High inflation makes it hard for people to make ends meet. High inflation also imposes\nlonger-run costs on our economy. It distorts the decisions households and businesses make about getting\nan education or training for a new job, or investing in R&D or plants and equipment. In this way, high\ninflation can harm the pace of innovation, productivity growth, and the potential growth rate of the\neconomy. So it can have lasting detrimental effects on the economy.\n\nThe Fed is responsible for ensuring price stability. Fed policymakers are committed to bringing inflation\nback to our 2 percent goal. Given where we are on that journey, I plan to remain diligent in setting\nmonetary policy to return the economy to price stability in a timely way and to be judicious in balancing\nthe risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nThe U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. But during the two weeks leading up to the March\nFOMC meeting, stresses emerged in a small number of banks. The Fed, the Treasury, and the FDIC took\n\n\f2\nswift action to ensure that these stresses did not spill over to the rest of the U.S. banking and financial\nsystem. Had such contagion occurred it could have undermined the public’s confidence in healthy banks\nand prevented them from doing their important work to support the savings and credit needs of\nhouseholds and businesses. Banks now have access to liquidity through a new Fed lending facility, as\nwell as the traditional discount window, where they can borrow against sound collateral to ensure that\nthey have sufficient liquidity to serve their customers. The stresses experienced in the banking system in\nMarch have eased, but the Fed continues to carefully monitor conditions and is prepared to take further\nsteps as necessary to ensure financial stability.\n\nIn the past, when tensions like this have arisen in banking and financial markets, banks have tended to\ntighten credit availability, making it harder for households and businesses to borrow. In addition, if\nhouseholds and businesses become concerned about the outlook for the banking sector or the overall\neconomy, they could become more cautious in their spending. Going forward, Fed policymakers will\ncontinue to assess the magnitude and duration of these effects and their implications for the outlook for\ninflation and employment and, therefore, for appropriate monetary policy.\n\nEconomic Growth\nIncoming economic information over the first part of the year has pointed to resilience in underlying\ndemand in product and labor markets and persistence in inflation. Partly in response to higher interest\nrates, tighter lending standards at banks, and tighter overall financial conditions, economic activity has\nbegun to slow. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust\npace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021. Growth in the final quarter of last year was over 2-1/2 percent, but\nmuch of that was due to firms rebuilding inventories. Inventories aside, growth in real final sales was\nmore modest, just over 1 percent. The slowdown in activity is seen most clearly in the housing sector.\nResidential investment continues to decline sharply in response to higher mortgage rates, but real estate\nagents and homebuilders have told us that demand has begun to stabilize. There is still a longer-run\n\n\f3\nstructural shortage of available housing, which suggests less downward pressure on prices than one might\nexpect given the rise in interest rates. Construction contacts also indicated that they expect public-sector\nspending and future infrastructure spending to support activity.\n\nBusiness fixed investment in equipment and manufacturing activity have slowed, but a few of our\nbusiness contacts have said that they thought investment has been more resilient than expected given\nhigher interest rates. Indicators suggest that consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP,\ngrew at a relatively strong pace in the first quarter. This spending has been supported by strong\nhousehold balance sheets and income growth. Debt-to-income levels of households have been fairly\nstable, and, in the aggregate, households have been able to service their debt in the rising interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, disruptions in supply chains have generally improved, although not\nuniformly. Contacts report that bottlenecks have eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have\nshortened. This is welcome news because price pressures can be alleviated both through further\nmoderation in demand and further improvement in supply.\n\nLabor Markets\nEmployment growth has slowed over the past year, firms report that it is somewhat easier to find workers\nnow, and the rate at which people are quitting their jobs is moving down, which is usually is a sign of a\nmoderating labor market. Nonetheless, overall labor market conditions remain strong, with demand for\nworkers outpacing supply. Payroll job gains averaged over 400 thousand per month in January and\nFebruary, a pickup from the average monthly gain in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment\nrate remains a very low 3.6 percent, near where it has been for much of the past year. The number of job\nopenings has varied from month to month. They are down from their level a year ago, but the ratio of\n\n\f4\nopenings per unemployed worker has been running between 1.7 to 1.9 over the six months that ended in\nFebruary, compared with 1.2 in the six months before the pandemic started.\n\nRecent gains in prime-age labor force participation may be helping to ease the imbalance between labor\ndemand and supply. But this imbalance has put upward pressure on wages, and because labor costs\nconstitute a significant share of a business’s expenses, especially in the service sector, this imbalance has\nalso contributed to high inflation. Since workers’ wage gains generally have not kept up with inflation,\nmany workers are not better off in real terms. By some measures, wage pressures are beginning to ease,\nbut wages are still growing at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 to 5 percent. This is well above the level\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation given current estimates of trend productivity growth. Indeed, for wage\ngrowth at this pace to be consistent with price stability, trend productivity growth would need to be 2-1/2\nto 3 percent, instead of the current estimates of 1 to 1-1/2 percent. We have not seen any evidence that\ntrend productivity growth is rising; in fact, productivity growth has declined over the past year. So,\nworkers are still falling behind in their purchasing power and will continue to do so until we get the\neconomy on a sustained path back to price stability.\n\nInflation\nSeveral factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation that began in the spring of 2021 in the U.S. These\nfactors include the pandemic and how households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers\nresponded to it, and Russia’s war against Ukraine, which led to sharp increases in food and commodity\nprices. Imbalances arose between strong demand and constrained supply, and these led to significant\nupward pressures on prices in an environment of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nInflation remains too high and too stubborn. The February PCE inflation data showed some\nimprovement, but recall that, in January, the data were a bit stronger than analysts expected. So while the\nlevel of inflation is lower than it was last summer, in February, the year-over-year measures of both total\n\n\f5\nPCE inflation and core PCE inflation were in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent range, which is well above our 2\npercent goal. The story is the same with other measures of underlying inflation, such as the median and\ntrimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each\nmonth. Measured year-over-year, both of these measures are between 4-1/2 and 6 percent and have\nshown little to no improvement since their peaks last August.1\n\nThe disaggregated data show that the inflation stubbornness is due mainly to the prices of services.\nGoods inflation has been moving down over time, although it remains considerably above where it was\nbefore the pandemic. Shelter price inflation has not improved but the slowdown in housing activity and\nthe deceleration in rents in new leases will eventually show up in the inflation statistics. Inflation in core\nservices excluding shelter has not improved either. It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage inflation,\nand is a much larger share of the overall index than goods or housing, since consumers spend a larger\nshare of their income on these services.\n\nFor much of the pre-pandemic expansion, core goods inflation was slightly negative, on average, and\nfalling goods prices were pulling inflation down. By the end of that expansion, inflation was nearing our\ntarget. In January 2020, PCE inflation had reached 1.8 percent and core inflation had risen to 1.7 percent.\nThat reading reflected 0.75 percent deflation in core goods prices and 2.5 percent inflation in core\nservices prices. That is very different from today. Since the current period of high inflation started in the\nspring of 2021, core goods prices have been rising, and through last September, inflation in core goods\nexceeded inflation in core services. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation, we will need to\nsee continued sustained disinflation in both components.\n\n1\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx).\n\n\f6\n\nMy expectation is that with tighter financial conditions, demand in product and labor markets will\ncontinue to moderate. Output growth will likely be well below trend this year and pick up a bit next year.\nEmployment growth will slow, with the unemployment rate rising to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent by the end of\nthe year. So far, high inflation has not unanchored medium- and longer-term inflation expectations,\nwhich remain at levels reasonably consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The continued anchoring\nof inflation expectations is an important factor underpinning my outlook that we will see a meaningful\nimprovement in inflation this year, with inflation moving down to about 3-3/4 percent this year,\ncontinuing to improve next year, and reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. In my modal projection, to put\ninflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent and to keep inflation expectations anchored,\nmonetary policy moves somewhat further into restrictive territory this year, with the fed funds rate\nmoving above 5 percent and the real fed funds rate staying in positive territory for some time.\n\nMy forecast is similar to the modal forecasts of FOMC participants released two weeks ago, although I\nsee somewhat more persistent inflation pressures than the median forecast among participants. Of course,\nI also recognize that there is heightened uncertainty around the outlook and, in such an environment, it\nwill be particularly important to continue to collect and assess the whole panoply of incoming\ninformation, not only official government statistics but also regional information gathered from our\nbusiness, labor market, and community contacts; a variety of surveys on economic and banking\nconditions; and higher-frequency data such as credit card spending. All of this information can help us\ndetermine not only where the economy has been but where it is going, which is important when setting\nappropriate monetary policy since it affects the economy with a lag. The FOMC likes to say that its\npolicy decisions are “data dependent.” It would be wrong to interpret this phrase as saying that we will\nreact to one or two data points. Instead, I view “data dependent” as shorthand for saying that incoming\neconomic information informs my economic outlook and my assessment of risks, which, in turn, inform\nmy view of appropriate monetary policy. (You can see why we needed shorthand!)\n\n\f7\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has come an\nappreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one. We have taken\nactions to address the stresses that emerged last month in the banking system. Our decision in March to\nraise the fed funds rate by another 25 basis points reflected the persistence in underlying inflation and the\nneed to move policy into a sufficiently restrictive stance to return inflation to 2 percent over time.\n\nPrecisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and for how long policy will\nneed to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down,\nand that will depend on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being resolved, and price\npressures are easing. The FOMC indicated in its March statement that it anticipates that some additional\npolicy firming may be appropriate. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the\nFOMC will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary\npolicy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\n\nEven before the recent stresses, banks had begun to tighten their credit standards. Credit has become less\navailable as interest rates have risen. This is the typical way in which monetary policy tightening\ntransmits to the broader economy. The recent tensions in the banking system could well result in banks\nfurther tightening their credit standards, and households and businesses may become more cautious in\ntheir spending. Directionally, we know that credit conditions are likely going to be somewhat tighter, and\nwe will be assessing the magnitude and duration of these effects on the economic outlook to help us\ncalibrate the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward.\n\n\f8\nFinancial Stability\nLet me conclude by noting that this is standard operating procedure for monetary policy: evaluating the\nimplications of economic and financial developments for the economic outlook and adjusting the\nmonetary policy path if needed. This is different from using monetary policy to address the stresses in the\nbanking or financial system instead of pursuing our monetary policy goals.\n\nIn fact, both price stability and financial stability are important for a healthy economy, and I do not see a\ntradeoff between the two. Well-formulated and well-communicated monetary policy that achieves our\ndual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability supports financial stability by allowing\nhouseholds, firms, and financial institutions to make better investment, saving, borrowing, and lending\ndecisions. A healthy financial system provides valuable credit, risk-management, payment, and liquidity\nservices to households and businesses in support of a sound economy. An unstable financial system can\npropagate adverse macroeconomic shocks over broad economic sectors and over time to the detriment of\nmacroeconomic stability.\n\nBecause a safe, sound, and resilient banking system is of first-order importance to our economy, it is vital\nthat we effectively use our microprudential tools of regulation and supervision and our macroprudential\ntools, including stress tests, to keep the banking system safe, sound, and resilient. Doing so has the\nbenefit of allowing monetary policy to remain focused on bringing inflation back down to 2 percent in a\ntimely way. This is a very important duty because returning to price stability is necessary for the long-run\nhealth of the labor market, the overall economy, and the stability of the financial system.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\f"

Schoenholtz\nwith Matthew Luzzetti and Justin Weidner\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2023 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nSponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets\nAt the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to participate in this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum. I have\nattended many of the forums, and this is the fourth time I have had the honor of being on the program. So\nI can say based on experience that the forum always chooses a topic of utmost importance for monetary\npolicymaking and always successfully delivers a paper combining solid research and policy\nrecommendations. This year is no exception.\n\nOver the past year, in the wake of rising inflation, the FOMC has taken deliberate action to remove\nmonetary policy accommodation by raising the federal funds rate by 4-1/2 percentage points and reducing\nthe size of the Fed’s balance sheet through asset run-off. Returning the economy to price stability is an\nimperative for sustaining healthy labor markets and the U.S. standard of living. The very high inflation\nthe economy has experienced for almost two years has been painful for households and businesses,\nespecially those with fewer resources. High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy\nbecause it distorts the decisions households and businesses make about building human capital and\ninvesting in R&D, plants and equipment, and other forms of physical capital. These decisions ultimately\naffect the pace of innovation, productivity growth, the potential growth rate of the economy, and\nimprovement in our living standards.\n\nIncoming economic information shows that our monetary policy actions are having the intended effect of\nslowing demand and reducing price pressures. In addition, supply chain disruptions are easing. But\ninflation remains too high. So the paper is highly relevant for the task at hand as the FOMC manages the\nnecessary disinflation back to our 2 percent goal while minimizing the pain of the journey back to price\nstability.\n\nIn the time I have, I will comment on three aspects of the paper: the empirical estimation of the Phillips\ncurve, the role of inflation expectations, and the lessons for policymakers operating in an uncertain\n\n\f2\nenvironment. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Phillips Curve\nIn many inflation models used by central banks, inflation is driven by three key factors: a resource\nutilization gap or marginal cost of production; lagged inflation; and expectations of inflation. Different\nmodels put different weights on these fundamental factors, but empirical work across many specifications\nof such a Phillips curve relationship generally finds that inflation expectations matter and the resource\nutilization gap or slack matters when it is large. The finding that inflation expectations matter is an\nimportant reminder that estimates of a Phillips curve are dependent on the conduct of monetary policy and\nthat reduced-form Phillips curves are not structural.\n\nIt is not surprising that the estimated inflation dynamics over the period that includes the high inflation of\nthe 1960s and 1970s and the Volcker disinflation over 1979-1984 differ from those over the period of the\nGreat Moderation from 1985 through 2019 because inflation expectations were not well anchored in the\nearlier period but were in the latter period. Some of the difference could reflect the nature of the shocks\nthat hit the economy in each period, but it also reflects differences in how monetary policy was\nconducted. The experience of the 1960s and 1970s taught Fed policymakers the importance of setting\npolicy to prevent the unanchoring of inflation expectations and the role that an explicit numerical inflation\ntarget can play in keeping expectations anchored. Now, more generally, there is a greater appreciation of\nmonetary policy independence coupled with transparency and accountability, although that appreciation\ncan ebb and flow with economic developments and should not be taken for granted.\n\n[Figure 1]\nThe forum paper investigates inflation dynamics by estimating a nonlinear Phillips curve and then\nembedding that relationship in a simple economic model to simulate inflation since 2019. The authors’\n\n\f3\npreferred specification is estimated over the sample period from 1962 through 2019. It relates core PCE\ninflation to a measure of slack based on the vacancy-to-unemployment gap, v/u – (v/u)*, allowing the\ncoefficient on the gap to differ in hot labor markets (when the v/u gap is positive) and in cold labor\nmarkets (when the v/u gap is negative).\n\nThey find a statistically and economically significant positive relationship between inflation and the v/u\ngap in a hot labor market and a very small statistically insignificant negative relationship in a cold labor\nmarket.\n\n[Figure 2]\nThis result is the opposite of the findings of several papers in the literature. Two examples are Stock and\nWatson (2010) and Ashley and Verbrugge (2023). Stock and Watson (2010) documented a key stylized\nfact, namely, that inflation tends to decline during recessions. In their preferred inflation forecasting\nmodel, inflation is related to a stochastic trend inflation rate and an unemployment recession gap, the\ndifference between the current unemployment rate and the minimum unemployment rate over the current\nand previous 11 quarters. This gap variable measures the severity of economic contractions and the\nstochastic trend in their Phillips curve is meant to capture longer-term inflation expectations. While their\npaper is silent on what happens to inflation in booms, they find that inflation is lower in recessions, i.e.,\nwhen the labor market is cold. In normal times when the gap is small, inflation is driven by its stochastic\ntrend.\n\nIn a recent Cleveland Fed working paper, Ashley and Verbrugge (2023) estimate what they call a\npersistence-dependent Phillips curve, in which the unemployment gap is decomposed into a transitory\ncomponent, a moderately persistent component, and a highly persistent component. The moderately\npersistent component behaves similarly to the Stock and Watson unemployment recession gap, while the\nhighly persistent gap captures low-frequency movements in the business cycle, slowly turning positive\n\n\f4\nduring recessions and then negative during expansions. In their preferred empirical specification, these\nauthors find that inflation is lower when the moderately persistent component turns up during recessions.\nIn contrast, the highly persistent component of the unemployment gap typically has little association with\ninflation except when the unemployment rate is far below the natural rate. So in contrast to today’s paper,\na cold labor market is associated with lower inflation, and the labor market has to be very hot to boost\ninflation to the same degree.1\n\nBut even within the forum paper itself there is a tension between the estimated Phillips curve findings and\nthe historical analysis presented in Section 2. The historical analysis documents that the vast majority of\ndisinflations in the U.S. and in other advanced economies have been accompanied by recessions, a finding\nthat differs from the estimated Phillips curve results. Perhaps there is one way to reconcile at least part of\nthe tension. It could be that when labor markets are overheating and inflation is high, policymakers\ntighten monetary policy to bring labor demand into better balance with supply to alleviate inflation\npressures without intending to push the economy beyond that and into recession. Because this is a\ndifficult calibration exercise, policy tends to overshoot and the economy does end up in recession in most\ndisinflations. The implication is that policymakers need to be attentive to the lagged effects of policy\nactions as they bring inflation down.\n\nIf we take the forum paper’s estimated Phillips curve results at face value, another implication is that once\nthe economy overheats, it is going to be difficult for monetary policymakers to bring inflation down. This\nsupports the authors’ conclusion that monetary policy should be pre-emptive to avoid spurring a hot labor\nmarket in the first place.\n\n1\n\nOther examples of papers that estimate nonlinear Phillips curves include Barnes and Olivei (2003), Peach, Rich,\nand Cororaton (2011), and Harding, Lindé, and Trabandt (2023).\n\n\f5\nThe persistence of inflation underscores the important role inflation expectations play in inflation\ndynamics, which is my next topic.\n\nThe Role of Inflation Expectations\nInflation expectations have been a central factor in models of inflationary dynamics since the 1960s and\n1970s, with the seminal work of Phelps, Friedman, and Lucas, and they play a key role in New Keynesian\ndynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models used to inform and evaluate monetary policy.2, 3\nIn addition to their role in helping to forecast inflation, inflation expectations are also an indicator of how\ncredible the public finds the central bank’s commitment to achieving its policy goals.\n\nThe forum paper uses a behavioral equation for inflation expectations in which those expectations are\nhighly inertial and strongly anchored, unlike they were in the 1960s and 1970s, and it measures these\nexpectations using the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Anchored inflation expectations are highly\ndesirable; they mean that the public finds the longer-run inflation target credible and that fluctuations in\ninflation will eventually die out. But during a period of very high inflation, the stability of inflation\nexpectations cannot be taken for granted: the real world does not always cooperate with our modeling\nassumptions.4 Research indicates that there is considerable heterogeneity across and even within different\ngroups of agents.5 And inflation remains a challenging construct for consumers to fully understand.\n\n2\n\nSee Phelps (1967), Friedman (1968), Lucas (1972), Fuhrer and Olivei (2009), and Clark and Davig (2009).\n\n3\n\nWork done at the Cleveland Fed and by other researchers finds that including measures of inflation expectations in\ninflation forecasting models reduces the size of forecast errors. See Faust and Wright (2013), Zaman (2013), Chan,\nClark, and Koop (2018), and Tallman and Zaman (2020).\nMester (2022) discusses the role of inflation expectations in monetary policymaking from a practitioner’s\nperspective.\n4\n\n5\n\nFor example, the inflation expectations of consumers appear to vary with demographic and socioeconomic factors.\nAccording to the Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations measure, women’s inflation expectations\ntend to be higher than men’s and older respondents and more educated respondents also report higher inflation\nexpectations. The Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations measure, which started in 2021, is\nbased on a nationwide survey with more than 10,000 responses and is updated on a weekly basis. Instead of asking\nconsumers directly about overall inflation, the survey asks consumers how they expect the prices of the things they\nbuy to change over the next 12 months and how much their incomes would have to change for them to be able to\nafford the same consumption basket and be equally well-off. See Hajdini, et al. (2022).\n\n\f6\nCleveland Fed research finds that consumers regularly report higher forecasts for aggregate inflation than\nthey do for the disaggregated components of inflation and that their future spending plans are tied more to\ntheir forecasts for the components than for overall inflation.6\n\n[Figure 3]\nOver the past two years, short-term inflation expectations moved up with gasoline and food prices, which\ntend to have an outsized effect on households’ inflation expectations.7 As energy prices have fallen in\nrecent months, short-term inflation expectations have eased, although they remain well above their prepandemic levels. This also raises the possibility that if energy and food prices rise again, short-run\ninflation expectations could also rise again. Most measures of medium- and longer-term expectations are\nalso somewhat above their pre-pandemic levels, but they appear to be reasonably well anchored at levels\nconsistent with our 2 percent target.\n\n[Figure 4]\nIdentifying when longer-term expectations are becoming unanchored is not easy. Changes in the\nskewness of the distribution of responses to surveys of inflation expectations or increases in the\ndispersion between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the distribution can provide some indication that\nexpectations are becoming unmoored.8 As inflation rose, dispersion measures also rose. They are\nmoving back down now, suggesting that inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored. But that\nshould not be taken for granted.\n\n6\n\nSee Dietrich, et al. (2022).\n\n7\n\nFor the effect of salient prices on inflation expectations, see Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), Cavallo, Cruces,\nand Perez-Truglia (2017), D’Acunto, et al. (2021), and Campos, McMain, and Pedemonte (2022).\n8\n\nReis (2021) analyzes the degree and timing of the unanchoring of inflation expectations during the 1960s and\n1970s in the U.S. and discusses the use of dispersion as a sign of unanchoring.\n\n\f7\nIt is good to remember that inflation expectations are determined not only by movements in inflation but\nalso by policymakers’ actions to follow through on their strongly stated commitment to return inflation to\nits longer-run goal. The conduct of monetary policy matters, and research indicates that if policymakers\nare going to make an error, it is more costly to set policy assuming that inflation expectations are well\nanchored when they aren’t rather than the other way around.9 If inflation expectations were to become\nunanchored, their influence would offset the effect of any beneficial change in the resource gap.\nMonetary policy would then have to act more forcefully, and the return to price stability would be more\npainful and costly.\n\nThis brings me to my last topic, which concerns monetary policymaking in a world of uncertainty.\n\nMonetary Policymaking under Uncertainty\n[Figure 5]\nUncertainty is the norm, not the exception.10 The economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks that\ncan lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated. Economic data are measured with\nerror and can be revised over time. As the forum paper demonstrates, policymakers also have to contend\nwith model uncertainty. Competing models can be consistent with the observable data but can interpret\nthe data in different ways, producing different dynamics that are relevant for policymaking. Moreover,\nthe underlying structure of the economy can change over time, making some models more relevant in\ncertain periods than in others and complicating forecasting and policy setting in real time. In addition,\neven if one knew the correct model, some of the important conceptual elements in the model are not\ndirectly observable, e.g., the equilibrium interest rate, r*; slack, like the output gap or v/u gap used in the\n\n9\n\nSee De Pooter, et al. (2016).\n\n10\n\nMester (2016) discusses the role of uncertainty in monetary policymaking.\n\n\f8\npaper; the natural rate of unemployment, u*; and inflation expectations. These constructs have to be\nproxied and are subject to mismeasurement, which can affect policy decisions.11\n\n[Figure 6]\nBecause of these uncertainties, one should expect economic forecasts, and therefore the associated\nmonetary policy paths, to change over time. Those changes can reflect economic developments, a better\nunderstanding of the underlying structural elements of the economy, or a combination of both. For\nexample, in the pre-pandemic expansion, the FOMC learned over time that employment growth could be\nstronger and the unemployment rate lower without generating inflation than one would have thought\npossible based on the experience of past decades. As the FOMC learned, its assessments of the longerrun unemployment rate came down significantly over time. During this expansion, inflation moved\nhigher and proved to be more persistent than anticipated.\n\nBecause of uncertainty, it is useful for policymakers to look at a variety of models that fit the data and\nconsider policy prescriptions that perform well across those models. It is also helpful to look at the\nprescriptions from a variety of policy rules that are robust across various models and economic\ncircumstances.12\n\nScenario analysis should also play a larger role in policymaking. It is helpful to contemplate different\nways the economy could evolve and think about subjective probabilities across the scenarios. Hansen and\nSargent’s robust control approach confronts head-on the fact that models are only an approximation to\nreality and they show the benefit of choosing the policy that produces the best outcome in the worst-case\n\n11\n\nOrphanides has laid out a convincing case that mismeasurement of slack and other unobservables like the natural\nrate of interest led to monetary policy mistakes that contributed to the Great Inflation of the 1970s. See, for\nexample, Orphanides and Van Norden (2005) and Orphanides (2015).\n12\n\nThe Cleveland Fed publishes quarterly updates of the outcomes of a set of simple monetary policy rules across\nseveral forecasts. See Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2022).\n\n\f9\nscenario across models.13 I found scenario analysis particularly useful during the pandemic when the\nexpected path for the economy depended critically on how the pandemic would evolve.\n\nIn terms of the appropriate policy responses in a highly uncertain environment, some results in the\nliterature suggest that when policymakers confront more uncertainty either in their data or in their models,\nthey should be more cautious in acting, i.e., they should be more inertial in their responses.14 However,\nsubsequent research has shown that this is not generally true. Inertial policies can reduce the direct effect\nof the mismeasurement, but they can also carry forward policy errors generated by mismeasurement.\nSargent (1999) points out that caution does not necessarily mean doing less. When there is uncertainty, it\ncan be better for policymakers to act more aggressively because aggressive and pre-emptive action can\nprevent the worst-case outcomes from actually coming about.15 Indeed, I agree with the forum paper’s\nauthors that the FOMC acted appropriately to move the policy rate up quickly last year. A more languid\nreaction to high inflation would have led to worse outcomes.\n\nThe forum paper also makes a strong argument that policy should act pre-emptively to prevent inflation\nfrom rising and points out that because the FOMC failed to act pre-emptively in 2021 as inflation rose, it\nthen needed to act decisively in 2022 to stabilize inflation expectations. I agree that, in hindsight, the\nFOMC should have acted sooner, but I do not attribute the inaction to a change in views about the value\nof pre-emptive monetary policy as suggested by the authors.16 Even policy that is explicitly forward\n\n13\n\nSee Sargent (1998) and Hansen and Sargent (2001, 2007, and 2011).\n\n14\n\nMester (2016) discusses some of the literature.\n\n15\n\nGiannoni (2002 and 2007) shows policymakers who are averse to uncertainty will react more strongly to\nfluctuations in inflation and the output gap than if there were no uncertainty. They would put more weight on\nstabilizing inflation and the output gap and less weight on stabilizing the nominal interest rate. Walsh (2003, 2022)\npoints out that better economic outcomes are achieved by assuming that high inflation will be persistent and acting\naccordingly.\n16\n\nSome commentators have suggested that the revised monetary policy strategy adopted by the FOMC in August\n2020 and reaffirmed annually since then took a step back from pre-emptive policy. (See, e.g., Levy and Plosser,\n2020.) Instead, I view the changes in the strategy statement as an acknowledgment of the uncertainty around\nassessments of the level of maximum employment. Given that we don’t know where u* is, policymakers should not\n\n\f10\nlooking may end up not being appropriate ex post if the forecasts on which such policy is based are much\ntoo optimistic about the likely path for inflation. The FOMC’s inflation forecasts were overly optimistic\nabout inflation moving back down, and this contributed to maintaining a highly accommodative stance for\nmonetary policy. Indeed, inaction on the funds rate meant that policy was becoming even more\naccommodative as inflation rose.\n\nPutting these pieces together for the current economic environment, while it is welcome news to see some\nmoderation in inflation readings since last summer, the level of inflation matters and it is still too high.\nPolicy decisions need to consider the risk around the forecast but also the costs of continued high inflation\nto households, businesses, and the longer-run health of the economy. The forum paper’s projections and\nrecent research from the Cleveland Fed suggest that inflation could be more persistent than currently\nanticipated by many forecasters.17 I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the\ncosts of continued high inflation as being significant. So in my view, at this point with the labor market\nstill strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs\nof overshooting. But policy also needs to be forward looking, and as inflation comes down, I anticipate\nthat the balance of risks will shift.\n\nTo conclude, I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this fine paper, and I recommend that\neveryone read it. The authors draw several lessons from their work. Let me add another one, namely,\nthat the economy can evolve differently than expected and monetary policymakers should be prepared for\nthat.\n\nbase policy solely on what could be an outdated estimate of this construct. But if inflationary pressures are building,\npolicy can and should take pre-emptive action. As the strategy statement continues to acknowledge, monetary\npolicy actions tend to influence the economy with a lag. This means it can be costly if monetary policy allows an\naccommodative stance to remain in place when price pressures rise.\n17\n\nSee Verbrugge and Zaman (2023).\n\n\f11\nReferences\nAshley, Richard, and Randal J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nUkraine: One Year Later – Session I: Monetary Policy and Market Implications\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nUniversity of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee College of Business\nSarasota, FL\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me begin by thanking David Kotok and the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak at\ntoday’s conference. The GIC has a long tradition of organizing sessions to inform us about the important\nissues affecting the world’s economies. I am grateful that I have been able to participate in many GIC\nevents over the years.\n\nToday, my topic will be the outlook for the U.S. economy and the appropriate monetary policy settings\nthat will return our economy to price stability. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nBecause the Super Bowl was played just this past Sunday, I titled my talk “In It to Win It” because the\nFed is committed to getting inflation back to our 2 percent goal. But, of course, returning the economy to\nprice stability is not a game: it is an imperative for sustaining healthy labor markets and our standard of\nliving. The very high inflation the economy has experienced for almost two years has been painful for\nhouseholds and businesses, especially those with fewer resources, as they have had to cope with\nincreasing costs and make hard choices about where to spend their money. Organizations that offer\nservices to lower-income households have also been struggling with higher costs, limiting their ability to\noffer aid to as many people. High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy because it\ndistorts the decisions households and businesses make about building human capital and investing in\nR&D, plants and equipment, and other forms of physical capital. These decisions ultimately affect the\npace of innovation, productivity growth, the potential growth rate of the economy, and improvement in\nour living standards. Because of the negative costs of high inflation, the Fed is resolved and focused on\nreturning to price stability in a timely way: we are in it to win it.\n\nLast year, in the wake of very high inflation, the Fed took deliberate action to remove monetary policy\naccommodation. Over the course of 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, our policy rate, by\n\n\f2\n4-1/4 percentage points and began reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll\noff. At the meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC took another step and raised the target range of the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent and the balance-sheet reduction continues.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation, which started in the spring of 2021 in the U.S.,\nbut has also occurred in other advanced economies around the globe. These factors include the pandemic\nand how households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers responded to it, as well as\nRussia’s war against Ukraine. An imbalance arose between strong demand and constrained supply, which\nled to significant upward pressures on prices in an environment of accommodative monetary and fiscal\npolicy.\n\nIncoming economic information shows that our monetary policy actions are having the intended effect of\nslowing demand and reducing price pressures. In addition, supply chain disruptions are easing, which is\nalso helping to alleviate some of the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This is\ngood news, but further monetary policy action is needed to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\nEconomic growth slowed considerably last year, and I expect that growth will be well under trend this\nyear. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about\n5-3/4 percent in 2021. Growth in the final quarter of last year was almost 3 percent, but much of that was\ndue to firms rebuilding inventories. Abstracting from inventories, growth in real final sales was a more\nmodest 1-1/2 percent, suggesting some dampening in underlying momentum.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive sectors have been experiencing the sharpest slowdown. Residential investment\ncontinues to decline sharply in response to higher mortgage rates. Business fixed investment and\n\n\f3\nmanufacturing activity have slowed. Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, has held\nup, reflecting the strength in household balance sheets. But it has slowed from the robust pace seen in\n2021.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, supply chain disruptions have improved but not uniformly across\nsectors and products. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index fell\nappreciably during 2022, although it remains above its pre-pandemic level.1 Some of the improvement in\nthis index last month reflects better delivery times from China, consistent with China easing its zeroCOVID policy and reopening its economy. Our business contacts tell us that transportation bottlenecks\nand delivery times have improved compared to last year but that certain products, including computer\nchips and electric generators, remain difficult to source.\n\nLabor Markets\nDespite the slowdown in growth, labor market conditions remain strong, with labor demand continuing to\noutpace labor supply. After some moderation over the past year, there was a sizable gain in payrolls in\nJanuary, with the economy adding over 500 thousand jobs. The number of job openings moved down\nsomewhat over the past year, but there are still 1.9 openings per unemployed worker. The unemployment\nrate has been running at about 3.5 percent for the past year, a 50-year low, and it actually edged down in\nJanuary. Despite these strong numbers, anecdotal reports from our business contacts suggest that\nconditions are easing in the labor market, except in healthcare where significant hiring challenges remain\ndue to a national shortage of skilled and unskilled healthcare workers. Although they do not intend to\nreduce their workforces, many of our business contacts have tempered their demand for workers and\nthose that are hiring say it has become easier to find the workers they need.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index is available at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/overview.\n1\n\n\f4\nOn the supply side, labor force participation has stabilized below its pre-pandemic level. Over time, it has\nbecome apparent that this lower level of participation reflects structural factors such as the high level of\nretirements over the pandemic, reduced immigration, changes in preferences, and the difficulty in finding\naffordable childcare.\n\nAn indication that labor demand is outpacing labor supply is strong wage growth. Labor costs constitute\na significant share of a business’s expenses, especially in the service sector. The strong increase in wages\nhas contributed to higher inflation, yet workers’ wage gains generally have not kept up with inflation. So,\nin real terms, many workers are not better off. Recent data and reports from business contacts suggest\nthat as the economy has slowed, wage growth has started to moderate from its peak last summer.\nNonetheless, nominal wage growth is still around 4-1/2 percent. Given current estimates of trend\nproductivity growth of between 1 and 1-1/2 percent, this means wage growth is still about 1 to 1-1/2\npercentage points above the level consistent with price stability.\n\nThe imbalance between labor demand and supply will need to continue to shrink to alleviate wage\npressures. Since there is little reason to think that labor force participation will increase significantly in\nthe coming months, labor demand will need to moderate further to reduce the imbalance. I expect that\nwith the economy growing well below trend, the labor market will cool off, with slower employment\ngrowth and a rise in the unemployment rate. But this moderation in labor demand could come mainly\nfrom firms deciding not to add to their payrolls rather than cutting their staffs. Indeed, many contacts\nhave told me they plan to do all they can to retain workers through the slowdown, given how hard hiring\nhas been over the past couple of years. This suggests we will see less of an increase in the unemployment\nrate than is typical in an economic slowdown.\n\nInflation\nInflation remains well above our goal of 2 percent. Recent monthly readings show inflation has eased\n\n\f5\nfrom its high point last summer, and short-term inflation expectations have moved down with it. In\nDecember, the year-over-year measure of headline PCE inflation moderated to 5 percent, compared to 7\npercent in June, with declining energy prices contributing to the decline in overall inflation. Underlying\ninflation measures have also shown some improvement. In December, core PCE inflation was about\n4-1/2 percent compared to 5 percent in June. Looking at the most recent 3-month period, core PCE\ninflation is down to 3 percent. The median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, which exclude\ncomponents with the most extreme movements each month, have also improved in recent months but to a\nlesser extent.2\n\nThe improvement in the monthly readings in core inflation has come from the goods sector, where PCE\ngoods prices fell about 3 percent, annualized, over the past three months. Some of that decline reflected\nan unsustainably sharp drop in used car prices. So goods inflation is likely to move up in coming months.\nShelter price inflation has not improved, but it is expected to ease later in the year as housing activity\ncontinues to weaken and the deceleration in rents in new leases passes through to the inflation measures.\nCore services inflation excluding shelter has not improved. It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage\ninflation, and has a large share in the overall index, since consumers spend a larger share of their income\non services than on goods.\n\nFor much of the pre-pandemic expansion, core goods inflation was slightly negative, on average, and\nfalling goods prices were pulling inflation down. By the end of that expansion, inflation was nearing our\ntarget. In January 2020, PCE inflation had reached 1.8 percent and core inflation had risen to 1.7 percent.\nThat reading reflected 0.75 percent deflation in core goods prices and 2.5 percent inflation in core\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate.

That is very different from today. In the current period of high inflation, which began in\nthe spring of 2021, core goods prices have been rising, and for much of this period until recently, inflation\nin core goods has exceeded inflation in core services. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent\ninflation, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation in both components.\n\nMy expectation is that we will see a meaningful improvement in inflation this year and further\nimprovement over the following year, with inflation reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. But my outlook\nis contingent on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has come an\nappreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one, but I believe\nwe have more work to do. Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go and for how\nlong policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations\nare moving down, and that will depend on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being\nresolved, and price pressures are easing. At this juncture, the incoming data have not changed my view\nthat we will need to bring the fed funds rate above 5 percent and hold it there for some time to be\nsufficiently restrictive to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent. Indeed, at our\nmeeting two weeks ago, setting aside what financial market participants expected us to do, I saw a\ncompelling economic case for a 50-basis-point increase, which would have brought the top of the target\nrange to 5 percent.\n\nMy view of appropriate policy is contingent on my economic outlook, which is informed by incoming\ndata, the real-time reconnaissance provided by our regional contacts, and a variety of economic models\nand analyses. The FOMC likes to say that its policy decisions are data dependent, but that doesn’t mean\n\n\f7\nwe react to one or two data points. Instead, I view “data dependent” as shorthand for saying that\nincoming economic information informs my economic outlook and assessment of risks, which, in turn,\ninforms my view of appropriate monetary policy.\n\nIn addition to my economic outlook, my policy views are also importantly influenced by riskmanagement considerations, including the risks to the economic outlook and my assessment of the costs\nof continued high inflation to households, businesses, and the longer-run health of the economy.\n\nIt is welcome news to see some moderation in inflation readings since last summer, but the level of\ninflation matters and it is still too high. January’s CPI inflation report showed a jump in the monthly rate\nof overall inflation and no improvement in underlying inflation. The report provides a cautionary tale\nagainst concluding too soon that inflation is on a timely and sustained path back to 2 percent.\n\nI continue to see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside for a number of reasons. Russia’s\ncontinuing war in Ukraine adds uncertainty to the inflation picture, particularly for food and energy\nprices. While energy prices have moved down, partly because of mild winter weather in Europe, they\ncould move up again, as could food prices. Indeed, in January, energy prices in the CPI rose strongly and\nfood prices also advanced. These items constitute a sizable share of the consumption basket for many\nhouseholds, particularly those with lower incomes. They also influence short-term inflation expectations.\n\nChina is another source of risk. On the one hand, the reopening of China is helping to ease supply chain\ndisruptions. But China is also a major world economy and increasing demand there will put upward\npressure on commodity prices.\n\nSeveral private-sector forecasters do not expect inflation to return to 2 percent until sometime next year.\nAccording to the median in the December FOMC Summary of Economic Projections, this goal will not\n\n\f8\nbe reached until 2025.3 If that comes to pass, it means that inflation will have been above 2 percent for\nover 4 years, and well above 2 percent for much of that time. Even that forecast could turn out to be\noptimistic. Some recent research by economists at the Cleveland Fed presents a plausible case, based on\na model and historical relationships in the data, that inflation could end up being much more persistent\nthan current projections, despite the actions the FOMC has taken.4 While this research has not altered my\nview that there will be material improvement in inflation this year, it does inform my view that the risks\nto inflation remain on the upside.\n\nThe upside risks to inflation and historical experience suggest to me that the costs of undershooting on\npolicy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting. Under-tightening raises\nthe risk that inflation will settle in stubbornly above our goal, imposing both short-run and long-run costs\non households and businesses. It could result in longer-term inflation expectations moving higher, which\nwould make it much harder and more costly to return to price stability. Over-tightening also has costs,\nbut if inflation begins to move down faster than anticipated, we can react appropriately.\n\nGiven the risks and costs, we need to be prepared to move the federal funds rate higher if the upside risks\nto inflation are realized and inflation fails to moderate as expected or if the imbalances between demand\nand supply in product and labor markets persist longer than anticipated.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, inflation remains too high and it is the responsibility of the FOMC to bring it down.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nFinancial Executives International of Northeast Ohio\nand\nThe Association for Corporate Growth Cleveland\nCleveland, OH\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\nThe remarks on the national economy and monetary policy are the same as those delivered earlier on\nFebruary 16, 2023.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Financial Executives International of Northeast Ohio and the Association for Corporate Growth\nCleveland for inviting me to speak this evening. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland. As you know, the Cleveland Fed represents the Federal Reserve System’s Fourth\nDistrict, which comprises the state of Ohio and portions of Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.\nAs president of the Cleveland Fed, I like to engage with a variety of people from around the District to get\na better sense of what is happening on the ground in our economy. These insights are more timely than\nthe official government statistics, and I share the economic reconnaissance gathered from our business,\nlabor, consumer, and community contacts with my colleagues at Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) meetings so that it can inform the setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThis evening, my topic will be the outlook for the U.S. and Ohio economy and the appropriate monetary\npolicy settings that will return our economy to price stability. The views I present will be my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nBecause the Super Bowl was played just this past Sunday, I titled my talk “In It to Win It” because the\nFed is committed to getting inflation back to our 2 percent goal. But, of course, returning the economy to\nprice stability is not a game: it is an imperative for sustaining healthy labor markets and our standard of\nliving. The very high inflation the economy has experienced for almost two years has been painful for\nhouseholds and businesses, especially those with fewer resources, as they have had to cope with\nincreasing costs and make hard choices about where to spend their money. Organizations that offer\nservices to lower-income households have also been struggling with higher costs, limiting their ability to\noffer aid to as many people. High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy because it\ndistorts the decisions households and businesses make about building human capital and investing in\n\n\f2\nR&D, plants and equipment, and other forms of physical capital. These decisions ultimately affect the\npace of innovation, productivity growth, the potential growth rate of the economy, and improvement in\nour living standards. Because of the negative costs of high inflation, the Fed is resolved and focused on\nreturning to price stability in a timely way: we are in it to win it.\n\nLast year, in the wake of very high inflation, the Fed took deliberate action to remove monetary policy\naccommodation. Over the course of 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, our policy rate, by\n4-1/4 percentage points and began reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll\noff. At the meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC took another step and raised the target range of the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent and the balance-sheet reduction continues.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation, which started in the spring of 2021 in the U.S.,\nbut has also occurred in other advanced economies around the globe. These factors include the pandemic\nand how households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers responded to it, as well as\nRussia’s war against Ukraine. An imbalance arose between strong demand and constrained supply, which\nled to significant upward pressures on prices in an environment of accommodative monetary and fiscal\npolicy.\n\nIncoming economic information shows that our monetary policy actions are having the intended effect of\nslowing demand and reducing price pressures. In addition, supply chain disruptions are easing, which is\nalso helping to alleviate some of the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This is\ngood news, but further monetary policy action is needed to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\n\f3\nEconomic growth slowed considerably last year, and I expect that growth will be well under trend this\nyear. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about\n5-3/4 percent in 2021. Growth in the final quarter of last year was almost 3 percent, but much of that was\ndue to firms rebuilding inventories. Abstracting from inventories, growth in real final sales was a more\nmodest 1-1/2 percent, suggesting some dampening in underlying momentum.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive sectors have been experiencing the sharpest slowdown. Residential investment\ncontinues to decline sharply in response to higher mortgage rates. Business fixed investment and\nmanufacturing activity have slowed. Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, has held\nup, reflecting the strength in household balance sheets. But it has slowed from the robust pace seen in\n2021.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, supply chain disruptions have improved but not uniformly across\nsectors and products. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index fell\nappreciably during 2022, although it remains above its pre-pandemic level.1 Some of the improvement in\nthis index last month reflects better delivery times from China, consistent with China easing its zeroCOVID policy and reopening its economy. Our business contacts tell us that transportation bottlenecks\nand delivery times have improved compared to last year but that certain products, including computer\nchips and electric generators, remain difficult to source.\n\nLabor Markets\nDespite the slowdown in growth, labor market conditions remain strong, with labor demand continuing to\noutpace labor supply. After some moderation over the past year, there was a sizable gain in payrolls in\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index is available at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/overview.\n1\n\n\f4\nJanuary, with the economy adding over 500 thousand jobs. The number of job openings moved down\nsomewhat over the past year, but there are still 1.9 openings per unemployed worker. The unemployment\nrate has been running at about 3.5 percent for the past year, a 50-year low, and it actually edged down in\nJanuary. Despite these strong numbers, anecdotal reports from our business contacts suggest that\nconditions are easing in the labor market, except in healthcare where significant hiring challenges remain\ndue to a national shortage of skilled and unskilled healthcare workers. Although they do not intend to\nreduce their workforces, many of our business contacts have tempered their demand for workers and\nthose that are hiring say it has become easier to find the workers they need.\n\nOn the supply side, labor force participation has stabilized below its pre-pandemic level. Over time, it has\nbecome apparent that this lower level of participation reflects structural factors such as the high level of\nretirements over the pandemic, reduced immigration, changes in preferences, and the difficulty in finding\naffordable childcare.\n\nAn indication that labor demand is outpacing labor supply is strong wage growth. Labor costs constitute\na significant share of a business’s expenses, especially in the service sector. The strong increase in wages\nhas contributed to higher inflation, yet workers’ wage gains generally have not kept up with inflation. So,\nin real terms, many workers are not better off. Recent data and reports from business contacts suggest\nthat as the economy has slowed, wage growth has started to moderate from its peak last summer.\nNonetheless, nominal wage growth is still around 4-1/2 percent. Given current estimates of trend\nproductivity growth of between 1 and 1-1/2 percent, this means wage growth is still about 1 to 1-1/2\npercentage points above the level consistent with price stability.\n\nThe imbalance between labor demand and supply will need to continue to shrink to alleviate wage\npressures. Since there is little reason to think that labor force participation will increase significantly in\nthe coming months, labor demand will need to moderate further to reduce the imbalance. I expect that\n\n\f5\nwith the economy growing well below trend, the labor market will cool off, with slower employment\ngrowth and a rise in the unemployment rate. But this moderation in labor demand could come mainly\nfrom firms deciding not to add to their payrolls rather than cutting their staffs. Indeed, many contacts\nhave told me they plan to do all they can to retain workers through the slowdown, given how hard hiring\nhas been over the past couple of years. This suggests we will see less of an increase in the unemployment\nrate than is typical in an economic slowdown.\n\nInflation\nInflation remains well above our goal of 2 percent. Recent monthly readings show inflation has eased\nfrom its high point last summer, and short-term inflation expectations have moved down with it. In\nDecember, the year-over-year measure of headline PCE inflation moderated to 5 percent, compared to 7\npercent in June, with declining energy prices contributing to the decline in overall inflation. Underlying\ninflation measures have also shown some improvement. In December, core PCE inflation was about\n4-1/2 percent compared to 5 percent in June. Looking at the most recent 3-month period, core PCE\ninflation is down to 3 percent. The median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, which exclude\ncomponents with the most extreme movements each month, have also improved in recent months but to a\nlesser extent.2\n\nThe improvement in the monthly readings in core inflation has come from the goods sector, where PCE\ngoods prices fell about 3 percent, annualized, over the past three months. Some of that decline reflected\nan unsustainably sharp drop in used car prices. So goods inflation is likely to move up in coming months.\nShelter price inflation has not improved, but it is expected to ease later in the year as housing activity\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx).\n\n\f6\ncontinues to weaken and the deceleration in rents in new leases passes through to the inflation measures.\nCore services inflation excluding shelter has not improved. It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage\ninflation, and has a large share in the overall index, since consumers spend a larger share of their income\non services than on goods.\n\nFor much of the pre-pandemic expansion, core goods inflation was slightly negative, on average, and\nfalling goods prices were pulling inflation down. By the end of that expansion, inflation was nearing our\ntarget. In January 2020, PCE inflation had reached 1.8 percent and core inflation had risen to 1.7 percent.\nThat reading reflected 0.75 percent deflation in core goods prices and 2.5 percent inflation in core\nservices prices. That is very different from today. In the current period of high inflation, which began in\nthe spring of 2021, core goods prices have been rising, and for much of this period until recently, inflation\nin core goods has exceeded inflation in core services. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent\ninflation, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation in both components.\n\nMy expectation is that we will see a meaningful improvement in inflation this year and further\nimprovement over the following year, with inflation reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. But my outlook\nis contingent on appropriate monetary policy. Before I turn to monetary policy, let me discuss the Ohio\neconomy.\n\nOhio Economy\nOhio is the seventh largest economy in the nation in terms of real gross state product. The path of a\nregional economy reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks that have hit it and the broader\nU.S. economy. Manufacturing, and within manufacturing, autos and auto parts, still constitute an\nimportant part of Ohio’s economy. Indeed, Ohio is still one of the largest producers of motor vehicles\namong states, and the recent investment announcements from Intel and LG Energy Solution suggest that\n\n\f7\nautos will remain an important sector here. But the state has become more diversified over the past 40\nyears.\n\nThe share of employment in manufacturing has been on a longer-term downward trend, at both the\nregional and the national level. Compared to the nation, manufacturing represents a larger share of\npayroll jobs in Ohio, but that differential has fallen over time.3 And Ohio’s economy has been\ntransitioning from one that is largely dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one that is\ndiversifying into healthcare and education. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 20 percent of\nOhio’s jobs and “eds and meds” represented about 12 percent. Those shares have now nearly reversed.\nIn the past decade, the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen to under 13 percent and the share in “eds\nand meds” has risen to nearly 17 percent. Regions that have diversified their industrial base have\ngenerally fared better over time. And in general, over the pandemic, the economy in Ohio has performed\nsimilarly to the national economy. Both Ohio and the U.S. experienced sharp drops in activity when the\neconomy shut down, and since the trough in activity in the second quarter of 2020 through the third\nquarter of last year, both experienced similar annualized growth rates of between 6 and 7 percent.\n\nAs in the nation, employers in Ohio have struggled to find workers throughout the pandemic. And in\nOhio, workforce growth tends to be slower than in the nation due to slower population growth. So this\nhas been a very challenging period for employers. The Ohio labor market remains very tight. Ohio’s\nunemployment rate was about 4-1/4 percent in December, the lowest it has been in two decades. And\nthere were almost one-and-a-half jobs available for every unemployed worker in Ohio, well above the\nlevel in the pre-pandemic expansion when the labor market was also tight. The rising cost and wage\npressures experienced by businesses in Ohio have led them to raise the prices they charge to their\n\n3\n\nOver the past decade, the share of jobs in manufacturing was 8.6 percent for the U.S. and 12.5 percent for Ohio. In\nthe 1990s, the share of jobs in manufacturing was 14.8 percent for the U.S. and 19.9 percent for Ohio.\n\n\f8\ncustomers, and most say they have had little pushback in this high inflation environment. This gives me a\nnatural segue to discuss monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has come an\nappreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one, but I believe\nwe have more work to do.

Instead, I view “data dependent” as shorthand for saying that\nincoming economic information informs my economic outlook and assessment of risks, which, in turn,\ninforms my view of appropriate monetary policy.\n\n\f9\nIn addition to my economic outlook, my policy views are also importantly influenced by riskmanagement considerations, including the risks to the economic outlook and my assessment of the costs\nof continued high inflation to households, businesses, and the longer-run health of the economy.\n\nIt is welcome news to see some moderation in inflation readings since last summer, but the level of\ninflation matters and it is still too high.

I do not view\nthe current situation as one in which there is a tradeoff between our two monetary policy goals because\nreturning to price stability in a timely way is the best way to ensure a healthy labor market over the longer\nrun. So I plan to remain diligent in setting monetary policy to return the economy to price stability and to\nbe judicious in balancing the risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nIn short, I remain in it to win it.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMarkus’ Academy\nPrinceton Bendheim Center for Finance\nPrinceton University\nPrinceton, NJ\n(via videoconference)\nNovember 10, 2022\n\n\f1\ndiligent (adj): having or showing care and conscientiousness in one’s work or duties\n\nI thank Markus Brunnermeier for inviting me to speak in the webinar series he runs as director of the\nPrinceton Bendheim Center for Finance. I make it a point to listen to his webcast, so it is a real honor to\nparticipate in this series. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLast week, the FOMC raised its target range of the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 3-3/4 to 4\npercent. We also indicated that we anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be\nappropriate in order to attain a monetary policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2\npercent. Given the level and persistence of inflation, the journey back to 2 percent inflation will likely\ntake some time. The FOMC is also continuing the process of reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet\nby allowing assets to roll off, which also helps to firm the stance of monetary policy.\n\n[Figure 1. Federal funds rate]\nThe move last week was the fourth 75-basis-point increase in as many meetings and the funds rate target\nis now 375 basis points higher than it was at the start of the year. Compared to history, this has been a\nbrisk pace of increases in our policy rate. But compared to history, the economy is experiencing very\nhigh and persistent inflation, and the real policy rate is just beginning to move into restrictive territory.\nNonetheless, overall financial conditions are tighter than at the start of the year: Treasury yields,\nmortgage rates, and credit spreads are higher, the dollar has appreciated, and equity prices are lower.\n\n[Figure 2. Inflation, year-over-year]\nIndeed, unacceptably high and persistent inflation remains the key challenge facing the U.S. economy.\nInflation rates remain at 40-year highs. Measured year-over-year, in September, PCE inflation was still\nrunning over 6 percent and core PCE inflation moved up in September to over 5 percent. The median and\n\n\f2\ntrimmed-mean measures, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each month, tell\na similar story of persistently high inflation.1\n\n[Figure 3. Inflation, 3-month change, annualized]\nA positive sign is that the three-month changes in underlying inflation measures are lower now than they\nwere in June, although they remain high. Other positive signs are that commodity prices have moved\ndown and goods inflation has begun to ease. This morning’s October CPI report also suggests some\neasing in overall and core inflation. On the other hand, services inflation, which tends to be sticky, has\nnot yet shown signs of slowing. In addition, inflation continues to be broad-based. In September’s PCE\ninflation report, the prices of about half of the items people buy were at least 5 percent higher than they\nwere a year ago, and we’ve seen little improvement in this share. Inflation is particularly difficult for\npeople in lower-income households, who spend a larger share of their income on essentials like food,\nshelter, and energy, components that have seen some of the largest price increases.\n\n[Figure 4. GDP growth and sectors]\nIn order for inflation to fall, there will need to be further slowing in product and labor markets, bringing\ndemand into better balance with supply to alleviate price pressures. We are beginning to see demand in\nproduct markets slowing, partly in response to higher interest rates. Real output contracted in the first\nhalf of the year. It grew in the third quarter, but final sales to private domestic purchasers were\nessentially flat. Growth in consumer spending slowed and residential investment fell significantly. While\nequipment spending grew at a healthy pace in the third quarter, readings of new orders from the ISM and\nregional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys indicate that equipment spending is likely to slow in the\ncoming months. On the supply side, improvement in supplier delivery times and anecdotal reports from\n\n1\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx)\n\n\f3\nmy business contacts indicate some welcome easing in supply bottlenecks. On balance, I expect real\nGDP growth to be well below trend this year and next year.\n\n[Figure 5. Employment growth and the unemployment rate]\nThere has been a slight moderation in labor market conditions, but the labor market remains tight. Job\ngains have slowed to an average of about 290 thousand per month over the past three months compared to\nabout 540 thousand per month over the comparable period a year ago and job openings are lower than\nthey were in March. Nonetheless, there are still almost two openings per unemployed person, which is\nwell above the level in the strong labor market in 2019. And even with some slowing in output growth,\nbusiness contacts continue to report that they cannot find the workers they need. The unemployment rate,\nat 3.7 percent, is still very low by historical standards.\n\n[Figure 6. Employment Cost Index]\nAnother indication that labor demand is outpacing labor supply is strong wage growth. The year-overyear growth rate of the employment cost index is 5 percent, well above the level consistent with price\nstability, based on estimates of trend productivity growth.\n\nAlthough growth is slowing, there continue to be some upside risks to the inflation forecast. Russia’s\ncontinuing war against Ukraine could mean gas and energy prices move higher again this winter and next\nwinter. And I remain cognizant of the fact that economists’ forecasts – private sector, the FOMC’s, and\nmy own – have underestimated the level of inflation and its persistence for almost two years.\nNonetheless, I do expect inflation to begin to slow meaningfully next year and the following year,\nreaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. This is because the FOMC is strongly committed to returning the\neconomy to price stability. We will be diligent in making that happen, that is, we will proceed with care\nand conscientiousness.\n\n\f4\n[Figure 7. Near-term and longer-term inflation expectations]\nThe behavior of longer-term inflation expectations reflects that commitment. Near-term expectations\nhave risen significantly with actual inflation, and they have fallen in recent months as gasoline prices\nhave declined. Inflation expectations over the longer term have risen much less. They remain reasonably\nwell anchored at levels consistent with our goal and that should help to lower inflation without as large of\na slowdown in activity. However, we cannot take that anchoring for granted. The longer actual inflation\nand near-term inflation expectations remain elevated, the greater the risk that longer-term inflation\nexpectations become unanchored and high inflation permeates wage- and price-setting behavior and\ninvestment decisions, making it much more costly to return inflation to our goal.\n\n[Figure 8. November FOMC statement forward guidance]\nWe have moved rates up expeditiously this year, starting from a very accommodative stance to a stance\nthat is becoming restrictive. The focus had been on how quickly we could get to that restrictive stance.\nNow the focus can shift to the appropriate level of restrictiveness that will return the economy to price\nstability in a timely way. Given the current level of inflation, its broad-based nature, and its persistence, I\nbelieve monetary policy will need to become more restrictive and remain restrictive for a while in order to\nput inflation on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. As indicated in the FOMC statement last\nweek, in determining the pace of future increases, the Committee will take into account the cumulative\ntightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and\ninflation, and economic and financial developments. All of these factors figure into the economic outlook\nand risks around the outlook, which inform our policy decisions.\n\nPrecisely how much higher the fed funds rate will need to go and for how long policy will need to remain\nrestrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down, which\ndepends on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being resolved, and price pressures are\neasing. To help me make the assessment of how high and how long, I will be looking at a variety of\n\n\f5\nincoming information and data, including the official statistics, survey evidence, and reports from our\nbusiness, labor market, and community contacts, which are more forward looking than other data sources.\nIn December, the Committee will be releasing a new set of economic projections, which will incorporate\neach participant’s thinking about the appropriate path of policy.\n\nThe transition back to price stability will take some time and will not be without some pain. It is likely\nthat there will continue to be higher-than-normal levels of financial market volatility, which can be\ndifficult to navigate. With growth likely to be well below trend, it could easily turn negative for a time.\nBusiness contacts tell us that given how hard it has been to attract and retain workers over the last two\nyears, they intend to keep their workers even as the economy slows. If so, we could see less of an\nincrease in the unemployment rate than is typical in an economic slowdown. However, it is also possible\nthat the unemployment rate could go up more than anticipated and this would impose difficulties on\nhouseholds and businesses.\n\nBut it is important to remember that the current very high inflation is painful as well, as less well-off\npeople and businesses struggle to make ends meet. Moreover, we should not underestimate the\nconsequences of continued elevated inflation on the long-run health of the economy. Without price\nstability, businesses and households have to divert their attention to trying to preserve the purchasing\npower of their money. It becomes more difficult to plan for the future and to make long-term\ncommitments, and decisions regarding investments in physical and human capital are distorted. Without\nprice stability we will not be able to sustain healthy labor market conditions over the medium and long\nrun, which is inconsistent with the maximum employment part of our dual mandate. This means that\ncontinued high inflation can have negative long-run implications for an economy’s potential growth rate\nand standard of living. So returning the economy to price stability remains our priority.\n\n\f6\nAs is always the case when we are transitioning monetary policy, we will need to continue to weigh the\nrisks of tightening too much against the risks of tightening too little. Tightening too much would slow the\neconomy more than necessary and entail higher costs than needed. Tightening too little would allow high\ninflation to persist, with short- and long-run consequences, and necessitate a much more costly journey\nback to price stability. We will need to be very diligent in setting monetary policy to return the economy\nto price stability and be judicious in balancing these risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nDespite the moves we have made so far, given that inflation has consistently proven to be more persistent\nthan expected and there are significant costs of continued high inflation, I currently view the larger risks\nas coming from tightening too little. As policy moves further into restrictive territory, the effects of our\ncumulative tightening will work through to the broader economy, and I anticipate that we will see\ninflation pressures ease. At that point, I expect that my view of the balance of these risks will shift, and I\nwill welcome that shift because it will mean that inflation is moving down in a meaningful way.\n\n\fFigures for\n“A Diligent Return to Price Stability”\nLoretta J.

            "content": "An Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy:\nPerseverance in Returning to Price Stability\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSignature Luncheon\nEconomic Club of New York\nNew York, NY\nOctober 11, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Economic Club of New York for the opportunity to speak with you today. I am looking\nforward to the dialog. It is likely no surprise that I will focus my prepared remarks on inflation and how\nmonetary policymakers will persevere in fostering a return to price stability. The views I present will be\nmy own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\nUnacceptably high and persistent inflation remains the key challenge facing the U.S. economy. Inflation\nhas been running well above 2 percent for almost a year and a half, and the risks to inflation forecasts are\nskewed to the upside. Everyone is feeling the brunt of high inflation. It is imposing a particularly\nonerous burden on those households and businesses that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for\nessentials like food, gasoline, and shelter. Lower-income households spend a higher proportion of their\nincome on these essentials, and these components have had some of the strongest price increases. We\nhave moved from a situation in which households and businesses could be rationally inattentive to\ninflation to one in which inflation is on everyone’s mind, with lower-income households having to make\nhard choices about how to spend their money to make ends meet.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy. It is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain\nhealthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive\nand live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. Without price stability, businesses and households\nhave to divert attention to trying to preserve the purchasing power of their money, and it becomes more\ndifficult to plan for the future and to make long-term commitments and investments. Hence, high\ninflation can have negative long-run implications for an economy’s potential growth rate and standard of\nliving.\n\n\f2\nThe FOMC is strongly committed to using its tools to return the economy to price stability and it will\npersevere to make this happen. We are taking decisive action to remove monetary policy accommodation\nto bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and labor markets. Since\nMarch, the FOMC has reduced monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range of the fed\nfunds rate by 3 percentage points and by reducing assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet.\n\nGiven the current level of inflation, its broad-based nature, and its persistence, I believe monetary policy\nwill need to become more restrictive in order to put inflation on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent.\nGiven appropriately restrictive financial conditions, my modal outlook is that inflation will move down\nappreciably next year, to about 3-1/2 percent, and continue to decline, reaching our 2 percent goal in\n2025. I anticipate that the return to price stability will entail a period of output growth that is well below\ntrend over the next two years. This below-trend growth will lead to slower employment growth, with the\nunemployment rate moving up to 4-1/2 percent by the end of next year and up a bit more in 2024. We are\nlikely to experience higher-than-normal levels of financial market volatility as well. At this point, indices\nconstructed by the St. Louis Fed and the Kansas City Fed point to low levels of financial stress, but we\nwill need to remain attentive to financial vulnerabilities.1 With growth well below trend over the next\ncouple of years, it is possible that a shock could push the U.S. economy into recession for a time. None\nof this is painless, but the high inflation we are experiencing is already inflicting pain on many people.\nThe necessary costs incurred now for the economy to transition back to price stability are much lower\nthan the costs borne later were inflation to become embedded in the economy, influencing wage- and\nprice-setting behavior, investment decisions, and longer-term productivity growth. Perhaps Paul Volcker\nsaid it best as he fought inflation in the 1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation\nwill only make any subsequent effort more difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”2\n\n1\n\nThe St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index is available at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI3. The Kansas\nCity Financial Stress Index is available at https://www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/kansas-city-financialstress-index/current-release/.\nSee Paul A. Volcker, “No Time for Backsliding,” remarks at the National Press Club, Washington, DC, September\n25, 1981, p. 2. (https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/statements-speeches-paul-a-volcker-451/time-backsliding-8243)\n2\n\n\f3\n\nEconomic Growth\nThe inflation we are experiencing today stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an\nimbalance between strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures\non prices. Indeed, both aggregate demand and aggregate supply were affected by the pandemic and by\nthe responses of households, businesses, and policymakers to it. Mandated shutdowns and the voluntary\npullback in demand for high-contact services led to a shift in spending early in the pandemic from\nservices to goods. When the economy reopened, demand surged. This strong demand was supported by\nthe extraordinary level of fiscal transfers and accommodative monetary policy applied during the height\nof the pandemic.\n\nEconomic growth is slowing down from last year’s robust 5-3/4 percent pace. Indeed, the level of real\nGDP decreased in the first half of this year, but current estimates suggest that it resumed rising in the\nsecond half. Activity is slowing partly in response to the monetary policy actions taken this year, which\nhave led to tighter overall financial conditions. This is most easily seen in the housing market. Housing\ndemand increased during the pandemic as housing preferences shifted. Housing supply, which was\nalready somewhat constrained before the pandemic, could not keep up with increased demand and house\nprices rose. This year housing market activity has slowed appreciably as mortgage rates have risen 3-1/2\npercentage points since the start of the year. Housing starts and sales have moved down. House price\ninflation is beginning to ease but the year-over-year increase in house prices is still in double digits and\nwell above pre-pandemic levels; growth in rents also remains high.\n\nIn addition to tighter financial conditions, the slowdown in economic activity more broadly reflects how\nhouseholds and businesses are responding to very high inflation and their concerns about the economic\noutlook, to the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and to slower growth abroad. Both\n\n\f4\nconsumer spending and business investment have decelerated from the robust pace seen last year, and as\nthe effects of the pandemic have waned, consumption has begun to shift from goods to services.\n\nThe supply side of the economy remains constrained relative to demand. There are signs that supply\nchain bottlenecks, which have stemmed from pandemic-related shutdowns across the globe and the war in\nUkraine, have begun to ease.3 Our business contacts tell us that supply chain disruptions remain a\nchallenge but over time they have learned to navigate through them more effectively. They report that the\nlarger factor holding back production is the lack of available workers.\n\nLabor Markets\nWe are seeing some signs of moderation in the labor market, but overall conditions remain very strong\nand labor demand is still outpacing labor supply. The number of job openings has fallen this year, but\nthere are still 1.7 openings per unemployed person. Back in 2019, another time of tight labor markets,\nthere were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker. Last year, job gains averaged over 550 thousand\nper month. This year, through September, job gains have eased to an average of 420 thousand per month,\nbut that is still very strong job growth by historical standards. The unemployment rate is lower now than\nit was at the start of the year, and at 3.5 percent is at a 50-year low. The participation rate of prime-age\nworkers has returned to where one would expect it to be based on demographics. Many people chose to\nretire during the pandemic and left the labor force, and the overall participation rate, which includes those\nof retirement age, has risen only gradually.\n\nA continued rise in participation would be helpful in easing the imbalance between labor demand and\nsupply. But typically, most people who have retired and have begun to receive Social Security payments\ndo not return to the job market. I don’t expect to get much help from immigration either: net migration\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) has fallen appreciably this\nyear but remains above its pre-pandemic level. And if transportation costs rise again, supply chain pressures may\nalso begin to rise. The GSCPI is available at https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/overview.\n3\n\n\f5\nhas been declining since the late 1990s. So it is likely that much of the rebalancing will need to come on\nthe labor demand side. This could occur mainly through firms reducing the number of workers they are\nseeking rather than through layoffs. Indeed, many employers have told us that because it has been so hard\nto attract and retain workers over the past two years, they will strive to keep them on their payrolls even if\ndemand for their products slows down. This would result in a smaller rise in the unemployment rate than\nhas been seen in other economic slowdowns.\n\nThe imbalance between labor demand and supply has put upward pressure on wages. The employment\ncost index for private industry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6\npercent annual pace. If you squint, more recent reports suggest that wage pressures may be starting to\nstabilize. For example, average hourly earnings rose at about a 4-1/2 percent annual pace in the three\nmonths ending in September, compared to a little over 4-3/4 percent in 2021. With trend productivity\ngrowth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, nominal wage growth will need to moderate to\naround 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price stability. Even with the moderation in nominal\nwage growth that will occur as the economy returns to price stability, workers will be better off. In real\nterms, workers have been losing ground because wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Indeed,\nsince April of last year, wages adjusted for inflation have been declining. If real wages continue to\ndecline, it will be difficult to attract people back to the workforce, exacerbating the imbalance in the labor\nmarket.\n\nInflation\nDespite some moderation on the demand side of the economy and nascent signs of improvement in\nsupply side conditions, there has been no progress on inflation. Inflation readings have persisted at the\nhighest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, in August, PCE inflation was still running over 6\npercent and CPI inflation was over 8 percent. The core measures, which omit food and energy prices, and\nthe median and trimmed-mean measures, which exclude components with the most extreme movements\n\n\f6\neach month, tell a similar story of broad-based, persistently high inflation.4 I note that we look at these\nmeasures not because food and energy prices or the prices of other volatile components, such as apparel,\nare not important parts of a household’s consumption basket. Indeed, our long-run inflation target is\nbased on total PCE inflation, which includes all components. But we look at these alternative measures\nbecause they can give us a better sense of where inflation is likely going. Measured year-over-year, these\nunderlying inflation measures all moved up in August. The month-to-month changes in the inflation\nmeasures have shown no real decline, so we cannot even say inflation has peaked yet, let alone that it is\non a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. Given developments related to the ongoing war in Ukraine,\ngas and energy prices may move higher again later this year. In addition, services inflation, which tends\nto be persistent, is at its highest level since the early 1990s, with growth in housing rent and shelter costs\nlikely to keep inflation elevated for some time.\n\nIn my view, even with appropriate monetary policy actions, given inflation dynamics, it will take a couple\nof years before inflation returns to the Fed’s 2 percent goal. But I do expect to see meaningful progress\nover the next year as output growth and employment growth slow and there is some improvement in\nsupply side conditions. A key factor in this outlook is that medium- and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent goal despite current high inflation\nreadings. This anchoring should help to bring inflation back to our goal without as large a change in the\noutput gap. It is the job of monetary policymakers to ensure that inflation expectations remain well\nanchored.\n\n4\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx)\n\n\f7\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. And as\nalways, we are calibrating our monetary policy based on the implications of incoming information for the\neconomic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals.\n\nMonetary policy acts with a lag on the economy so we need to be forward looking. It is unlikely that we\nhave seen the full effects on households and businesses of the latest rate increases we have implemented\nand it would not be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2 percent. But\nit is also the case that based on Fed communications, financial conditions began to tighten well before our\nfirst rate increase in March and those effects have been passing through to the economy. Yet high\ninflation persists, an indication that we need to increase rates further.\n\nIn order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent, policy will need to move into a\nrestrictive stance. That means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is, real\ninterest rates, will need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Although we have\nraised the nominal fed funds rate by 300 basis points, policy is not yet restrictive. The median projection\nfor the longer-run nominal fed funds rate in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) of\nFOMC participants is 2.5 percent, which is my own estimate as well.5 This means that if inflation were 2\npercent, and inflation expectations were well anchored at levels consistent with that goal, a real fed funds\nrate of half of a percent would be neutral in the sense of neither stimulating nor restraining economic\nactivity. But that is an important “if.” Currently, inflation and shorter-term inflation expectations are\nwell above 2 percent. If we adjust the current nominal fed funds rate by the SEP median projection for\ninflation next year, which is 2.8 percent, policy is still a tad accommodative. Further funds rate increases\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee, “Summary of Economic Projections,” September 21, 2022.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf)\n5\n\n\f8\nare needed to get policy into a restrictive stance, and the median fed funds rate path in the SEP has rates\nmoving up to 4.4 percent by the end of this year and to 4.6 percent next year.\n\nBecause I see more persistence in inflation than the median SEP projection, the funds rate path I\nsubmitted for the September SEP was a bit higher over the next year than the median path, and I do not\nanticipate any cuts in the fed funds target range next year. But let me emphasize that this is based on my\ncurrent reading of the economy and outlook, and I will adjust my views as warranted based on the\nimplications of incoming economic and financial information for the outlook and risks around the\noutlook. While it is clear that the fed funds rate needs to move up from its current level, the size of rate\nincreases at any particular FOMC meeting and the peak fed funds rate will depend on the inflation\noutlook, which depends on the assessment of how rapidly aggregate demand and supply are coming back\ninto better balance and price pressures are being reduced. Given lags in the data, the reconnaissance we\nreceive from our contacts about what is happening on the ground in real-time will be particularly\nimportant in assessing the effects of the cumulative tightening on the economy. Making this assessment\nwill be challenging because both the demand and the supply sides of the U.S. economy will continue to\nbe affected by a variety of factors. This includes economic and policy developments in the rest of the\nworld, which can affect the U.S. economy through trade and financial market channels.\n\nWe will be operating in an uncertain environment for some time. High uncertainty is usually associated\nwith being cautious, and being cautious is often associated with acting inertially. But in the current\nenvironment of high and persistent inflation, a risk management, robust control approach counsels that\nbeing cautious does not mean doing less. Instead, it means being very careful to not allow wishful\nthinking to substitute for compelling evidence, leading one to prematurely declare victory over inflation\nand pause or reverse rate increases too soon. It means not being complacent that inflation expectations\nwill remain well anchored in this high inflation environment but taking appropriate actions to keep them\nanchored.\n\n\f9\n\nIt has been very helpful that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up less than\nshort-run expectations. They are below current inflation readings, an indication that the public believes\nthat inflation will move back down. Yet the recent declines in medium- and longer-term expectations\noccurred as gasoline prices declined; the jury is still out about whether these readings will rise again if\ngasoline prices move back up. In addition, every month that inflation remains highly elevated raises the\nchances that inflation expectations will become unanchored and that firms and households will begin to\nmake decisions based on persistently high inflation. If that were to happen, returning to price stability\nwould be more difficult and much more costly in terms of lost output and higher unemployment. Even if\none doesn’t think an unanchoring of inflation expectations is the most likely scenario, the costs of being\nwrong are high given the current state of the economy. So the robust control approach encourages strong\naction to keep expectations anchored to prevent the worst-case outcome from actually occurring.6 In my\nview, in the current environment, being cautious means that the FOMC should persevere in taking policy\nactions to return the economy to price stability.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, inflation remains very elevated and is placing a large burden on households and businesses.\nThe FOMC is committed to taking appropriate action to tighten financial conditions by raising the fed\nfunds rate and continuing to reduce the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet in order to return the economy to\nprice stability. Monetary policy is moving into restrictive territory and will need to be there for some\ntime in order to put inflation on a sustained downward path to our 2 percent goal. We will be looking at a\nvariety of incoming data and collecting economic and financial information from our business, labor\n\nSee Loretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Speech\n2022 Chicago Payments Symposium:\nBuilding Customer-Centered and Adaptive Networks\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, IL\nOctober 4, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Ellen Bromagen and the other organizers for inviting me to speak again at the Chicago Payments\nSymposium. It is truly an honor to participate in this symposium, which, under Ellen’s leadership, is a\npremier event for sharing ideas and for gathering insights from those who are involved in the payment\nsystem. At this time of dramatic change in payments, I feel privileged to chair the Fed’s Financial\nServices Policy Committee (FSPC), which oversees the provision of the Fed’s payment services to\ndeposit institutions and the U.S. Treasury. And I want to thank Ellen for being such a key member of our\ncommittee, providing insights from her years of experience working in payments. I would also like to\ntake this opportunity to extend my sincere appreciation to Federal Reserve Bank presidents Charles Evans\nand Esther George, who will be stepping down from their roles in January. Throughout their careers at\nthe Fed, Charlie and Esther have been strong and dedicated leaders working on behalf of the public. They\nhave made important contributions to all aspects of the Fed’s work, including monetary policy, banking\nsupervision, financial stability, community development, and payments. Indeed, their leadership has been\ninstrumental in the System’s success in supporting the ongoing modernization of the payment system. I\nam very grateful to count Esther and Charlie as friends and I appreciate their mentorship – although they\nmay have wished for a better student.\n\nThis morning, I will discuss some efforts the Federal Reserve has underway, in collaboration with the\nindustry and other payments stakeholders, to modernize the payment system, a critical part of the\ninfrastructure in the U.S. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Fed’s Modernization Efforts\nBecause the current payment system works well, most people have spent little time thinking about the\nbackbone that makes these payments possible and ensures that the payment system is reliable and secure.\nThis rational inattention is just as it should be. But with the changes brought by new technology and the\n\n\f2\nentry of new service providers, more people are seeking new ways to execute transactions, whether it be\nonline or via cell phone, and they want to execute them faster. The modernization efforts underway aim\nto foster a system that is not only efficient, secure, and effective, but also one that is innovative,\nadaptable, resilient, and accessible to everyone: a payment system that consumers and businesses can rely\non with confidence to efficiently make purchases, pay bills, and get paid. Indeed, ensuring that the public\ncan be confident in the system is a critical ingredient in achieving a better payment system, so innovations\naimed at efficiency must also be designed for security and resiliency.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has taken a collaborative approach in its modernization efforts. Ten years ago, the\nFed recognized that the payment system was at an inflection point. New technologies were being\ndeveloped and increasingly used, and the expectations of the end users of the payment system were also\nevolving. These conditions portended a period of rapid transformation in the end-to-end payments\nlandscape. The Fed engaged with a diverse set of payment-system stakeholders, and we all came to agree\nthat the U.S. payment system needed to evolve further and faster to support the changing nature of\ncommerce, keep pace with the global economy, meet the changing needs of end users and offer them\nbetter value, and address new and ongoing threats to security. Again engaging with stakeholders, the Fed\nestablished strategies to improve the payment system in terms of the speed, security, and efficiency of\ndomestic and cross-border payments. 1 These strategies, along with tactics, were published in 2015 and\nthey have guided the Fed’s modernization efforts.\n\nOver the ten years since the Fed recognized that the U.S. payment system needed improvement, two\nthings have happened. First, as foreseen, the payments landscape has undergone significant change. New\nentrants, shifting user needs, and digitalization have all shaped new models and methods for making\npayments. Traditional providers and fintech firms are coming to market with products that better meet\n\n1\n\nSee Federal Reserve System (2015).\n\n\f3\ncustomers’ needs in terms of convenience and that address long-standing frictions in the payment system.\nNew technologies have shaped the public’s expectations for faster, more efficient, and broadly accessible\npayment services that, at the same time, are safe and secure.\n\nThe second thing that has occurred is considerable progress toward the goal of a better payment system\nthat benefits all, a goal shared by the Federal Reserve, the industry, and end users. What both the private\nsector and the public sector have accomplished in a relatively short period of time is impressive,\nparticularly given the complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. financial infrastructure. This\nprogress underscores the value of collaboration. Indeed, the Fed working collaboratively with a broad\narray of payment participants was one of the five strategies included in our 2015 paper that catalyzed our\ncurrent modernization efforts.\n\nLet me now touch on a few examples of current and future innovations.\n\nCurrent Payment Innovations\nDigital payments\nInnovative digital payments products are filling gaps, addressing inefficiencies, and expanding payments\naccess to underserved consumers. According to a 2021 Fed survey, nearly seven out of 10 consumers use\nmobile payment devices to send or receive payments, and this usage spans consumers of all ages. 2 This is\na considerable increase from 2013, when only one in 10 consumers had ever made a mobile payment. In\naddition to using services from their primary bank or credit union, 83 percent of consumers are using a\ndigital wallet or a fintech payment app at least occasionally to complete transactions, including 71 percent\nof those age 55 and older. 3\n\n2\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2022).\n\n3\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2022).\n\n\f4\nOf course, the pandemic has had a wide-ranging and uneven impact on firms’ and households’ payment\nbehaviors and patterns. The share of retail sales done electronically jumped during the pandemic, but this\nshare began increasing much earlier. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales accounted\nfor about 6 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2013. That share has now risen to about 14 percent. 4 It\nseems clear that the consumer’s preference for digital payments, which has been spurred by industry\ninnovation, is here to stay. Apps created by financial institutions and fintech providers are increasingly\neasy to use and access. Other digital tools have significantly improved money management and financial\naccess for consumers, including those with low or moderate incomes, who have historically been\nunderserved. At the same time, because maintaining the public’s confidence in the payment system is a\npublic good, it is important to ensure that consumers using these new payments products understand how\nthese new products compare with other payment instruments, including cash, in terms of risks and\nbenefits. Ensuring that new products and payments rails are built with security and resiliency in mind\nfrom the very start is essential if the modernization of the payment system is to live up to its promise.\n\nCombating fraud and increasing cyber resilience\nOne negative trend affecting the payment system is the increase in fraud. Fraud has the potential to\nundermine the public’s confidence in the payment system, and staying ahead of the fraudsters requires\nconstant vigilance because of the increasing sophistication of the frauds being perpetrated. Scams abound\nand are constantly changing. Bad actors are hacking into systems by using bots, phishing schemes, and\nsocial networks to exploit weaknesses in the system. Payment fraud comes in a variety of forms.\nAccording to one estimate, synthetic identity fraud, in which personal identifiable information such as a\nSocial Security number is used to fabricate a person or entity in order to commit a fraudulent act,\n\nSee U.S. Census Bureau (2022). In this report, e-commerce sales are “sales of goods and services where the buyer\nplaces an order, or the price and terms of the sale are negotiated over an Internet, mobile device (M-commerce),\nextranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) network, electronic mail, or other comparable online system. Payment\nmay or may not be made online.”\n\n4\n\n\f5\naccounted for $20 billion in losses for U.S. financial institutions in 2020. 5, 6 Remote authentication fraud,\nin which a new account is fraudulently created in someone’ else’s name, or a victim’s account is taken\nover by using stolen credentials or information, is also on the rise. 7\n\nTo help its financial institution customers better fight fraud, the Fed has published a series of research\nbriefs and has expanded educational resources in concert with industry participants. The\nFraudClassifier℠ model is a good example of our recent efforts with the industry. The model can be used\nregardless of the payment type, payment channel, or payment characteristics to facilitate more consistent\nfraud classifications. This can help an organization improve its fraud management and responses, as well\nas more effectively educate its customers on current fraud methods and how to protect themselves. 8\n\nThe Fed is also working constantly to strengthen the defenses and enhance the resilience of our clearing\nand settlement platforms. While we have remained secure from ever-growing cybersecurity threats, we\ndo not take that for granted. We are continuously working to enhance the cybersecurity and resiliency of\nour own systems, applications, and data, to ensure that we can detect and prevent an attack on our\nsystems, and if one were to occur, making sure we can minimize the time it takes to contain it and limit\nthe business impact on our customers and the broader public. We regularly obtain cyber intelligence on\nhow actors may attempt to attack critical Federal Reserve payment systems; we regularly test our controls\nto determine their capabilities in preventing these attacks from being successful; and we are continuously\nimproving and testing our preparedness against a potential ransomware attack, which is a top threat for\norganizations, including the Fed.\n\n5\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2019).\n\n6\n\nThis estimate comes from software company FiVerity. See ABA Banking Journal (2021).\n\n7\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement, “Remote Authentication Fraud.”\n\n8\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement, “FraudClassifier Model.”\n\n\f6\ne-Invoicing\nThe Fed is also focused on enhancing payment efficiency. Just like consumers, American businesses are\neager to go electronic with payment options that provide immediate access to funds and support straightthrough processing of invoice, payment, and remittance data. Despite that desire, check usage remains\nhigh for business-to-business (B2B) payments because current electronic options pose challenges for\npayments reconciliation. To help remedy this impediment, the Fed is collaborating with the Business\nPayments Coalition to modernize B2B payments. One of the fruits of that collaboration is the e-invoice\nexchange market pilot. This is an effort to build and test a virtual network that will enable businesses of\nall kinds to exchange e-invoices by establishing a secure and open delivery framework between\nproviders. 9 The collaboration has also determined that the electronic exchange framework could be\nadapted so that businesses could share with one another a payment’s remittance information.\n\nFaster payments infrastructure\nPerhaps the most visible and eagerly anticipated innovation in payments is the establishment of instant\npayment capabilities. In the Fed’s 2021 payments survey, 62 percent of consumers said they expected to\nbe using faster payment options more extensively in the future, particularly options that offer robust fraud\nprotections. 10 Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of businesses we surveyed in 2020 said that they would\nfactor access to faster payments into future decisions on whether to switch banks. 11\n\nThe industry has made great strides in offering faster payments, and building in security features,\nincluding identity management, authentication, and robustness. Real-time settlement is an important\nsecurity feature of faster payments. When settlement is deferred, the payee’s service provider is taking on\ncredit risk until it gets the funds from the payer’s service provider. To reduce this risk, some, but not all,\n9\n\nSee Business Payments Coalition, “Electronic Invoices.”\n\n10\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2022).\n\n11\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2021).\n\n\f7\nof the faster payment systems around the world couple real-time or near real-time settlement with faster\npayments. 12\n\nThe Federal Reserve will launch its own instant payments rail incorporating real-time clearing and\nsettlement, the FedNow℠ Service, between May and July of next year. 13 As was discussed yesterday at\nthe symposium, the Fed’s goals in offering instant payments through FedNow include providing greater\nflexibility to consumers and businesses through instant access to their funds; increasing access to the\npayment system for more consumers; offering the potential for greater efficiency in B2B payments by\nincluding invoice and remittance data within payment messages; and leveling the playing field for\ncompetition. This faster-payments rail and the innovation that will emerge around it hold great promise\nin making both domestic and cross-border payments more efficient and more accessible to all.\n\nThe Fed has spent several years planning for and investing in FedNow and its launch is fast approaching.\nFinancial institutions will be able to connect to the service either directly, via their core processors, or\nthrough a technology service provider. Now is the time for industry stakeholders, including financial\ninstitutions and core service providers, to prepare themselves to use the new service, and the Fed is\nleaning in on stakeholder engagement to ensure everyone is ready. Our pilot testing program has more\nthan 120 participants and our FedNow Community portal is a great place to get information. 14 We realize\nthat for many financial institutions, getting ready to use FedNow will take some investment. Some\norganizations will need to upgrade 40-year-old payment infrastructures, accounting procedures, and other\nback-office processes to accommodate the expanded 24×7 operating hours. But the Fed is asking you to\n\n12\n\nSee Mester (2017) and Committee on Payments and Markets, Bank for International Settlements (2016).\n\n13\n\nSee Brainard (2022) for an update on FedNowSM.\n\n14\nInformation on joining the FedNow Community is available at https://www.frbservices.org/financialservices/fednow/community.\n\n\f8\nmake those investments so that you’ll be prepared to offer this new instant payments service to your\ncustomers, who are increasingly demanding faster payments.\n\nFuture Payment Innovations\nAs we continue to make improvements to the payment system today, we also have to prepare for the\nfuture. It is important for us to ensure that our payment system evolves in a productive way. Innovation,\ncompetition, collaboration, broad accessibility, common standards, risk management, and appropriate\nsupervision and regulation – all are important facets of a well-functioning payment system.\n\nDiversity of providers and technologies\nInnovation in payments is not going to stop. Partnerships between traditional financial institutions and\nnewer fintech firms are becoming more common. Indeed, many fintech firms have participated in the\nFederal Reserve’s FedNow Service Provider Showcase, a one-stop resource that connects financial\ninstitutions and businesses with service providers who can help them implement instant payment products\nusing the FedNow Service. Financial institutions are exploring opportunities to improve both back-office\nand customer-facing operations in partnership with fintech firms. 15, 16 Many banks now use application\nprogramming interfaces (APIs) and other tools to provide the underlying financial infrastructure to\nnonbank technology firms and their customers, including deposit services and access to the payment rails.\nFintechs are increasingly becoming significant providers of technological services to smaller banks,\nwhich lack the scale to develop such technologies on their own.\n\nThe growing diversity of the providers of payment services, including nonbank and fintech firms, is likely\nto continue. New tools and techniques previously unavailable to some financial institutions, including\n\n15\n\nSee Bowman (2022).\n\n16\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021).\n\n\f9\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence, are now being applied to credit underwriting, back-office\noperations, and various aspects of risk management. And learning how to apply these new technologies\nmore effectively is ongoing. For example, it is now better recognized that just because it is an algorithm\ndoes not mean it is immune from producing discriminatory underwriting and pricing decisions. Testing\nalgorithms before they are deployed and designing so-called ethical algorithms, which balance the\naccuracy of a credit-risk model with other goals such as not producing systematically higher error rates\nfor one racial group than another, are methods that can be used to avoid unintended consequences of the\nnew tools. 17\n\nJust like the industry, the Fed is actively monitoring and studying new technologies and approaches to\npayments, and we are enhancing some of our service offerings to help our customers offer better services\nto theirs. For example, last month Fed Financial Services launched the FedPayments® Insights Service,\nan analytical tool that generates reports on a financial institution’s payments settled through the\nFedACH® Service to help inform business strategy and day-to-day ACH operations. 18 We continue to\nprovide APIs to improve payment system efficiency and accessibility. 19 And so that we will be better\npositioned to meet our customers’ needs and those of the public, we have changed how Federal Reserve\nFinancial Services are organized within the Fed. As many of you know, for the past 20 years, we have\norganized financial services by product line, such as wholesale, retail, and cash. This year we have\nrestructured our services along functional lines, such as technology, operations, and customer service.\nMark Gould, who spoke yesterday, serves as our chief payments executive, overseeing Fed financial\nservices.\n\n17\n\nSee Mester (2020b) and Kearns and Roth (2020) for further discussion.\n\n18\n\nSee FRBServices (2022).\n\nExamples include our Service Status API, which monitors the availability of Fed financial services in real-time;\nFedCash Services E-Manifest API, now active as a pilot program, which gives financial institutions and armored\ncarriers greater ability to track currency shipments from order to delivery; and FedNow Service APIs, which will\nlaunch next year and report transaction details, update status and daily activity, and provide downloadable\ninformation to customers. See FRBServices.org for more information.\n19\n\n\f10\nCentral bank digital currency\nThe Fed, under direction from the Board of Governors, is also exploring emerging technologies and\nevaluating whether there is a potential role for a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the future.\nThe Federal Reserve has been researching issues raised by a CBDC for some time. To foster public\ndialog, earlier this year the Board of Governors released a discussion paper outlining potential benefits,\nrisks, and policy considerations of a U.S. CBDC and invited public comment. 20 As readers of that paper\nknow, there are numerous issues pertaining to CBDC that have to be evaluated including the implications\nfor financial stability, global financial market functioning, and the transition of monetary policy; how to\nensure security and balance privacy with transparency; and whether there is a use case for CBDC in the\nU.S. No decision has been made about whether to issue a U.S. central bank digital currency.\nNonetheless, given the evolving digitalization of the financial system, under coordination by the Board of\nGovernors, the Federal Reserve System is researching and experimenting with the underlying\ntechnologies. 21 We are gaining insights that will not only help inform a future decision on a CBDC but\nalso aid our current work on faster payments, interoperability between payment systems, and payment\nsystem resiliency.\n\nPayment security and consumer safeguards\nAs the payment system evolves, the safeguards needed to maintain the public’s confidence in the payment\nsystem will also need to evolve. Private-sector and public-sector service providers and regulators need to\nensure that user protections are in place for responsible data use and privacy, and that safeguards\nadequately protect customer accounts against cybersecurity breaches, fraud, and data leakage. It is also\nour collective responsibility to educate consumer and business users of the payment services so they can\ntake appropriate steps to protect themselves from fraud and understand the risks, which may vary across\n\n20\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022a).\n\n21\n\nMester (2020a) and Mester (2020b) discuss some of the experimentation taking place.\n\n\f11\nproducts and services, especially while there is variation in the consumer protections in place. And it is\nincumbent upon providers and regulators to continue to educate themselves as new technologies emerge.\nFor example, once quantum computing fully develops, it will disrupt the cryptography currently in place\nthat secures our payment services. Data privacy methods will also have to adapt. The traditional way of\nkeeping data private, by taking away names or otherwise anonymizing it, no longer works in a world rich\nwith multiple data sources that can be cross-referenced to de-anonymize the data and reveal identities. 22\nSo we can’t take for granted that our current methods for securing our payment system will remain valid;\nas technologies evolve, we need to evolve our methods as well.\n\nPayment system supervision\nHow we go about effectively supervising the payment system will also need to evolve to ensure that the\nsystem remains secure, effective, and broadly accessible. The public policy approach will need to change\nto include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data privacy regulation.\nTo ensure that the benefits of a better payment system are captured and the risks managed, there will need\nto be cooperation across these types of regulators, as well as international cooperation through the\nFinancial Stability Board and other international entities, given the global nature of payments and the\nentities that are now offering payments services. Extending some regulations to new services is already\noccurring; for example, payments services offered by bigtech firms are subject to “know your customer”\nrules.\n\nAs new providers enter the field, we’ll need to focus more on the risks a service entails rather than on the\ntype of entity providing the service. This will help limit regulatory arbitrage while at the same time\nsupporting financial stability and innovation. This risk-focused approach is seen in the final guidelines\n\nSee Mester (2020b) for further discussion. Kearns and Roth (2020) discuss how then-Massachusetts governor\nWilliam Weld’s medical record was identified by combining the anonymized medical records released by the state\nwith voter registration data.\n\n22\n\n\f12\napproved by the Board of Governors in August that Federal Reserve Banks will use when evaluating\nrequests from institutions for access to Fed accounts and payment services. 23 The guidelines incorporate a\nthree-tiered review framework that entails more extensive review for entities that entail greater risks. They\naim to increase transparency and to foster equitable national treatment of account requests while\nsupporting responsible innovation and appropriate risk management.\n\nConclusion\nA well-functioning and secure payment system is vital to our economy. As we modernize the payment\nsystem, it is important to remember that the foundation of a successful payment system is the public’s\nconfidence in it: confidence that it will be available whenever the customer needs it; confidence that it\nwill efficiently route and settle payments; confidence that it will be resilient against cyber attacks and\nfraudulent actors; and confidence that it can be relied upon without having to know the intricacies of the\ninfrastructure behind it. This confidence requires trust in the financial entities offering payment services.\nToday, the American public does have confidence in the payment services offered by the Federal Reserve\nSystem and the industry. But we cannot take that for granted. As the payment system evolves, the Fed,\nthe industry, and end users will need to continue to collaborate to ensure that the modern payment system\nlives up to its promise of being efficient, safe, resilient, and available to all. That’s the best way to\nmaintain the confidence of the public we serve.\n\n23\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022b).\n\n\f13\nReferences\nABA Banking Journal, “Report:

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nDistinguished Speaker Series\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology Golub Center for Finance and Policy\nCambridge, MA\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Eric Rosengren and MIT’s Golub Center for inviting me to speak today. I have known Eric pretty\nmuch over my entire career as an economist. I feel very lucky that I had the opportunity to learn from\nhim during our years at the Federal Reserve, not only about economics, financial stability, and monetary\npolicy, but about how to lead a Reserve Bank. Today, it is probably not surprising that I plan to speak\nabout inflation and the appropriate strategy for monetary policy when there is uncertainty about the path\nof both inflation and inflation expectations. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\nInflation\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well\nabove 2 percent for well over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced\neconomies around the globe. This high inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects\nan imbalance between strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward\npressures on prices. Inflation is a top concern of businesses and households: this is evident in surveys and\nin my conversations with regional contacts. High inflation is imposing a particularly onerous burden on\nthose who do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, and\nwho are now having to make hard choices about how to spend their money.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain\nhealthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive\nand live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. Stable prices mean businesses and households don’t\nhave to spend time trying to protect the purchasing power of their money; they can make long-term plans\nand commitments without having to deal with the uncertainty about the value of their money. Price\nstability and monetary policy are intimately linked, but because of the uncertainties surrounding inflation\ndynamics, setting monetary policy to achieve price stability is not trivial. It requires being able to\n\n\f2\nmeasure inflation so that we understand where inflation is relative to our goal. It requires being able to\nforecast inflation because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag that varies over time and with\neconomic circumstances. It requires understanding the determinants of the monetary policy transmission\nmechanism. It also requires having the ability to make decisions under uncertainty.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has not always been successful at achieving price stability, and there have been\nmisses on both sides. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the U.S. experienced deflation. In the\naftermath of the oil price shocks in the 1970s, inflation surged and remained high until then-Fed\nChairman Paul Volcker began to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down, at the cost of a deep\nrecession in the early 1980s. The Fed has learned from these historical episodes. One lesson is the\nimportance of a central bank remaining focused on its price stability goal.\n\nThe FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring inflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2\npercent. Last week we took another decisive action to remove monetary policy accommodation by\nraising the target range of the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and we are continuing the process of\nreducing assets on the Fed’s balance sheet, which also reduces accommodation. Reductions in monetary\npolicy accommodation and tighter financial conditions will bring demand into better balance with\nconstrained supply in both product and labor markets, resulting in an economic transition to growth in\nreal output that is well below trend, slower employment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\n[Figure 1: U.S. CPI and PCE inflation and global inflation]\nInflation continues to run at rates last seen in the early 1980s in the U.S. This is true whether one looks at\nCPI or PCE inflation. The strong increase in inflation that started in the spring of last year is very\ndifferent from what the U.S. experienced during the long pre-pandemic expansion. Until late in that\nexpansion, the concern was that inflation was running below our 2 percent longer-run goal, and this was\ntrue in other advanced economies as well. Several common factors contributed to low inflation in this\nperiod. First, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, global demand was weak. Prices of energy and other\n\n\f3\ncommodities were declining, and in the U.S., a rise in the value of the dollar put downward pressure on\nthe prices of imports into the U.S. Indeed, over the 2009-2011 period, one puzzle for policymakers was\nactually not why inflation was low, but rather, why it wasn’t lower.1 A major reason was that longer-term\ninflation expectations were relatively stable at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation, a topic that I’ll\nreturn to later.\n\nBut low and stable inflation preceded the Great Recession. Since the mid-1980s, inflation had been\nrelatively stable in spite of several wars, dramatic ups and downs in oil prices, and mild and severe\nrecessions. The fact that inflation had become less correlated with changes in resource utilization in the\nlabor market and in product markets – that is, there had been a flattening of the Phillips curve – suggested\na change in inflation dynamics.2 This hypothesis may still hold, but it is an open question as to whether\ninflation dynamics have once again changed or whether the factors that held down inflation prior to the\npandemic will exert their force again over time.\n\n[Figure 2: PCE energy, PCE food, PCE core inflation and share of components with high inflation\nrates]\nThe overriding message from a variety of measures is that inflation is not only high but it is broad-based.\nWhen inflation began to rise in April 2021, it was concentrated in a limited number of categories that\nwere directly related to the effects of the pandemic. But by later last year, those price pressures had\nbroadened across categories.\n\nEnergy prices have been a major contributor to the rise in inflation. Over the last year, the PCE energy\nprice index has increased over 30 percent. Recent readings have eased, but developments related to the\nongoing war in Ukraine suggest that gas and energy prices could move higher again later this year or\nearly next year. Food prices have also risen significantly and inflation in this component is at its highest\n\n1\n\nSee Constâncio (2015).\n\n2\n\nSee Del Negro et al. (2020).\n\n\f4\nlevel since the late 1970s. But even excluding these components, core PCE inflation is at its highest level\nsince the 1980s.\n\n[Figure 3: Real goods and services spending relative to trend]\nThe nature of the pandemic shock and the response to it affected aggregate demand and aggregate supply.\nThe mandated shutdowns and the voluntary pullback in demand for high-contact services led to a shift in\nspending early in the pandemic from services to goods. When the economy reopened, demand surged.\nThis strong demand was supported by fiscal transfers and accommodative monetary policy. Spending is\nbeginning to shift from goods to services, but neither is back to its pre-pandemic trend.\n\nThe strong demand was met by constrained supply, which was affected by supply chain bottlenecks and\nthe withdrawal of workers from the labor force. Many thought the supply constraints would work\nthemselves out fairly quickly. But rolling pandemic lockdowns across the globe in response to new\nwaves of the virus and the sluggish return of workers to the work force made it difficult for supply to keep\nup with demand. Our business contacts tell us that supply chain disruptions remain a challenge, although\nthey have learned how to better navigate them over time; they tell us that they have seen less\nimprovement in the imbalance between the demand and supply of labor.\n\n[Figure 4: Core PCE goods, services, and housing inflation]\nThe continued imbalance between demand and supply has led to intense inflationary pressures. Inflation\nin both goods and services is high, with goods inflation still exceeding services inflation. This is very\ndifferent from the pre-pandemic expansion, when core goods inflation was slightly negative on average\nand falling goods prices were pulling inflation down.\n\nConsumers spend a larger share of their income on services than on goods, so services have a higher\nweight in the inflation indices. Services inflation also tends to be more persistent than goods inflation.\nHousing, as measured by rents or imputed rents for owner-occupied housing, is a large and cyclically\n\n\f5\nsensitive component of services inflation; shelter is about a third of the CPI price index. Early in the\npandemic, high unemployment and moratoria on foreclosures and evictions initially put downward\npressure on housing inflation. Subsequently, there has been strong demand for housing and a rapid rise in\nhouse prices and rents. Activity in the housing sector has been slowing rapidly in response to higher\nmortgage rates, but there is a long-run imbalance between demand and supply of housing. So despite the\nmoderation in activity, housing prices and rents remain quite high. It typically takes some time for higher\nrents to flow through to the inflation measures, so growth in housing rent and shelter costs will likely\nkeep inflation elevated for some time.\n\n[Figure 5: Core, median, and trimmed-mean inflation measures]\nThe July reading of PCE and core PCE inflation showed a bit of moderation, which was welcome news.\nBut the August CPI report underscored that inflation pressures remain intense. Indicators of the\nunderlying inflation trend, including the trimmed-mean and median CPI and PCE measures, which\nexclude components with the most extreme movements each month, show that inflation pressures remain\nvery elevated and broad-based even though there has been some moderation in economic activity.\nMeasured year-over-year, the median and trimmed-mean inflation rates were either stable or actually\nincreased in July; in August, the median and trimmed-mean CPI rose.3\n\nWage pressures are also contributing to high inflation. They are growing much faster than the pace\nconsistent with price stability and there is little sign that wage pressures are abating.\n\n[Figure 6. SEP PCE inflation projections]\nThe evolution of projections made by FOMC participants shows that inflation has moved up much more\nand remained high for longer than anticipated. Both the demand and the supply sides of the economy will\n\n3\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n\n\f6\ncontinue to be affected by a variety of forces, including the war in Ukraine and the energy situation in\nEurope, the global economic outlook, property market stresses and continued lockdowns in China, the\nsentiment of consumers and businesses and their reaction to elevated inflation readings, changes in supply\nchain disruptions, and labor force participation. Since high inflation reflects the imbalance between\nsupply and demand, there will continue to be considerable uncertainty around the inflation forecast.\n\nInflation Expectations\nOne of the big lessons from the 1970s is that it is much more difficult and costly to bring inflation down\nonce it has become embedded in the economy, that is, once businesses and households expect inflation to\nremain elevated and that expectation influences their savings and investment decisions and price-setting\nand wage-setting behavior. High inflation imposes costs on households and businesses in both the short\nand the long run. It eats into savings and makes it hard to plan for the future. By making it more difficult\nto evaluate investment opportunities, high inflation can affect productivity growth, with long-term\nconsequences for the standard of living. The Fed’s monetary policy framework recognizes the\nimportance of keeping inflation expectations well-anchored at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.4\nAnd by “well-anchored” I mean longer-term inflation expectations that are insensitive to data.\n\nInflation expectations have been a central factor in models of inflationary dynamics since the 1960s and\n1970s.5 In many inflation models used by central banks, inflation is driven by three key factors: some\nmeasure of a resource utilization gap (for example, the output gap or unemployment rate gap), or\nmarginal cost of production; lagged inflation, which captures the inertia in the inflation process; and\nexpectations of inflation. Different models put different weights on these fundamental factors, but\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, revised in 2020 and reaffirmed since\nthen, says that the Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent\ncontribute to achieving its monetary policy goals. See Federal Open Market Committee (2022a).\n4\n\n5\n\nSee Phelps (1967), Friedman (1968), and Lucas (1972). Empirical work on the determinants of inflation finds that\nthe output gap matters when it is large and that, in recent years, forward-looking measures of inflation expectations\nplay a larger role in explaining inflation dynamics than do backward-looking measures.\n\n\f7\nhousehold and business expectations matter, since they affect wage demands and offers, and therefore\nfirms’ price-setting behavior.6 In addition to their role in inflation dynamics and helping to forecast\ninflation, inflation expectations also provide an indication of how credible the public finds the central\nbank’s commitment to achieving its policy goals.\n\nTheory indicates that well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations can help to mitigate the pull of\nresource gaps on inflation, and therefore, the cyclical movements in interest rates that policymakers\ninduce to maintain price stability need not be as large as when inflation expectations are not well\nanchored. This is particularly useful when the zero lower bound constrains interest rates. Arguably, the\nU.S. might have suffered much lower inflation during the Great Recession had inflation expectations not\nbeen relatively stable, offsetting some of the influence the negative output gap had on inflation.\nSimilarly, in the face of today’s very high inflation readings, keeping inflation expectations well anchored\nshould help to bring inflation back to goal without as large a change in the output gap. Of course, we\nhave to acknowledge that while the theory is compelling, the real world does not always cooperate. For\nexample, in Japan, inflation expectations have run well above actual inflation for a number of years.7\n\n[Figure 7: Measures of short-term and medium- and longer-term inflation expectations]\nOne difficulty in moving from theory to practice is that inflation expectations are not directly observable.\nSo we look at a number of measures, which differ by type of agent and time horizon. These include\nmeasures based on surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters; measures derived from\nfinancial markets; and composite indices that combine various measures.8 A clear signal is not always\nforthcoming because the inflation expectations of different groups of agents can behave differently from\n\n6\n\nFor further discussion, see Fuhrer and Olivei (2009) and Clark and Davig (2009).\n\n7\n\nSee Trehan and Lynch (2013) and Hattori and Yetman (2017).\n\nThe index of common inflation expectations is a research data series maintained by the Board of Governors’ staff.\nSee Ahn and Fulton (2021).\n8\n\n\f8\none another, even within groups there can be variation, and the literature has not firmly established whose\nexpectations are most important for inflation dynamics.9, 10\n\nShorter-term expectations tend to move with gasoline prices and the prices of other salient items like\nfood. Longer-term expectations and their level relative to short-term expectations give a better sense of\nwhether expectations are becoming unanchored from the target, an indication of increased risk of inflation\nbecoming embedded in the economy, and, relatedly, the level of the central bank’s credibility in the eyes\nof the public. For example, longer-term expectations remaining stable in the face of a positive shock to\ninflation would indicate that the public believes that inflation will come down, although it need not\nindicate that the public believes monetary policy will be the main driver of the reduction.\n\nThe rise in inflation expectations since last year has been concentrated in short-term expectations, which\nrose with the rise in gasoline and food prices. More recently, these short-term expectations have moved\ndown with gasoline prices. Still, they indicate that consumers expect high inflation to prevail over the\nnext year.\n\nMedium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up less than short-run expectations, and they\nare below current inflation readings, an indication that the public believes that inflation will move back\ndown. The recent decline in the New York Fed’s medium-term expectations measure and the University\nof Michigan’s longer-term expectations measure was welcome news. But despite the moderation, these\n\n9\n\nSee Candia, Coibion, and Gorodnichenko (2021).\n\n10\n\nAs discussed in De Pooter, et al. (2016), survey measures of the inflation expectations of professional forecasters\nand financial industry participants were fairly stable over the course of the Great Recession and recovery, while\nthose of households and businesses drifted down.\nIn addition, the Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations measure indicates that women, older\nrespondents, and more educated respondents have tended to expect higher inflation over the next year than do their\ncounterparts. The Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations measure, which started in 2021, is based\non a nationwide survey with more than 10,000 responses and is updated on a weekly basis. Instead of asking\nconsumers directly about overall inflation, the survey asks consumers how they expect the prices of the things they\nbuy to change over the next 12 months and how much their incomes would have to change for them to be able to\nafford the same consumption basket and be equally well-off. See Hajdini, et al. (2022).\n\n\f9\nmeasures are higher than they were before the pandemic. Longer-term expectations should be less\naffected by changes in gasoline prices than near-term expectations and more reflective of consumers’\nperceptions of the Fed’s commitment and ability to return the economy to price stability. The recent\nimprovement in measures of medium- and longer-term inflation expectations occurred as Fed\ncommunications emphasized that we were taking decisive action against high inflation. So the decline in\nthe expectations measures could indicate firmer anchoring. But the improvement also coincided with the\ndecline in gasoline prices. So it is not clear yet that the measures won’t move up again if gas prices rise,\nfood prices remain high, or inflation developments take a turn for the worse as the year progresses.\n\n[Figure 8: Dispersion among SPF and University of Michigan inflation expectations]\nDispersion in expectations across survey respondents also indicates how well inflation expectations are\nanchored, with lower dispersion indicating better anchoring.11 The recent data are mixed. During the\ncurrent period of high inflation, the dispersion in longer-tern inflation expectations across the respondents\nto the Survey of Professional Forecasts has risen only modestly. Those forecasters with relatively high\nand those with relatively low projections of inflation over the next 10 years expect PCE inflation to\naverage more than 2 percent, but this is mainly concentrated in the next five years. The 5-year/5-year\nforward projection is still basically 2 percent.\n\nIn contrast, dispersion in the longer-run inflation expectations across respondents to the University of\nMichigan’s survey has increased sharply since the start of the pandemic. Earlier it was driven by an\nincrease in expectations at the top part of the distribution; most recently there has been a sharp drop off in\nexpectations at the bottom part of the distribution, perhaps a reflection of respondents’ outlook for the\n\n11\n\nReis (2021) discusses the relationship between dispersion in inflation expectations and signs of unanchoring.\nNaggert, Rich, and Tracy (2021) find that the lower end of the distribution of 5-year/5-year-forward PCE inflation\nexpectations from the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters shifted up toward 2 percent and the dispersion of\ninflation expectations across respondents narrowed after the FOMC announced its revised monetary policy\nframework in August 2020.\n\n\f10\neconomy. Such a large and rising level of dispersion suggests that inflation expectations among\nconsumers may not be as well anchored as we would hope.\n\nMonetary Policymaking Strategy\nSince March, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 3 percentage points,\nand in June, the FOMC began to reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet according to the plan\nannounced in May.12 While this has been a relatively fast pace of tightening, given the current level of\ninflation and the outlook, I believe that further increases in our policy rate will be needed. In order to put\ninflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent, monetary policy will need to be in a restrictive\nstance, with real interest rates moving into positive territory and remaining there for some time.\n\n[Figure 9. September 2022 SEP median fed funds rate path]\nThe FOMC released a new Summary of Economic Projections last week. The median path among\nFOMC participants moved up again in response to the implications of incoming data for the outlook. In\nparticular, high inflation is proving to be more persistent, and more restrictive policy will be needed and\nfor longer to ensure that inflation expectations do not move up and that inflation moves back down.13\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain environment, and assessing the balance between supply and demand will\nremain challenging as we go. In terms of the appropriate policy responses in an environment with a lot of\nuncertainty, some results in the literature suggest that when policymakers confront more uncertainty\neither in their data or in their models, they should be more cautious in acting, that is, be more inertial in\ntheir responses.14 However, subsequent research has shown that this is not generally true. For example,\n\n12\n\nStarting in September, the Fed will allow up to $60 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $35 billion\nper month of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities\nare less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. See the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (2022b).\n13\n14\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee (2022c).\n\nSee Mester (2016). Aoki (2003) studied the optimal policy response when data are measured with error and\nconcluded that the degree of response to a variable in the policy rule should be less the higher the variable’s\n\n\f11\nSargent (1999) points out that caution does not necessarily mean doing less. When there is uncertainty, it\ncan be better for policymakers to act more aggressively because aggressive and pre-emptive action can\nprevent the worst-case outcomes from actually coming about.15 Walsh (2003, 2022) points out that better\neconomic outcomes are achieved by assuming that high inflation will be persistent and acting\naccordingly.\n\nFollowing this robust-control view, in current circumstances I am going to be very cautious and not\nassume that one or two improved readings on inflation mean inflation is on a downward path or that\ninflation expectations are firmly anchored at our goal when expectations measures are elevated. Wishful\nthinking cannot be a substitute for compelling evidence. So before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I\nwill need to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings. I will also guard against\nbeing complacent that longer-term expectations are well anchored. The longer inflation remains elevated,\nthe higher the risk that inflation expectations become unanchored and firms and households begin making\ndecisions based on persistent high inflation. Were that unanchoring to occur, returning the economy to\nprice stability would be more difficult and much more costly in terms of lost output and higher\nunemployment.\n\nResearch indicates that erroneously assuming that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at\nthe level consistent with price stability when, in fact, they are not is a more costly error for the economy\nthan assuming they are not well-anchored when they actually are.16 If inflation expectations are drifting\nup and policymakers treat them as stable, policy will be set too loose. Inflation would then move up and\nthis would be reinforced by increasing inflation expectations. And that will be harder to rein in. If, on the\n\nmeasurement error. Brainard (1967) studied optimal policy in response to a shock when there is uncertainty about\nthe effect of policy on the economy and concluded that policy should respond less when there is uncertainty than\nwhen there is no uncertainty. It has been shown that this result is not general across models.\n15\n\nGiannoni (2002 and 2007) shows policymakers averse to uncertainty will react more strongly to fluctuations in\ninflation and the output gap than if there were no uncertainty. They would put more weight on stabilizing inflation\nand the output gap and less weight on stabilizing the nominal interest rate.\n16\n\nSee De Pooter, et al. (2016) and Walsh (2022).\n\n\f12\nother hand, inflation expectations are actually stable and policymakers view the drift up with concern,\npolicy will initially be set tighter than it should. Inflation would move down, perhaps even below target,\nbut not for long, since inflation expectations are anchored at the goal.\n\nIn summary, price stability is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a healthy,\nproductive economy over time. So the FOMC will be resolute in putting inflation on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent. There will be some pain and bumps along the way as the growth in output\nand employment slow and the unemployment rate moves up. But the current persistent high inflation is\nalso very painful for many households and businesses. I do not view the current situation as one in which\nthere is a tradeoff between our two monetary policy goals. If we were to fail to take decisive action to get\ninflation down and firmly anchor inflation expectations, the costs would be high: we would not be able to\nsustain healthy labor markets over time, to the detriment of the public.\n\n\f13\nReferences\nAhn, Hie Joo, and Chad Fulton, “Research Data Series: Index of Common Inflation Expectations,” FEDS\nNotes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 5, 2021.\n(https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2873)\nAoki, Kosuke, “On the Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Noisy Indicators,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 50, April 2003, pp. 501-523.\n(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3932(03)00023-0)\nBrainard, William C., “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” American Economic Review: Papers\nand Proceedings 57, May 1967, pp. 411-425.\n(https://www.jstor.org/stable/1821642#metadata_info_tab_contents)\nCandia, Bernardo, Olivier Coibion, and Yuriy Gorodnichenko, “The Inflation Expectations of U.S. Firms:\nEvidence from a New Survey,” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 28836, May\n2021.\n(http://www.nber.org/papers/w28836)\nClark, Todd E., and Troy Davig, “The Relationship Between Inflation and Inflation Expectations,” memo\nto the FOMC, November 30, 2009, authorized for public release by the FOMC Secretariat on 4/29/2016.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20091201memo05.pdf)\nConstâncio, Vítor, “Understanding Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, 2015.\n(https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/7077/ConstancioPanelist_JH2015.pdf)\nDel Negro, Marco, Michele Lenza, Giorgio E.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMarket News International Webcast\n(via videoconference)\nSeptember 7, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the MNI webcast. I will focus my opening\nremarks on how monetary policy will foster a return to price stability, and I look forward to the questionand-answer portion of the session to hear what is on your mind. Of course, the views I present will be my\nown and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\nThe Key Economic Challenge Is High Inflation\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well\nabove 2 percent for over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced economies\naround the globe. This inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an imbalance\nbetween strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures on prices.\nInflation is the number one concern of businesses and households: this is evident in surveys and in my\nconversations with regional contacts. High inflation imposes a particularly onerous burden on those who\ndo not have the wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, and who now have\nto make some hard choices about how to spend their money.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain\nhealthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive\nand live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. The FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring\ninflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2 percent; it is taking decisive action to remove monetary\npolicy accommodation to bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and\nlabor markets. Since March of this year, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate by\n2-1/4 percentage points, and it has begun to reduce the assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet,\nwhich will also reduce accommodation. Given current rates of inflation, I believe that the Fed has more\nwork to do in order to get inflation under control. This will entail further rate increases to tighten\n\n\f2\nfinancial conditions, resulting in an economic transition to below-trend growth in nominal output, slower\nemployment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\nEconomic Growth\nEconomic activity is beginning to slow down from last year’s robust pace. It is responding to our\nmonetary policy actions and to the tightening in overall financial conditions since last year. But the\nslowdown also reflects how households and businesses are responding to very high inflation and their\nconcerns about the economic outlook, to the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and to slower\ngrowth abroad. Consumer spending, housing activity, and business investment have decelerated from the\nrobust pace seen last year. Indeed, the level of real GDP decreased in the first half of this year. Despite\nthis moderation, aggregate demand is still out of balance with aggregate supply, which remains\nconstrained due to supply chain disruptions stemming from pandemic-related shutdowns across the globe\nand the war in Ukraine. Many firms tell us that they will be investing to make their supply chains more\nresilient to be better prepared for the future. In the meantime, supply disruptions remain a challenge and\nthey have added to price pressures.\n\nAnalysts often use the rule-of-thumb that two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth means\nthe economy is in recession. I do not believe the U.S. economy is currently in a recession because the\nlabor market is so strong. I do believe that the risks of recession over the next two years have moved up\nbecause financial conditions are tightening globally, inflation is very high in many countries, global\ngrowth is slowing, and the devastating war in Ukraine is adding considerable uncertainty and downside\nrisks to the growth outlook, especially in Europe.\n\nI am in the process of preparing my submission to the Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC\nparticipants, which will be released after our next FOMC meeting in two weeks. At this point, I have not\nincorporated a recession into my baseline outlook for the U.S., but instead expect a fairly sharp slowing in\n\n\f3\nactivity, especially when compared to the robust growth the U.S. experienced in 2021. While there is\nconsiderable uncertainty, I currently expect that the U.S. economy will return to positive growth in the\nsecond half of the year, but for this year as a whole and for next year, I expect growth to run well below 2\npercent, which is my estimate of trend growth.\n\nLabor Markets\nWith the economy growing below trend, I expect labor market conditions to cool, with the unemployment\nrate rising somewhat above 4 percent by the end of next year. Some cooling off in the labor market will\nput it on more sustainable footing compared to the unsustainably tight conditions that exist today. The\nemployment report for August, released last Friday, suggests that we are beginning to see some\nmoderation but that labor market conditions remain strong.\n\nLast year, the economy added 6.7 million jobs, a robust average of over 550 thousand jobs per month.\nThis year, average job gains have slowed to about 440 thousand per month. The unemployment rate rose\nin August, but at 3.7 percent, it remains very low. The increase in the unemployment rate partly reflects\nan increase in labor force participation. The participation rate of prime-age workers has returned to where\none would expect it to be. Many people chose to retire during the pandemic and left the labor force, and\nthe overall participation rate, which includes those of retirement age, has risen only gradually. A\ncontinued rise in participation would be helpful in easing the imbalance between labor market demand\nand labor market supply. But typically, most people do not return to the job market once they have\nretired. So there is little reason to think that we will see an influx of workers that is large enough to return\nthe overall participation rate to its pre-pandemic level. Although the number of job openings has eased in\nrecent months, labor demand is still outpacing labor supply. There is still almost double the number of\nopenings per unemployed worker. To put this into perspective: in 2019, another time of tight labor\nmarkets, there were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\n\f4\nContacts across a broad spectrum of firms tell us it has been very difficult to find workers. They have\nbeen using a variety of ways to attract and retain staff, including offering more flexible work schedules,\nsigning and retention bonuses, expanded benefits, and higher base wages. The employment cost index for\nprivate industry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6.0 percent annual\npace. More recent reports suggest that wage pressures may be beginning to stabilize, but they remain\nhigh. Even so, for many workers their wage increases have not kept up with inflation, and their\npurchasing power is being eroded. With trend productivity growth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2\npercent, wage growth will need to moderate to around 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price\nstability.\n\nInflation\nAs their costs have continued to rise, businesses have been raising the prices they charge their customers\nand finding little resistance. Despite some moderation in economic activity, inflation readings continue to\nbe at the highest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation came in at about 6-1/4\npercent in July; CPI inflation was 8-1/2 percent. These readings were down slightly from their June\nreadings, mainly reflecting a sharp drop in the price of gasoline and energy. This was welcome news, but\nwe have to guard against wishful thinking becoming a substitute for compelling evidence.\n\nIn my view, it is far too soon to conclude that inflation has peaked, let alone that it is on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent. Measures of the underlying inflation trend did not uniformly decline in\nJuly,1 and given developments related to the ongoing war in Ukraine, gas and energy prices may move\nhigher again later this year. In addition, services inflation, which tends to be persistent, is at its highest\n\n1\n\nOnly the core PCE inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, declined in July. Measured year-over-year,\ncore CPI inflation and the median and trimmed-mean inflation rates, which exclude the components with extreme\nmovements, were either stable or actually increased. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmedmean PCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces the\nmedian and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rates and the median PCE inflation rate and provides analyses of inflation\nand inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n\n\f5\nlevel since the early 1990s, with growth in housing rent and shelter costs likely to keep inflation elevated\nfor some time. In my view, it will take a while for inflation to return to the Fed’s 2 percent goal. But I do\nexpect inflation to move down into a range of 5 to 6 percent for this year and then to make more progress\ntoward our goal over the next two years, because I expect the Fed to take further action to make it so.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. Monetary\npolicy cannot affect the supply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings.\nInstead, it works on the demand side of the economy. The Fed is being resolute and intentional in\ntightening financial conditions to bring demand into better balance with supply to alleviate price\npressures. Since March, we have raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 2-1/4\npercentage points and financial conditions are tighter than they were at the end of last year.\n\nIn addition, in June we began to reduce the size of our balance sheet according to the plan announced in\nMay.2 Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction in our balance sheet is being\ndone primarily by adjusting how much we reinvest of the principal payments we receive on our assets.\nWithout asset sales, the process could take three years or so. I would favor the FOMC’s considering\nselling some of our agency mortgage-backed securities at some point during balance-sheet reduction in\norder to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury securities.3 Holding\n\n2\n\nStarting in September, the Fed will allow up to $60 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $35 billion\nper month of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities\nare less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. See the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (2022b).\n3\n\nAs indicated in the minutes of the March 2022 FOMC meeting, FOMC participants generally agreed that after\nbalance-sheet reduction was well underway, it would be appropriate to consider sales of agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities. See the Federal Open Market Committee (2022a), pp. 4-5.\n\n\f6\nmainly Treasuries will help to minimize the effect of the Fed’s holdings on the allocation of credit across\neconomic sectors.4\n\nAs is always the case, we will be calibrating our monetary policy based on the implications of incoming\ninformation for the economic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals. Monetary\npolicy acts with a lag on the economy. It is unlikely that we have seen the full effect on households and\nbusinesses of the rate increases we have implemented so far. Moreover, because of the lagged effects of\nmonetary policy, it would not be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2\npercent. That said, given the current level of inflation and the economic outlook, I believe that further\nincreases in our policy rate are needed.\n\nWe will need to move policy into a restrictive stance in order to put inflation on a sustained downward\ntrajectory to 2 percent. That means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is,\nreal interest rates, will need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Right now,\nnominal short-term interest rates are lower than expected inflation, so short-term real interest rates are still\nnegative and monetary policy is still accommodative. My current view is that it will be necessary to\nmove the nominal fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next year and hold it there; I do\nnot anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year. But let me emphasize that this is based\non my current reading of the economy and outlook. While it is clear that the fed funds rate needs to move\nup from its current level, the size of rate increases at any particular FOMC meeting and the peak fed funds\nrate will depend on the inflation outlook, which depends on the assessment of how rapidly aggregate\ndemand and supply are coming back into better balance and price pressures are being reduced.\n\n4\n\nOne potential way to implement sales would be to sell agency securities up to the cap in any month in which\nprincipal payments were less than the cap. This is similar to our treatment of Treasuries. Another way to implement\nsales would be to set a monthly floor on reductions, which would be met first by principal payments received and\nthen by sales. See Mester (2022a).\n\n\f7\nMaking that assessment will remain challenging because there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding\nthe outlook for the global economy. Both the demand side and the supply side of the economy will be\naffected by a variety of forces, including the war in Ukraine and the energy situation in Europe, the global\neconomic outlook, the sentiment of consumers and businesses and their reaction to elevated inflation\nreadings, changes in supply chain disruptions, and labor force participation.\n\nIn formulating my monetary policy views, I will be guarding against declaring victory over the inflation\nbeast too soon. Doing so would put us back in the stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s,\nwhich was very costly to households and businesses.5 Before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will\nneed to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings.\n\nI will be carefully watching measures of inflation expectations, particularly expectations of inflation over\nthe medium and longer term. The rise in inflation expectations since last year has been concentrated in\nshorter-term expectations, which tend to move with gasoline prices and the prices of other salient items\nlike food. Nonetheless, medium- and longer-term expectations remain at the upper end of the range of\nvalues consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, and they could move up further depending on inflation\ndevelopments over the balance of the year. A risk-management perspective on monetary policymaking\nstrongly argues against being complacent about a rise in longer-term expectations. If longer-term\ninflation expectations were to become unanchored and move above levels consistent with our longer-run\ninflation goal, high inflation would become embedded in the economy, affecting the actions of both firms\nand consumers; at that point, it would be considerably more difficult and more costly to bring inflation\ndown. Better economic outcomes are achieved when policymakers assume that rises in inflation and\ninflation expectations are persistent and act forcibly to bring both down.6 Such action gives the public\n\n5\n\nFor a short, readable history, see Sablik (2013).\n\n6\n\nSee Mester (2022b), De Pooter, et al. (2016), Walsh (2022), and Schnabel (2022).\n\n\f8\nmore confidence that policymakers are committed to ensuring price stability, and this helps to anchor the\npublic’s expectations about inflation, reinforcing the effect of the policy action itself.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\nThe return to price stability will take some time and a lot of fortitude. There will be bumps along the\nroad. Financial markets could well remain volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could\nslow more than expected and return to negative territory; and the unemployment rate could move above\nestimates of its longer-run level. This will be painful in the near term but so is high inflation. High\ninflation imposes costs on households and businesses in both the short and long run. It eats into savings\nand makes it hard to plan for the future. Perhaps Paul Volcker said it best as he fought inflation in the\n1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation will only make any subsequent effort\nmore difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”7\n\nIn summary, price stability is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a healthy,\nproductive economy over time. I do not view the current situation as one in which there is a tradeoff\nbetween our two monetary policy goals. If we fail to take decisive action to get inflation down and firmly\nanchor inflation expectations, we will not be able to sustain healthy labor markets over the medium and\nlong run, to the detriment of the public.\n\n7\n\nVolcker (1981), p. 2.\n\n\f9\nReferences\nDe Pooter, Michiel, Alan Detmeister, Eric Engstrom, Don Kim, David Lebow, Canlin Li, Elmar Mertens,\nJeremy Nalewaik, Marius Rodriguez, Jae Sim, Brad Strum, Robert Tetlow, Min Wei, and Emre Yoldas,\n“Longer-Term Inflation Expectations: Evidence and Policy Implications,” memo to the FOMC, March 4,\n2016, authorized for public release by the FOMC Secretariat on 1/14/2022.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20160304memo07.pdf)\nFederal Open Market Committee, Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 15-16, 2022a.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20220316.pdf)\nFederal Open Market Committee, Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,\nMay 4, 2022b.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm)\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx)\nMester, Loretta J., “The FOMC’s Plan for Significantly Reducing the Federal Reserve’s Securities\nHoldings,” panel remarks, 2022 Financial Markets Conference: A New Era of Financial Innovation and\nDisruption: Challenges and Opportunities, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Amelia Island, FL, May 10,\n2022a.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20220510-the-fomcs-plan-forsignificantly-reducing-the-federal-reserves-securities-holdings.aspx)\nMester, Loretta J., “The Role of Inflation Expectations in Monetary Policymaking: A Practitioner’s\nPerspective,” European Central Bank Forum on Central Banking: Challenges for Monetary Policy in a\nRapidly Changing World, Sintra, Portugal, June 29, 2022b.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20220629-the-role-of-inflationexpectations-in-monetary-policymaking)\nSablik, Tim, “Recession of 1981-82,” Federal Reserve History, Federal Reserve System, November 22,\n2013.\n(https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1981-82)\nSchnabel, Isabel, “Monetary Policy and the Great Volatility,” panel remarks at the Economic Policy\nSymposium, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 27, 2022.\n(https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220827~93f7d07535.en.html)\nVolcker, Paul A. “No Time for Backsliding,” remarks at the National Press Club, Washington, DC,\nSeptember 25, 1981.\n(https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/statements-speeches-paul-a-volcker-451/time-backsliding-8243)\nWalsh, Carl E., “Inflation Surges and Monetary Policy,” Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies,\nBank of Japan, IMES Discussion Paper Series, 2022-E-12, July 2022.\n(https://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/abstracts/english/22-E-12.html)\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGovernment Affairs Breakfast\nDayton Area Chamber of Commerce\nDayton, OH\nAugust 31, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a great pleasure to be with you today, and I thank Jackie Gamblin for the kind introduction. As many\nof you know, in addition to being CEO of JYG Innovations, Jackie is also a director of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Jackie for her public service to my\norganization and to the country. Jackie and her fellow directors provide a wealth of information on the\neconomic circumstances of households and businesses in their regions. The information comes from their\nown firms and customers, as well as other business and community contacts like you. In the\nunprecedented environment we have all had to confront since the start of the pandemic, I cannot overstate\nthe value of this reconnaissance in helping me and my colleagues at the Fed formulate monetary policy.\n\nIndeed, since I last spoke at this breakfast four years ago, much has transpired. At that time, the economy\nwas in the ninth year of an expansion; labor markets were strong; and inflation was finally moving up to\nour 2 percent goal after running below this goal for some time. The Fed was continuing to increase its\npolicy rate, the fed funds rate, to be consistent with these healthy economic conditions and the outlook.\nThe economic expansion continued for another two years, until the pandemic changed all that. The\nresilience shown by households and businesses over the past two challenging years has been truly\nremarkable. Yet many challenges remain; in particular, inflation, which is at a 40-year high, is a serious\nburden for households, businesses, and the overall economy. Today, I will focus my remarks on how\nmonetary policy will foster a return to price stability. Of course, the views I present will be my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe Economy\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well\nabove 2 percent for over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced economies\naround the globe. This inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an imbalance\n\n\f2\nbetween strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures on prices.\nVarious surveys and my conversations with regional contacts reveal that inflation is the number one\nconcern of businesses and households. It imposes a particularly onerous burden on those who don’t have\nthe wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, whose inflation rates have\nbeen particularly high.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain\nhealthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive\nand live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. The FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring\ninflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2 percent; it is taking decisive action to remove monetary\npolicy accommodation to bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and\nlabor markets. Since March of this year, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate by\n2-1/4 percentage points, and it has begun to reduce the assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet,\nwhich will also reduce accommodation. Given current rates of inflation, I believe that the Fed has more\nwork to do in order to get inflation under control. This will entail further rate increases to tighten\nfinancial conditions, resulting in an economic transition to below-trend growth in nominal output, slower\nemployment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\nEconomic Growth\nIn fact, we are beginning to see activity slow down from last year’s robust pace. In part, this can be\nattributed to our monetary policy actions and the tightening in overall financial conditions compared to a\nyear ago. But it also reflects households’ and businesses’ responses to very high inflation and their\nconcerns about the economic outlook, as well as the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and\nslower growth abroad. Consumer spending, housing activity, and business investment have decelerated\nfrom the robust pace seen last year. Indeed, real GDP moved down in the first half of this year. In the\nfirst quarter, the main contributors to the decline in output were declines in net exports and government\n\n\f3\nspending and slower inventory investment, but consumer and business spending remained solid. The\nsecond quarter saw slower growth in these components as well. While manufacturing surveys suggest\nactivity has moderated, firms in our region tell us that their strong order books should keep them busy at\nleast through the end of the year. In response to higher mortgage rates, residential investment, one of the\nmost interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, also fell quite sharply in the second quarter. Yet,\nbecause the supply of housing has not kept up with demand, housing prices and rents remain quite\nelevated.\n\nIndeed, supply constraints have posed a significant challenge across a variety of sectors since the\neconomy reopened after the pandemic shutdowns. In product markets, firms have had to deal with a\ncascading set of disruptions to their global supply chains. These disruptions stem from pandemic-related\nshutdowns across the globe and the war in Ukraine, which has further constrained supplies in energy,\nmetals, and agricultural commodity markets. Firms in Dayton and other parts of our region tell us that the\nsupply challenges have lasted longer than they expected and they have had to be creative in meeting those\nchallenges. Some manufacturers are stockpiling large volumes of materials to have them on hand to meet\nfuture demand or to fill their backlogged orders. Other firms are custom making parts to substitute for\nthose that are unavailable. Many have been trying to adjust their inventories to be better prepared to meet\ncurrent and future demand, which explains some of the overstocking at the end of last year, followed by\nslower inventory building this year. Many firms tell us that they will be investing to make their supply\nchains more resilient to be better prepared for the future.\n\nAnalysts often use the rule-of-thumb that two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth means\nthe economy is in recession. I do not believe the U.S. economy is currently in a recession because the\nlabor market remains very strong. I do acknowledge that the risks of recession over the next year or two\nhave moved up because financial conditions are tightening globally, inflation remains at high levels in\nmany countries, and the devastating war in Ukraine adds considerable uncertainty and downside risks to\n\n\f4\nthe growth outlook, especially in Europe. That said, at this point, I have not incorporated a recession into\nmy baseline outlook for the U.S., but instead expect a fairly sharp slowing in activity, especially when\ncompared to the robust growth the U.S. experienced in 2021. While there is considerable uncertainty, I\ncurrently expect that the U.S. economy will return to positive growth in the second half of the year, but\nfor this year as a whole and for next year, I expect growth to run well below 2 percent, which is my\nestimate of trend growth.\n\nLabor Markets\nWith the economy growing below trend, I expect the current very strong labor market conditions to cool,\nwith the unemployment rate rising somewhat above 4 percent by the end of next year. Some cooling off\nin the labor market will put it on more sustainable footing compared to the unsustainably tight conditions\nthat exist today.\n\nThe economy added 6.7 million jobs last year, an average of over 550 thousand jobs per month, which is\nvery robust. There are widespread reports from a broad spectrum of firms about how hard it has been to\nfind workers. Even so, employment growth has remained very strong this year. Job gains averaged about\n460 thousand per month over the first half of the year, and they accelerated in July. The unemployment\nrate fell to 3.5 percent, matching the lowest level reached during the long pre-pandemic expansion.\nAlthough the number of job openings has eased in recent months, they remain at historically high levels:\nthere are close to 2 openings per unemployed worker; in 2019, another time of tight labor markets, there\nwere about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\nA variety of reasons have contributed to people leaving the workforce early in the pandemic and then\nonly slowly returning. These include responsibilities for caring for children or other family members;\nfear of the virus; reevaluation of their careers; and retirement. Reduced immigration has also constrained\nlabor supply. The participation rate of prime-age workers has returned to where one would expect it to\n\n\f5\nbe. Overall participation, which includes those of retirement age, has improved, but only gradually.\nTypically, most people don’t return to the job market once they have retired. So there is little reason to\nthink that we will see an influx of workers large enough to return the overall participation rate to its prepandemic level.\n\nFirms have been using a variety of ways to attract and retain staff, including offering more flexible work\nschedules, signing and retention bonuses, expanded benefits, and higher base wages. Wage pressures\nhave been building up for a while and show little sign of abating. The employment cost index for private\nindustry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6.0 percent annual pace.\nEven so, these wage increases have not kept up with inflation, so workers’ purchasing power is being\neroded. Higher wages that reflect higher productivity growth don’t contribute to inflation, and they are a\npositive for both workers and firms. But current wage increases are not consistent with inflation returning\nto our 2 percent goal. With trend productivity growth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, wage\ngrowth will need to moderate to around 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price stability. As\nformer Fed Chair Paul Volcker pointed out in the midst of his fight against very high inflation in 1981:\n“[Wage gains], when they are not grounded in real growth and productivity, are a kind of economic ‘shell\ngame’ in which rising incomes disappear at the supermarket or the shoe store… .” 1\n\nInflation\nAs their costs have continued to rise, businesses have been raising the prices they charge their customers\nand finding little resistance. Over the past year, price pressures have broadened across goods and\nservices, and despite some moderation in economic activity, inflation readings continue to be at the\nhighest levels in 40 years. To assess the inflation situation, I look at a variety of measures. The Fed has\nset its inflation target in terms of PCE inflation. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation came in at about\n6-1/4 percent in July; CPI inflation was 8-1/2 percent. These readings were down slightly from their June\n1\n\nVolcker (1981a), p. 2.\n\n\f6\nreadings, mainly reflecting a sharp drop in the price of gasoline and energy. This was welcome news, but\nwe have to guard against wishful thinking becoming a substitute for compelling evidence.\n\nIn my view, it is far too soon to conclude that inflation has peaked, let alone that it is on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent. First, measures of the underlying inflation trend did not uniformly decline in\nJuly. Only the core PCE inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, declined. Measured year-overyear, core CPI inflation and the median and trimmed-mean inflation rates, which exclude the components\nwith extreme movements, were either stable or actually increased. 2 Second, in the coming months, goods\ninflation may slow in response to easing demand and the appreciation of the dollar, but the prices of\nenergy and other commodities are set in global markets, and developments related to the ongoing war in\nUkraine may lead to higher prices later this year. Third, inflation in the prices of services tends to be\nmore persistent. Services inflation is at its highest level since the early 1990s, and growth in housing rent\nand shelter costs, which represent a large share of measured inflation, will likely keep inflation elevated\nfor some time. All of this suggests that it will take a while for inflation to reach the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\nI expect inflation to move down into a range of 5 to 6 percent for this year and then to make more\nprogress toward our goal over the next two years, but it will require further action on the part of the Fed to\nmake that so.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. Monetary\npolicy cannot affect the supply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings.\nInstead, it works on the demand side of the economy. The Fed is being resolute and intentional in\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n2\n\n\f7\ntightening financial conditions to bring demand into better balance with supply to alleviate price\npressures. Since March, we have raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 2-1/4\npercentage points and financial conditions are tighter than they were at the end of last year.\n\nIn addition, in June we began to reduce the size of our balance sheet according to the plan announced in\nMay. 3 Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction in our balance sheet is being\ndone primarily by adjusting how much we reinvest of the principal payments we receive on our assets.\nWithout asset sales, the process could take three years or so. 4\n\nMonetary policy acts with a lag on the economy. So even though other financial conditions, like\nmortgage rates, have adjusted, it is likely we have not yet seen the full effect of the rate increases we have\nimplemented so far on households and businesses. Given the lagged effects of monetary policy, it would\nnot be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2 percent. As is always the\ncase, we will be calibrating our policy based on the implications of incoming information for the\neconomic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals. That said, at our last meeting,\nthe FOMC indicated that it anticipates that ongoing rate increases in the fed funds rate will be appropriate.\nI certainly agree with that view.\n\nGiven the current level of inflation and the economic outlook, I anticipate that policy will need to move\ninto a restrictive stance in order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent. In my\n\nStarting in September, the Fed will allow up to $60 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $35 billion\nper month of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities\nare less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. See the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (2022b).\n\n3\n\nAs indicated in the minutes of the March 2022 FOMC meeting, FOMC participants generally agreed that after\nbalance-sheet reduction was well underway, it would be appropriate to consider sales of agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Sales would help to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury\nsecurities, consistent with the FOMC’s stated desire to minimize the effect of the Fed’s balance-sheet holdings on\nthe allocation of credit across economic sectors. See the Federal Open Market Committee (2022a), pp. 4-5.\n\n4\n\n\f8\nview, that means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is, real interest rates,\nwill need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Right now, nominal short-term\ninterest rates are lower than expected inflation, so short-term real interest rates are still negative and\nmonetary policy is still accommodative. The current level of the fed funds rate is near the range of\nestimates of its longer-run nominal level, and when inflation is at 2 percent and inflation expectations are\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation, this longer-run level would be neutral in the sense of neither\nstimulating nor restraining economic activity. But in the current high-inflation environment, a\n2-1/2 percent nominal funds rate is still accommodative and the Fed has more work to do. My current\nview is that it will be necessary to move the fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next\nyear and hold it there; I do not anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year. But let me\nemphasize that this is based on my current reading of the economy and outlook. While it is clear that the\nfed funds rate needs to move up from its current level, the size of rate increases at any particular FOMC\nmeeting and the peak fed funds rate will depend on the inflation outlook, which depends on the\nassessment of how rapidly aggregate demand and supply are coming back into better balance and price\npressures are being reduced.\n\nMaking that assessment will remain challenging because there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding\nthe outlook for the global economy, with a variety of forces affecting the demand and supply sides of the\neconomy. The war in Ukraine and the energy situation in Europe could impose further costs on the\npeople in that region and on the global economy, posing downside risks to growth but upside risks to\ninflation. A souring in consumer and business sentiment and reactions to elevated inflation readings\ncould result in a larger than anticipated moderation in activity. There are some potential positives on the\nsupply side of the economy. The newly passed fiscal package may have a larger effect on productivity\ngrowth and inflation over the near term than current private-sector estimates suggest. 5 And with some\n\nAnalysis by Penn Wharton Budget Model (2022) indicates that the Inflation Reduction Act would reduce\ncumulative government deficits by $264 billion over the 10-year budget window, have no meaningful effect on\n\n5\n\n\f9\nluck, supply chain disruptions will abate faster than anticipated and labor market participation will\ncontinue to rise, helping to ease supply constraints in product and labor markets and bringing supply into\nbetter balance with demand. But we cannot rely on luck.\n\nIt would be a mistake to declare victory over the inflation beast too soon. Doing so would put us back in\nthe stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s, which was very costly to households and\nbusinesses. 6 In assessing the appropriate stance of policy, I will be looking for compelling evidence that\ninflation is on a sustainable downward trajectory to our 2 percent goal. Before I conclude that inflation\nhas peaked, I will need to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings. I will also be\ncarefully watching measures of inflation expectations, particularly expectations of inflation over the\nmedium and longer term. Currently, consumers and businesses expect inflation to be well above 2\npercent over the next year. While recent readings of medium- and longer-term expectations have eased\noff a bit, they have moved up over time and are at the upper end of the range of values consistent with our\ninflation goal. Research indicates that changes in the prices of particular salient items, including gasoline\nand food, can have an outsized effect on households’ inflation expectations. 7 Gas prices have come down\nfrom recent highs but with the uncertainty surrounding world oil supply, gasoline prices could rise again,\nand food prices might remain high.\n\nWe need to be particularly attuned to inflation expectations. If longer-term inflation expectations were to\nbecome unanchored and move above levels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal, high inflation\nwould become embedded in the economy, affecting the actions of both firms and consumers; at that point\nit would be considerably more difficult and more costly to bring inflation down. A risk-management\n\ninflation in the near term, but would reduce inflation by 0.1 percentage point by the middle of the first decade. See\nPenn Wharton Budget Model (2022).\n6\n\nFor a short, readable history, see Sablik (2013).\n\n7\nFor the effect of experiences from high-inflation eras on inflation expectations, see Malmendier and Nagel (2016).\nFor the effect of salient prices on inflation expectations, see Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), Cavallo, Cruces,\nand Perez-Truglia (2017), D’Acunto, et al. (2021), and Campos, McMain, and Pedemonte (2022).\n\n\f10\nperspective strongly argues against policymakers being complacent about a rise in longer-term\nexpectations. Instead, better economic outcomes are achieved if policymakers assume rises in inflation\nand inflation expectations are persistent and act forcibly to bring both down. It is good to remember that\ninflation expectations are determined not only by movements in inflation but also by policymakers’\nactions to follow through on their strongly stated commitment to price stability, thereby justifying the\npublic’s belief in our commitment.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\nThe return to price stability will take some time and a lot of fortitude. There will be bumps along the\nroad. Financial markets could well remain volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could\nslow more than expected; and the unemployment rate could move above estimates of its longer-run level.\nThis will be painful in the near term but so is high inflation. High inflation imposes costs on households\nand businesses in both the short and long run. It eats into savings and makes it hard to plan for the future.\nIf we fail to take the actions needed to get inflation down and firmly anchor inflation expectations, we\nwill not be able to sustain healthy labor markets over the medium and long run, to the detriment of the\npublic.\n\nAs Paul Volcker said as he fought inflation in the 1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on\ninflation will only make any subsequent effort more difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.” 8\nThat statement is as true now as it was then. That is why I remain resolute in setting monetary policy to\nreturn the economy to price stability, which is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a\nhealthy, productive economy over time.\n\n8\n\nVolcker (1981b), p. 2.\n\n\f11\nReferences\nCampos, Chris, Michael McMain, and Mathieu Pedemonte, “Understanding Which Prices Affect\nInflation Expectations,” Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Number 2022-06,\nApril 19, 2022.\n(https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-ec-202206)\nCavallo, Alberto, Guillermo Cruces, and Ricardo Perez-Truglia, “Inflation Expectations, Learning, and\nSupermarket Prices: Evidence from Survey Experiments,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics\n9, 2017, pp. 1-35.\n(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20150147)\nCoibion, Olivier, and Yuriy Gorodnichenko, “Is the Phillips Curve Alive and Well after All?

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPhiladelphia Council for Business Economics\nPhiladelphia, PA\n(via videoconference)\nJune 2, 2022\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\nI thank Michael Weiss and the Philadelphia Council for Business Economics (PCBE) for inviting me to\nspeak today. It is nice to be back in Philly, if only virtually. I spent many years at the Philadelphia Fed\nand fondly remember attending many of the PCBE’s programs, which were held at the Bank. The\nconversations were always relevant, with attendees providing a variety of valuable insights into the\neconomy, financial markets, and policy. So I am looking forward to engaging with you today. But before\nwe start, I need to remind you that the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe key challenge facing the economy is unacceptably high inflation, which reflects the imbalance\nbetween strong aggregate demand and constrained aggregate supply. The FOMC is committed to using\nits tools to get inflation under control, on a downward trajectory to its longer-run inflation goal of 2\npercent, and the Committee has begun the process of repositioning monetary policy. This recalibration\nreflects the evolution of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and the risks around the outlook, and\nas the recalibration proceeds, it will continue to do so.\n\nThe Economy\nLast year, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong.\nReal GDP grew at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent, the highest since 1984 and well above the trend growth\nrate, which I estimate to be about 2 percent. Growth this year has been expected to slow from this robust\npace, and in the first quarter, growth actually turned negative. But the details of the report suggest that\ndemand momentum remained strong. The main contributors to the decline in output were declines in net\nexports and government spending, and slower inventory investment. The decline in net exports reflected\na pullback in foreign demand for our exports amid continued robust domestic demand for imports.\nGovernment spending fell but remained at a high level. The pace at which firms invested in inventories\nwas still very strong, just not as strong as the robust pace seen in the fourth quarter. Supported by savings\n\n\f2\n\naccumulated during the pandemic, consumer spending grew at a solid pace in the first quarter, and growth\nin business fixed investment was solid as well. The April personal consumption data indicate that even\nthough consumers are paying higher prices, they are continuing to spend. Indeed, adjusted for inflation,\nconsumer spending increased on nondurable goods, durable goods, and services.\n\nStrong demand has occurred in the face of very constrained supply in both product and labor markets.\nProduct markets have had to deal with a cascading set of disruptions to supply chains, reflecting\ndifferences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across the globe. China’s zero-COVID\npolicy has further disrupted supply chains, and Russia’s dastardly invasion of Ukraine has further\nconstrained supplies in energy, metals, and agricultural commodity markets. Some of our business\ncontacts have characterized the situation as akin to Whac-A-Mole. As soon as they figure out how to\nsolve a problem in one part of their supply chain, a problem arises in another part. This has meant that\nthe supply chain disruptions have lasted a lot longer than businesses expected. For example, last\nDecember, almost two-thirds of our business contacts who were having supply chain problems thought\nthey would see meaningful improvement this year. Now only a third do. Firms have told us that\nmanaging their supply chains and their workforce to meet demand has taken attention away from other\nactivities, such as new product innovation, which could affect the longer-run competitiveness of their\nfirms. The recent industrial production data indicate that manufacturers have been able to maintain solid\nproduction, even if doing so has taken considerable effort.\n\nHiring and retention have also required significant effort by businesses. Labor markets are very tight.\nThe economy added 6.7 million jobs last year, and monthly payroll gains have averaged above 500\nthousand over the first four months of this year. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent and is\nnear the lowest level reached during the long pre-pandemic expansion. Labor force participation remains\nbelow its pre-pandemic level. A variety of reasons have contributed to the reduced supply of workers and\npeople leaving the workforce and then only slowly returning to work during the pandemic. These include\n\n\f3\n\nresponsibility for caring for children or other family members; fear of the virus; reevaluation of their\ncareers; retirement; and reduced immigration. Over time, participation has improved significantly, but\nlabor supply has not been able to keep up with robust labor demand. Job openings are at historically high\nlevels: there are almost 2 openings per unemployed worker; in 2019, another time of tight labor markets,\nthere were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker. The performance of the labor market over the\npast two years is even more remarkable when you think back to the early months of the pandemic. In just\ntwo months, March and April of 2020, the economy lost about 22 million jobs – about the number it had\ngained over the long pre-pandemic expansion – and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent.\nConditions are vastly different now.\n\nWith demand out of balance with supply in both product and labor markets, prices and wages have moved\nup significantly. When costs first started to rise, firms told us they were reluctant to pass on these higher\ncosts to customers. But as costs have continued to rise, firms have been passing higher costs on in the\nform of higher prices and finding little resistance. Inflation readings are now at their highest levels in 40\nyears. Measured year-over-year, in April, total PCE inflation was over 6-1/4 percent, core PCE inflation\nwas nearly 5 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation was over 4-1/4 percent. When\ninflation started to move up earlier last year, it was concentrated mainly in goods and services most\ndirectly affected by the pandemic and its effects on supply chains, such as used cars and home furniture.\nAs the economy reopened, people who accumulated savings when things were shut down have been able\nto travel and eat out more, and prices for these and other services are now rising sharply. Indeed, price\npressures have broadened to a wide set of goods and services. One way to see this is to look at the 44\ncomponents that are used to construct the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation measure. Measured yearover-year, median CPI rose at a 5.2 percent rate in April, with 64 percent of components having yearover-year inflation rates of 5 percent or more, and 82 percent of components having inflation rates of\n3 percent or more. In contrast, a year ago, the median CPI measure of inflation was 2.1 percent, and\n\n\f4\n\n41 percent of components had inflation rates under 2 percent. 1\n\nWage pressures have also built up over time. The employment cost index for private industry workers\naccelerated over the three months ending in March, rising at a 5.8 percent annual pace. Higher wages that\nreflect higher productivity growth are a positive for the economy, and a higher level of wages represents a\nshift of income share from capital to labor. But the current pace of wage increases is inconsistent with\nmaintaining price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its goals of price stability and maximum employment. While monetary policy cannot affect the\nsupply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings, it can affect the demand side\nof the economy. The Fed is committed to using its tools to get inflation under control by tightening\nfinancial conditions to bring excess demand into better balance with constrained supply.\n\nThe FOMC raised its policy rate by 25 basis points at its March meeting and by another 50 basis points at\nits May meeting, and the Committee indicated that it believes ongoing rate increases will be appropriate.\nIn addition, yesterday the Fed began reducing the size of its balance sheet according to the plan\nannounced in May. Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction will be done\nprimarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments the Fed receives on its assets.\nWithout asset sales, the process could take three years or so. The Fed is starting by allowing up to\n$30 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion per month of agency securities to run\noff its balance sheet. In three months, these caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and\n\n1\nThe median CPI and median PCE inflation measures are maintained by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation\nResearch and are available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n\n\f5\n\n$35 billion per month for agency securities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are\nless than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. As securities\nrun off the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet, the Fed’s liabilities, which include reserve balances, will\nalso decline. The balance sheet will continue to shrink until reserve balances are close to the level the\nFOMC judges is consistent with implementing monetary policy via its ample reserves operating regime.\nIn this regime, reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not needed.\n\nWith the interest rate moves we have made so far, the current target range of the federal funds rate is 75 to\n100 basis points. This is well below the range of estimates of the longer-run nominal policy rate that\nwould be neutral in the sense of neither stimulating nor restraining economic activity when inflation is\n2 percent. For example, in the March Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, the\nrange of estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate was 2 to 3 percent. My own estimate is 2-1/2 percent.\nIf inflation were 2 percent, with longer-term inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with the\n2 percent goal, this would imply a neutral real fed funds rate of 1/2 percent. But in the current high\ninflation environment, the real fed funds rate remains very negative. So given economic conditions,\nongoing increases in the fed funds rate are called for. Unless there are some big surprises, I expect it to\nbe appropriate to raise the policy rate another 50 basis points at each of our next two meetings.\n\nAt that point, the nominal funds rate will be nearing the lower end of estimates of the longer-run neutral\nrate and the balance-sheet reduction will have been underway for two months. The FOMC will then be\nwell positioned to consider the appropriate pace at which to continue removing accommodation over the\nbalance of the year and assess how high rates will need to go. In my view, with inflation as elevated as it\nis, the funds rate will probably need to go above its longer-run neutral level to rein in inflation. But we\ncannot make that call today because it will depend on how much demand moderates and what happens on\n\n\f6\n\nthe supply side of the economy. So, we need to continue monitoring economic and financial\ndevelopments closely to gauge the balance between demand and supply and the evolution of price\npressures. Making this assessment will be challenging because a variety of forces will be affecting the\ndemand and supply sides of the economy as the year progresses. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the\nCOVID lockdowns in China pose upside risks to inflation but downside risks to growth. On the demand\nside, broader financial conditions have already tightened considerably, as markets have anticipated further\nrate increases in light of the Fed’s forward guidance. For example, the 30-year mortgage rate was under\n3 percent last September and is now about 5-1/4 percent, and recent data suggest some tempering in\nhousing market activity. It could be that the relatively swift tightening in financial conditions means that\nmonetary policy will transmit throughout the economy faster than in past cycles and that demand will\nmoderate more quickly, too. The effects of the fiscal stimulus provided during the pandemic are also\nwaning, which will help to moderate growth. In addition, elevated inflation readings may also result in a\npullback in spending more generally. On the supply side of the economy, with some luck, supply chain\ndisruptions will begin to abate and labor market participation will continue to rise, helping to ease supply\nconstraints and allowing supply in product and labor markets to come into better balance with demand.\nBut we cannot rely on luck.\n\nWith both demand-side and supply-side factors contributing to high inflation, and because inflation tends\nto be persistent, it will likely take some time for inflation to reach our longer-run goal of 2 percent. I will\nbe looking for compelling evidence that inflation is on a downward trajectory toward our 2 percent goal,\nand before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will need to see several months of sustained downward\nmonthly readings of inflation. I have not seen that yet. On the positive side, the monthly increases in the\ncore PCE price index were relatively stable over February, March, and April. But in April, the monthly\nreadings of both core CPI inflation and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation reversed the declines\nseen in March. Rising rents and rising prices of energy, agricultural products, and other commodities can\nbe expected to continue to feed through to overall inflation for a time.\n\n\f7\n\nIn my view, a risk-management approach argues for being cautious about declaring that inflation is on a\nsustainable downward path because the inflation risks are to the upside and because the longer inflation\nruns above our goal, the higher the risk that longer-term inflation expectations will become unanchored,\nthereby making the return to price stability much more costly. We already see that medium- and longerterm inflation expectations have moved up over time. The Board staff’s measure of common inflation\nexpectations, which summarizes a number of measures, has been rising and is at the upper end of the\nrange of values seen since 2005. 2 Some of that rise has been driven by increases in near-term\nexpectations; for example, the Cleveland Fed’s measure of year-ahead indirect consumer inflation\nexpectations, which is based on a nationwide survey of adults with more than 10,000 responses each\nweek, moved above 7 percent for the week ended May 28, 2022, compared to around 4 percent a year\nago. 3 But even though longer-term inflation expectations have moved up by less, I do not think it is\nprudent to ignore the rise given the serious harm that would be caused were longer-term expectations to\nmove above levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal and high inflation were to become\nembedded in the economy. So, if by the September FOMC meeting, the monthly readings on inflation\nprovide compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, then the pace of rate increases could slow,\nbut if inflation has failed to moderate, then a faster pace of rate increases could be necessary.\n\nIn the current environment, there is heightened uncertainty around the outlook. The risk of recession has\nrisen, but because underlying aggregate demand momentum and the demand for labor are so strong, a\ngood case can still be made that as demand and supply come into better balance, a sharp slowdown can be\navoided, with growth slowing to a trend pace this year, labor market conditions remaining healthy, and\ninflation moving down to a 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range this year and declining further next year. Of\ncourse, if there is anything we have learned over the past two years, it is that the economy can evolve\nSee Hie Joo Ahn and Chad Fulton, “Research Data Series: Index of Common Inflation Expectations,” FEDS\nNotes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 5, 2021 (https://doi.org/10.17016/23807172.2873).\n\n2\n\n3\nThe Cleveland Fed’s measure of year-ahead indirect consumer inflation expectations is available at\nhttps://cebra.org/programs/idd/indirect-consumer-inflation-expectations/.\n\n\f8\n\ndifferently than expected and we should be ready for that.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\nAs this period of recalibration of monetary policy continues, the FOMC will need to be resolute and\nintentional in removing policy accommodation to tighten financial conditions at the pace needed to get\ninflation under control. This will take fortitude. There will be bumps along the road. Financial markets\ncould remain very volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could slow somewhat more than\nexpected for a couple of quarters; and the unemployment rate could temporarily move above estimates of\nits longer-run level. This will be painful but so is high inflation. High inflation imposes a real burden on\nhouseholds and businesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential\ngoods and services. I do not see the current situation as one involving a trade-off between our two\nmonetary policy goals. If we fail to do what is necessary to get inflation down, we will not be able to\nsustain healthy labor markets over the medium and longer run, to the detriment of the public we serve. So\nin formulating my policy views, I will remain focused and committed to using our policy tools to achieve\nour monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to explain my current views on the economy and monetary policy.\n\n\f"

            "content": "The Great Recalibration of U.S. Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nInternational Research Forum on Monetary Policy:\nMonetary Policy During and After the Pandemic\nEuropean Central Bank\nFrankfurt, Germany\n(via videoconference)\nMay 13, 2022\n\n\f1\nIt is a pleasure to participate in this policy panel at the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy\nsponsored by the Euro Area Business Cycle Network, the European Central Bank, and the Federal\nReserve Board. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last week; so in my brief prepared\nremarks, I will review the FOMC’s recent decisions and put them into context. As a reminder, the views I\npresent today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its goals of price stability and maximum employment. At the start of the pandemic in March\n2020, the FOMC reduced the target range of its policy rate, the federal funds rate, to 0 to 1/4 percent, to\nsupport the economy in the wake of the unprecedented COVID shock. The FOMC also used its balance\nsheet as a policy tool, buying large quantities of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities, to reduce the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic and to support the\neconomy. In March of this year, the FOMC raised its policy rate by 25 basis points. Last week, it raised\nthe fed funds rate by another 50 basis points and indicated that it believes ongoing rate increases will be\nappropriate. The FOMC also announced that it will begin reducing its balance-sheet assets starting in\nJune.\n\nThese actions are part of what I have called the Great Recalibration of U.S. monetary policy: a shift from\nthe extraordinarily accommodative policy needed earlier in the pandemic to a policy stance that is more\nappropriate for addressing the key challenge facing the U.S. economy: unacceptably high inflation. 1\nWhile liftoff of the funds rate from zero only occurred in March, this recalibration actually began in the\nautumn of last year. Last September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to taper asset\n\nJeff Cox, “Fed’s Mester Casts Doubt on the Need for ‘Shock’ Interest Rate Hikes Ahead,” CNBC, April 22, 2022\n(https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/22/feds-mester-casts-doubt-on-the-need-for-shock-interest-rate-hikes-ahead.html).\n\n1\n\n\f2\npurchases, and it announced the beginning of tapering in November. In December, the FOMC sped up\nthe tapering and released projections indicating that participants now expected an earlier liftoff of the\npolicy rate than they had previously anticipated. In January, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be\ntime to raise its policy rate, and then followed through with the first increase in March. Asset purchases\nalso ended in early March.\n\nThis recalibration of policy has reflected the evolution of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and\nthe risks around the outlook.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year, with real\nGDP growing at a 5-1/2 percent rate, the highest annual pace since 1984 and well above the trend growth\nrate, which I estimate to be about 2 percent. The decline in real GDP in the first quarter was driven\nmainly by declines in net exports, government spending, and a still high but lower level of inventory\ninvestment compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Growth in consumer spending and business fixed\ninvestment remained solid last quarter and there continues to be positive underlying momentum in\ndemand. Household and business balance sheets are healthy, reflecting high savings accumulated during\nthe pandemic.\n\nStrong demand has occurred in the face of very constrained supply in both product and labor markets. In\nproduct markets, differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies have resulted in a cascade\nof disruptions to the global supply chain. China’s zero-COVID policy has further disrupted supply chains\nand Russia’s dastardly invasion of Ukraine has further constrained supplies in energy, metals, and\nagricultural commodity markets.\n\nLabor markets remain very tight. The U.S. economy added 6.7 million jobs last year. Despite\nwidespread reports from firms about the difficulty of finding workers, monthly payroll gains have\n\n\f3\naveraged above 500 thousand over the first four months of this year. The unemployment rate has fallen to\n3.6 percent, nearly as low as its lowest reading during the pre-pandemic expansion. Labor force\nparticipation remains below its pre-pandemic level, but it has improved significantly over time. Still,\nlabor supply has been unable to keep up with the robust demand for labor. Job openings are at very high\nlevels by historical standards: there are almost 2 openings per every unemployed worker; in 2019, this\nratio averaged 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\nWith demand out of balance with supply in both product and labor markets, prices and wages have moved\nup. Price pressures have broadened across goods and services, and inflation readings in the U.S. are now\nat their highest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, in March, total PCE inflation was over 6-1/2\npercent, core PCE inflation was nearly 5-1/4 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation was\nalmost 4-1/4 percent. Wage pressures are also building. The employment cost index for private industry\nworkers accelerated over the three months ending in March, rising at a 5.8 percent annual pace. Higher\nwages that reflect higher productivity growth are a positive for the economy, and a higher level of wages\nrepresents a shift of income share from capital to labor. But the current pace of wage increases is\ninconsistent with maintaining price stability.\n\nThe Fed is committed to using its tools to get inflation under control by bringing excess demand into\nbetter balance with constrained supply. It will likely take some time for inflation to reach our longer-run\ngoal of 2 percent because several of the factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings\nare supply-side factors, which monetary policy cannot affect, and because inflation tends to be persistent.\nBut as we recalibrate our policy, I will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is on a\ndownward trajectory toward our 2 percent goal. We will be able to gauge improvement by looking at the\nmonthly changes in inflation readings to see if inflation is beginning to move down. The monthly\nincrease in the core PCE price index in March was little changed from its February reading, and the\nmonthly reading of the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation moved down in March. These are positive\n\n\f4\nsigns, but in April, monthly CPI inflation increased, and risks to inflation remain strongly on the upside,\nespecially in the midst of the continuing war in Ukraine and the potential that the zero-COVID policy in\nChina will further disrupt supply chains. I will need to see several months of sustained downward\nmonthly readings of inflation before I conclude that inflation has peaked.\n\nA risk-management perspective argues for such caution because inflation risks are to the upside and\nbecause the longer inflation runs above our goal, the higher the risk that long-term inflation expectations\nwill become unanchored, thereby making the return to price stability much more costly. We already see\nthat medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up. The Board staff’s measure of\ncommon inflation expectations, which summarizes a number of measures, has been rising and is at the\nupper end of the range of values seen since 2005. 2 Even though some of the rise has been driven by\nincreases in near-term expectations, I do not think it is prudent to ignore the rise given the serious harm\nthat would be caused were long-term expectations to move above levels consistent with our longer-run\ninflation goal of 2 percent. 3\n\nIn my view, the FOMC will need to be resolute and intentional in removing policy accommodation at the\npace needed to get inflation under control. High inflation imposes a real burden on households and\nbusinesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential goods and\nservices. If we fail to do what is necessary to get inflation down, we will be jeopardizing sustaining\nhealthy labor markets over the medium and longer run, again hurting lower-income households. So I do\nnot see the current situation as one involving a trade-off between our two goals.\n\nSee Hie Joo Ahn and Chad Fulton, “Research Data Series: Index of Common Inflation Expectations,” FEDS\nNotes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 5, 2021 (https://doi.org/10.17016/23807172.2873).\n\n2\n\n3\nThe Cleveland Fed’s measure of year-ahead indirect consumer inflation expectations for the week ended May 9\nwas 6.7 percent (https://cebra.org/programs/idd/indirect-consumer-inflation-expectations/).\n\n\f5\nThe current target range of the federal funds rate is 75 to 100 basis points. This is well below the range of\nestimates of the longer-run neutral nominal policy rate, which neither stimulates nor restrains economic\nactivity. For example, in the March Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, the range\nof estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate was 2 to 3 percent. The real fed funds rate is still negative.\nSo given economic conditions, ongoing increases in the fed funds rate are called for, and unless there are\nsome big surprises, I expect it to be appropriate to raise the policy rate another 50 basis points at each of\nour next two meetings.\n\nAt that point, the nominal funds rate will be nearing the lower end of estimates of the neutral rate and\nbalance-sheet reductions will be underway. The FOMC will then be well positioned to consider the\nappropriate pace at which to continue removing accommodation over the balance of the year and how far\nabove neutral rates will need to go. It will be challenging to remove accommodation at the pace needed\nto get inflation under control while sustaining healthy labor market conditions. There are likely to be\nsome bumps along the road; growth could slow a bit more than expected for a couple of quarters and the\nunemployment rate could move up temporarily. Nonetheless, the FOMC will be aiming to calibrate our\npolicy to bring demand better in line with supply, thereby putting inflation on a downward trajectory\ntoward our 2 percent goal. This calibration will entail assessing the various forces that will be affecting\nthe demand and supply sides of the economy. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in\nChina pose upside risks to inflation but downside risks to growth. Broader financial conditions have\nalready tightened considerably, as markets have anticipated further rate increases in light of the Fed’s\nforward guidance. For example, the 30-year mortgage rate was under 3 percent last September and is\nnow about 5-1/4 percent. And the Fed’s balance-sheet reduction will soon be underway. These tighter\nfinancial conditions will help moderate excess demand. With some luck, supply chain disruptions will\nbegin to abate and labor market participation will continue to rise, helping to ease supply constraints and\nallowing supply in product and labor markets to come into better balance with demand. But we cannot\nrely on luck. With both supply and demand adjusting over time, I will be monitoring economic and\n\n\f6\nfinancial developments closely to gauge the balance between demand and supply and to determine\nappropriate monetary policy. If by the September FOMC meeting, the monthly readings on inflation\nprovide compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, then the pace of rate increases could slow,\nbut if inflation has failed to moderate, then a faster pace of rate increases may be necessary.\n\nAs I mentioned, in addition to raising our policy rate, we are initiating the balance-sheet reduction in\nJune. This will be done primarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments the\nFed receives on its assets. Starting in June, the Fed will allow up to $30 billion per month of Treasury\nsecurities and up to $17.5 billion of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. After three months,\nthese caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and $35 billion per month for agency\nsecurities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury\nbills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap.\n\nThe plan that the FOMC announced last week did not rule out asset sales, and I would favor the FOMC\nconsidering asset sales after balance-sheet reduction is well underway to speed up the return of the\nportfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury securities. This would be consistent with the\nFOMC’s stated desire to minimize the effect of the Fed’s balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of\ncredit across economic sectors.\n\nThe plan also did not indicate what size the balance sheet will be when the FOMC ends the reductions,\nbut it did give some guidance. We are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating\nregime in which reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not needed. The FOMC intends to slow and then stop the\nreduction in balance-sheet assets when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is\nconsistent with ample reserves. Once runoff has stopped, reserve balances will likely continue to fall for\n\n\f7\na time, reflecting growth in other Fed liabilities, until the FOMC judges that they have reached the ample\nlevel. At that point, the FOMC will then manage its security holdings to maintain ample reserves over\ntime. The ample level of reserves is uncertain. It will depend on the banking sector’s demand for\nreserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. So as\nthe process to reduce the size of the balance sheet progresses, we will be monitoring developments in\nmoney markets to determine the appropriate level of reserves at which to end balance-sheet runoff,\nconsistent with maintaining ample reserve balances over time.\n\nThis concludes my brief remarks about the Great Recalibration of U.S. monetary policy. I look forward\nto participating in the discussion.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel remarks prepared for the session “Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\nChallenges During Balance Sheet Normalization”\n2022 Financial Markets Conference:\nA New Era of Financial Innovation and Disruption: Challenges and Opportunities\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAmelia Island, FL\nMay 10, 2022\n\n\f1\nGood afternoon. I thank Raphael Bostic for inviting me to participate in this panel focused on balancesheet normalization. I have had the opportunity to attend and participate in this conference over the past\nfew years, and it has never disappointed in bringing together interesting research and interesting policy\nviews. This year’s conference is no exception.\n\nIn my brief prepared remarks, I will describe how the FOMC intends to significantly reduce the security\nholdings on its balance sheet. The views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, in addition to the federal funds rate, the Fed has used its balance sheet as a\npolicy tool, buying large volumes of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. At\nnearly $9 trillion in assets, the Fed’s balance sheet is now about double the size it was before the\npandemic. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the severe strains in financial\nmarkets seen early in the pandemic, and throughout the pandemic, they helped to support the economy in\nthe midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. Markets are now functioning, a solid expansion is\nunderway, and inflation is far above the Fed’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. So at its May meeting last\nweek, the FOMC decided that it will begin reducing the size of its balance sheet in June. To lay the\ngroundwork and to help prepare financial markets for this announcement, the FOMC, after its January\nmeeting, released a set of guiding principles for the reduction, and the Committee gave more specifics\nabout its plans in the minutes to its March meeting. The plans announced last week are consistent with\nthe earlier communications.\n\nBalance-sheet reduction will be done in a predictable manner, primarily by adjusting the reinvestment\namounts of the principal payments the Fed receives on its assets. Starting in June, the Fed will allow up\nto $30 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion of agency securities to run off the\nbalance sheet. After three months, these caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and\n\n\f2\n$35 billion per month for agency securities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are\nless than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap.\n\nThe plan draws on our experience from October 2017 through August 2019 when the FOMC reduced the\nbalance sheet of some of the assets that had been purchased in the wake of the Great Recession. But there\nare some important differences. Last time, runoff caps were initially set at $6 billion per month for\nTreasuries and $4 billion per month for agency securities, and the phase-in was very gradual, with caps\nincreasing by $6 billion and $4 billion, respectively, every 3 months over the next 12 months, to\n$30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for agency securities. This time, the phase-in is only 3 months\nand the monthly runoff caps total $95 billion, almost twice the size as last time. Another difference is\nthat, last time, balance-sheet reduction started almost two years after liftoff of the funds rate from zero;\nthis time it is starting about 2-1/2 months after liftoff. I note, though, that even though the gap between\nliftoff and the start of balance-sheet reduction is much shorter this time, the level of the target range is not\nthat different – only 25 basis points lower this time – because the funds rate rose very slowly last time. 1\n\nThese differences reflect the fact that the economy is in a very different place now than it was then.\nWhen the Fed began reductions in October 2017, balance-sheet assets had grown to about $4.5 trillion, or\n22 percent of GDP; reserves were about $2.2 trillion, or 11 percent of GDP; the unemployment rate was\nabout 4-1/4 percent; real output growth was near 2.7 percent; and inflation was still running slightly\nbelow 2 percent. Now, balance-sheet assets are about $9 trillion, or 37 percent of GDP; reserves have\nbeen averaging about $3.8 trillion, or about 15 percent of GDP; labor markets are very tight, with the\nunemployment rate at 3.6 percent; the economy grew 5.5 percent last year; and instead of being below our\ngoal, PCE inflation is currently 6.6 percent, a 40-year high.\n\nThe target range was 1 to 1-1/4 percent when the balance-sheet reduction began in October 2017, and it is 3/4 to 1\npercent now.\n\n1\n\n\f3\nLet me finish by discussing two items that the plan announced last week did not address: asset sales and\nthe size of the balance sheet when reductions will end.\n\nThe plan did not rule out asset sales. The FOMC has not discussed sales, but the minutes of the March\nmeeting indicated that FOMC participants generally agreed that after balance-sheet reduction was well\nunderway, it would be appropriate to consider sales of agency mortgage-backed securities. An important\nbenefit of sales is that they would help to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to being\nprimarily Treasury securities, consistent with the FOMC’s stated desire to minimize the effect of the\nFed’s balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of credit across economic sectors. One potential way to\nimplement sales would be to sell agency securities up to the cap in any month in which principal\npayments were less than the cap. This is similar to our treatment of Treasuries. Another way to\nimplement sales would be to set a monthly floor on reductions, which would be met first by principal\npayments received and then by sales. A potential drawback of sales is that, depending on the interest rate\npath, they could result in realized mark-to-market losses, which would lower the Fed’s remittances to the\nTreasury. Such losses would not entail any operational challenges for the Fed in setting monetary policy.\nHowever, they would pose communication challenges that would need to be appropriately addressed so\nthat the public understands the benefits of returning the balance sheet to a more normal size and\ncomposition despite the losses.\n\nSecond, the plan did not indicate the size the balance sheet will be when the FOMC ends the reductions,\nbut it did give some guidance. We are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating\nregime in which reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not needed. The FOMC intends to slow and then stop the\ndecline in balance-sheet assets when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is consistent\nwith ample reserves. Once runoff has stopped, reserve balances will likely continue to fall for a time,\n\n\f4\nreflecting growth in other Fed liabilities, until the FOMC judges that they have reached the ample level.\nAt that point, the FOMC will then manage its security holdings to maintain ample reserves over time.\nThe ample level of reserves is uncertain. It will depend on the banking sector’s demand for reserves, as\nwell as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. During the last\nreduction episode, the FOMC ended runoff when reserve levels were about $1.5 trillion, or 7 percent of\nGDP. When stresses developed in short-term money markets in mid-September 2019, the FOMC judged\nthat the level of reserves had fallen below the level consistent with ample reserves, and in October 2019,\nthe FOMC began purchasing Treasury bills and conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement\noperations to maintain reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.\n\nThis time, as the process to reduce the size of the balance sheet progresses, we will once again be\nmonitoring developments in money markets to determine the appropriate level of reserves at which to end\nbalance-sheet runoff, consistent with maintaining ample reserve balances over time.\n\nThis was a brief summary of the FOMC’s plan for significantly reducing the Federal Reserve’s balancesheet assets. I look forward to hearing the other panelists’ remarks and participating in the discussion.\n\n\f"

            "content": "Successful Workforce Development Programs:\nFour Lessons from Four Decades of Federal Reserve Research and Outreach\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nOhio Economic Forum 2022:\nEducation and Workforce Development: The Key to Ohio’s Economic Future\nThe University of Akron\nAkron, OH\nApril 14, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is wonderful to be at the University of Akron as a participant in this year’s Ohio Economic Forum,\nwhich focuses on education and workforce development. Workforce development is a crucial ingredient\nfor achieving a healthy and dynamic economy that can work for all. When it comes to the economic wellbeing of entire regions, many studies have documented the importance of investments in education and\ntraining programs. For example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, education\nlevels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth1 and\nthat counties with higher levels of high school graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher\nlevels of labor force participation.2 Resilient regions, ones that have been able to avoid persistent declines\nin population over the longer run, tend to have a more educated population and a more diverse industry\nmix.3 Better education helps individuals, too. It is correlated with lower levels of unemployment and\nhigher wages.\n\nSince having a skilled workforce benefits people and communities, workforce development is front and\ncenter in the work that the Federal Reserve does to promote a sound economy. I suspect that many of you\nknow that the Federal Reserve’s goals in setting monetary policy are to achieve price stability and\nmaximum employment. These goals were formally given to the Fed by Congress in 1977. Currently,\nlabor markets in the U.S. are very tight and inflation is very elevated. The Fed has begun the process of\nreducing monetary policy accommodation. Our intent is to reduce accommodation at the pace necessary\nto bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in order to get inflation under control while\nsustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy labor markets. So understanding what is\nhappening in the workforce is central to understanding the state of the business cycle and setting\nappropriate monetary policy.\n\n1\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2005).\n\n2\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2006).\n\n3\n\nLin (2012).\n\n\f2\nBut understanding workforce dynamics is also important for assessing the longer-run health of the\neconomy. It is relevant to the Fed’s role in identifying effective community development policies and\npractices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. This role arose from the responsibility that Congress gave to the Fed and other federal\nbanking regulators for implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was passed in\n1977.\n\nSo understanding all aspects of the U.S. labor force, including how communities can develop and sustain\na resilient workforce, has been part of the Fed’s mission for over four decades. Today, I will discuss four\nimportant lessons we have learned about successful workforce development from four decades of Federal\nReserve research and outreach. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Origins of Community Development Work at the Fed\nFirst, let me provide a little background. As I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has a long-standing interest\nin community development. Congress passed the CRA to help address concerns about the deterioration\nin low- and moderate-income neighborhoods throughout the U.S., a deterioration that many people at the\ntime attributed at least partially to limited access to credit and illegal practices such as redlining. The\nCRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are\nchartered to do business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and\nneighborhoods, and the Fed and other federal financial supervisory agencies were charged with\nimplementing the act.4 To do so, the Fed created its Community Affairs function in 1981 to provide\n\n4\n\nSee Mester (2017) and Braunstein (2008).\n\n\f3\ntechnical training and support to depository institutions to help bolster their compliance with the CRA.5\nFrom this targeted beginning, the Federal Reserve’s work in the area of community development has\nevolved and expanded to include research and community outreach and information gathering on a\nnumber of topics, including housing, education, health, transportation, and workforce development.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System comprises 12 regional Reserve Banks that are distributed across the country\nand a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington that oversees those Banks. The U.S. is very\ndiverse, encompassing large cities, small towns, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries and\noccupations. That is true of the Cleveland Fed’s District, the Fourth District, which comprises the entire\nstate of Ohio, and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The Reserve Banks are very\nmuch organizations of their Districts, so they are well positioned to gather information and develop a\nsolid understanding of what is actually happening on the ground in their Districts. This community\nengagement via outreach and research on relevant issues allows the Fed’s decisions to take into account\nthe diversity of the American economy and its people.\n\nFour Lessons from Four Decades of the Fed’s Work on Workforce Development\nBecause having a skilled workforce is a vital component of a healthy economy, the Cleveland Fed, as\nwell as many of our fellow Reserve Banks, focuses a lot of attention on workforce development and what\ncommunities can do to enhance it. While the economy is very diverse and workforce development efforts\ndiffer by location, four decades of Fed research and outreach have yielded some common themes. In the\nrest of my remarks, I will highlight four lessons we have learned about what successful workforce\n\n5\n\nThe Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) are currently working together to strengthen and modernize the regulations that implement the\nCRA. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (September 21, 2020) and Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (July 20,\n2021).\n\n\f4\ndevelopment efforts have in common.\n\nLesson 1. Collaboration and commitment are essential for building effective programs.\nThe first lesson is that collaboration across public, private, and nonprofit entities is essential to a\nsuccessful workforce development program. Community development practitioners have long known\nthat effective workforce initiatives almost always require many different organizations to work together.\nThe Boston Fed examined small and mid-sized cities that had lost manufacturing employment and found\nthat resurgent cities, those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree of\nleadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private\ncitizens, corporations, and government.6 Importantly, the researchers also found that to have an effect on\neconomic outcomes, leadership and collaboration must be part of long-lasting campaigns. There are no\nshortcuts or easy fixes. It takes commitment.\n\nIn the last 10 years, much has been learned about the value of sector-led partnerships, often focused on\njust one or a few industries. Cleveland Fed analysts undertook case studies of five sector-based initiatives\nacross the Fourth District and found that successful programs involve employers who are substantively\nengaged. That engagement involves people at the highest levels of their organizations so that they can\nspeak on behalf of the firm; it includes providing advice on curricula and interacting with students.7 The\ncase studies also showed that commitment is needed so that the programs have a chance to become\nestablished and grow. Because, in many cases, the employers involved in the programs are competitors,\ntrust among the employers and program partners is an important driver of success. Our research also\n\n6\n7\n\nKodrzycki and Muñoz, et al. (2009).\n\nThese sectors were health care in western Pennsylvania, information technology (IT) in northeastern Ohio,\nadvanced manufacturing in central Ohio, marine mechanics in northwestern Ohio, and coal mining in eastern\nKentucky. Four of these five initiatives provide direct training to workers, while the IT initiative focuses on\nincreasing and enhancing the pipeline of IT talent through deep employer engagement with educational institutions\nat all levels. See Fee, Klesta, and Nelson (2016).\n\n\f5\nfound that having the technical skills required for a position is often not enough to gain employment.\nEmployers are also interested in hiring people who are motivated, aren’t daunted by uncertainty and can\nbe flexible, can work well in teams, can effectively communicate, and can learn new things. This\nunderscores the need for collaboration, because effective workforce development programs combine\npartners who can educate people on these types of skills with partners who can provide the necessary\ntechnical skills.\n\nLesson 2. Communication between employers, workers, and trainers is needed to ensure that programs\ntackle the right problems.\nThe second lesson that is clear from the Fed’s research and outreach is that to improve workforce\noutcomes there needs to be better communication between employers and workers about what each wants\nand needs. This avoids wasting effort and funding on programs that are misfocused. In the current labor\nmarket, almost every firm we speak to says it has been struggling to find the talent it needs. In a recent\nsurvey of more than 750 employers across an 18-county region of Northeast Ohio conducted by\nConxusNEO, Fund for Our Economic Future, and Team NEO, over three-quarters of the respondents said\nthey were struggling to find talent and finding it was their biggest challenge, and over 90 percent said\ntheir pool of qualified applicants was insufficient to meet their needs.8 Surveyed employers said they\nhave responded by raising wages and by offering more flexible schedules, hybrid work arrangements, and\nmore paid time off. But only 8 percent of firms have taken the simple step of actually asking workers\nwhat matters to them. The Fund for Our Economic Future is completing a region-wide survey and\nholding focus groups asking workers what they are looking for, as input into the fund’s support for\nstrategies that lead to better job outcomes.9\nBetter communication can also help employers avoid making assumptions that are unproductive in\n\n8\n\nIn the survey, which was conducted in December 2021 and January 2022, 78 percent of respondents said they were\nstruggling to find talent, citing recruitment as their biggest challenge, and 94 percent of respondents said that their\npool of qualified applicants was insufficient to meet their needs. See Burke (2022).\n9\n\nSee Burke (2022).\n\n\f6\nfostering better employment outcomes. The period before the pandemic hit was also one where labor\nmarket conditions were strong and our business contacts reported that they were having trouble finding\nthe qualified labor they needed. A few reported that current employees were sometimes not interested in\nbeing promoted to a new role at a higher wage. They did not have a good understanding of why this was\nthe case, since getting a job or a promotion was a path to better economic achievement. A few firms\nassumed it meant that people just did not want to work. But, of course, the reality was more complicated.\n\nWhile a job or promotion may put someone on the path to higher future income, in the short run, taking a\njob at the offered wage can actually cost someone more in terms of lost public benefits than he or she\nwould gain in wages from taking the job. While some public benefit programs phase out gradually,\nothers, including Medicaid, have strict income cutoffs for participation. This creates so-called benefits\ncliffs. These cliffs often differ across localities and with the person’s situation, in part, because benefit\nprograms interact with one another. So it is not a simple task for either workers or employers to calculate\nthe net financial effect on the worker of taking the job offered.\n\nTo help potential workers and employers better understand benefits cliffs, the Cleveland Fed is partnering\nwith the Atlanta Fed and the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services to provide an interactive tool\nin six counties in Ohio as part of the state’s Benefit Bridge pilot program.10 The Career Ladder Identifier\nand Financial Forecaster (CLIFF) dashboard, developed by the Atlanta Fed, allows people to compare\nthemselves with others in similar economic situations and locations to see how benefits change with\nincreases in income, taking into account local living expenses and state-specific eligibility rules for public\nbenefits.11 The tool allows workers to look at different career path scenarios to help them understand the\ntradeoffs they would be making in terms of lost benefits in the short run versus potentially higher income\n\n10\n11\n\nSee Nelson and Goran (2022) for further discussion.\n\nFor more information on benefits cliffs and CLIFF, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Advancing Careers\nfor Low-Income Families.\n\n\f7\nfrom wage gains in the future, and it allows employers and counselors to offer more informed career\nplanning advice to workers.\n\nCommunication between businesses and educational and training organizations is also vital so that they\ncan coordinate their efforts. With the workplace changing so rapidly, it is important that students and\nthose advising them know what skill sets employers are seeking now and in the future so they can prepare\nthemselves for joining the job market. In Pittsburgh, the Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment is working with businesses, educators, and students in elementary and high schools to raise\nawareness of the future job market so that curricula can be better matched to the skill sets that will be in\ndemand.\n\nThrough its own surveys and outreach, the Federal Reserve is helping to communicate the challenges\nfaced by lower-income families that hamper their ability to participate in the labor market and advance\neconomically. The Cleveland Fed’s biennial Policy Summit regularly has sessions on workforce\ndevelopment that bring together those with diverse perspectives.12 Our workforce development outreach\nefforts routinely include both business and labor market participants so that each can communicate their\nneeds and challenges. The Fed’s reputation for objectivity helps us play a role as both a convener and a\ncatalyst, aiming to increase everyone’s understanding of the issues affecting the workforce and to foster\neffective collaboration.\n\nLesson 3. Effective workforce development programs recognize that place matters.\nA third lesson drawn from Fed research and outreach is that place matters.13 Employers are often drawn\nto places that will attract workers. So those living in lower-quality neighborhoods in terms of schools;\n\n12\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2021).\n\n13\n\nSee Mester (2021).\n\n\f8\nhousing; access to healthcare, food, and public transportation; and natural amenities like parks and green\nspace typically have less access to good jobs, and without a good job, they have less ability to move to\nlocations that offer better employment prospects. A body of research has shown that economic\nopportunity is tied not only to individual circumstances but also to place. Upward mobility – the\nprobability that a child will be better off economically than his or her parents – is dependent not only on\nthe family’s characteristics but also on neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, the\nquality of schools, access to social services, access to transportation, and racial integration.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that regional economic development, which focuses on growth in\neconomic activity, and workforce development, which focuses on the skill sets of individuals, are linked\nand should be viewed as a common goal. As part of the Federal Reserve System’s Investing in America’s\nWorkforce initiative, the Fed held listening sessions across the country. During those sessions, we heard\nthat an important challenge to developing the workforce is the lack of critical support services, like\ntransportation, needed by those seeking training. These services are either inaccessible or underfunded,\nespecially for those people living in low- and moderate-income communities.14,15 Training is not as\nsimple as if you build it, they will come. Training needs to be connected to support that enables people to\naccess the training, and then once they complete the training, to be able to take advantage of job\nopportunities and to move along a career path. Cleveland Fed researchers have found that increasing\naccessibility to jobs by reducing commuting distance can make a significant difference in keeping people\nemployed, especially for African Americans, women, and older workers, whose jobs require them to be\non-site.16 The move to more remote working arrangements presents a great opportunity for bringing more\npeople into the workforce.\n\n14\n\nThe Federal Reserve System worked with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers\nUniversity, the Ray Marshall Center of the Lyndon B. Johnson School at the University of Texas, and the W.E.\nUpjohn Institute for Employment Research on the initiative, Investing in America’s Workforce.\n15\n\nPack and Fee (2019).\n\n16\n\nFee (2020, 2021), Pacetti (2018), and Barkley, Pacetti, and Bailey (2018).\n\n\f9\nSince the characteristics of firms, workers, and available infrastructure differ across localities, to be\nsuccessful, workforce development efforts need to be tailored to the specifics of the localities. The\nBoston Fed’s Working Places initiatives recognize this. Its Working Cities and Working Communities\nChallenges were developed based on the Boston Fed research I mentioned earlier on small and mid-sized\ncities that had lost manufacturing employment. Those cities in which leaders collaborated across sectors\nwith many local partners to form a localized and shared vision of long-term success were more successful\nat reinvigorating their economies. Informed by this research and designed in partnership with the Boston\nFed’s network of community development stakeholders, the challenges are grant competitions aimed at\nstrengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help struggling post-industrial cities and rural towns\nin an enduring way. The funding comes from philanthropic, public-sector, and private-sector partners,\nwith the Boston Fed administering the program and providing technical assistance, including\nopportunities to learn from other participants.\n\nLesson 4. Programs should be regularly and objectively evaluated based on data and informed by\nresearch.\nThis brings me to the last lesson I will discuss today: evaluation is essential. No matter how well\nintentioned, some workforce development programs will be less effective than others. And because place\nmatters, some programs that work in one region may be less effective in another. Funding is scarce, so it\nis important that initiatives be regularly evaluated, based on objective evidence and informed by research,\nto help ensure that the investment in workforce development is money well spent and that programs are\ndesigned to be effective so that they can help the most people.\n\nIt is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of a program without the data to do it. So initiatives should\ncollect complete data on the programs and outcomes by geography and by the race, ethnicity, education,\nincome, and other characteristics of the participants. And initiatives should be willing to share these data\nso that objective third parties can evaluate the programs.\n\n\f10\n\nThe Cleveland Fed and colleagues around the Federal Reserve System are creating and using data to\nsupport workforce development. For example, the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Reserve Banks’\nproject to identify “opportunity occupations,” those occupations that pay higher than the median wage but\ndo not require a bachelor’s degree, grew out of our hearing repeatedly through our outreach of the need\nfor these types of jobs.17 The Cleveland and Philadelphia Feds have created an Occupational Mobility\nExplorer tool, which helps workers, particularly those without a college degree, identify good-paying jobs\nbased on the skills they have.18 It covers 33 of the largest metropolitan areas in the country and allows an\nindividual to see what other occupations that use similar skills are available and what the pay differentials\nare across these occupations. For example, cashiers would find that customer service representatives have\nskills similar to theirs but get paid more. With this type of information, people are better equipped to\nexplore alternative career paths that could enhance their economic outcomes.19 They can also use the tool\nto determine how much better off they might be financially if they obtained training to enhance their skill\nsets given current and future employment demands.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve has been supporting workforce development efforts for more than four\ndecades by providing research and data, doing outreach to all the stakeholders with an interest in\nworkforce development, and convening these stakeholders so that they can share their perspectives on\nwhat is needed to ensure a highly skilled workforce. Through our efforts, we have learned that\ncollaboration, commitment, communication, recognition that place matters, and objective evaluation are\nall important ingredients in designing and maintaining effective workplace development initiatives that\nhelp individuals and communities prosper economically.\n\n17\n\nWardrip, et al. (2015).\n\n18\n\nThe tool is available at the Occupational Mobility Explorer web page.\n\n19\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2020) and Nelson, Fee, and Wardrip (2019).\n\n\f11\n\nIn today’s rapidly changing world, the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those\njobs are also changing. That is why many people talk about the need for life-long learning. That applies\nnot only to individuals but also to institutions. In that vein, the Cleveland Fed is committed to expanding\nits knowledge and working with all stakeholders to help support efforts to develop a highly skilled\nworkforce, an essential ingredient in maintaining a strong economy in which everyone can benefit.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nBarkley, Brett, Emily Garr Pacetti, and Layisha Bailey, “A Long Ride to Work: Job Access and the\nPotential Impact of Ride-Hailing in the Pittsburgh Area,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, September\n5, 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/a-look-behind-the-numbers/albtn20180905-a-long-ride-to-work-job-access-and-the-potential-impact)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Issues Advance Notice of\nProposed Rulemaking on an Approach to Modernize Regulations That Implement the Community\nReinvestment Act,” September 21, 2020.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200921a.htm)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Interagency Statement on Community Reinvestment Act Joint Agency\nAction,” July 20, 2021.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210720a.htm)\nBraunstein, Sandra F., “The Community Reinvestment Act,” testimony before the Committee on\nFinancial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, February 13, 2008.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/braunstein20080213a.htm)\nBurke, Bethia, “New Survey Reveals What Employers Are (or Aren’t) Doing to Mitigate Talent\nChallenges,” Fund for Our Economic Future, February 2, 2022.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nLyons Companies and the Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship,\nAlfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, University of Delaware\nNewark, DE\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Lyons Companies and the University of Delaware for inviting me to speak at today’s forum on\nthe outlook for the U.S. economy. I had the opportunity to speak at this event in 2019 and enjoyed being\non campus. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to meet in person soon.\n\nIn my remarks three years ago, I characterized 2019 as a year of transition for the economy and monetary\npolicy. At that time, economic growth was expected to transition to a more sustainable pace after abovetrend growth in 2018, and we were completing a monetary policy transition that had been underway for\nsome time: a transition away from the emergency monetary policy settings needed in the wake of the\nGreat Recession to more normal policy.\n\nToday, we are at the start of another monetary policy transition, this time away from the extraordinary\naccommodation that was necessary earlier in the pandemic. I will spend my time discussing the\neconomic rationale for the transition and the implications for monetary policy going forward. As a\nreminder, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year. Real\nGDP grew at about a 5-1/2 percent rate, the highest annual pace since 1984; firms added a record 6.7\nmillion jobs to their payrolls; and the unemployment rate moved down to about 4 percent, close to its prepandemic level. The economy’s strength reflected very robust demand by households and businesses.\nThis demand was supported by extraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy, as well as the deployment\nof vaccinations, which allowed the economy to reopen more fully. But this strong demand came at the\nsame time that there were constraints on product supply and labor supply. The imbalances between\nsupply and demand have put significant upward pressures on prices and wages. Inflation readings in the\n\n\f2\nU.S. are at their highest levels in about 40 years, and nominal wages are accelerating at a faster pace than\nwe have seen in decades.\n\nThere are risks and uncertainty around the outlook, including those engendered by the geopolitical events\nunfolding today. My modal outlook continues to be that the strong economic expansion continues this\nyear. Just as the Delta variant did last autumn, the Omicron variant has weighed on activity in highcontact services. But new case counts and hospitalizations are declining sharply, so I expect that\nhouseholds and businesses will once again prove to be resilient in the face of the virus. Once Omicron is\nbehind us, demand should rebound fairly quickly because both business and household balance sheets are\nvery healthy. But compared to last year, demand is likely to moderate this year as the support from the\npandemic stimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative. Nevertheless,\nthe economy should still expand at an above-trend pace despite facing some challenges.\n\nOne challenge is the imbalance between supply and demand I mentioned earlier. While earlier in the\npandemic, the economic effects of the virus were mainly on the demand side, now the effects are seen\nmainly on the supply side. Differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across the\nglobe have disrupted global supply chains. Firms are struggling to get necessary parts and materials\nthrough clogged ports and transportation channels. Many businesses are facing significantly higher costs\nfor available inputs. Rather than abating over last year, the disruptions continued to constrain economic\nactivity. But now, there are some hopeful signs. Anecdotal reports suggest that some of the constraints\nmay be stabilizing and delivery times appear to be improving. We routinely speak with a large number of\nbusiness and community contacts in our District, which comprises Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania,\nKentucky, and West Virginia. Manufacturers take as a hopeful sign that deliveries have become more\npredictable even though lead times remain very long, and half of our business contacts expect some\neasing of the supply disruptions in the second half of this year. Still, more than a third of our contacts do\nnot expect improvement until 2023.\n\n\f3\n\nBusinesses are also struggling to find workers. By a number of measures, labor markets are very strong\nand the demand for workers is well outstripping labor supply. While payroll employment is still nearly 3\nmillion jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic level, job gains have been very strong, averaging over\n550 thousand per month last year. Broad-based gains continued in January, despite the effects of\nOmicron, and the November and December payroll gains were revised up, suggesting continued positive\nmomentum in the labor market. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent, down nearly 2-1/2 percentage\npoints from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it was before the pandemic.\nAccording to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per unemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors, including child and elder care responsibilities and fear of the virus, have\ncontributed to the undersupply of workers. These factors should fade over time, though the precise timing\nand magnitude are open questions. Over a longer horizon, labor force participation has been trending\ndown since early 2000 due to demographics, and many more people retired during the pandemic than\npredicted solely by demographics. So labor markets are likely to remain tight for some time.\n\nIn response to labor shortages, businesses have been raising wages, offering signing and retention\nbonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and speeding up automation.\nAverage hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure on wages continues,\nalthough, in many cases, the wage increases are not keeping up with inflation.\n\nThe imbalances between demand and supply in both product and labor markets are contributing to the\nvery high inflation readings. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached almost 6 percent in\nDecember, and core PCE inflation reached almost 5 percent. Both are at their highest levels since the\nearly 1980s. The Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure and the median CPI and trimmed-mean\nCPI measures are useful indicators of the underlying inflation trend and all have moved well above 2\n\n\f4\npercent.1 As inflationary pressures rose last year, they also broadened considerably across a wider range\nof goods and services. Inflation forecasts were revised up all year. In the December 2020 Summary of\nEconomic Projections of FOMC participants, the median projection of PCE inflation for 2021 was 1.8\npercent. By the December 2021 SEP, that projection had risen to 5.3 percent.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity\nconstraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. Nonetheless, I expect inflation to remain\nabove 2 percent this year and next, and I see the risks to inflation as tilted to the upside. Geopolitical\nevents add upside risk to the inflation forecast even as they put some downside risk to the near-term\ngrowth forecast. My projection of some moderation in inflation is conditioned on the FOMC taking\nappropriate action to recalibrate monetary policy to an economy in which inflation has been running well\nabove our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid momentum in underlying\ndemand is expected to continue.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThe FOMC’s policy decisions reflect its strong commitment to achieving its dual-mandate goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. The task before the Fed is to remove accommodation at the pace\nnecessary to bring inflation under control while sustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy\nlabor markets. Monetary policy cannot alleviate the constraints on supply. But it can help to moderate\ndemand by making broader financial conditions less accommodative, thereby reducing inflationary\npressures. Doing so will help sustain the expansion in activity and healthy labor markets.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure reached 3.6 percent in December. In January, the Cleveland\nFed’s median CPI inflation measure rose to 4.2 percent, its highest level since 1991, and its trimmed-mean CPI\ninflation measure rose to 5.4 percent, its highest level since the series began in 1983. These inflation measures are\nmaintained by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research and are available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n1\n\n\f5\nThe FOMC is beginning the process of reducing accommodation. Since March 2020, the FOMC has\nmaintained the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent to support the economy. At our\nJanuary meeting, the Committee announced that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range.\nBarring an unexpected turn in the economy, I believe it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up in\nMarch and follow with further increases in the coming months. The ultimate pace at which monetary\npolicy accommodation is removed will need to be data driven and forward looking. If, by mid-year, I\nassess that inflation is not going to moderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation\nat a faster pace over the second half of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than\nexpected, then the pace of removal could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half.\nThe implications of the unfolding situation in Ukraine for the medium-run economic outlook in the U.S.\nwill also be a consideration in determining the appropriate pace at which to remove accommodation.\n\nThroughout the pandemic we have also used our balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large volumes of\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These asset purchases were an important\npolicy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and throughout the\npandemic, they have helped to support the economy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock.\nBut now, markets are functioning and a solid expansion is underway, so the FOMC has been winding\nthese purchases down. Last September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to moderate the\npace of asset purchases; in November, it began reducing the monthly pace of purchases; and in December,\nit sped up the reductions. This January, the FOMC announced that the purchases would end in March and\nreleased a set of principles it plans to follow as it significantly reduces the size of its balance sheet.\n\nAt nearly $9 trillion in assets, the Fed’s balance sheet is now about double the size it was before the\npandemic. The last time the Fed undertook a process to reduce the size of its balance sheet was after the\nGreat Recession. That process started nearly two years after liftoff of the funds rate from zero and when\nthe target range had risen to 1 to 1-1/4 percent; the reduction process went on for almost two years. This\n\n\f6\ntime, the balance sheet is much larger and inflation is much higher. So barring a material change in the\neconomy, I support our beginning to reduce the size of the balance sheet soon and to go at a faster pace\nthan we did last time. I would also support selling some of our mortgage-backed securities at some point\nduring the reduction process, something we did not do last time, in order to speed the conversion of our\nportfolio’s composition to primarily Treasury securities. Holding mainly Treasuries minimizes the effect\nof our balance-sheet assets on the allocation of credit across economic sectors, which is one of the guiding\nprinciples the FOMC released in January.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this year the FOMC will be transitioning monetary policy away from the emergency levels\nof accommodation needed earlier in the pandemic and recalibrating policy to today’s economic\nchallenges. Accommodation will be removed at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control while\nsustaining the expansion in activity and healthy labor markets. As last year clearly shows, the economy\ncan evolve differently than expected. We are not through the pandemic yet and other risks, including\nunfolding geopolitical events, could affect the U.S. economy. So I will be carefully monitoring economic\nand financial developments and assessing their implications for the outlook and the risks around the\noutlook, as the FOMC recalibrates monetary policy in pursuit of its goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNew York University Stern Center for Global Economy and Business\nNew York, NY\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the New York University Stern Center for Global Economy and Business for the opportunity to\nspeak with you this afternoon. I have fond memories of being an adjunct professor of finance at NYU in\nthe late 1990s and co-teaching the Ph.D. Seminar in Financial Institutions. So it feels good to be back in\nthe classroom, so to speak. I am looking forward to the interactive part of today’s program, but let me\nstart the session with some remarks about the economy and monetary policy. As a reminder, the views I\npresent today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThis year will be one of transition for monetary policy. We will be transitioning away from the\nextraordinarily accommodative monetary policy that was needed earlier in the pandemic and recalibrating\npolicy to today’s economic challenges. The FOMC is taking steps to begin that process. Our main policy\ntool is the federal funds rate. Since March 2020, the FOMC has maintained the target range of the fed\nfunds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent to support the economy. At our January meeting, the Committee announced\nthat it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have also used our balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large volumes of\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These asset purchases were an important\npolicy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and they have\ncontinued to support the economy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. But now, markets are\nfunctioning and a solid expansion is underway, so the FOMC has been winding down these purchases.\nLast September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to moderate the pace of asset purchases;\nin November, it began reducing the monthly pace of purchases; and in December, it sped up the\nreductions. This January, the FOMC announced that the purchases would end in March and released a set\nof principles it plans to follow as it significantly reduces the size of its balance sheet.\n\n\f2\nToday, I will frame my remarks about the monetary policy transition around three key points:\n1. There is a very compelling case for transitioning monetary policy away from the current\nemergency levels of accommodation.\n2. This monetary policy transition will differ from the last time because the economy is in a very\ndifferent place.\n3. As monetary policy transitions, communications will need to transition as well.\n\nThe Case for Transitioning Away from Emergency Levels of Monetary Policy Accommodation\nThe FOMC’s policy decisions reflect its strong commitment to achieving its dual-mandate goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, economic growth\nwas very strong last year, and the outlook is for continued solid growth this year. Last year, real GDP\ngrew at a 5.5 percent rate, its highest annual pace since 1984. The Omicron variant has weighed on\nactivity in high-contact services and has put a strain on hospitals, healthcare workers, and other essential\nservices employees. But, thankfully, Omicron is less virulent than earlier strains, and new case counts\nand hospitalizations are declining sharply in many parts of the U.S. Households and businesses are once\nagain proving to be resilient in the face of the virus.\n\nAlthough there continue to be risks and uncertainty around the outlook, when we get beyond Omicron,\ndemand should rebound quickly because the balance sheets of businesses and households are very\nhealthy. I expect some moderation in demand this year compared to last year, as the support from the\npandemic stimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative. But the\neconomy should still expand at an above-trend pace despite facing some challenges.\n\nOne challenge is the imbalance between demand and supply. The effects of the pandemic on the\neconomy have shifted over time. Early in the pandemic, when the economy shut down, the effects were\nmainly on the demand side. Now, with the economy reopened, the effects are mainly on the supply side.\n\n\f3\nDemand is strong and supply is struggling to keep up. It turns out that shutting down the economy can\nhappen pretty quickly but starting the economy back up again is slower and more complicated. And this\nhas implications for both parts of the FOMC’s dual mandate.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, and firms are still struggling to get necessary parts and\nmaterials through clogged ports and transportation channels. Many businesses are facing significantly\nhigher costs for available inputs. Rather than abating over last year, the disruptions continued to constrain\neconomic activity. Anecdotal reports suggest that some of the constraints may be stabilizing, delivery\ntimes appear to be improving, and half of our business contacts tell us that they expect some easing of the\nsupply disruptions during the second half of this year. Still, more than a third of our contacts do not\nexpect improvement until 2023.\n\nBusinesses are also struggling to get workers. By a number of measures, labor markets are very strong\nand the demand for workers is well outstripping labor supply. While payroll employment is still nearly 3\nmillion jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic level, job gains averaged over 550 thousand per\nmonth last year. The January jobs report showed continuing broad-based gains, with Omicron mainly\naffecting hours worked and absences. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent, down nearly 2-1/2\npercentage points from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it was before the\npandemic. According to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per unemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors, including child and elder care responsibilities and fear of the virus, have\ncontributed to the undersupply of workers. These factors should fade over time, but the precise timing\nand magnitude are open questions. Over a longer horizon, participation has been trending down since\nearly 2000 due to demographics, and many more people retired during the pandemic than predicted solely\nby demographics. So labor markets are likely to remain tight for some time. Businesses cite the shortage\nof labor as a very significant issue and have responded by raising wages, offering signing and retention\n\n\f4\nbonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and speeding up automation.\nAverage hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure on wages continues as\nfirms scramble to retain and attract workers.\n\nThe imbalances between demand and supply in both product and labor markets are contributing to the\nvery high inflation readings. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached 5.8 percent in December,\nand core PCE inflation reached 4.9 percent. Earlier last year, inflationary pressures were confined to a\nhandful of the most pandemic-affected categories. As the year wore on, the inflationary pressures\nbroadened considerably. In December 2020, about one-third of the components used to compute the\nCleveland Fed’s median CPI measure had inflation rates of 3 percent or more; that share has now risen to\nabout three-quarters of the components.\n\nHigh inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the\nwherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. Allowing inflation to remain at high levels can\nlead firms, households, and financial market participants to expect higher inflation over the longer term.\nSuch a rise in longer-term inflation expectations could then spill over into wage- and price-setting\ndynamics, leading to even more persistent inflation. And persistently high inflation would undermine\nsustaining a strong and inclusive expansion.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity\nconstraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. Nonetheless, I expect inflation to remain\nabove 2 percent this year and next, and I see the risks to inflation as tilted to the upside. My projection of\nsome moderation in inflation is conditioned on the FOMC taking appropriate action to transition away\nfrom the current emergency levels of accommodation and recalibrate to an economy in which inflation\nhas been running well above our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid\nmomentum in underlying demand is expected to continue.\n\n\f5\nThe Economy Is in a Different Place Than During the Last Transition\nThis brings me to my next point on what the transition will look like. The last time we began a transition\nto less accommodative monetary policy was after the Great Recession. The economy is in a very\ndifferent place now than it was then, so this transition will need to be different, too.\n\nThe recovery from the Great Recession was a slow one. While the recession officially ended in June\n2009, the FOMC held the funds rate at zero until December 2015, when it raised the rate by 25 basis\npoints. At that time, inflation was running below 1 percent, the unemployment rate was 5 percent, and\nreal GDP growth was under 2 percent. The FOMC did not raise the funds rate again until a year later.\nThereafter, the funds rate was gradually raised, with three 25-basis-point increases in 2017 and four more\nin 2018, the last one in December of that year, bringing the funds rate target range to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2\npercent.\n\nWith respect to the balance sheet, the FOMC engaged in sizable asset purchases in the wake of the Great\nRecession, increasing its asset holdings to about $4.5 trillion. The Fed did not begin reducing the size of\nits balance sheet until October 2017, nearly two years after liftoff and when the target range of the funds\nrate had risen to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. At that point, the unemployment rate was about 4-1/4 percent, real\noutput growth was near 2.7 percent, and inflation was still running slightly below 2 percent. Gradual\nreductions in assets continued until August 2019.\n\nThis time is very different. Instead of running below target, inflation has been running well above target\nfor some time and is now at a nearly 40-year high. Labor markets are tight and the economy grew at a\n5-1/2 percent pace last year. In addition, at nearly $9 trillion in assets, our balance sheet is now about\ndouble the size it was when the last reduction process began.\n\n\f6\nSo, barring a material change in the economy, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to move the funds\nrate up at a faster pace this time and to begin reducing the size of the balance sheet soon and more quickly\nthan last time. In terms of the balance sheet, I would also support selling some of our mortgage-backed\nsecurities at some point during the reduction process, something we did not do last time. Sales would\nhelp to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to primarily Treasury securities, which would\nminimize the effect of our balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of credit across economic sectors, one\nof the FOMC’s principles for reducing the size of our balance sheet.\n\nThe ultimate path policy takes will depend on the evolution of the economy, which brings me to my final\npoint which concerns monetary policy communications.\n\nMonetary Policy Communications\nAs you know, there was a substantial shift in the FOMC’s view of appropriate policy over the last year.\nIn last March’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median path of FOMC participants\nindicated that no change in the policy rate would be appropriate in 2022. By the December SEP, the\nmedian appropriate policy path showed the federal funds rate moving up by 75 basis points this year.\nThis change in projections reflected economic and financial developments and the resulting evolution of\nthe FOMC’s economic outlook and the risks around the outlook. For example, last March, the SEP’s\nmedian projections for unemployment and inflation for 2021 were 4.5 percent and 2.4 percent,\nrespectively, and the majority of participants saw the risks to each as broadly balanced. Instead, by the\nfourth quarter of 2021, the unemployment rate had actually fallen to 4.2 percent and year-over-year\ninflation had risen to 5.5 percent. And as indicated in the December SEP, the majority of participants\nnow saw the inflation risks as weighted to the upside. These economic developments informed the\nchange in the FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate policy.\n\n\f7\nAs the FOMC begins the process of reducing accommodation, its communications will need to transition\nas well. Earlier in the pandemic, in addition to the extraordinarily accommodative settings of our policy\nrate and asset purchases, we also provided fairly explicit forward guidance about our future policy\nsettings. In extraordinary economic times, forward guidance is more than a communications device. It is\nalso a monetary policy tool that has the potential to increase the degree of monetary policy\naccommodation, especially when interest rates are essentially at their zero lower bound. By reducing\nuncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance can help lower interest rates by reducing the\npremiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty. In addition, at least in\ntheory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be low for a long\ntime – perhaps lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central bank’s past\nbehavior – this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby spurring current\neconomic activity.\n\nBut now, instead of wanting to increase accommodation, the FOMC will be reducing it, so policy\ncommunications need to transition away from providing explicit forward guidance. Instead, we will need\nto convey the overall trajectory of policy and give the rationale for our policy decisions based on our\nassessment of the outlook and risks around the outlook, which are informed by economic and financial\ndevelopments. This change in communications will provide a better sense of the FOMC’s policy reaction\nfunction and should not be interpreted as the FOMC backing away from transparency. Clear\ncommunications are a very important part of monetary policymaking. First, to the extent that households,\nbusinesses, and financial market participants understand how policymakers are likely to react to economic\nand financial developments – whether the developments are anticipated or unanticipated – their policy\nexpectations will better align with those of policymakers. This means their decisions will be better\ninformed and monetary policy will be more effective. Second, policy transitions are often met with\nvolatility in financial markets, and this time is no exception. By keeping financial market participants’\n\n\f8\nexpectations aligned with those of policymakers, clear communications can mitigate the volatility that\nwould occur if there were a rapid or sizable realignment.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, I believe the case for transitioning monetary policy away from emergency levels of\naccommodation and recalibrating policy to today’s economic challenges in pursuit of our dual-mandate\ngoals is very compelling. While the experience after the Great Recession will inform this transition, the\neconomy is in a very different place, so the transition will be different, too. As monetary policy\ntransitions, our policy communications will also need to transition away from explicit forward guidance\nand toward conveying a sense of our policy trajectory and explaining the rationale for our policy\ndecisions in terms of economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and\nrisks around the outlook.\n\nThe task before the Fed is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary to bring inflation under\ncontrol while sustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy labor markets. Barring an\nunexpected turn in the economy, I believe it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up in March and\nfollow with further increases in the coming months. If by mid-year, I assess that inflation is not going to\nmoderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation at a faster pace over the second\nhalf of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than expected, then the pace of\nremoval could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half. So, the pace at which\nmonetary policy accommodation is removed will need to be data driven and forward looking. The\ncommunications challenge will be to convey a good sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional\non how the economy evolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular path\nregardless of how the economy evolves.\n\n\f"

            "content": "Rebalancing the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe European Economics and Financial Centre\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\nLondon, U.K.\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a real pleasure to join you again in the European Economics and Financial Centre’s Distinguished\nSpeakers Seminar series. I do hope we will be able to meet together in London sometime soon. But\nregardless of whether it is held in-person or virtually, I always enjoy this speaking opportunity because\nyour questions present interesting perspectives, which I contemplate long after the session is over. So I\nwill try to keep my prepared remarks on the U.S. economy and what’s ahead for monetary policy\nrelatively brief. As a reminder, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Activity\nIn an outlook talk at the beginning of the year, it is usually very safe to say that last year was an\ninteresting one and this year is shaping up to be an interesting one as well. That sentiment definitely fits\nour current situation. When we met early last year, I said that I thought the prospects were good for a\nmuch more favorable U.S. economy in 2021 than we had in 2020. That prediction came to pass, but the\nimprovements in the economy obscure the many challenges households, businesses, and policymakers\nfaced because of the ongoing pandemic. Indeed, economic developments continue to reflect the influence\nof the virus, as well as the extraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy put in place in response to the\npandemic.\n\nDespite the challenges, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year. Real GDP grew at a 5.5 percent\npace, the highest annual pace since 1984. Firms added a record 6.7 million jobs to their payrolls and the\nunemployment rate moved down to about 4 percent, close to its pre-pandemic level. The economy’s\nstrength reflected very robust demand by households and businesses. This demand was supported by\nextraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy, as well as the deployment of vaccinations, which allowed\nthe economy to reopen more fully. But this strong demand came at the same time there were constraints\non product supply and labor supply. The imbalances between supply and demand have put significant\n\n\f2\nupward pressures on prices and wages. Inflation readings in the U.S. are at their highest levels in nearly\n40 years, and nominal wages are accelerating at a faster pace than we have seen in decades.\n\nAlthough there continue to be risks and uncertainty around the outlook, I expect the strong economic\nexpansion to continue this year. Just as the Delta variant did last autumn, the Omicron variant is\nweighing on activity in high-contact services such as travel, dining, and leisure and hospitality. This\nvariant has put a strain on hospitals, healthcare workers, and other essential services employees. Because\nOmicron is so transmissible, it has exacerbated the labor shortages many businesses have been facing, and\nin response, many have had to reduce their operating hours. Thankfully, Omicron is less virulent than\nearlier strains, and new case counts and hospitalizations are declining sharply in many parts of the U.S.\nSince the start of the pandemic, as vaccination rates have risen and households and businesses have\nlearned to navigate the virus, each new wave of the virus has had less of an economic impact. My\nexpectation is that the immediate economic effects of the Omicron wave will be relatively small and\nshort-lived, and that households and businesses will once again prove to be resilient in the face of the\nvirus.\n\nWhen we get beyond Omicron, demand should rebound quickly. Business balance sheets are healthy.\nMany consumers have the wherewithal to continue to spend because household balance sheets are also\nvery healthy, bolstered by accumulated savings, higher earnings, and rising net worth. I expect growth to\nbe above trend this year, but to moderate from last year’s robust pace, as the support from the pandemic\nstimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative.\n\nSince the economy reopened, supply has struggled to keep up with demand. While shutting the economy\ndown at the start of the pandemic happened very quickly, starting the economy back up again has proved\nto be slower and more complicated. Differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across\nthe globe have disrupted global supply chains. Firms have struggled to get necessary parts and materials\n\n\f3\nthrough clogged ports and transportation channels and are facing significantly higher costs for available\ninputs. As last year wore on, rather than abating, the disruptions continued to constrain economic\nactivity. A recent sign of improvement comes from manufacturers in our Federal Reserve District, who\nreport that while lead times remain long, deliveries have become more predictable. Nonetheless, while\nhalf of our business contacts expect some easing of the supply disruptions during the second half of this\nyear, more than a third do not expect improvement until 2023.\n\nLabor Market Conditions\nBy a number of measures, labor markets are very strong and the demand for workers is well outstripping\nlabor supply. Payroll employment is still nearly 3 million jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic\nlevel, but job gains averaged over 550 thousand per month last year. Despite the effects of Omicron, the\nJanuary jobs report showed continuing broad-based gains. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent,\ndown nearly 2-1/2 percentage points from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it\nwas before the pandemic. According to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per\nunemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors have contributed to the undersupply of workers. Some people, especially\nwomen, left the workforce during the pandemic because of child or elder care responsibilities. Some may\nbe waiting until virus conditions improve before reentering the workforce. Others likely took the\nopportunity that their accumulated savings gave them to retrain for better jobs. These pandemic-related\nfactors that are holding back labor supply should fade over time, but when and by how much are open\nquestions. Over a longer horizon, participation has been trending down since early 2000 due to\ndemographics. In addition, during the pandemic, many more people retired than predicted solely by\ndemographic factors, and in previous business cycles, retirees have not tended to return to the workforce.\nThis means that it will likely take some time before labor demand and labor supply come into balance.\n\n\f4\nBusinesses cite the shortage of labor as a very significant issue and have responded by raising wages,\noffering signing and retention bonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and\nspeeding up automation. Average hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure\non wages continues as firms scramble to retain and attract workers. Seventy percent of our business\ncontacts reported increasing wages in the past month, and the share raising their wages has been 60\npercent or higher since last July.\n\nInflation\nCurrently, the imbalances between demand and supply in product and labor markets are contributing to\nthe very high inflation readings. Firms tell us that they are having little trouble passing on their higher\ncosts to their customers. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached 5.8 percent in December, and\ncore PCE inflation reached 4.9 percent. Both are at their highest levels since the early 1980s. The\nCleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation, median CPI, and trimmed-mean CPI are useful measures of the\nunderlying inflation trend and all have moved well above 2 percent. 1\n\nInflation levels began moving up last year as the economy reopened. At first, inflationary pressures were\nconfined to a handful of the most pandemic-affected categories, like lumber and durable goods. But as\nthe year wore on, the inflationary pressures broadened considerably. In December 2020, one-third of the\ncomponents used to compute the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure had inflation rates of 3 percent or\nmore; that share has now risen to three-quarters of the components.\n\nAt the end of 2020, many forecasters, including those at the Fed, thought that as the economy reopened\nmore fully in 2021, inflation rates would move up but remain slightly below our 2 percent target for the\nyear. As supply constraints pushed inflation rates above 2 percent early in 2021, most forecasters\n\nThese measures are maintained by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research and are available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n\n1\n\n\f5\nexpected inflation to move back down as constraints eased. But the supply constraints have persisted,\ndemand has been very strong, and inflation has continued to rise. As a result, inflation forecasts had to be\nrevised up over the year.\n\nYou can see this in our own FOMC projections. As its name suggests, the FOMC’s Summary of\nEconomic Projections – or SEP – gives a summary of the economic projections submitted by each FOMC\nparticipant. In the December 2020 SEP, the median projection of what PCE inflation would be in 2021\nwas 1.8 percent. By the December 2021 SEP, that projection had risen to 5.3 percent. In my view, even\nwith the upward revisions, the risks to inflation are still tilted to the upside.\n\nHigh inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the\nwherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. The nominal wage increases over the past year\nhave benefited many families, but for many of them, the increases have not kept up with inflation.\nAllowing inflation to remain at high levels can lead firms, households, and financial market participants\nto expect higher inflation over the longer term. A rise in longer-term inflation expectations could then\nspill over into wage- and price-setting dynamics, leading to even more persistent inflation. And\npersistently high inflation would undermine sustaining a strong and inclusive expansion.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity\nconstraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. But the timing and magnitude of that easing\nof constraints remain uncertain. My expectation is that inflation will moderate but remain above 2\npercent this year and next, but this forecast is conditional on the FOMC taking appropriate action.\n\nMonetary Policy\nJust as demand and supply need rebalancing, so does monetary policy. Inflation has been running well\nabove our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid momentum in underlying\n\n\f6\ndemand is expected to continue. So the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy that was needed\nearlier in the pandemic is no longer appropriate. Moreover, as inflation rates have risen, real interest rates\nhave moved down, meaning financial conditions have become even more accommodative, further raising\ndemand amid constrained supply. While monetary policy cannot alleviate the constraints on supply, it\ncan help to moderate demand by making broader financial conditions less accommodative, thereby\nreducing inflationary pressures.\n\nThe FOMC is now taking steps toward beginning the process of reducing accommodation. In November,\nthe FOMC started reducing the monthly pace at which it had been purchasing Treasury securities and\nagency mortgage-backed securities; in December, it sped up the reductions; and in January, it announced\nthat the purchases would end in March. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the\nsevere strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and they have continued to support the\neconomy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. But now, markets are functioning and a solid\nexpansion is underway, so these purchases are no longer needed.\n\nThe Fed’s main policy tool is the federal funds rate. Since March 2020, the FOMC has maintained the\ntarget range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. This January, the Committee announced that it will\nsoon be appropriate to raise the target range. While the Omicron variant may weigh on activity in the\nnear term, the high levels of inflation and the tightness in labor markets make a compelling case to begin\nrecalibrating the stance of monetary policy. Barring an unexpected turn in the economy, I support\nbeginning to remove accommodation by moving the funds rate up in March.\n\nWhat about the future course of monetary policy? It is clear that removing the extraordinary monetary\npolicy accommodation is needed to help rebalance the economy. The last time we began such a process\nwas in December 2015, and it was a very gradual process, with the target range of the fed funds rate\nreaching 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in December 2018. This time, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to\n\n\f7\nmove the funds rate up at a faster pace because inflation is considerably higher and labor markets are\nmuch tighter than in 2015. In my view, increases in the fed funds rate in the coming months will be\nneeded, but the ultimate path of the fed funds rate in terms of the number and pace of increases will\ndepend on how the economy evolves. For example, if by mid-year, I assess that inflation is not going to\nmoderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation at a faster pace over the second\nhalf of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than expected, then the pace of\nremoval could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half.\n\nIn terms of our balance sheet, we currently hold nearly $9 trillion in assets, which is about 36 percent of\nnominal GDP. This is double the asset holdings at the start of the pandemic. In January, the FOMC\nreleased a set of principles to guide the planned significant reduction in the size of our balance sheet.\nThese principles affirm that the federal funds rate is our main tool for adjusting monetary policy, that\nreductions in the balance sheet will commence after the process of increasing the policy rate has begun,\nand that we intend to reduce our security holdings in a predictable way over time. The principles also\nreaffirm that in the longer run, the FOMC will hold primarily Treasury securities in its portfolio to\nminimize the effect of the Fed’s holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.\nToday, as a result of our purchases, about a third of our portfolio, over $2.5 trillion, comprises agency\nsecurities. While our principles state that we will reduce balance-sheet assets primarily by adjusting the\nreinvestment amounts of the principal payments we receive on our assets, I would support selling some of\nour mortgage-backed securities at some point during the reduction period to speed the conversion of our\nportfolio’s composition to primarily Treasuries.\n\nThe FOMC has begun to discuss the plan to implement balance-sheet reduction in accordance with the\nguiding principles. We have the benefit of having done this once before. In the wake of the Great\nRecession, the FOMC engaged in sizable asset purchases, increasing its asset holdings to about $4.5\ntrillion, or about 25 percent of nominal GDP at its peak. In October 2017, nearly two years after liftoff of\n\n\f8\nthe fed funds rate from zero and with the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent, the FOMC began shrinking its\nbalance sheet at a gradual pace. The reductions lasted until August 2019. While this experience will\ninform our plans, this time, things are different. First, the balance sheet is about double the size it was\nthen, and even in our ample-reserves operating regime, it is considerably larger than the size needed to\nimplement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Second, inflation is much higher and labor\nmarkets are much tighter than they were then. So in my view, conditions warrant that we start balancesheet reductions soon and go at a faster pace than we did last time.\n\nWhen to stop the reductions will depend on the banking sector’s demand for reserves, as well as the\ndistribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. As the process to reduce the\nsize of the balance sheet progresses, we will be monitoring developments in money markets to determine\nthe appropriate levels of reserves and balance-sheet size at which to stop the reductions. We will remain\nprepared to adjust the plan in light of economic and financial developments, if necessary.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, in setting monetary policy, the Fed is committed to achieving both parts of its dual mandate:\nprice stability and maximum employment. While the current extraordinarily accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy was needed to support the economy earlier in the pandemic, that stance is no longer\nappropriate. Strong demand in both product and labor markets is outpacing constrained supply, and\ninflation is at its highest level in nearly 40 years. Inflation well above our goal undermines sustaining a\nstrong and inclusive expansion. So the task before us is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary\nto bring inflation under control. Doing so will help sustain the expansion in activity and healthy labor\nmarkets.\n\nThe process of transitioning to a less accommodative monetary policy stance in the U.S. is beginning. As\nthis process continues, our monetary policy decisions will need to be data driven and forward looking.\n\n\f9\nEconomic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the\noutlook will inform the pace at which we remove accommodation in pursuit of our goals.\n\nWhile their actions are not coordinated, other central banks, including the Bank of England, have also\nbegun to move to a less accommodative monetary policy stance as economic conditions have improved\nand inflation has risen. Policy transitions are often met with some volatility in financial markets, and this\ntime is no exception. Clear communications can help keep the public’s policy expectations aligned with\nthose of policymakers during the policy transitions underway. Despite the challenges and risks, my\nexpectations are that these transitions will be successful, inflation will come under control, and the\neconomic expansion will be sustained.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nFourth Annual Managing Cyber Risk from the C-Suite Conference\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve System’s Large and Foreign Banking Organizations\nManagement Group\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCleveland, OH\n(via videoconference)\nOctober 5, 2021\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you to this year’s conference on Managing Cyber Risk from the C-Suite. This\nis the fourth annual conference in this series, and each year the discussions have both broadened and\ndeepened our understanding of the cyber risks faced by the financial system. It is hard to get through a\nweek without hearing about a new cybersecurity event that has affected an organization and its customers.\nThese events impose costs and affect operations at institutions of all sizes. Efforts to disrupt an\ninstitution’s operations; to steal, corrupt, or destroy data and intellectual property; or to divert funds have\nbecome more prevalent. According to Boston Consulting Group, financial services firms are 300 times as\nlikely as other types of companies to be targeted by a cyber attack.1 Just as the financial system is\nconstantly evolving, so, too, are the cybersecurity risks that institutions need to assess and manage.\nGiven the vital role that financial services firms play in supporting a strong global economy – a role\nclearly demonstrated throughout the pandemic – it behooves us all to continually expand our knowledge\nof the risks we face and the best way to combat them.\n\nCybersecurity and Financial Stability\nGiven the Federal Reserve System’s role in fostering a strong economy and a stable financial system,\ncybersecurity is a high priority for us. To put it succinctly, there is no financial stability without\ncybersecurity. Indeed, at a recent European Central Bank Forum, Fed Chair Jay Powell said that a\nsuccessful cyber attack on a large financial institution or financial market utility is one of the top risks to\nfinancial stability.2 And surveys indicate that this view is widely shared by the industry and other\n\n1\n\nSee Anna Zakrzewski, Tjun Tang, Galina Appell, Andrew Hardie, Nicole Hildebrandt, Michael Kahlich, Martin\nMende, Federico Muxí, and André Xavier, “Global Wealth 2019: Reigniting Radical Growth,” Boston Consulting\nGroup, May 2019, p. 22. (https://image-src.bcg.com/Images/BCG-Reigniting-Radical-Growth-June-2019_tcm9222638.pdf)\n2\n\nEuropean Central Bank Forum on Central Banking 2021, policy panel with Andrew Bailey, Haruhiko Kuroda,\nChristine Lagarde, and Jerome H. Powell, moderated by Alessandra Galloni of Reuters, September 29, 2021.\n\n\f2\nfinancial regulators across the globe.3 While much progress has been made in addressing more typical\nbanking risks, including credit, liquidity, and operational risks, risks to cybersecurity are expanding, very\ndynamic, and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber attacks have become more systematic,\nmaliciously targeting financial firms and playing out over time for maximum effect.\n\nCyber threats pose some unique hazards to financial stability. Because of the complex interconnections\nand dependencies among financial firms, cyber threats are more likely to be correlated across institutions\nand to have wider-spread negative effects than a typical operational problem. An attack that compromises\nan institution’s system or data can impair its ability to service creditors not directly affected by the attack.\nIn addition, an attack on a trading platform, a settlement and payments system, or a central securities\ndepository could have a major impact on the financial system as a whole because these are critical\ninfrastructures on which financial firms depend and for which there are few substitutes. The advent of\nnew technologies like cloud computing creates another concentrated risk, as there are only a handful of\nthird-party providers of these services. Cyber risk can also be amplified by coordination failure.\nDecision-making tends to be decentralized across financial institutions and across global financial\nregulatory agencies; so without prior engagement, guidance, and proper communication channels, a small\nattack can be propagated across the system.\n\nA recent Federal Reserve study analyzed the potential impact of a hypothetical cyber attack on the five\nlargest participants in the U.S. wholesale, large-value payments network, called Fedwire. Because these\nlarge players account for close to 40 percent of total payments on the system, an attack on these\ninstitutions would have spillover effects on others, with an average spillover impact on about 38 percent\nof banking system assets, excluding the attacked institutions. Because of the nature of Fedwire, the\ninstitutions under attack would be able to receive funds but not send them out, and in the simulation, the\nSee Thomas M. Eisenbach, Anna Kovner, and Michael Junho Lee, “Cyber Risk and the U.S. Financial System: A\nPre-Mortem Analysis,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, No. 909, January 2020, revised May\n2021. (https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr909.pdf)\n3\n\n\f3\naverage liquidity shortfall in the financial system would grow from $122 billion on the first day of the\nattack to $1 trillion by the fifth day.\n\nAs much as individual firms are investing in cybersecurity – and it is a lot – as a nation and globally, we\nare likely underinvesting. This is because cybersecurity is a public good: the overall financial system\nconveys benefits to us all. Individual institutions certainly have incentives to invest in their own\ncybersecurity, and banks have been making major investments to monitor and protect their systems\nagainst attack. But the social benefit conveyed by a well-functioning and resilient financial system, one\nin which the public can continue to have a lot of confidence, likely requires a higher level of investment\nin cybersecurity than what individual firms would decide to do on their own, as they consider the tradeoff\nbetween the risk of loss to their firm from a cyber attack versus the cost of that investment. In addition, to\nthe extent that individual firms are relying on shared services, in considering how much to invest in their\nown cybersecurity, they should be entertaining the possibility that those shared services could be heavily\ntaxed in the event other firms are attacked at the same time they are 4 or that the shared service itself could\nbe the entry point for a system-wide attack. These types of externalities may not be part of any one firm’s\ninvestment decision. Moreover, an individual firm may rely on others in the shared network to make\ninvestments that make the network more secure, but if every firm thinks this way, there will be\nunderinvestment in security.5\n\nCybersecurity and the Federal Reserve System\n\nSee Anil K. Kashyap and Anne Wetherilt, “Some Principles for Regulating Cyber Risk,” American Economic\nReview Papers and Proceedings, 109, May 2019, pp. 482-487. (https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20191058)\n4\n\nSee Tim Sablik, “Cyberattacks and the Digital Dilemma,” Econ Focus, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Third\nQuarter 2017.

We are making sure we are doing the same\nwith our own payments systems. Because attacks continue to grow in sophistication, even the best cyber\ncontrols will not be able to stop all determined attackers; so ensuring operational resiliency is critical. An\ninstitution’s being prepared for and having the ability to withstand and effectively recover from an attack\nare becoming increasingly important. From a systemic resiliency perspective, banks’ timely notification\nto their supervisory authorities when an incident occurs can be a big help. As the Fed improves the\nefficiency and speed of services like Fedwire, and as we develop the FedNowSM instant payments system,\ntimely reporting is becoming even more important, since it will allow us to coordinate a systemic\nresponse that minimizes service disruptions in the event multiple firms are simultaneously attacked.\n\nIn order to promote financial system resiliency, the Fed has taken steps to ensure that our supervision of\nbanks’ cyber security posture is effective. We have been developing clear and consistent standards for\nassessing financial institutions’ preparedness; establishing corporate governance best practices with\nrespect to cybersecurity; hiring staff with the necessary technical skills to assess risk-management\npractices; and encouraging and creating avenues for information sharing among financial institutions and\nregulators.\n\nThe Fed has increased coordination with the other federal banking agencies in assessing cybersecurity at\nthe nation’s largest, most complex firms. We are coordinating our annual reviews of these institutions,\ntargeting key areas of supervisory interest, including cyber risk-management practices and the resiliency\nand recovery of critical services. This coordination has the added benefit of reducing the regulatory\nburden for institutions subject to oversight from multiple regulators while making that oversight more\neffective. We have also raised our expectations of cyber resilience preparedness for all of the institutions\nwe supervise, including regional and community banks.\n\n\f5\n\nThe Fed is also focused on enhancing our own cybersecurity. The Fed is a provider of both wholesale\nand retail financial services to the public and the U.S. government. We need to maintain the public’s trust\nand confidence in our ability to deliver those services. The Fed has remained secure from ever-growing\ncybersecurity threats. But we do not take that for granted. We are continuously working to enhance the\ncyber security and resiliency of our own systems, applications, and data, to ensure that we can detect and\nprevent an attack on our systems, and if one were to occur, making sure we can minimize the time it takes\nto contain it and limit the business impact on our customers. We regularly obtain cyber intelligence on\nhow actors may attempt to attack critical Federal Reserve payments systems, we regularly test our\ncontrols to determine their capabilities in preventing these attacks from being successful, and we are\ncontinuously improving and testing our preparedness against a potential ransomware attack, which is a\ntop threat for organizations, including the Fed. The Cleveland Fed provides critical payments services to\nthe U.S. Treasury, including operating several systems to collect funds for federal government agencies.\nOur staff is constantly monitoring cybersecurity threats and potential fraudulent transactions on our\nsystems.\n\nCybersecurity and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Cleveland Fed is taking a leading role in the Federal Reserve System’s cybersecurity efforts more\nbroadly. The System’s Cybersecurity Analytics Support Team, known as CAST, is based at the\nCleveland Fed. This team monitors and analyzes threats faced by institutions supervised by the Federal\nReserve. The Cleveland Fed recently collaborated with the Ohio Department of Commerce’s Division of\nFinancial Institutions’ Technology Advisory Group to develop and perform a tabletop ransomware cyber\nattack exercise to help banks improve their preparedness. The exercise used the latest intelligence from\nCAST on how ransomware can rapidly compromise an entire network of computers and how attackers\nattempt to extort payments from firms in exchange for decryption keys and promises to not release stolen\ncustomer information.\n\n\f6\n\nWe regularly share information and cyber security insights with the management teams of our District’s\nlarge banks. This information sharing has been especially important during the pandemic. The Cleveland\nFed was able to identify and alert firms to new cyber risks that were rapidly arising as banks were\ntransitioning to remote work. Later today, Chad Siegrist, who heads CAST, will share the latest\ninformation on ransomware, phishing attacks, account hijacking, and other methods of cyber attacks\ntargeted at banking organizations.\n\nAdvancing cybersecurity supervision is one of the strategic goals of the Cleveland Fed’s supervision\nfunction. The Cleveland Fed participates in the Federal Reserve System’s annual national horizontal review of\ncybersecurity for banks with assets between $100 billion and $500 billion. Fed examiners assess a bank’s\ncybersecurity along a number of dimensions. Effective cybersecurity requires sound cyber-risk governance,\nincluding leadership’s engagement in oversight of the firm’s cybersecurity programs. The bank needs to have\neffective programs for identifying and managing risks and vulnerabilities, including those within its own technology\ninfrastructure, those associated with vendors and third-party technology providers, and those posed by new products.\nThe bank is assessed on its processes for incident response and its plans for timely recovery and restoration of\ncritical functions, as well as on the basics, such as adequate technology inventories, data security, access\nmanagement, and timely software patching. Our next speaker, Jennifer Burns, who is the deputy director of\nsupervision and regulation for the Federal Reserve System, will share more information about the Fed’s cyber\nexamination program.\n\nConclusion\nI hope my brief remarks have made it clear why the Federal Reserve is so focused on cyber resiliency and\nwhat we at the Cleveland Fed are doing to advance both the industry’s and the Fed’s own resiliency\nagainst cyber incidents. The dynamic nature of the cyber landscape, with rapid technological change and\never-evolving risks that are becoming more sophisticated and complex, can make it seem like we are\nalways running to catch up. This can be discouraging. But if one looks back over the previous years of\n\n\f7\nthis conference, it is clear that much progress has been made in better understanding cyber threats and\nhow, by working together, we can best handle those threats. My expectation is that perseverance and\ncollaboration will continue to yield benefits in making our financial system ever more resilient. And this\nresiliency is critical, given the importance of the financial system to our economic health.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nOhio Bankers League\n2021 CEO Symposium\nColumbus, OH\n(via videoconference)\nSeptember 24, 2021\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Ohio Bankers League for the opportunity to speak at this year’s CEO Symposium. Your\ntheme, “Bouncing Back,” seems to sum things up very well, so I could probably end my talk right here.\nBut it is probably better if I take a few moments to discuss my views on the shape of the bounce-back and\nthe implications for monetary policy. Of course, these views will be my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWhen we talk about the economy, it is important to remember that it is made up of households,\nbusinesses, including banks, and communities throughout the U.S. All have soldiered on through these\nextraordinarily difficult and unprecedented times. Ohio bankers have played a very important role in\nsupporting families and businesses throughout the pandemic. You have provided valuable credit, riskmanagement, and liquidity services. Your significant contributions helped to shorten the recession and\nthey continue to sustain the recovery.\n\nIn addition, throughout the pandemic, bankers have been providing me with valuable insights that have\nhelped me in my role as a Federal Reserve policymaker. The Fed collects and analyzes many different\nstatistics and uses many models to assess the economy, but hearing from the bankers on our boards and\nadvisory councils, and bankers throughout the Fourth Federal Reserve District, helped us understand what\nwas really happening on the ground and what might be coming. Timely information like this is always\nvaluable when setting monetary policy, but over the past 18 months, it has been critical in helping us\nnavigate the uncharted waters of the pandemic. I particularly want to recognize and thank the chair of\nyour board, Tom Fraser, who serves on the Cleveland Fed’s Community Depository Institutions Advisory\nCouncil; OBL director Eddie Steiner, who is currently a Cleveland Fed board member; and OBL director\nTodd Mason, who is a former Cleveland Fed director. The public service provided by you and the other\n\n\f2\nbankers throughout our District is greatly appreciated and will continue to be important given the elevated\nrisks and uncertainty that will be with us for some time to come.\n\nEconomic Growth\nBefore I discuss current conditions and the outlook, its useful to remember where we have been. Before\nthe pandemic hit last March, the U.S. economy had been on very solid ground. The unemployment rate\nwas at a historically low level, employment growth was strong, participation in the labor force was solid,\nand inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. All that changed when almost the entire\neconomy had to shut down quickly because of the public health crisis created by the pandemic. The\neconomy fell into the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Real growth fell at an annual rate of\nover 30 percent in the second quarter of last year. In just two months, March and April 2020, the\neconomy lost over 22 million jobs, about the same number it had added over the previous 11-year\nexpansion. The unemployment rate rose from a pre-pandemic 3-1/2 percent to nearly 15 percent and\ninflation fell to under 1/2 percent.\n\nBut with the remarkable contributions of healthcare workers, the agility and resiliency of households and\nbusinesses, and with strong support from fiscal and monetary policy, the economy was able to reopen and\nlast year’s recession was the shortest one on record.\n\nA strong economic recovery is underway, but it has been an uneven one and challenges and risks remain.\nAs the rapid spread of the Delta variant reminds us, we have to remain humble when it comes to\npredicting the future. Unlike in typical business cycles, virus developments and public health\nconsiderations have been critical factors determining the pace and nature of the recovery, and they will\ncontinue to do so for the foreseeable future. The initial reopening of the economy last year unleashed\npent-up demand and resulted in real output growth rebounding to over 30 percent in the third quarter of\nlast year and firms adding back almost half of the jobs lost during the shutdown, or almost 11 million\n\n\f3\njobs, over May through August 2020. But as virus cases rose last fall and winter, growth moderated and\nconsumers pulled back on their spending.\n\nAnd then things improved again over the first half of this year. Supported by sizable fiscal stimulus,\ngrowth returned to a robust pace of about 6.5 percent as new cases declined and the relatively rapid\ndeployment of vaccinations throughout much of the country gave households and businesses more\nconfidence that it was safe to re-engage in activity.\n\nIn recent months, the Delta variant has led to a sharp increase in new cases, particularly among the\nunvaccinated. Hospitalizations and deaths have not risen to the levels seen earlier in the pandemic\nbecause of the efficacy of the vaccines, but these developments have dampened consumer sentiment and\nhave led to a downturn in some activities that require close physical contact. So far, the adverse effects\non consumer demand appear to be smaller than those seen in earlier waves of the virus. It appears that as\nvaccination rates have risen, households and businesses have learned to better navigate changes in virus\nconditions. I expect that the monthly indicators and pace of activity will continue to ebb and flow with\nvirus developments. The Delta variant will temper consumer spending and growth over the second half\nof the year, compared to the first half, but I don’t expect it to lead to widespread shutdowns of economic\nactivity or to derail the recovery. Nonetheless, continued increases in vaccination rates and the\ndeployment of safe and effective vaccines to children would contribute significantly to lowering risks and\nbroadening the recovery.\n\nThe pandemic has not only affected the demand side of the economy; it is having significant effects on\nthe supply side, too. Across a number of sectors, demand is strong, but supply-chain disruptions and\nbottlenecks are constraining activity. These constraints are now expected to last well into next year,\nconsiderably longer than originally thought. Our manufacturing contacts report that orders remain strong\nbut backlogs have grown and lead times for deliveries have risen because of virus-related disruptions to\n\n\f4\nproduction and at ports. Automakers have had to cut back production in the face of ongoing shortages of\nsemiconductors. In the residential real estate market, low mortgage rates and shifts in housing\npreferences have increased demand. But homebuilders have not been able to ramp up supply enough to\nmeet this demand, partly due to delays in getting building materials and their elevated cost. As a result,\nhouse prices have been soaring.\n\nOn balance, I expect growth to be less robust over the second half of this year, compared to the first, but\nfor the year as a whole, growth will be strong, at around 5-1/2 percent, which is well above trend. Next\nyear, I anticipate that the headwinds from supply constraints will begin to ease and the recovery will\nbroaden. Growth is likely to remain above trend but at a more moderate pace of 3-3/4 to 4 percent, as the\ntailwinds coming from the pandemic-related fiscal support and pent-up demand fade.\n\nThe Labor Market\nThe Fed has two monetary policy goals: maximum employment and price stability. So, before I turn to\nmonetary policy, let me discuss the labor market and inflation. Strong output growth this year has been\naccompanied by strong job growth. Even with the virus-driven slowdown in service-sector hiring last\nmonth, payrolls have grown an average of about 585 thousand per month so far this year, and 750\nthousand per month over the last three months. The unemployment rate has fallen 1.5 percentage points\nsince last December. Conditions in the labor market have vastly improved since their nadir in April 2020,\nyet there is still some distance to go. Payrolls are still over 5 million jobs below where they were before\nthe pandemic, the unemployment rate is elevated at 5-1/4 percent, and the labor force participation rate\namong workers aged 16 to 54 is still about a percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. Despite the\nprogress that has been made, by these measures, it looks like there is still considerable slack in the labor\nmarket.\n\n\f5\nYet, firms across a wide range of industries and across the country have been reporting for some time that\nthey want to hire but are struggling to find workers. The number of job openings is at its highest level\nsince the start of that data series in 2000, and the statistics show more posted job openings than\nunemployed workers. So by these measures, labor markets appear to be tight.\n\nSome of our business and labor contacts thought that when the supplemental unemployment insurance\nbenefits ended, the number of job applicants would rise. The state of Ohio stopped paying these benefits\nin June, but almost half of our contacts looking for workers said they had seen no increase in job\napplicants since May and over a third said they had actually seen a decline. This indicates that the labor\nmarket story is more complex. Labor supply has likely been held back by a perfect storm of factors,\nmany of which reflect the unusual nature of the pandemic. The high cost and scarcity of daycare is likely\na factor deterring the return of some parents. 1 Employment of daycare workers is still down about 12\npercent from where it was pre-pandemic. That is worse than the 3.5 percent gap across all sectors and the\n8 percent gap for the hard-hit food services-restaurant sector. 2 For those with older children, there is\nuncertainty about whether schools will be able to stay reliably open in the midst of the Delta wave. In\naddition, some workers are likely reluctant to return to the workforce until virus cases turn back down.\nThe support received during the pandemic has given some workers the financial wherewithal to retrain for\nbetter jobs than they had before the pandemic. This is a promising development, but training takes some\ntime.\n\nIt is possible that with more firms offering remote working arrangements and technological advances that\nwill keep these arrangements productive, we will end up with more people in the labor force after the\n1\n\nResearchers from the Atlanta Fed estimate that women with children under age 6 made up about 10 percent of the\npre-pandemic work force but account for almost a quarter of job losses due to the pandemic. See M. Melinda Pitts,\n“Where Are They Now? Workers with Young Children during COVID-19,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s\nPolicy Hub, No. 10-2021, September 2021. (https://doi.org/10.29338/ph2021-10)\nFor further discussion of current labor market conditions in the child care industry, see Heather Long, “‘The Pay is\nAbsolute Crap’: Child-care Workers Are Quitting Rapidly, A Red Flag for the Economy,” The Washington Post,\nSeptember 19, 2021. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/19/childcare-workers-quit/)\n2\n\n\f6\npandemic than we had before the pandemic. But in the meantime, firms are responding to labor shortages\nby increasing wages and offering more flexible work schedules and other benefits to attract and retain\nworkers. Even with the uncertainty around the outlook stemming from the virus, my expectation is that,\nover time, more people will get vaccinated, the public health situation will improve, the factors weighing\non labor supply will diminish, and labor supply will come into better balance with labor demand. As this\nhappens, labor market conditions will continue to improve, firms will add to their payrolls, and the\nunemployment rate will fall. In my baseline forecast, the unemployment rate falls to about 4-3/4 percent\nby the end of this year and to about 4 percent by the end of next year.\n\nInflation\nIn addition to higher wage costs, many firms are having to pay higher costs for materials, components,\nand shipping because of supply-chain challenges. In response to the higher costs of inputs and labor,\nfirms have increased the prices they are charging to their own customers. Measures of inflation have\nmoved up considerably and by more than expected at the start of the year. In July, the year-over-year\nmeasure of PCE inflation moved up to 4.2 percent. Core PCE inflation, which omits food and energy\nprices, and is one of the measures we look at to get a sense of the underlying inflation rate, rose to 3.6\npercent. Other indicators of underlying inflation, including the Cleveland Fed’s measures of median CPI\nand trimmed mean CPI, have also increased. As inflation rates have risen, some measures of consumer\nand business inflation expectations have also risen after being mired at levels below those consistent with\nour 2 percent inflation goal over much of the previous expansion.\n\nSo far, the increases in inflation have mainly been driven by price movements in components affected by\nvirus-related supply constraints or pent-up demand. We have already seen the prices of some of these\nitems stabilize and move back down. Used car prices are an example. My baseline expectation is that\ninflation will be well above 2 percent this year but will begin to move lower as supply constraints and\n\n\f7\npent-up demand ease. It will take some time for price pressures to abate, and inflation is likely to remain\nsomewhat above 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\nBecause both demand factors and supply factors are affecting inflation readings, the uncertainty attached\nto my inflation outlook is particularly high. On the downside, the factors that have held back inflation for\nmuch of the last expansion, such as technological change, digitalization, globalization, and a relatively\nweak relationship between economic activity and inflation, are all still present. The lower level of\nequilibrium interest rates in the U.S. and other advanced economies also results in a downward bias to\ninflation. Indeed, offsetting this bias was one reason the Federal Reserve changed its monetary policy\nstrategy to focus on keeping longer-run inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with our 2\npercent goal and aiming for inflation to average 2 percent over time.\n\nBut there are also upside risks to inflation, and I see them as outweighing the downside risks at this time,\neven though I have revised my inflation forecast up since the start of the year. Many businesses report\nthat cost pressures are intensifying and consumers seem to be willing to pay higher prices. The\ncombination of strong demand and supply-chain challenges could last longer than I anticipate and could\nlead people and businesses to raise their expectations for future inflation more than we have seen so far.\nAlthough this is not my base case, if elevated inflation readings were to persist longer than anticipated\nand inflation expectations were on a trajectory to move higher than levels consistent with our 2 percent\ngoal, monetary policy would need to be adjusted in order to bring inflation and inflation expectations\nback to our 2 percent goal on a sustained basis.\n\nMonetary Policy\nBoth the federal government and the Federal Reserve took swift and significant actions in response to the\npandemic. These actions helped to make last year’s recession the shortest on record and to avoid longterm economic scarring. The Fed took actions to restore the smooth functioning of the financial markets,\n\n\f8\nto ensure credit could flow to households and businesses, and to increase monetary accommodation in\nsupport of the recovery.\n\nAt our meeting earlier this week, the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to\n1/4 percent and made no change to the pace of our asset purchases. We are currently purchasing $80\nbillion per month of Treasury securities and $40 billion per month of agency mortgage-backed securities.\nWe indicated that if progress continues broadly as expected, a moderation in the pace of asset purchases\nmay soon be warranted.\n\nThe Fed’s asset purchases were an important policy response to address the severe strains in financial\nmarkets early in the pandemic and to support the economy in the midst of this unprecedented shock.\nNow, market functioning is restored and a solid recovery is underway. Last December, the FOMC issued\nforward guidance that we would not begin tapering our purchases until substantial further progress had\nbeen made toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. In my view, the economy has\nmet those conditions, and I support starting to dial back our purchases in November and concluding them\nover the first half of next year.\n\nThe start of asset-purchase tapering should not be taken as a signal that the FOMC plans to raise the fed\nfunds rate any time soon. Even after tapering starts, our balance sheet will be growing and monetary\npolicy will remain very accommodative. As the FOMC said, we expect to keep the funds rate at its\ncurrent target range of 0 to 1/4 percent until we have reached maximum employment and inflation has\nrisen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Inflation developments\nsuggest that the second condition has largely been met. Inflation is running well above 2 percent and is\nforecasted to be 2 percent or more over the next couple of years; average inflation over the past 5 years is\n2 percent, and measures of inflation expectations have moved up after running low over the last\nexpansion. But in my view, the first condition has not been met: the economy is still some distance from\n\n\f9\nmaximum employment. The number of payroll jobs and the labor force participation rate are still well\nbelow where they were prior to the pandemic, and unemployment rates are still well above their prepandemic levels. But as the recovery continues, labor markets will continue to improve, and I expect that\nthe conditions for liftoff of the fed funds rate will be met by the end of next year. Even after liftoff, to\nensure that our goals of maximum employment and price stability are sustainably achieved and\nmaintained, I believe it will be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for\nsome time\n\nEconomists often say that the only thing certain about an economic forecast is that it will certainly be\nwrong. If we have learned anything over the past 18 months, it is that things can evolve very differently\nthan anticipated. In these unprecedented times, the uncertainty around any economic forecast – including\nmy own – is particularly high. Uncertainty will remain very high until the path of the economy can be\ndecoupled from the virus. I know that I don’t need to tell bankers that in such an environment, it is\ncrucial to monitor risks – and stay humble. I plan to do both. I will reassess my outlook against the\nincoming data and the economic reconnaissance we gather from businesses, bankers, and community\ncontacts. My policy views will depend on how economic conditions, the outlook, and the risks around\nthe outlook actually evolve. I am prepared to change my views on the economy and appropriate monetary\npolicy as conditions warrant.\n\nComing back to your theme of bouncing back, I will close by noting that the economy and the people,\nbusinesses, banks, and communities that make it work have shown remarkable adaptability and resiliency\nin unprecedented times. I’m sure that at some point over the past 18 months, we have all felt as if we\nwere bouncing off the walls. But the good news is that over those months, the U.S. economy has bounced\nback a considerable way and it is poised to make even more progress over the coming year.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPolicy Keynote Speech\nBank of Finland and Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) Joint Webinar:\n“New Avenues for Monetary Policy”\nHelsinki, Finland\n(via videoconference)\nSeptember 10, 2021\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the program committee for inviting me to participate in the conference on “New Avenues for\nMonetary Policy” organized by the Bank of Finland and CEPR. I have felt a strong attachment to the\nBank of Finland ever since I was invited to participate in an external review of the bank’s research\nactivities in 2004. At the time, the bank was interested in building a strong research function so that it\ncould be an active member of the European System of Central Banks. It is easy to see by looking at the\nstrength of today’s program, the bank’s research output, and its engagement in the profession that the\nBank of Finland is achieving this goal.\n\nThe conference’s theme of new avenues for monetary policy is particularly relevant given the economic\nchallenges presented by the global pandemic. But even before the pandemic hit, structural changes to the\neconomy, in particular, lower estimates of the neutral real interest rate, presented challenges for monetary\npolicymakers and suggested that new thinking was needed to ensure achievement of our monetary policy\ngoals. Recently, both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) have undertaken\nreviews of their monetary policy frameworks to determine whether changes were needed to increase the\neffectiveness of their policy strategies. The ECB released the outcome of its review in July. The Fed’s\nrevised strategy is now about a year old. Today, I will discuss the Fed’s revised strategy, how the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) has put the strategy into practice, and based on that experience, what I\nbelieve are areas that would benefit from further clarification. As always, the views I will present are my\nown and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n\f2\nReasons for the Monetary Policy Framework Review\n[Figure 1: FOMC framework review] In August 2020, the FOMC adopted a revised Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which was reaffirmed in January of this year. 1 The\nrevised statement summarized the outcome of a review of our framework for setting monetary policy.\nThe review began in early 2019 and covered the strategy, tools, and communications we use in setting\npolicy in pursuit of the monetary policy goals given to us by the U.S. Congress. These goals are\nmaximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates. 2 When prices are stable\nand the economy is at maximum employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels.\nSo it is often said that the Fed has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe framework review was informed by our experience during and after the Great Recession, by\neconomic theory and empirical analysis, by consultations with academic researchers and practitioners at\nresearch conferences, and by conversations with the public at large through a series of Fed Listens events\nheld across the country. 3\n\nThe review was undertaken in light of changes in the economic environment that have emerged since the\nFOMC’s first strategy statement was published in 2012. The 2012 statement was significant because it\nstated for the first time an explicit numerical definition of price stability, namely, 2 percent inflation, as\nmeasured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE\n\n1\n\nThe revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf . Information about the\nframework review is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policystrategy-tools-and-communications.htm.\n2\n\nThe monetary policy goals given to the Fed by the U.S. Congress are specified in Section 2A of the Federal\nReserve Act (https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm).\nSeveral of the papers presented at the Federal Reserve System’s conference on Monetary Policy – Strategy, Tools,\nand Communication Practices were published in a special issue of the International Journal of Central Banking 160\n(February 2020) (https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb2002.htm).\n3\n\n\f3\ninflation. 4 The establishment of an explicit inflation target took many years of FOMC discussion: the\nFOMC was not an early adopter. But the experience of the financial crisis and deep recession of 20072009, the sluggish ensuing recovery in the labor market, and the rounds of unconventional monetary\npolicies used to provide accommodation after the federal funds rate was constrained by the zero lower\nbound all contributed to the FOMC’s decision in 2012 to adopt a form of flexible inflation targeting, with\nan explicit numerical inflation goal. 5 The 2012 strategy recognized that, over the longer run, monetary\npolicy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as\nthe natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help\noffset shorter-run fluctuations in employment around maximum employment.\n\nThis flexible inflation-targeting strategy served the FOMC well. The ensuing economic expansion turned\nout to be the longest expansion on record in the U.S., with the unemployment rate falling to its lowest\nlevel in several decades – until it was cut short by the pandemic. But the experience during this long\nexpansion and structural changes to the economic environment led the FOMC to review our monetary\npolicy strategy to ensure it maintained its effectiveness now and in the future.\n\n[Figure 2: Equilibrium real interest rates] One economic development with important implications for\nmonetary policy is the decline in the U.S. and other advanced economies in the general level of real\ninterest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability, that is, r-star. This decline reflects\nseveral factors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity\ngrowth, which weigh on long-run economic growth and lower the natural rate of unemployment. 6 It\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” January\n24, 2012 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_201201.pdf).\n4\n\nFor additional context on the FOMC’s adoption of the explicit numerical inflation target and flexible inflation\ntargeting, see Jeffrey M. Lacker, “A Look Back at the Consensus Statement,” Cato Journal 40, Spring/Summer\n2020 (https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-05/cj-v40n2-3_1.pdf).\n5\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Demographics and Their Implications for the Economy and Policy,” Cato Journal, 38\n(Spring/Summer 2018), pp. 399-413. (https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2018/5/cjv38n2-6.pdf)\n6\n\n\f4\nmeans that the level of the federal funds rate, the policy rate in the U.S., consistent with maximum\nemployment and price stability is now lower than it has been in the past.\n\n[Figure 3: Longer-run fed funds rate] And this means that during economic downturns, it is now more\nlikely that the fed funds rate will be constrained by its effective lower bound. The FOMC will have less\npolicy space to support the economy using the funds rate, its traditional policy tool, and other tools,\nincluding asset purchases and forward guidance, will need to be used more often. In past recessions, the\nFOMC has typically reduced the federal funds rate target by 5 to 6 percentage points. With lower\nequilibrium interest rates, this policy space will not be available; for example, in last year’s recession, the\nFOMC was able to reduce the funds rate by only 1-1/2 percentage points. Assuming that households,\nbusinesses, and financial markets understand that it will be more difficult for monetary policymakers to\nreach their inflation goal, this constraint imparts a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations,\nwhich reinforces the downside risks to achieving our policy goals.\n\n[Figure 4: Phillips curve] Another change in the economic environment with implications for monetary\npolicy pertains to inflation dynamics. Until late in the prior economic expansion, inflation readings in the\nU.S. ran below the 2 percent objective, and this was true in other advanced economies as well. Resource\nutilization in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with actual inflation than\nin the past – the Phillips curve has become flatter – and inflation expectations now play a larger role in\ndetermining inflation outcomes. This makes it even more important that inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored at levels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal. If expectations move persistently\nbelow these levels, it is more likely that inflation will run persistently below our goal, which results in\neven less policy space. Expectations that run persistently above our goal would also be a problem, but\ncould be addressed by raising the policy rate.\n\n\f5\nThese structural changes in the economic environment are expected to persist and the FOMC undertook\nthe framework review with them in mind, with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of our monetary\npolicy strategy in promoting our policy goals in the new environment.\n\nWhat Did Not Change in the Revised Strategy\n[Figure 5. What did not change] Before discussing the changes in our strategy, it is important to know\nthat several things have not changed.\n\nFirst, the longer-run inflation goal has not changed; it remains at 2 percent as measured by the annual\nchange in the PCE price index.\n\nSecond, the FOMC continues to believe it is not appropriate to set a fixed numerical goal for employment\nbecause monetary policy cannot influence nonmonetary structural aspects of the economy, including\nmaximum employment and the natural rate of unemployment, which change over time.\n\nThird, the FOMC continues to be forward looking in setting monetary policy because policy affects the\neconomy with a lag. This means that policy will depend on the economic outlook and the assessment of\nrisks to the outlook.\n\nFourth, the FOMC continues to acknowledge that risks to the financial system could impede the\nattainment of our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\n\f6\nWhat Did Change in the Revised Strategy\nWhile the elements I just mentioned were unchanged, several other elements did change.\n\n[Figure 6: Inflation goal] Regarding our approach to inflation, while the goal hasn’t changed, the\nstrategy for achieving the goal now takes into account the downward bias that the lower r-star and zero\nlower bound on interest rates impart to inflation and inflation expectations. In particular, after periods in\nwhich inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we will likely aim to have inflation run\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. Aiming for inflation to average 2 percent over time is\nexpected to help anchor inflation expectations, a main determinant of actual inflation, at levels consistent\nwith 2 percent inflation. This revised strategy can be viewed as a shift from flexible inflation targeting to\nflexible average inflation targeting, whereby policy actions are taken to make up for some past inflation\nmisses in order to have inflation average 2 percent over time.\n\nThis revision is a stronger statement than ones we made in the past as we struggled to effectively convey\nthat the longer-run goal of 2 percent should not be interpreted as a ceiling. In the past, I and many others\non the FOMC indicated that we would be comfortable with inflation running above 2 percent for a time\nafter it had run low for some time – a type of opportunistic re-inflation. But now we are being deliberate\nrather than opportunistic. After inflation has run persistently low, we won’t just tolerate serendipitous\nshocks that move inflation above 2 percent for some time, but we will set policy with that intention. This\nmeans that monetary policy will be somewhat more accommodative than in the past, all else equal.\n\nRegarding our employment goal, I view the changes in strategy as a more explicit acknowledgment of the\nuncertainty around assessments of the level of maximum employment and a clarification of our approach\nto achieving the employment goal in light of our experience over the past expansion. 7 During the pre-\n\n7\n\nThis is consistent with something I have advocated for some time: that policy communications should\nacknowledge uncertainty. See, e.g., Loretta J. Mester, “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” remarks at the Shadow Open\n\n\f7\npandemic expansion, we learned that employment growth could be stronger and the unemployment rate\ncould move lower without generating inflation than we thought possible based on decades of experience.\n\n[Figure 7: Estimates of the natural rate of unemployment] It took some time for the FOMC to learn\nabout the structural changes in the economy and the difficulties in assessing maximum employment in\nreal time using the Phillips curve model. As the FOMC was learning, its assessments of the longer-run\nunemployment rate came down significantly over time. And, as Cleveland Fed staff analysis indicates, in\nthe last two years of the most recent economic expansion, FOMC participants put less weight on the\nunemployment rate in determining the appropriate monetary policy path than they had earlier in the\nexpansion. 8\n\n[Figure 8: Maximum employment goal] Unfortunately, this time-to-learn, combined with the previous\nstrategy statement’s references to “deviations” of employment from maximum employment rather than\n“shortfalls,” gave the impression that the FOMC would at times take deliberate policy action to bring\nemployment down independently of our inflation goal. But this was not the case. Now, the revised\nstrategy statement makes it explicit that the FOMC views its maximum employment goal as a broadbased and inclusive goal and that in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability,\nstrong employment is not a concern and monetary policy will not react to it.\nExperience with the Revised Strategy over the First Year\nThe revised strategy has been in place for about a year and has been guiding our policy decision-making.\nFor the strategy to live up to its promise of better anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at 2 percent\n\nMarket Committee Fall Meeting, New York, NY, October 7, 2016.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20161007-acknowledging-uncertainty.aspx).\nSee Edward S. Knotek II, “Changing Policy Rule Parameters Implied by the Median SEP Paths,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland Economic Commentary Number 2019-06, April 15, 2019.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economiccommentaries/ec-201906-changing-policy-rule-parameters)\n8\n\n\f8\nand delivering on our goals of maximum employment and longer-run price stability in a low r-star\nenvironment, it is important that the public understand the strategy and that the FOMC is committed to it.\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I will present my views on our experience thus far and some aspects of\nthe strategy we should clarify for the public.\n\nPerhaps the new strategy’s most obvious influence is on the FOMC’s forward guidance on the expected\nfuture path of the fed funds rate and on the asset purchase program that has been included in our postmeeting policy statement since adoption of the strategy.\n\n[Figure 9. Forward guidance] First, since September 2020, the FOMC has indicated that it expects it\nwill be appropriate to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market\nconditions have reached levels consistent with our assessments of maximum employment, and inflation\nhas risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. After liftoff, the\nFOMC expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until our goals are met and\nlonger-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent. This is outcome-based forward\nguidance, which the FOMC has used in the past, but it indicates a more accommodative path for the funds\nrate than likely would have been deemed appropriate under the former strategy in terms of both the\nemployment and inflation conditions. This change acknowledges the need to ensure that policy is\naccommodative enough to prevent low levels of inflation and inflation expectations as seen in the last\nexpansion from becoming entrenched.\n\nWith regard to the asset purchase program, since December of last year, the FOMC has been indicating\nthat we expect to continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month\nand of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further\nprogress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\n\f9\nThe FOMC’s forward guidance is in line with our new policy strategy and is an important part of policy\ncommunications. Communications play a critical role in effective monetary policymaking by aligning the\npublic’s policy expectations with those of policymakers, enhancing policymakers’ credibility, and\nproviding the public the information it needs to hold policymakers accountable. Good communication is\nparticularly important in a low-interest-rate environment because at the zero lower bound, forward policy\nguidance is a tool that can be used to add monetary accommodation. Whether the revised strategy\nstatement and our policy forward guidance provide enough clarity to achieve our communication goals\nremains an open question.\n\nFed watchers and others have asked for more context about several aspects of the new strategy and our\nforward guidance. They are interested in knowing how the FOMC will measure average inflation, how\nfar above 2 percent the FOMC considers “moderately” above, and what time period constitutes “for some\ntime” when assessing inflation above 2 percent. They are interested in what indicators the FOMC will be\nusing to assess whether labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment and what\nconstitutes “substantial further progress” toward our goals when determining whether it is time to begin\ntapering our asset purchases. These questions have become particularly relevant as the economy has\ncontinued to surprise over the course of the pandemic. Instead of inflation being mired below target, it\nhas surprised on the high side. Similarly, the recovery in the labor market since the nadir in April 2020\nhas been remarkable.\n\n[Figure 10. First area for clarification] When the FOMC established the revised strategy, we did not\nspecify a mathematical formula to determine whether average 2 percent inflation had been met, choosing\nto maintain some flexibility as we had done under our prior flexible inflation targeting strategy. In part,\nthe flexibility recognizes that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single inflation mandate. But some\nclarity on how the FOMC will assess average inflation will help ensure that the new strategy lives up to\nits promise of anchoring inflation expectations at levels consistent with our longer-run 2 percent goal.\n\n\f10\n\n[Figure 11. Inflation benchmarks] For example, as of the second quarter of this year, PCE inflation has\naveraged 2 percent over the past 5 years. 9 According to many forecasts, even with inflation expected to\nmove down from its elevated levels of the past year, 5-year average inflation is forecasted to move above\n2 percent over the next year as earlier low levels of inflation drop out of the calculation. So a reasonable\nassessment is that we are at or close to meeting the average inflation goal. But this is based on a 5-year\nwindow for averaging. Others may prefer a different time horizon. For example, PCE inflation has\naveraged 1.8 percent over the past 6 years and 1.6 percent over the past 7 years. Or they may prefer a\nfixed starting point rather than a moving average in order to assess progress on the inflation goal.\nDepending on your benchmark, you would have different views on how much progress has been made\ntoward the goal, and in order to promote achievement of the average inflation goal, the moderate\novershoot you might be willing to tolerate could be different depending on the shortfall you perceive.\n\n[Figure 12. Second area for clarification] A similar issue arises with the employment goal. To interpret\n“substantial further progress” one needs to know how much further there is to go, and this assessment\ndepends on whether it is reasonable to expect labor market conditions to return to their strong prepandemic levels of February 2020. That is probably not a bad benchmark to use to assess progress for\nmany indicators, but it is not necessarily the right one for other indicators.\n\n[Figure 13. Labor force participation rates] For example, about 3 to 3-1/2 million people in the U.S.\nhave retired since the onset of the pandemic. This is about twice as many as would have been expected\nbased on population aging. Retirees typically don’t return to the labor market. This time could be\ndifferent since the pandemic shock is something new, but we probably shouldn’t expect the overall labor\n\n9\n\nAs of 2021Q2, the compounded annualized growth rate over the past 20 quarters of PCE inflation is 1.99 percent\nand of core PCE inflation is 1.96 percent.\n\n\f11\nforce participation rate to approach its pre-pandemic level. It is likely better to assess conditions using the\nprime-age participation rate to abstract from retirements.\n\nWhile it is important for the FOMC to look at a variety of indicators to assess progress on our\nemployment goal, it is also important that we do so systematically. As a committee, we should examine\nthe same relevant set of indicators over time and communicate our assessment of progress based on that\nset of indicators. This would be a way to align the public’s assessment with the FOMC’s so the public\nwill understand when “substantial further progress” has been made.\n\n[Figure 14. Third area for clarification] Indeed, the promise of the new strategy is that it will keep the\npublic’s inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent even in a low-interest-rate environment. To\nachieve this, it is important that we give the public a good sense of our policy reaction function under the\nnew strategy and to demonstrate our commitment to it. One helpful step would be if our post-meeting\npolicy statement provided more of a narrative of our assessment of how changes in a consistent set of\neconomic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks around that\noutlook, the appropriate policy path based on that outlook and risk assessment, and the considerations the\nFOMC will take into account when determining future changes in policy. Changing the policy statement\nlike this would make it longer, but also more informative.\n\n[Figure 15. Inflation] Our experience this year with communications about inflation shows some of the\nchallenges of not including enough narrative in our statement. The sources of this year’s inflation\nincreases have complicated communications and have made forecasting inflation considerably more\ndifficult. Supply chain disruptions driven by the pandemic, coupled with pent-up demand let loose by the\nreopening of the economy, have led to a surge in measured inflation. In July, year-over year PCE\ninflation was 4.2 percent and core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was 3.6 percent.\nA considerable portion of the rise in inflation this year has been concentrated in a small number of goods\n\n\f12\nand services. Inflation measures that exclude items with the most extreme movements in the price\ndistribution, such as those calculated by the Cleveland Fed, have increased by much less, and the prices of\nsome of these components have begun to fall as supplies have realigned and demand has adjusted. 10\nOther prices are expected to stabilize and then move back down next year as some of the supply\nconstraints abate. The FOMC first pointed to the rise in inflation in its post-meeting statement in April,\nand said it was largely due to transitory factors. The statement did not elaborate further.\n\nOne could view the language as a terse way to distinguish supply-side factors that would lead to relative\nprice changes from demand-side pressures that could cause the underlying trend inflation rate to rise. But\nanother way to interpret “transitory” is in terms of time. This is perfectly reasonable since Merriam\nWebster’s first definition of the word is “of brief duration.”\n\nBut many businesses now tell us that the supply disruptions are lasting longer than they originally thought\nand many do not expect them to resolve until the middle of next year or later. Many firms have been able\nto pass on the increased cost of inputs to their customers in the form of higher prices. At the same time,\nlabor shortages have led firms to raise wages. These developments, along with continued elevated\ninflation readings, mean that the “transitory” language has become a less useful description of the\ninflation situation.\n\nMy own modal forecast is for inflation to remain high this year and then to begin to move back down next\nyear; however, I see upside risks to this forecast. It is possible that the higher prices could cause longerrun inflation expectations to rise above the levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, thereby\nputting upward pressure on inflation. These levels could only be sustained if monetary policy was too\naccommodative, and the Fed would need to respond to bring inflation and inflation expectations in line\nThe Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research provides its measures of median CPI inflation and median PCE\ninflation, as well as its measures of inflation expectations and inflation nowcasts, on its web pages at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n10\n\n\f13\nwith the 2 percent goal. These dynamics are difficult to communicate in a word or two, especially in an\nenvironment where both strong demand and supply factors are in play. But a statement that offered more\nof an explanation of the FOMC’s views on the factors affecting current inflation readings, the outlook for\ninflation, and the risks around that outlook would give the public a better sense of the FOMC’s\nassessment than merely saying that elevated readings largely reflect transitory factors.\n\nGiven that we have a new strategy and that we continue to live with the uncertainties of the pandemic,\ngiving the public the information it needs to better understand how policymakers are likely to react not\nonly to anticipated economic and financial developments but also to unanticipated developments seems\nlike a very worthwhile endeavor. My expectation is that, over time, as we gain more experience under\nour new strategy, we will be able to hone our communications in a way that supports the promise offered\nby the new strategy of better achieving our monetary policy goals.\n\n\fCharts for\n“The Federal Reserve’s Revised Monetary Policy Strategy\nand Its First Year of Practice”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nWorkshop on Low-Interest-Rate and Unconventional Monetary Policy\nNorges Bank\nOslo, Norway\n(via videoconference)\nJune 22, 2021\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Kasper Roszbach and the Norges Bank for inviting me to present at this workshop on lowinterest-rate and unconventional monetary policy. I applaud the Norges Bank for spurring research on\nthis topic. In a period of less than two decades, the world has experienced two historically deep negative\nshocks to the global economy and financial system. While their causes were different, the global\nfinancial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis each necessitated the intervention of central\nbanks in ways not contemplated in earlier decades. Lessons from the actions taken during the 2008 crisis\nand recovery and from the large body of research that was generated thereafter helped to inform economic\npolicy during the pandemic. I anticipate that our experience over the past year and a half, as well as\nresearch driven by that experience, will help guide policymakers now and in the future. Today, I will\nshare my thoughts on the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability in a low-interestrate environment. These thoughts are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or\nof my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nLet me start with a working definition of financial stability. When I refer to financial stability, I mean a\nfinancial system that is resilient to shocks. That is, one in which banks and nonbank financial institutions\nnot only remain solvent but also continue to lend to creditworthy businesses and households during a\nsignificant economic downturn, and one in which financial markets continue to intermediate in an orderly\nfashion during periods of stress.\n\nWith this definition, it is clear that monetary policy and financial stability are linked in several ways.\nFirst, monetary policy affects the real economy by affecting financial conditions. When financial markets\n\n\f2\nare disrupted, as they were during the global financial crisis and at the onset of the pandemic, the\ntransmission of monetary policy to the economy is disrupted.\n\nSecond, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are interconnected, usually in a\ncomplementary way. A stable financial system plays a key role in supporting the achievement of\nmonetary policy goals. In the U.S. these goals are price stability and maximum employment.\nIndeed, the FOMC’s statement on its monetary policy strategy says that “sustainably achieving maximum\nemployment and price stability depends on a stable financial system” and that the FOMC’s monetary\npolicy decisions “reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance\nof risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s\ngoals.”1\n\nVolatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic economy\nare not a concern, but disruptions to the financial system that interfere with its ability to provide valuable\ncredit, risk-management, payment, and liquidity services to businesses and households can interfere with\nthe economy’s ability to achieve and maintain stable prices and maximum employment. An unstable\nfinancial system can propagate adverse macroeconomic shocks over broad economic sectors and over\ntime to the detriment of macroeconomic stability. In the other direction, well-formulated and wellcommunicated monetary policy supports financial stability by allowing households, firms, and financial\ninstitutions to make better investment, saving, borrowing, and lending decisions, and price stability\neliminates a source of asset-price volatility.\n\nThe linkages between monetary policy and financial stability are usually complementary, but at times\npolicymakers will be faced with intertemporal tradeoffs and these tradeoffs will vary over the business\n\n1\n\nSee FOMC (2021).\n\n\f3\nand credit cycles. For example, if the economy is already near its monetary policy goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability, then continuing to keep policy rates very low to move even closer to\nthese goals could contribute to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities. This creates the potential for a future\nperiod of financial instability that could jeopardize the achievement of monetary policy goals over time.\n\nChanges to the Economic Environment\nCentral banks have recognized these linkages between financial stability and monetary policy for a long\ntime. What is different now is that the economic environment has changed in ways that affect both\nmonetary policy and financial system stability. These changes in the economic environment were a\ncatalyst for the FOMC’s monetary policy framework review, whose conclusions were summarized in a\nrevised monetary policy strategy statement announced in August 2020 and reaffirmed in January 2021. 2\n\nOver the past couple of decades, the U.S. and other advanced economies have seen a decline in the\ngeneral level of interest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline in the\nequilibrium interest rate, so-called r-star, reflects several structural factors, including the aging of the\npopulation; changes in risk preferences, which affect savings and investment decisions; and a slowdown\nin productivity growth. Lower r-star means that the FOMC will have less policy space to support the\neconomy during economic downturns; that its traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, will spend more\ntime at its effective lower bound; and that nonconventional policy tools will more often need to be used to\nadd monetary accommodation.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment over the past two decades pertains to inflation dynamics.\nResource slack in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with actual inflation\nthan in past decades, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation outcomes.\n\n2\n\nFOMC (2021).\n\n\f4\nThis, coupled with the proximity of the policy rate to its effective lower bound, means there is a\ndownward bias in inflation expectations and that bouts of low inflation may be more persistent than in the\npast.\n\nIn recognition of these changes in the economic environment, the FOMC revised its policy strategy by\nbeing explicit that in order to reach its 2 percent longer-run inflation goal and promote maximum\nemployment, anchoring longer-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation is\nvery important. And to do that, the FOMC would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2\npercent for some time following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent.\n\nNonconventional Monetary Policy Tools and Financial Stability Risks\nIn the U.S., the nonconventional policy tools the FOMC has used include large-scale asset purchases,\nholding the policy rate at its effective lower bound for an extended period, and forward guidance that\ncommunicates an intention to maintain a very accommodative stance of monetary policy until certain\neconomic improvements have been realized. Because these nonconventional tools raise the potential for a\nbuildup in financial vulnerabilities and imbalances, monetary policymakers need to expend extra effort in\nassessing financial stability risks. Since the global financial crisis, the FOMC has increased its\nmonitoring of financial vulnerabilities using a framework that recognizes the complex nature of the\nfinancial system in the U.S., with its mix of bank-based and market-based finance and its multiplicity of\nregulatory and supervisory bodies. 3\n\nThere are several avenues through which the use of nonconventional monetary policy might create or\ncontribute to financial system vulnerabilities. A commitment to a protracted period of very low interest\nrates could encourage risk-taking as investors search for yield; it could lead to a build-up in leverage; and\n\n3\n\nFor a description of this framework, see Adrian, Tobias, and Liang (2015).\n\n\f5\nit could lead lenders to lower their credit standards and promote increased borrowing. While all of these\nare avenues through which monetary policy typically affects the economy, the concern is that these\neffects could be excessive and create or contribute to financial vulnerabilities.\n\nVery low interest rates can also compress the risk premia in asset prices, leading to excessive valuations.\nIndeed, some empirical studies indicate that monetary policy affects asset prices mainly through its effect\non risk premia. 4 Excessive valuations are a vulnerability because if risk appetites were to change\nsuddenly, these valuations could fall suddenly, leading to margin calls and losses, especially if leverage is\nelevated, which is more likely in a low-interest-rate environment. Low interest rates could more directly\nimpact the profitability of banks by lowering net interest margins and earnings, thereby limiting banks’\ncapital levels and their ability to lend through a downturn and changing their appetite for risk. While the\navailable empirical evidence suggests that the effects of changes in policy rates on asset prices and risk\npremia have been moderate relative to the typical fluctuations seen in these measures, the evidence is\nparticularly limited since we have not had many extended periods with low interest rates.\n\nHigh debt levels, both private debt and government debt, have to be intermediated by the financial sector,\ncreating another potential vulnerability: periods of dysfunction in financial markets when there is a large\nshift in demand for liquidity. We experienced this at the beginning of the pandemic when the dash for\ncash put pressure even on the U.S. Treasury market, one of the most liquid markets in the world.\n\nAlthough I’ve been speaking about long periods with low interest rates, sizable asset purchases by the\ncentral bank can have similar effects by creating imbalances. Depending on how large they are, a central\nbank’s asset purchases could create vulnerabilities by encouraging investors to be less sensitive to risk or\ncould impact market functioning and thereby the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.\n\n4\n\nSee, e.g., Gertler and Karadi (2015) and Gilchrist, López-Salido, and Zakrajšek (2015).\n\n\f6\n\nForward guidance can provide additional accommodation once the policy rate has been brought down to\nits effective lower bound by reducing uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate. In addition to\nthe risks of holding interest rates lower for longer, by reducing uncertainty, forward guidance may mute\nfinancial market volatility and spur a buildup of leverage.\n\nAddressing Financial Stability Risks\nWhile it is clear that monetary policymakers need to be aware of financial stability risks, a less settled\nquestion is how monetary policymakers should best address emerging financial stability risks, especially\nwhen taking actions to promote monetary policy goals might be in conflict with containing financial\nstability risks. In the U.K., the Financial Services Act recognizes potential tradeoffs between monetary\npolicy and financial stability policy and explicitly says that the Financial Policy Committee is not\nauthorized to act in a way that it feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the\nfinancial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long term.”5\n\nArguably, a post-crisis consensus has emerged that it is better to use supervisory, regulatory, and\nmacroprudential tools to address financial stability risks and monetary policy tools to address\nmacroeconomic stability risks. Since this type of separation is optimal in many models, a natural\nquestion is: What can we do to maximize the chances that we will be able to maintain this separation\nbetween monetary policy and financial stability policy and minimize periods when our macroeconomic\nstability goals and financial stability goals are in conflict. I will offer three recommendations:\n•\n\nFirst, we need to ensure that the banking system remains structurally resilient across the\nbusiness and financial cycles, with strong capital and liquidity requirements that are\nrecalibrated to a low-interest-rate environment.\n\n5\n\nSee U.K. (2012).\n\n\f7\n•\n\nSecond, we need to take steps to increase the structural resiliency of nonbank financial\nfirms and markets and improve our ability to monitor risks in the nonbank financial\nsector.\n\n•\n\nThird, we need to be more explicit in our monetary policy framework that there will be\ntimes when macroeconomic and financial stabilities will come into conflict and include\nconsideration of financial stability risks when issuing forward guidance on monetary\npolicy.\n\nLet me elaborate on each of these to conclude my remarks. Regarding the first recommendation, the\nbenefits of a resilient banking system in supporting the attainment of macroeconomic goals became very\nclear during the pandemic. After the last financial crisis in which banks were front and center, steps were\ntaken to shore up the resiliency of the commercial banking system through higher capital levels, liquidity\nrequirements, and stress testing. These steps paid off. Banks were in a strong enough position going into\nthe pandemic that, with support from their regulators, they played an important role in ensuring that credit\nkept flowing to households and small businesses. This helped to mitigate some of the economic effects of\nthe pandemic. The strength of the banking system also allowed monetary policymakers to use their tools\nfully to support the economy.\n\nIn the U.S., maintaining the structural resiliency of the banking system throughout the cycle is made even\nmore important by the limits on the macroprudential tools available to address vulnerabilities that vary\nover the business and credit cycles. There is a complex constellation of regulators and a variety of\nfinancial institutions in the U.S. The use of macroprudential tools has to be coordinated across multiple\nregulators and, in some cases, follow legally required administrative procedures like public comment\nperiods, which delay application of the tools. The U.S. does not have some of the tools that Norway and\nsome other countries have, including limits on loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios that vary\nover the cycle and are targeted to particular sectors like housing or household credit to control leverage\n\n\f8\nregardless of lender. Instead, the main cyclical macroprudential tools available in the U.S. are the stress\ntests and countercyclical capital buffer. 6\n\nStress tests (the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) that apply to the largest banks in the U.S.\nmight be adapted to serve as a macroprudential tool to the extent that the systemic vulnerabilities of\nconcern can be built into the stress scenarios. But, typically, these scenarios are set well in advance and\nare not aimed at macroprudential goals, but rather at microprudential risks. Nonetheless, last year, as the\neconomy shut down because of the pandemic, the Board of Governors adapted stress testing techniques to\nconduct sensitivity tests of bank capital levels and solvency in several plausible downside scenarios amid\ngreat uncertainty about how the pandemic would affect the economy. This information was used to\ninform decisions about whether to halt dividend payments and stock buybacks.\n\nOur other tool, the countercyclical capital buffer, is designed to be increased so that banks raise capital in\ngood economic times when vulnerabilities build and then lowered to support continued lending when\neconomic conditions deteriorate. The social return to lending in this state of the world would be relatively\nhigh, so optimally we should be willing to trade off somewhat lower lending in a healthy economy in\norder to support lending in a weak economy. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will use this\ntool only when systemic vulnerabilities are “meaningfully above normal” and that, when using the tool, it\nintends to increase the buffer gradually and give organizations substantial notice. 7 This makes the tool\nless useful as a method for addressing vulnerabilities that arise quickly or may be detected only after they\nhave had time to develop. In the U.S., the buffer has never been raised above zero. In contrast, Norway’s\n\n6\n\nOther cyclical tools available in the U.S. are supervisory guidance and changes to margin requirements.\nSupervisory guidance has been used to limit banks’ exposures in certain markets, for example, commercial real\nestate and leveraged lending. But the guidance is not legally binding and would need to be coordinated with the set\nof U.S. bank regulators, which takes time. The Federal Reserve Board has the ability to set margin requirements on\nequity purchases, but it has not used this power since the early 1970s. To be effective, changes in margin\nrequirements would need to be coordinated across jurisdictions, which takes time. Research suggests that such\nrequirements are not that effective in addressing vulnerabilities.\n7\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016).\n\n\f9\ncountercyclical capital buffer is ordinarily set above zero and varies over the cycle. 8 It is worth\nconsidering whether recalibrating this tool in the U.S. to be above zero in normal times would lead U.S.\npolicymakers to be more willing to use it.\n\nIn my view, given the limits on cyclical macroprudential tools in the U.S., focus is better placed on\nimproving the resiliency of the financial system’s structure across the business and financial cycles. As I\ndiscussed, the potential for financial vulnerabilities to build up in a low-equilibrium-interest-rate (r-star)\nenvironment is elevated, all else equal. This means that the current minimum capital and liquidity\nrequirements are likely not properly calibrated to deliver the same degree of resiliency as they did when\nthese minimums were set under Basel and r-star was higher. 9 As part of their work to ensure a resilient\nfinancial system, policymakers and the research staffs that support them should begin an assessment of\nthe benefits and costs of recalibrating these minimums to the new low-interest-rate environment.\n\nMy second recommendation recognizes that much of our regulatory, supervisory, and macroprudential\napparatus is focused on banks, yet financial activity is increasingly moving outside of the banking system.\nNonbank financial intermediation, through investment funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and\nother financial entities, has risen over time. These entities now hold almost half of global financial assets,\nup from 42 percent in 2008. 10 This means that credit risk is increasingly being intermediated and held\noutside the banking sector. Yet limited transparency around the risk exposures of hedge funds, family\noffices, and other leveraged financial entities makes monitoring emerging risks more difficult for both\nregulators and counterparties. The Financial Stability Board has recognized the need to better understand\n\nIn December 2018, on the recommendation of the Norges Bank, Norway’s Ministry of Finance decided to raise the\ncountercyclical buffer to 2.5 percent, effective at the end of 2019. The buffer was subsequently reduced to 1 p ercent\nin March 2020, the early days of the pandemic; it will be raised to 1.5 percent at the end June 2022. See Norway\nMinistry of Finance (2018, 2020, and 2021).\n8\n\n9\n\nSee Tucker (2018) for discussion.\n\n10\n\nFinancial Stability Board (2020), p. 12.\n\n\f10\nthe interconnections between bank and nonbank intermediation, the amplification of shocks, and the\noverall resiliency of the nonbank financial sector. 11\n\nSome of the nonbank intermediation is bank-like in that it involves short-run funding of longer-run assets\nand is subject to runs that can spill over to the broader financial system. During both the global financial\ncrisis and the pandemic, prime (nongovernment) money market mutual funds, because of their structure,\nwere subject to significant outflows in a very short period of time. In the U.S., $125 billion flowed out of\nprime money market funds in March 2020, which was 11 percent of their assets. 12 Outflows forced the\nfunds to redeem their commercial paper holdings, thereby creating more stress in short-term funding\nmarkets. These runs were severe enough to require the Fed to intervene with emergency facilities.\nReforms to the structure of these funds to reduce the risk of runs are now being considered by U.S.\nregulators. 13 These reforms include swing pricing, widely used in Europe, whereby investors redeeming\nshares receive a lower price when the fund’s redemptions rise above a certain level.\n\nThe pandemic also revealed some structural issues in the U.S. Treasury market, one of the most important\nand most liquid markets in the global financial system. In March 2020, amid great uncertainty about the\nemerging global pandemic, many investors sought to move into cash and began liquidating their\npositions, even their positions in U.S. Treasuries, which are usually viewed as safe-haven assets. Pressure\nto sell was widespread and overwhelmed the dealers who play a central role in this market by\nintermediating between buyers and sellers. Stresses rose to a level that necessitated aggressive actions by\nthe Fed, including purchasing large volumes of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and conducting operations in the repo market. While these actions were able to re-establish\nsmooth functioning in the Treasury market, they did not address the underlying structural issues that\n\n11\n\nFinancial Stability Board (2020).\n\n12\n\nSee Financial Stability Board (2020), p. 19.\n\n13\n\nSee U.S. Department of the Treasury (2020), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (2021), and Brainard\n(2021).\n\n\f11\npropagated the stresses. Several reforms have been suggested, including moving toward centralized\nclearing with less dependency on broker-dealers and better collection of data and increased transparency\naround the positions of participants in the market. 14 The Treasury market is a crucial global financial\nmarket. Improving its structural resiliency needs to be a top priority, and all of the suggested reforms\nneed to be carefully evaluated with some urgency.\n\nMy last recommendation recognizes that while the desire is to maintain separation with macroprudential\ntools focused on financial stability and monetary policy tools focused on fostering macroeconomic\nstability, in a low r-star environment and with limited macroprudential tools, it behooves monetary\npolicymakers to consider the financial stability implications of its monetary policy settings. In January\n2020, as part of its monetary policy framework review, the FOMC discussed how financial stability\nconsiderations should be incorporated into the conduct of monetary policy, with policymakers generally\nagreeing that supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools should be the primary means to address\nfinancial stability risks. 15 I do not disagree, but I would like to see financial stability considerations\nexplicitly incorporated into the monetary policy framework, with an acknowledgment that\nnonconventional monetary policy has the potential to increase the risks to financial stability by spurring\nsearch-for-yield behavior, eroding lending standards, and increasing leverage. I do not see financial\nstability as a separate goal for monetary policy. But monetary policymakers need to be clear-eyed that the\nactions they take to achieve monetary policy goals, while most often complementary to fostering financial\nstability, can at times contribute to financial stability risks that could jeopardize the achievement of\nmonetary policy goals over time. Macroprudential and microprudential tools should be the first line of\ndefense against building financial stability risks. However, if these prove inadequate, monetary\npolicymakers should follow a risk-management approach and be open to the possibility of adjusting their\n\n14\n\nSee Duffie (2020), Brainard (2021), and Treasury Market Practices Group (2019).\n\n15\n\nSee FOMC (2020).\n\n\f12\nmonetary policy settings in light of financial stability risk because this might be the best way to foster\nsustainable attainment of their monetary policy goals over time.\n\nPolicymakers need to consider the intertemporal tradeoffs. For example, in an economy near its monetary\npolicy goals, should financial vulnerability be sufficiently high and not able to be addressed with\nmacroprudential policy, policymakers may want to dial back monetary accommodation. This would\nlikely mean it would take somewhat longer to fully achieve the monetary policy goals, but the benefit\nwould be to lower the risks of a future period of financial instability that could harm macroeconomic\nstability in the future. In contrast, in an economy that is far from its monetary policy goals, policymakers\nshould be more cautious in tightening monetary policy on financial stability grounds because the\nlikelihood that financial imbalances would rise to problematic levels in such an environment is low and\nthe current macroeconomic costs would likely outweigh the potential gains to future macroeconomic\nstability.\n\nFollowing this approach suggests that forward guidance on the future path of monetary policy, including\nthe policy rate and asset-purchase programs, should explicitly include escape clauses for financial\nstability risks, similar to those that have been used by the Bank of England. 16 The evolution of financial\nstability risks is uncertain, and these escape clauses allow policymakers to deviate from their forward\nguidance if financial vulnerability and risks become sufficiently elevated. Escape clauses have a cost: by\nincreasing flexibility, they undermine the commitment value of the forward guidance and thus can lower\nits effectiveness. But escape clauses also have some benefits: they allow forward guidance to include\nlonger-run commitments and they preserve the credibility of policymakers who may find themselves\n\nIn August 2013, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee initiated forward guidance that it would hold\ninterest rates low and consider additional asset purchases at least until the unemployment rate had fallen to 7\npercent. But it also said that a condition that would vacate this guidance would be if the Bank of England’s\nFinancial Policy Committee found that the stance of monetary policy was threatening financial stability in a way that\ncouldn’t be contained by the available macroprudential tools. Kohn (2014) discusses this example. Also, see Bank\nof England (2013).\n16\n\n\f13\nhaving to adjust policy before the conditions in the forward guidance are met. Maintaining the credibility\nof this policy tool will permit it to be effectively used in the future. In my view, the benefits of escape\nclauses for forward guidance outweigh the cost, and I would like to see them used routinely when\nmonetary policymakers issue forward guidance.\n\nWhen to trigger the escape clause will depend on the conditions in the economy and financial system. It\nwill involve some judgment, but a decision to trigger should be tied to policymakers’ analysis of financial\nstability vulnerabilities and risks, which is communicated to the public on a regular basis. This regular\ncommunication should not be too difficult. In the U.S., this analysis already forms an important part of\nmonetary policy discussions, as indicated in the minutes of FOMC meetings. In addition, the Board of\nGovernors, which constitutes part of the FOMC, now releases a biannual financial stability report, which\ndiscusses the framework and their assessment. 17 Because some of the tools used to build the resiliency of\nthe financial system are beyond the purview of the FOMC, monetary policymakers will need to develop a\ngood understanding of actions being considered by other financial regulators in evaluating financial\nvulnerabilities and make a decision on whether to trigger the escape clause. In the U.S. we are still a\ndistance away from developing a clear strategy about the circumstances under which monetary policy\nwould be used to combat financial vulnerabilities, but I believe developing a set of principles to guide\nthese decisions would be a useful addition to our monetary policy deliberations in a low-interest-rate\nworld.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, maintaining and enhancing the resiliency of the global financial system has clear benefits. It\nsupports the attainment of our macroeconomic goals over time, and it allows monetary policymakers to\nfully use their policy tools. After the global financial crisis, steps were taken to shore up the resiliency of\n\n17\n\nSee Board of Governors (2021).\n\n\f14\nthe commercial banking system. Today, systemically important banking institutions have higher capital\nand liquidity buffers and better risk-management systems, and the banking system was able to lend\nimportant support to households and businesses throughout the pandemic. However, we cannot take this\nresiliency for granted. The resiliency of the banking system needs to be reassessed in light of the lowinterest-rate environment. In addition, the pandemic uncovered vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial\nsector, in short-term money markets, and in the U.S. Treasury market that need to be addressed. Changes\nin the economy will necessitate the use of nonconventional policy tools more often than in the past. So\nenhancing our ability to monitor risks to financial stability, including those that may be heightened by our\nmonetary policy settings, will remain of key importance for monetary policymakers. I am hopeful that\nconferences like this one will encourage researchers to further develop models and perform empirical\nstudies that enhance our knowledge of the interactions between monetary policy and financial instability.\nThis work has taken on even more urgency in a time of very low equilibrium interest rates.\n\n\f15\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Dan Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Annual Review of\nFinancial Economics 7 (December 2015), pp. 357-395.\n(https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-financial-111914-042008)\nBank of England, “Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, 31 July and 1 August, 2013,”\nAugust 14, 2013.\n(https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/minutes/2013/minutes-august-2013.pdf)\nBoard of Governors, Financial Stability Report (May 2021).\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20210506.pdf)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Regulatory Capital Rules: The Federal Reserve\nBoard’s Framework for Implementing the U.S. Basel III Countercyclical Capital Buffer,” Federal\nRegister, Federal Reserve System 12 CFR Part 217, Appendix A, Docket No. R-1529; RIN 7100 AE-43,\nSeptember 8, 2016.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20160908b1.pdf)\nBrainard, Lael, “Some Preliminary Financial Stability Lessons from the COVID-19 Shock,” remarks at\nthe 2021 Annual Washington Conference, Institute of International Bankers, March 1, 2021.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210301a.htm)\nDuffie, Darrell, “Still the World’s Safe Haven?

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Boston Economic Club\nBoston, MA\n(via videoconference)\nMay 5, 2021\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Juhi Dhawan for the invitation to speak with the Boston Economic Club today and to share my\nthoughts on the economy and monetary policy. Of course, those thoughts will be my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes! The pandemic has made the past year an incredibly challenging one for\nso many in the U.S. and across the world. In the U.S., the economic effects have fallen disproportionately\non those segments of the population whose economic situations make them the most vulnerable: lowincome workers, minority workers, and women and working mothers. Many households and businesses\ncontinue to struggle. But with the positive developments on the virus front, including widespread\ndeployment of COVID vaccinations throughout the U.S., with continued support from fiscal and\nmonetary policy, and with the remarkable adaptability and resiliency that households and businesses have\nshown throughout the pandemic, an economic recovery is now clearly underway. The tone of my talk\ntoday will be decidedly different from what you would have heard a year ago. While risks remain, the\noutlook is bright.\n\nBefore the pandemic hit early last year, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. The unemployment\nrate was at a historically low level, employment growth was strong, participation in the labor force was\nsolid, and inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. But once the pandemic hit, all that\nchanged very quickly. Much of the economy shut down swiftly for public health reasons. Economic\nactivity and employment plummeted, the unemployment rate soared, and prices fell. Real growth fell at\nan annual rate of over 30 percent in the second quarter of last year. In just two months, March and April\n2020, the economy lost over 22 million jobs, about the same number it had added over the previous 11year expansion. The unemployment rate soared to nearly 15 percent in April of last year, and inflation\n\n\f2\nfell to under 1/2 percent.\n\nWhile the shutdown was swift, a broad-based recovery is taking more time to achieve. As the public\nhealth statistics began to improve in early summer of last year, many parts of the country began to relax\nsome of their stay-at-home restrictions, and the economy entered what I call a reopening phase. There\nwere sharp rebounds in activity and hiring in those parts of the economy that did not involve close\nphysical contact. Real output growth rebounded to over 30 percent in the third quarter of last year, and\nfirms added over 7 million payroll jobs last May and June.\n\nAfter that initial rebound, the economy entered what I call a pre-vaccination recovery, in which the\ngrowth rate of the economy was slower than in the initial reopening phase and the level of activity varied\nwith the course of the virus. Last fall and winter, as the number of virus cases rose, mandatory and\nvoluntary restrictions were reinstated and weighed on economic activity. Businesses had to handle\ngreater variation in their staffing levels. Increased exposure to the virus meant that more workers had to\nbe quarantined or had to tend to children whose schools were closed due to the rise in cases. When the\nnumber of cases fell again, these restrictions were relaxed and activity picked back up.\n\nEconomic Growth\nSince the start of this year, the vaccination rate has increased, the number of new cases has fallen, and the\npace of the recovery has accelerated. Over 100 million Americans are now fully vaccinated, which is\nover 40 percent of adults. The international virus situation makes it clear that the virus still poses a risk to\nthe outlook and that widespread vaccinations are the key to returning to more normal economic and social\nactivity. I am anticipating that efforts to increase the distribution of vaccinations will continue over the\nnext several months and the U.S. economy will enter what I call the post-vaccination phase of the\nrecovery in the third quarter of this year. In this phase, the recovery will broaden over time as those\nsectors that involve high physical contact see increases in activity.\n\n\f3\n\nAt present, there is still considerable variation across sectors. Manufacturing activity is approaching its\npre-pandemic level. Housing, supported by low mortgage rates and strong demand from households\nreassessing their living situations, has surpassed its pre-pandemic level of activity. On the other hand, the\ncommercial real estate sector, in particular, the retail and office segments, continues to struggle given the\nuncertainties over the future of working arrangements and shopping preferences.\n\nConsumer spending has risen robustly this year, partly reflecting pent-up demand. Spending has been\nbuoyed over the course of the recovery by significant federal fiscal support in the form of extended\nunemployment insurance benefits and economic impact payments. In real terms, the level of consumer\nspending on goods is about 16 percent higher than it was before the pandemic, while that on services is\nstill about 5 percent below. This isn’t surprising, since many things classified as services involve high\nphysical contact. Hard-hit sectors in the economy like hospitality and leisure remain weak but they have\nrecently shown improvement. Looking forward, surveys conducted by Cleveland Fed staff indicate that\nmany higher-income consumers expect to increase their spending on high-contact services that they have\navoided over the last year. 1 In addition, many households have accumulated savings, which will support\nadditional spending this year.\n\nStrong consumer and government spending contributed to real output growth of 6 percent at an annual\npace in the first quarter of the year. The level of real GDP is nearly back to where it was at the end of\n2019, prior to the pandemic. With many people in a position to fulfill their pent-up demand, I expect\ngrowth this year to be in the 6 to 7 percent range, the strongest pace since the early 1980s.\n\n1\n\nEdward S.

The March employment report was\nvery strong. Firms added over 900,000 jobs to their payrolls and the unemployment rate fell to 6 percent.\nIn assessing the health of the overall labor market, it is important to look at levels, not just changes.\nEmployment remains about 8-1/2 million jobs below its level last February and the unemployment rate is\n2.5 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level. In addition, there is considerable unevenness across\ndifferent groups. While employment of high-wage workers is basically back to its pre-pandemic level,\nemployment of low-wage workers is still down almost 30 percent. And while employment in the\nprofessional and business services sector is about 5 percent lower than it was at the start of last year,\nemployment in the high-contact leisure and hospitality sector is down by more than 30 percent. The labor\nforce participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio have improved over the recovery, but they\nalso remain considerably below their pre-pandemic levels. So further progress and broader progress need\nto be made before we are back to the generally strong labor market conditions we had before the\npandemic hit.\n\nLabor supply is one of the confounding aspects of this recovery. As the employment data show, firms\nhave been able to increase their hiring. But we are receiving widespread reports from business contacts\nacross sectors that they are having a hard time finding the workers they need. The question is why, given\nthat the unemployment rate is still so high and a number of indicators point to continued slack in the labor\nmarket. I believe the answer reflects the unusual nature of the pandemic shock that hit the economy. It is\nlikely that some people with the financial means to do so have been cautious about returning to the\nworkforce because of concerns for their health in the midst of the pandemic. Some others have had to\nwithdraw from the workforce to take care of loved ones afflicted by the virus or to tend to children when\nchildcare facilities closed and schools shifted to on-line teaching. Childcare responsibilities fall\ndisproportionately on women and their labor force participation rates fell more sharply during the\n\n\f5\npandemic than those of men. The fiscal support likely meant that more people had the financial cushion\nto remain out of the workforce for these or other reasons. That support may also have shifted some\nbargaining power over wages to workers after decades of decline. Although the aggregate statistics do\nnot show much acceleration in wages, our contacts say that they are beginning to respond to labor\nshortages by increasing their wage offers and by considering candidates they may have previously passed\nover because of minor criminal offenses or other reasons.\n\nAs the public health situation continues to improve over the course of the year, I expect that the factors\nweighing on labor supply will diminish and that there will be strong job gains, with the unemployment\nrate falling to 4.5 percent or less by the end of the year.\n\nInflation\nSupply constraints are affecting product markets, too. While demand can increase quickly, it takes longer\nto increase production to meet that demand, especially given the length of this pandemic. Manufacturers\nand builders report that supply-chain challenges have intensified and are proving to be more persistent\nthan they originally anticipated. Builders face longer lead times to secure various materials, including\nlumber and steel, and more suppliers are rationing basic materials and parts to their customers. These\nsupply-chain issues are a headwind to production and are leading to significant increases in the prices of\nmany materials and components. Many of our contacts say that they have been able to pass on at least\nsome of their cost increases to their customers in the form of higher prices – which brings me to inflation.\n\nIn March, the year-over-year measures of PCE inflation and core PCE inflation moved up to 2.3 percent\nand 1.8 percent, respectively. I expect that consumer price inflation readings will be significantly higher\nin the next couple of months. An important reason is simply that the very low readings from last year will\nfall out of the calculations. Higher energy prices and higher prices of some goods and commodities due\nto bottlenecks and supply-chain disruptions will also contribute to higher inflation readings, and I expect\n\n\f6\ninflation for the year will be over 2 percent. After that, my baseline outlook is that inflation will move\nback down next year and then gradually rise above 2 percent the following year, as supply constraints\nease, monetary policy remains accommodative, and the factors that have held back inflation for so long,\nincluding digitalization, globalization, and the relatively weak relationship between economic slack and\ninflation, reassert themselves.\n\nBecause both demand factors and supply factors are affecting inflation readings, there is added\nuncertainty to my outlook for inflation and there are some upside risks to my forecast, something that has\nnot been true for some time. The anecdotal evidence suggesting that the supply-chain disruptions could\nlast longer than expected, that firms may have some pricing power, and that workers may have some\nbargaining power over wages all point to upward pressures on prices. But these factors would not be\nexpected to lead to sustained higher levels of inflation unless they changed the pricing process by\nincreasing inflation expectations, which would affect the economic decisions of households and\nbusinesses and support higher actual inflation. Given that inflation has run low for so long, some increase\nin inflation expectations and actual inflation would be a welcome development.\n\nMonetary Policy\nMy positive baseline outlook depends on appropriate monetary policy, which, in my view, will need to be\nvery accommodative for some time to support the broadening of the recovery. The Federal Reserve\nresponded swiftly when the severity of the pandemic became apparent. We took actions to restore the\nsmooth functioning of the financial markets, to ensure credit could flow to households and businesses,\nand to increase monetary accommodation in support of the recovery and return to our monetary policy\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nAt our meeting last week, the FOMC maintained the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.\nWe indicated that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain that range until labor market conditions\n\n\f7\nhave reached levels consistent with our assessments of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to\n2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also indicated that\nwe will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of\nagency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month. And we expect to continue doing so\nuntil substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability\ngoals.\n\nThe forward guidance in our policy statement is entirely consistent with our revised monetary policy\nstrategy, which was summarized in a statement we released last August and that we reaffirmed in\nJanuary. 2 The revised strategy has implications for how we will conduct monetary policy in pursuit of\nour goals. For inflation, we will aim for inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time after it\nhas run persistently below 2 percent, so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and inflation\nexpectations are anchored at levels consistent with 2 percent. For employment, in the absence of\ninflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, we will not react to strong labor market indicators.\nThe revisions to our strategy mean that for a given set of economic conditions, the FOMC will likely set a\nmore accommodative monetary policy than we would have in the past. This does not mean that our\nstrategy will entail more risk than in the past. Pursuit of our goals will still drive our policy decisions,\nand the new strategy is designed to be more effective given changes to the underlying structure of the\neconomy. In particular, the general level of interest rates is lower than in the past and inflation dynamics\nhave changed so that economic slack plays less of a role and inflation expectations play more of a role in\n\n2\n\nSee FOMC Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf).\nFor more information on the new strategy, see Loretta J. Mester, “The Federal Reserve’s New Monetary Policy\nStrategy,” 6 th Annual Monetary and Financial Policy Conference, Money Macro and Finance Society, London, U.K.\n(via videoconference), October 21, 2020 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp20201021-federal-reserves-new-monetary-policy-strategy.aspx).\nThe revised strategy summarizes the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary policy framework,\nincluding strategy, tools, and communications (see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-ofmonetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm).\n\n\f8\ndetermining inflation outcomes.\n\nThe FOMC is committed to our new strategy and will be following through on the guidance\ncommunicated in our FOMC statement. While it may take some time for supply disruptions to abate, the\nforces that have weighed on inflation are still with us, we have undershot our inflation goal for a while,\nand we are aiming for inflation to move moderately above 2 percent for some time. I wouldn’t consider\nthe increase in inflation I expect this year to be the type of sustainable increase needed to meet the\nforward guidance on our policy rate. So I expect to be deliberately patient unless there is clear evidence\nthat inflation pressures will push inflation to exceed our desired path.\n\nThe asset purchase forward guidance, which we added to the FOMC statement last December, indicates\nthat we need to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we begin to taper the pace of\npurchases. In thinking about progress in the labor market, one approach is to look at indices of labor\nmarket conditions that summarize a large number of indicators, such as those published by the Kansas\nCity Fed. 3 Another approach is to use a technique similar to the spider chart published by the Atlanta\nFed, gauging progress against appropriate benchmarks. 4 Let’s consider how far the labor market has\ntraveled back from the dire conditions of April 2020 to the generally strong pre-pandemic conditions of\nFebruary 2020. Many labor market conditions are useful for tracking the health of the labor market, but\nlet’s look at four: payroll employment, the unemployment rate, the employment-to-population ratio, and\nthe labor force participation rate for people ages 25 to 54. (That latter indicator is often called the primeage participation rate, but I’m not in that statistic and I consider myself still in my prime!)\n\n3\n\nSee the Kansas City Fed Labor Market Conditions Indicators at https://www.kansascityfed.org/data-andtrends/labor-market-conditions-indicators/.\n4\n\nSee the Atlanta Fed Labor Market Distributions Spider Chart at https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/labor-marketdistributions.aspx.\n\n\f9\nConsider employment. Between April and December of last year, when we issued our forward guidance,\nemployment had traveled 55 percent of the way back to its pre-pandemic level. Since December, it has\nmade a bit more progress and is now 62 percent of the way back. The unemployment rate peaked at 14.8\npercent last April. By December, it had fallen to 6.7 percent and was 72 percent of the way back to its\npre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent. As of now, it is 78 percent back. The employment-to-population ratio\nwas 62 percent back as of December, and now it is 66 percent back. And prime-age labor force\nparticipation was 39 percent back in December and is now 48 percent back. These indicators clearly\nshow that things are moving in the right direction and progress has been made since December. But I\nneed to see more improvement before I would consider the conditions of our forward guidance on asset\npurchases as being met.\n\nOf course, there are several caveats to this type of analysis. First, the labor market conditions in February\n2020 were strong along many dimensions, and it is not clear that we should expect every indicator to\nmake it back to the levels we saw then. For example, the longer-run trend in the participation rate is\ndrifting down, reflecting demographics. Moreover, retirement rates increased significantly during the\npandemic, and in the past, people who left the workforce through retirement generally didn’t return.\nThat’s one reason to look at the so-called prime-age participation rate rather than the participation rate of\nthose age 16 and above. Second, while labor markets were generally strong last February, further\nprogress would have been made in some dimensions had the pandemic not hit. For example, the\ndifference in the unemployment rates of Blacks and Hispanics compared to that of whites continued to\nnarrow as the previous expansion progressed; those gaps may have closed further had the expansion\ncontinued. Even if we use February 2020 as the benchmark, the unemployment rates for Blacks and\nHispanics have made less progress than that of whites. 5 Third, there is a large group of indicators, and the\n\n5\n\nFrom their peaks in April 2020, the unemployment rates for Blacks, Hispanics, and whites have traveled 66\npercent, 76 percent, and 78 percent, respectively, of the way back to their February 2020 levels.\n\n\f10\nrates of progress will vary across them. So the judgment of the FOMC rather than a mathematical\nformula will be needed to assess the health of the labor market and its progress.\n\nI note that even after the FOMC decides that the conditions for tapering have been met, we will still be\npurchasing assets and monetary policy will remain highly accommodative. I expect it will appropriate to\nmaintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for some time as we make our way back to\nmaximum employment and price stability. Since highly accommodative monetary policy can engender a\nsearch for yield and other investment behaviors that can exacerbate financial stability risks, and since a\nstable financial system plays a key role in supporting the achievement of our monetary policy goals, I am\nattuned to risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system. Currently, valuations in equity and residential\nreal estate markets are elevated, reflecting investors’ high appetite for risk, low interest rates, and positive\nprospects for the economy. Changes in risk appetite could bring volatility. Volatility isn’t concerning in\nand of itself, but if accompanied by high levels of leverage, it can elevate financial stability risks. For\nnow, I see financial stability risks and vulnerabilities as moderate. They are less concerning to the extent\nthat we have a resilient financial system.\n\nAfter the last financial crisis in which banks were front and center, steps were taken to shore up the\nresiliency of the commercial banking system through higher capital levels, liquidity requirements, and\nstress testing. These steps paid off because banks were in a strong enough position going into the\npandemic to play an important role, with support from their regulators, in ensuring that credit flowed to\nhouseholds and small businesses. The pandemic revealed some structural issues in the Treasury market\nand in money market mutual funds, and the Fed needed to take actions to reestablish smooth functioning.\nMore recent developments suggest that limited transparency around the risk exposures of hedge funds,\nfamily offices, and other leveraged financial entities could pose risks to financial stability. Just as was\ndone with the banking system after the global financial crisis, addressing fragilities in the Treasury market\nand the nonbank financial sector should be a top priority in raising the resiliency of the overall financial\n\n\f11\nsystem. If we’ve learned one thing during the pandemic, it is that things can evolve in a materially\ndifferent way than expected and it is better to be prepared for whatever comes our way.\n\n\f"

            "content": "The Cycle of Disparities in Economic Outcomes and Opportunities\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSwarthmore College\nSwarthmore, PA\n(via videoconference)\nApril 15, 2021\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Professor Marc Remer for inviting me to speak today as part of Swarthmore College’s lecture\nseries. I had the pleasure of serving as an outside honors examiner in economics at Swarthmore about 20\nyears ago. I was really impressed with the rigor of the program and the knowledge and engagement of the\nstudents I met. So in thinking about a topic for today’s talk, I have chosen to discuss a challenge that will\nrequire multi-faceted solutions from the great minds of those being trained at Swarthmore, as well as\nother individuals, communities, governments, businesses, and institutions. That challenge is the cycle of\ndisparities in economic opportunities that afflict our economy and limit economic inclusion.\n\nThe pandemic has shined a bright light on differences in economic outcomes, but these differences\nexisted long before we had heard of COVID-19. Many stem from the fact that the U.S. economy does not\noffer the same economic opportunities to all. There are racial disparities in educational attainment, labor\nmarket outcomes, and access to credit. People born into areas of concentrated poverty or predominantly\nminority areas are disadvantaged over their entire lifetimes, and so are their children. These disparities\nare interrelated, reinforce one another, and have been propagated across generations. In today’s lecture, I\nwill begin by explaining why I think it is important for Fed policymakers to understand the disparities in\nour economy and then I will walk through a set of figures that clearly illustrate these disparities to give\nyou a sense of the magnitudes. Before continuing, let me mention that, as always, the views I will present\nare my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nUnderstanding Economic Disparities Is Important for Assessing the Health of the Economy\n\nI believe that economic opportunity and inclusion are important to the Federal Reserve System’s mission\nof promoting a healthy economy and a stable financial system in the United States on behalf of the public.\nCongress has given the Fed several responsibilities, including setting monetary policy to achieve\nmaximum employment and price stability, fostering financial stability and a safe and efficient payments\n\n\f2\nsystem, regulating and supervising parts of the financial system, and promoting consumer protection and\ncommunity development. I believe that the Fed should focus on the responsibilities that Congress has\ngiven us. Staying within the boundaries of our assigned responsibilities respects the fact that Fed officials\nare not elected officials, unlike members of Congress or the executive branch. Staying focused on our\nresponsibilities also helps to maintain the Fed’s independence to make monetary policy decisions in\npursuit of our statutory goals, insulated from short-term political pressures. It is important to preserve\nthis independence because a body of research has shown that when central banks formulate monetary\npolicy free from political considerations and are held accountable for their decisions, better economic\noutcomes result. The Fed is held accountable when it regularly communicates the rationale for its\ndecisions in testimony before Congress, and in policy statements, meeting minutes, reports, and speeches.\n\nTo be able to meet our responsibilities, it is important for the Fed to understand the economic\nenvironment in which we are setting our monetary, regulatory, and payments policy. Understanding\ndifferences across demographic groups, industries, and areas of the country helps us to assess the strength\nof the economy, determine what policy is appropriate, identify the consequences of our policy actions,\nand assess whether the policy actions are achieving their goals. In some cases, the connection between\nour analysis and our responsibilities is obvious. For example, the Fed is responsible for enforcing the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to serve their entire community and ensure equitable\naccess to credit, in particular for underserved low- and moderate-income areas and individuals. It would\nbe impossible to assess whether a depository institution was complying with the Community\nReinvestment Act without understanding the credit conditions that exist in the low- and moderate-income\nareas it serves. Similarly, the Fed’s broader role in identifying effective community development policies\nand access to credit depends on understanding the challenges faced by people in these neighborhoods.\n\nIn other cases, the connection between our analysis and our policy responsibilities can be more subtle.\nWhile monetary policy is too blunt a tool to be used to close existing gaps in economic outcomes and\n\n\f3\nopportunities across different demographic groups, it does have a positive role to play. By promoting\nmaximum employment and price stability, monetary policy encourages longer expansions, which makes\nthe economy stronger for all, including those individuals and communities that are least able to withstand\neconomic downturns. Even though the effects of monetary policy are indirect, analyzing the size and\nsource of gaps gives us insight into the distributional effects of our policy actions. Understanding the\ngaps in labor market conditions is directly relevant to our assessment of labor market slack and how close\nwe are to reaching maximum employment, one of our statutory goals, which we view in a broad and\ninclusive way. Assessing economic opportunity gaps also informs our outlook for the economy over the\nlonger run. It helps us evaluate the overall strength of the aggregate economy and its ability to live up to\nits full potential. Persistent gaps in economic opportunity can lead to a lower longer-run growth rate for\nthe economy by limiting labor force participation and educational attainment levels, which affect\nproductivity growth. Longer-run economic growth is a determinant of the long-run equilibrium interest\nrate, an important factor to consider in setting monetary policy. So knowledge about the forces affecting\npeople’s ability to fully participate in the labor market, to gain the skills necessary to create new ideas and\ntechnologies, and to use those technologies effectively gives Fed policymakers insights into structural\naspects of the economy that are relevant to setting appropriate monetary policy, even though our policy\nactions cannot directly affect these structural factors.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed has established a Program on Economic Inclusion to conduct research and provide\ndata on economic disparities, their causes, implications, and solutions. 1 I invite you to explore this work\non our website. Because understanding disparities in economic outcomes and opportunities is important\nfor assessing the economy, I would like to spend the rest of my time today first focusing on some of the\ndisparities that grew during the pandemic and then turning to long-standing disparities.\n\n1\n\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Program on Economic Inclusion, at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/about-us/diversity-and-inclusion/program-on-economic-inclusion/about.aspx.\n\n\f4\n\nDisparities in the Economic Effects of the Pandemic\nWhile the economy is still far from our policy goals of maximum employment and price stability,\nprogress is being made and the economic outlook is brightening. Sizable support from fiscal and\nmonetary policy, vaccination deployment, and the resiliency shown by households and businesses, all\npoint to a pickup in activity in the second half of this year and for continued progress, albeit uneven\nprogress, as some sectors recover faster than others.\n\nIt probably is not surprising that the recovery has been uneven across business sectors, geographic areas\nof the country, and demographic groups, because the effects of the pandemic have not been evenly\ndistributed either. Negative effects have been borne by many of the most vulnerable in our economy:\nlower-income and minority workers and communities; those who do not have the opportunity to work\nfrom home; those who don’t have access to reliable telecommunications and internet services or to\nadequate healthcare; and the smallest of small businesses. A Fed survey released last September showed\nthat during the early stage of the pandemic, between March and July of last year, a larger percentage of\nlow-income workers, less-educated workers, and Black and Hispanic workers were laid off compared to\nhigher-income, more educated, and white workers.2,3 Other data show that from February to April of last\nyear, the number of active small business owners dropped by 3.3 million, a record 22 percent decline. 4\n\nIn these remarks, I will use the term “race” to refer to race and ethnicity, and “Hispanic” to refer to Hispanic and\nLatinx.\n2\n\n3\n\nResults from the Board of Governors’ survey on the economic well-being of households (Table 1, p. 3 of Board of\nGovernors, September 2020) show that between March 2020 and July 2020, 28 percent of workers in families\nmaking less than $40,000 a year were laid off (including being told not to work any hours), considerably higher than\nthe 13 percent of workers from families with incomes over $100,000 a year. Furthermore, a quarter of workers in\nlow-income families who experienced a layoff reported that they had returned to work for the same employer, while\nnearly 40 percent of high-income workers did so. Twenty-three percent of workers with a high school diploma or\nless were laid off between March and July, compared to 13 percent of workers with a college degree or more, and 22\npercent of Black workers and 23 percent of Hispanic workers were laid off compared to 18 percent of white\nworkers.\n4\n\nSee Fairlie (2020). Researchers at the New York Fed point to a number of contributing facto rs, including these\nfirms’ weaker financial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and funding gaps that existed prior to the pandemic,\nplus less access to federal relief funds. See Mills and Battisto (2020).\n\n\f5\nCompared to small firms overall, Black-owned businesses were twice as likely to close and Hispanicowned businesses were one-and-a-half times as likely to close. These closures can have an outsized\neffect on low- and moderate-income communities, which were already disadvantaged before the\npandemic.\n\n[Figure 1. Recovery in jobs by wage level and prime-age labor force participation rate by gender]\nAs the economy has begun to recover, rehiring by employers has been considerably slower for low-wage\nworkers than for high-wage workers. In these data, seen in the left panel of the figure, high-wage workers\nare those making above $29 per hour, which is the top quartile of the wage distribution, and low-wage\nworkers are those making below $13 per hour, which is the bottom quartile of the wage distribution.\nEmployment of high-wage workers is basically back to its pre-pandemic level, but employment of lowwage workers is still down almost 30 percent.\n\nAs seen in the right panel, among workers in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, the labor force\nparticipation rates of both men and women fell when the economy shut down last year, and the net\ndecline for women has been larger than that for men throughout the pandemic. This partly reflects the\nlarger share of women working in industries hit hardest by the pandemic and the fact that women bore\nmore of the brunt of having to provide childcare for pre-school children or those being schooled remotely.\n\n[Figure 2. Change in unemployment by race and education] Disparities in the initial impact of the\npandemic and in the recovery can also be seen in the unemployment rates of various demographic groups.\nAll groups’ unemployment rates shot up last spring and have fallen since then, but, as of March of this\nyear, there has been less progress for nonwhites and for those without a college education. Relative to\ntheir pre-pandemic levels, the unemployment rates of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians remain higher than\n\n\f6\nthat of whites, and the unemployment rate of high school graduates without any college is higher than that\nof college graduates. 5\n\n[Figure 3. Recovery in jobs by sector] Some of these differences in labor market outcomes reflect\ndifferences in the distribution of the types of jobs across demographic groups. The drop in employment\nin leisure and hospitality was severe and the recovery in that sector has been slow, with the number of\njobs down more than 30 percent compared to before the pandemic. In contrast, education and health\nservices; trade, transportation, and utilities; and professional and business services saw smaller declines\nand have made up more ground over the recovery.\n\nBut even before COVID-19, there were already long-standing economic disparities that need to be\nexamined to better understand the overall health of the U.S. economy.\n\nUpward Mobility\n[Figure 4. Upward mobility] All parents want to know that their children will be better off financially\nthan they are. But upward mobility – the probability that a child will be better off economically than his\nor her parents – has fallen sharply in the U.S. since World War II. Research by Raj Chetty and his coauthors found that around 90 percent of children born in 1940 earned more at age 30 than their parents\ndid. By the mid-1980s, only about 50 percent did. 6,7 Although not shown in the figure, the largest\ndeclines have been in the middle class.\n\n5\n\nThe net increase in the unemployment rate between February 2020 and March 2021 was 3.6 percentage points for\nBlacks, 3.5 percentage points for Hispanics, 3.6 percentage points for Asians, 2.4 percentage points for whites, 3.2\npercentage points for those with a high school diploma without any college, a nd 1.8 percentage points for those with\na bachelor’s degree or higher.\n6\n\nChetty and Williams (2019).\n\n7\n\nChetty, et al. (2017).\n\n\f7\n[Figure 5. Income inequality] Rising income inequality has contributed to this decline. Since the 1960s,\nthe median level of income, adjusted for inflation, has risen over time, from about $48,000 in 1967 to\nabout $69,000 in 2019. But those in the top 10 percent of the income distribution have enjoyed sharper\ngains than those in the bottom 10 percent. The U.S. has one of the lowest rates of intergenerational\nmobility among advanced economies and more pronounced income inequality. 8\n\n[Figure 6. Map of intergenerational mobility: U.S.] Using disaggregated data, Chetty and his coauthors show that upward mobility depends not only on the family’s characteristics but also on\nneighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, racial integration, the quality of schools, and\naccess to social services. 9 On this map, areas of relatively high intergenerational mobility are shown in\nshades of blue-green. 10 Children who grew up in these places earn higher average incomes in their midthirties than their parents did at the same age. Shades of red indicate areas of low intergenerational\nmobility: places where children have not progressed very far in terms of income relative to their parents.\nAn important insight from the research is that even areas with fairly good economies in terms of stronger\noutput growth and job growth, like some places in the South, have not necessarily produced high levels of\nupward mobility for the children growing up there. Strong economic factors certainly help, but they are\nnot a panacea.\n\n[Figure 7. Map of intergenerational mobility: Philadelphia] Here, I’m showing you the map for\nPhiladelphia. (I have circled Swarthmore in pink.) If you were to drill down even further, you would see\ndifferences even within neighborhoods. In fact, research shows that moving a child from a low-mobility\n\n8\n\nCorak (2013).\n\n9\n\nSee Chetty and Hendren (2018), Chetty, et al. (2018, revised 2020), and Chetty and Williams (2019).\n\n10\n\nMaps showing income mobility at the zip code level for different levels of income, race, and gender are available\nat https://www.OpportunityAtlas.org, a collaboration between the U.S. Census Bureau and Opportunity Insights.\nThe map shown here is based on the average income at age 35 of a child whose parents earned in the 25 th percentile\nof the income distribution, in other words, in low-income families.\n\n\f8\nneighborhood to a high-mobility neighborhood can have profound effects on his or her future economic\noutcomes. 11,12\n\nIn addition to place, race also matters. Even among those whose parents were at the same income level\nand who grew up in the same neighborhood, there is a gap in earnings between Black males and white\nmales. 13\n\n[Figure 8. Mobility by race] And there are adverse dynamics as well. The research by Chetty and his\nco-authors shows that even controlling for where a child grows up, Blacks have a significantly lower\nchance of moving up in the income distribution than whites or Hispanics and a higher chance of moving\ndown in the distribution. The left panel of bars in this chart shows the percentage of children born to lowincome parents who become high income, by race – that is, what we have been calling upward mobility.\nThe middle panel shows downward mobility – the percentage of children born to high-income parents\nwho become low income. And the right panel shows the percentage of children born to high-income\nparents who remain high income. Strikingly, Blacks who have been born to high-income parents are\nalmost as likely to move down to the lowest income quintile as to stay in the highest one.\n\nGaps in Income and Net Worth\n[Figure 9. Income and net worth by race] According to the 2019 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer\nFinances, median income for white households was about 1-3/4 times that of Black families and Hispanic\n\n11\n\nThe effect is found for children who move by the age of 13; it does not apply to adults. Each year of exposure to a\nbetter neighborhood has a greater benefit for the child. See Chetty, et al. (2018, revised 2020) and Chetty and\nHendren (2018).\n12\n\nThis is true not only in the U.S., but also in countries like Australia, where income inequality is lower than it is\nhere. Deutscher (2020) finds that in Australia , the place where a child grows up, especially in his or her teenage\nyears, has a causal effect on adult outcomes.\n13\n\nControlling for parental income, in adulthood, Black males end up having lower earnings than white males in 99\npercent of Census tracts in the U.S. For those who grew up in neighborhoods of low poverty and higher rent, both\nBlack and white males have better outcomes, but the gap between them is greater than in high poverty areas. The\ngap is smaller when fathers are present and when measures of racial bias are lower. See Chetty, et al. (2020 ).\n\n\f9\nfamilies. 14 These gaps are not a recent phenomenon: they have been around for decades. And because\nearnings gaps accumulate over time, they lead to much larger gaps in family net worth (financial and\nnonfinancial assets, like homes and autos, minus debt), often called the wealth gap. The median net\nworth of white families in 2019 was almost 8 times as high as that of Black families and about 5 times as\nhigh as that of Hispanic families. 15\n\nResearch by Cleveland Fed economists Aliprantis, Carroll, and Young found that the current gap in net\nworth between Blacks and whites can be explained much more by differences in earnings than by\ndifferences in bequests or in the returns to savings a family has earned. 16 Their modeling also shows that\nif the wealth gap were eliminated today, but without addressing the earnings gap, then in 50 years the\nwealth gap would be back to about where it is today. This suggests that closing the earnings gap is the\nkey to closing the wealth gap and that increasing access to high-quality education, which will expand\nlabor market opportunities, could be one of the key drivers of a more inclusive economy.\n\nGaps in Education\nMany factors play a role in these gaps in income and net worth. Black and white children tend to grow up\nin different neighborhoods, and this racial stratification leads to other risks, such as differences in access\nto healthcare and safe housing, which can affect access to quality education and longer-term economic\noutcomes.\n\n14\n\nSee the Federal Reserve System 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) (2020a). In 2019 dollars, the median\nincomes in 2019 for white, Black, and Hispanic families were $69,000, $40,300, and $40,700, respectively. See\nFederal Reserve System (2020a) and Table 1, Bhutta, et al. (2020).\n15\n\nAccording to the SCF data, in 2019 dollars, the median net worths in 2019 of white, Black, and Hispanic families\nwere $188,200, $24,100, and $36,200, respectively. See Federal Reserve System (2020a) and Table 2, Bhutta, et al.\n(2020).\n16\n\nFor further discussion of racial disparities in net worth over time, see Aliprantis, Carroll, and Young (2019).\n\n\f10\n[Figure 10. Digital divide] One difference that was illuminated by the pandemic and that poses a risk to\nlearning is lack of internet connectivity. Well before the coronavirus pandemic, access to the internet was\nan important avenue for education, as well as for healthcare and job access. Usage of broadband at home\nhas been increasing over time for all groups, but it remains comparatively higher for whites, those with\nhigher incomes, and those in urban and suburban areas. 17 Data indicate that Blacks and Hispanics are less\nlikely to have a computer or broadband at home than whites, and when they do have a computer, they are\nless likely to have broadband service at home. 18 Lack of connectivity put Black, Hispanic, and lowerincome families at a particular disadvantage over the last year when remote in-home learning became the\nnorm.\n\n[Figure 11. Math progress] In fact, as seen on the left-hand side of this figure, last spring, when schools\nwere shut down because of the pandemic, students in low-income and middle-income areas completed\nsignificantly fewer math courses online than those in high-income areas. 19 As seen on the right-hand side\nof this figure, this spring, students in middle-income areas have improved, but students in low-income\nareas are still struggling. 20\n\n[Figure 12. Income and wealth by education] These differences could have lasting negative effects.\nThe accumulation of human capital via education is an important path to economic inclusion and\nopportunity, resulting in better economic outcomes not only for individuals and their families, but also for\n\n17\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center survey data, as of February 2021, usage of broadband at home was 80 percent\nof whites, 71 percent of Blacks, and 65 percent of Hispanics; 92 percent for those earning $75,000 or more per year\nand 57 percent for those earning less than $30,000 per year; and 77 percent for those in urban areas, 79 percent for\nthose in suburban areas, and 72 percent for those in rural communities. See Pew Research Center (2021).\n18\n\nEstimates for 2019 from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that about 2 percent of Asian households, 4 percent of\nwhite households, 4 percent of Hispanic households, and 7 percent of Black households do not have a computer at\nhome. About 95 percent of Asian households, 91 percent of white households, 88 percent of Hispanic households,\nand 84 percent of Black households have a computer and broadband at home. See U.S. Census Bureau, American\nCommunity Survey, Subject Table S2802, 2019 1-year estimates. (Note: These estimates on broadband are higher\nthan those from Pew, cited in footnote 17, which pertain to usage.)\n19\n\nSee the Zearn math platform data at Opportunity Insights: Economic Tracker, and Chetty, et al. (2020).\n\n20\n\nHinrichs (2021) summarizes several strands of research on the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on education.\n\n\f11\nthe country at large by raising productivity growth. The median income for families with a college degree\nis about twice as high as that of a family with only a high school diploma. Similarly, median net worth is\nconsiderably higher for those with a college degree. 21\n\n[Figure 13. Educational attainment by race] The U.S. labor force has become more educated over time,\nbut educational attainment differs by race. In 2019, 41 percent of white families had a college degree\ncompared to 26 percent of Black families and 16 percent of Hispanic families. 22\n\nI probably don’t have to tell this audience that cost can be an important barrier to entering college,\nparticularly for those coming from lower-income families. The average cost of tuition and fees at fouryear institutions is now over $16,000 a year, and adjusted for inflation, it has more than doubled over the\npast three decades. 23 According to the Fed’s survey on economic well-being, as of late 2019, over 40\npercent of those who went to college had taken on debt for their education and about half of those people\nstill owe money on this debt, making it harder to access credit for other purchases. 24,25\n\n[Figure 14. College completion rates by race] For those students who do find the financial means to\nenter college, the likelihood of completing a degree differs by type of institution and by race. The\ncompletion rates have remained particularly low at for-profit institutions for all racial groups. At both\npublic and nonprofit private institutions, the graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all\nrisen over time, but those of Blacks remain well below those of these other groups and have shown only a\n\n21\n\nAccording to the 2019 SCF, in 2019, the median income of families whose reference person had a college degree\nwas $95,700 compared with $45,800 for families whose reference person had only a high school diploma. See\nFederal Reserve System (2020a) and Table 1, Bhutta, et al. (2020).\n22\n\nCalculations based on the 2019 SCF data, Federal Reserve System (2020a).\n\n23\n\nSee Digest of Education Statistics.\n\n24\n\nSee pp. 43-46, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (May 2020).\n\n25\n\nNew York Fed analysis shows that compared to borrowers in majority white areas, those in majority Black areas\nhave higher student loan balances and those in majority Black and majority Hispanic areas have higher rates of\ndefault on those loans. See Chakrabarti, Nober, and van der Klaauw (2020).\n\n\f12\nlittle progress over time. 26 The reasons for these differentials are complex. Among other reasons, they\npartly reflect differential access to high-quality education at the pre-college level that prepares the\nstudents for success in college, and they partly reflect the fact that students from lower-income families\nhave more financial responsibilities while attending college that take time away from their studies.\n\nGaps in Labor Markets and Credit Markets\n[Figure 15. Unemployment rates by race] Whatever the cause, the differences in educational attainment\nfollow people as they enter the workforce. Unemployment rates among Blacks and Hispanics have been\nchronically above those of whites and Asians, and Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to lose their jobs\nduring recessions. Some progress was made in closing those gaps over the long previous expansion,\nwhich is good news and points to the value of fostering long-lived expansions. Nonetheless, disparities\nremain. 27\n\n[Figure 16. Homeownership rates by race] Worse and more volatile labor market outcomes make it\nharder for nonwhite households to build assets and achieve sound financial health, limiting their ability to\nfully participate in the economy. For those families that are able to get a mortgage, job insecurity makes\nthe household less financially resilient and raises the risk that the household might fall behind on its\nmortgage or even default, putting the family’s longer-term financial health at risk. Housing continues to\nbe an important way for families to build wealth. As shown by the dotted lines on the left-hand side of\nthis figure, homeownership rates rose a lot last year, but part of those increases may reflect difficulties in\ncollecting data remotely during the pandemic. As shown on the right-hand side of this figure, even with\nlast year’s rise, the gap between the homeownership rate of whites and Blacks and between whites and\n\nSatisfaction with college also varies by race. About 70 percent of white recipients of bachelor’s degrees felt that\ntheir education was worth the cost, but only slightly more than half of Black recipients did. See Figure 28, p. 39, in\nBoard of Governors (May 2020).\n26\n\n27\n\nResearch from Fed economists indicates that lower educational attainment explains much of the difference in the\nunemployment experience of Hispanics but observable characteristics, like education, age, or marital status cannot\nfully account for the higher and more cyclical unemployment of Blacks relative to whites. See Cajner, et al. (2017).\n\n\f13\nHispanics remain large. New York Fed analysis indicates that there are sizable racial gaps even after\ncontrolling for income and other factors related to creditworthiness. 28 This indicates that systemic racial\ndifferences in access to credit have persisted well after enactment of fair housing and lending legislation\nin the 1970s meant to address the scourge of redlining and discrimination in credit markets. 29\n\n[Figure 17. Access to credit by race] As seen on the left-hand side of this figure, in terms of access to\nfinancial services, Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have a bank account and more likely to rely on\nalternative financial services such as money orders and check cashing services than whites. Being\nunbanked or underbanked makes it harder for these families to build a credit history. 30\n\nThe use of bank financing by small businesses also varies significantly with the race of the owner, as seen\non the right-hand side of this figure. According to the Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey, compared to\nsmall firms with white ownership, those with Black ownership were half as likely to have obtained\nfinancing from a bank in the five years before the pandemic, relying more on online lenders, which,\naccording to survey respondents, provide less satisfactory service. 31\n\nMoving Toward Economic Inclusion and a Stronger Economy\nAs I hope you find clear from this summary of some of the data, the disparities that exist in the economy\nare interrelated. Lower-income households have less access to high-quality education, which means less\n\n28\n\nFor documentation and discussion of the racial gaps in homeownership rates, see Haughwout, et al. (2020).\n\n29\n\nSee Choi (2020).\n\n30\n\nSee Table 11, p. 28, in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (May 2020). Unbanked is defined as\nnot having a checking, savings, or money market account. Underbanked is defined as having a checking, savings, or\nmoney market account but having used one of these alternative financial services: money order, check cashing\nservice, pawn shop loan, auto title loan, payday loan, paycheck advance, or tax refund advance.\nAccording to the 2020 report on the Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey of firms with 1 -499 employees, 46\npercent of firms with white ownership, 32 percent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 23 percent of firms with\nBlack ownership had obtained financing from a bank in the past five years; 19 percent of firms with white\nownership, 22 percent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 27 percent of firms with Black ownership had obtained\nfinancing from an online lender in the past five years. See Federal Reserve System (2020b), p. 9.\n31\n\n\f14\naccess to higher-paying jobs and job security, and less access to high-quality housing, which means less\naccess to credit, which means less access to education, and around it goes. And for many people, being\nnonwhite puts them into this cycle of disparities with fewer opportunities to escape because of systemic\nracism.\n\nEliminating racial and economic disparities, which have lasted over generations, is no easy task. One\nplace to start in breaking the cycle is for the country to take steps to increase access to high-quality\neducation and to effective job-skills programs, especially for those who have not had these opportunities\nin the past. Access should also include the necessary support to help students successfully complete these\nprograms. Workforce development is one of the key focus areas of the Federal Reserve’s community\ndevelopment function and is an important component of a healthy labor market. 32\n\nEducation can be transformational, changing the paths of individuals, future generations, and\ncommunities. Improving education levels and ensuring that people are well prepared to enter and remain\nproductive in the modern workforce would lead to higher levels of labor force participation and higher\nproductivity growth, key factors driving higher long-run economic growth and higher standards of living.\nInvestments to increase access to education present a good value proposition to the country – the promise\nof a stronger economy that works for us all.\n\nFor example, Investing in America’s Workforce is a collaborative effort of the Federal Reserve System, the\nHeldrich Center, the Ray Marshall Center, and the Upjohn Institute.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nRemarks for the Session “The Future of Work and Alternative Work Arrangements”\nat the Conference on Uneven Outcomes in the Labor Market:\nUnderstanding Trends and Identifying Solutions\nOrganized by Community Development Staff at the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston,\nCleveland, and Philadelphia and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\n\f1\nI thank the conference organizers for the opportunity to provide opening remarks for today’s session on\nthe future of work and alternative work arrangements, part of the conference on uneven outcomes in the\nlabor market. But more broadly, I also thank the staffs in community development from across the\nSystem – at every Federal Reserve Bank and the Board of Governors – for the enormous body of analysis\nand outreach that you have produced in light of the pandemic. The community development function’s\nefforts have contributed mightily to the Federal Reserve’s understanding of the myriad effects the\npandemic is having on our communities, households, and small businesses. Your work has informed\nFederal Reserve policy decisions and I expect that to continue as we work together to ensure a broadbased, sustainable economic recovery. You were able to bring these essential insights to the discussion\nbecause of the work you have done over many years to understand the issues affecting low- and\nmoderate-income communities, work that will yield dividends well after the pandemic is behind us.\nBefore I continue, let me remind you that, as always, the views I will present are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nIt is now clear that the adverse effects of the pandemic have not been evenly distributed and there are\nwide disparities in the recovery across business sectors, geographic areas of the country, and demographic\ngroups. The burdens of the pandemic have been borne by many of the most vulnerable in our economy:\nlower-income and minority workers and communities; those who do not have the opportunity to work\nfrom home; those who don’t have access to reliable telecommunications and internet services or to\nadequate healthcare; and the smallest of small businesses. Since last spring, Blacks and Hispanics have\nbeen faring less well in the job market than whites, and those without a bachelor’s degree have made less\nprogress than those with a bachelor’s degree. Rehiring by employers has been considerably slower for\nlow-wage workers than for high-wage workers, whose employment level has now returned to its prepandemic level. Among workers in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, the labor force participation rate\nof women has recovered less than that of men, because the need to provide childcare for pre-school\n\n\f2\nchildren or those being schooled remotely is disproportionately affecting women’s ability to remain in the\nworkforce or work their usual number of hours.\n\nOne source of the disparities across groups stems the fact that the distribution of the types of jobs held by\nmembers of a particular group varies across groups and the pandemic has hit some industries much harder\nthan others. Analysis by the Cleveland Fed indicates that one factor that has contributed to a rising\nearnings gap between whites and Blacks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and, Dayton, Ohio, is that the\ndistribution of workers across occupations differs by race. 1\n\nIt is important to remember that differences in economic outcomes did not start with COVID-19. Many\nof the economic disparities in our economy are long-standing ones and stem from the fact that the U.S.\neconomy does not offer the same opportunities to all. There are racial disparities in educational\nattainment, labor market outcomes, and access to credit. People born into areas of concentrated poverty\nor predominantly minority areas are disadvantaged over their entire lifetimes, and so are their children.\nThese disparities have been propagated across generations. Things cannot be expected to improve on\ntheir own. Actions will need to be taken to promote an inclusive economy – one in which people have the\nchance to move themselves and their families out of poverty, one in which systemic racism does not limit\nopportunities, and one in which all people can fully participate and have access to economic opportunity.\n\nEconomic inclusion and opportunity intersect with the Federal Reserve System’s mission to promote a\nhealthy economy and stable financial system in the United States. Our monetary policy decisions, our\nactions as supervisors and regulators of banks, our role in the payments system, and our efforts to\npromote community development in low- and moderate-income areas all contribute to achieving a well-\n\nBailey, Layisha, and Emily Garr Pacetti, “Recovery for Whom? Trends in Dayton, Ohio, and Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, Exemplify a Growing Gap in Earnings between Minority and White Workers Present in Many US\nRegions,” Community Development Briefs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, November 2019.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/community-development-briefs/db-20191126earnings-gap.aspx)\n\n1\n\n\f3\nfunctioning economy and financial system in which everyone can participate. Opportunity and inclusion\nare important for achieving a strong economy, one that is able to live up to its full potential. The fact that\na more inclusive economy will be a stronger economy is not difficult to see if we take a step back and\nlook at what determines a country’s standard of living. Increases in living standards, as measured by\nincome per person, are inextricably tied to a country’s long-run, potential growth rate, which is driven by\ngrowth in productivity. Important determinants of productivity are investment in human capital to\nincrease the knowledge and skills needed to productively use capital, and investment in R&D and new\ntechnologies. If we want to have a strong economy, it is important that we ensure that everyone has the\nopportunity to fully participate in the labor force and that they have the skills to create new ideas and\ntechnology and to use that technology effectively.\n\nA top priority for increasing economic inclusion and opportunity must be increasing access to highquality education at all levels from pre-school through college. Education can be transformational,\nchanging the path of a person and that of future generations. The GI Bill allowed many soldiers returning\nfrom World War II to become the first college graduates in their families, raising their and their children’s\nstandard of living. Education is a path toward better economic outcomes not only for individuals and\nhouseholds but also for communities. Education levels tend to predict a state’s per capita income growth\nand poverty rates. And cities with more highly educated populations experience lower unemployment\nrates, higher productivity growth, and higher growth in entrepreneurship than what would have been\npredicted by considering only the educational levels of individuals. 2 So education provides a positive\nexternality. Education can raise labor force participation rates, and the better educated tend to have\nhigher wages and lower levels of unemployment. The median income for families whose head has a\ncollege degree is more than twice as high as that of a family whose head has only a high school diploma.\n\nFor further discussion of the research linking educational attainment and economic outcomes of communities, see\nLoretta J. Mester, “Community Development and Human Capital,” remarks at the 2015 Policy Summit on Housing,\nHuman Capital, and Inequality, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond,\nJune 19, 2015. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20150619-communitydevelopment-and-human-capital)\n2\n\n\f4\nThe gap in wages between those with a college degree and those without, the so-called skill premium, has\nwidened substantially over time, more than doubling since the 1970s. Similarly, median net worth is\nconsiderably higher for those with a college degree. 3 Higher educational attainment gives people more\nlabor market security. Over the last expansion, the unemployment rate for those with a bachelor’s degree\nor higher averaged 3.2 percent compared to 6.6 percent for those with a high school diploma and no\ncollege. And while all groups’ unemployment rates are higher than they were before the pandemic, the\ngap between the current unemployment rate (as of December 2020) and the pre-pandemic level (as of\nFebruary 2020) is 1.9 percentage points for those with a college degree but 4.2 percentage points for those\nwith a high school diploma but no college.\n\nBut not all groups have benefited from a college education. While our workforce as a whole has become\nmore educated over time, educational attainment differs by race. According to the Fed’s 2019 Survey of\nConsumer Finances, 41 percent of white heads of household held a college degree compared to 26 percent\nof Black heads of household and 16 percent of Hispanic heads of household. The likelihood of\ncompleting a degree also differs by race and by type of institution. The completion rates have remained\nparticularly low at for-profit institutions for all races, with less than 20 percent of Black students who\nstarted at a for-profit institution in 2012 having earned a degree by 2018 and less than 40 percent of white\nstudents having done so. At both public and nonprofit private institutions, the graduation rates for whites,\nHispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of Blacks remain well below those of these other\ngroups and have shown no progress over time.\n\nCost can be an important barrier to entering and staying in college, particularly for those coming from\nlower-income families. According to the Fed’s survey of economic well-being, of those respondents who\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve System’s 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, in 2019, the median income of\nfamilies whose head has a college degree was $95,700 compared with $45,800 for families whose head had only a\nhigh school diploma. See 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, Federal Reserve System (2020).\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm)\n\n3\n\n\f5\ncould not complete their associate or bachelor’s degree, among other reasons, 56 percent said it was\nbecause it was too expensive. 4 The average cost of tuition and fees at four-year institutions is now over\n$16,000 a year, and adjusted for inflation, it has more than doubled over the past three decades. 5\nAccording to the Fed’s survey on economic well-being, as of late 2019, over 40 percent of those who\nwent to college had taken on debt for their education and about half of those people still owe money on\nthis debt. 6 New York Fed analysis shows that compared to borrowers in majority white areas, those in\nmajority Black areas have higher student loan balances and those in majority Black and majority Hispanic\nareas have higher rates of default on those loans. 7 These defaults can follow a person over time, making\nit harder to access credit in the future. So while on average and for society as a whole, the return to\ninvesting in education is positive, for some individuals it is not, especially if they have to take on high\nlevels of debt. Making college more affordable would help align private and social incentives in the\nchoice of education.\n\nIn addition to cost, another barrier to entering and completing college is not being adequately prepared.\nAccording to the Fed survey, 22 percent of respondents not completing a college degree said that one of\n\nRespondents could choose more than one reason, and 52 percent also said it was because they needed to earn\nmoney to take care of their family.

When children fall behind early on, it is often difficult to catch up.\n\nSo we need to increase investment in early childhood, elementary, and high school education so that\nstudents are better prepared for college. This investment includes financial support to the schools and to\nfamilies, as well as tutoring and mentoring to support children as they learn. Even before the pandemic, a\nlarge part of formal and informal education was being delivered digitally. So one part of the investment\nhas to be in closing the digital divide between low-income areas and higher-income areas. Usage of\nbroadband at home is comparatively higher for whites, those with higher incomes, and those in urban and\nsuburban areas. 9 Blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites to have a computer or broadband at\nhome, and when they do have a computer, they are less likely to have broadband service at home. This\nputs Black and Hispanic families at a disadvantage, especially now, given the pandemic, when remote inhome learning is the norm rather than the exception. The situation in Cleveland is particularly bad.\nAmong communities with a population of 100,000 or more, the city of Cleveland has among the lowest\nhome broadband access in the nation.

For any given type of capital, a more knowledgeable worker is a more productive worker. But\nchanges in technology demand even more highly skilled workers. Technology has changed how we do\nour jobs, how we recruit for workers, and how we search for new positions. The intersection of\ntechnology and work means that the type of skill sets in demand are going to be different than in the past,\nand include things like problem-solving and how to deal with ambiguity in the face of a rapidly changing\nenvironment. A worker’s attachment to a particular employer or even a particular career path is likely to\nbe different as well.\n\nEvidence suggests that technological change has led to an increase in demand for high-skill workers\nrelative to low-skill workers. Even industries often viewed as less skill-intensive have increased their\ndemand for skilled labor. The manufacturing plant of the 1970s looks little like the one of today.\nMiddle-skill jobs are less in demand than they used to be because technology is able to do the routinized\nwork of these jobs. Computers are less suited to replacing workers in occupations that require abstract\nthinking, high levels of cognition, and higher levels of education or workers in non-routine more manual\ntypes of work. This shift in the distribution of jobs helps to explain the wider gap in wages for highly\nskilled vs. low-skill workers, and the increasing return to gaining the education required to obtain those\nskills. Cleveland Fed economists investigated the overall increase in U.S. wage inequality in the last 30\nyears and found not only that educational attainment is a key driver of wage inequality, but that education\nhas become fundamental to boosting worker productivity. 10\n\nThe positive externalities from education to the economic health of communities and the country as a\nwhole mean we are likely under-investing in education from society’s viewpoint. Indeed, the U.S. does\nSee Pinheiro, Roberto, and Murat Tasci, 2019, “Firms, Skills, and Wage Inequality,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland, Working Paper no. 17-06R.

The\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) latest survey assessing adult skills\nindicates that the U.S. ranks 15th in terms of literacy and 24th in terms of numeracy among the 32 OECD\ncountries that participated in the assessment of these skills, and 15th in terms of problem-solving out of the\n29 OECD countries that participated in that part of the assessment. 11 In a different OECD survey of the\nskills of 15-year-olds, the U.S. ranked 9th out of 36 OECD countries in reading, 31st out of 37 OECD\ncountries in math, and 13th out of 37 OECD countries in science. 12\n\nThese results are troubling but not insurmountable. Thoughtful and deliberate policies to make quality\neducation the reality for all students can increase economic opportunity and inclusion for people who\nhave not had those opportunities in the past, better prepare us no matter how the nature of work changes,\nand strengthen the U.S. economy now and in the future.\n\nThe survey was conducted in three rounds: 2011-2012, 2014-2015, and 2017-2018.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe European Economics and Financial Centre\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\nLondon, U.K.\n(via videoconference)\nJanuary 12, 2021\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the European Economics and Financial Centre for the opportunity to share my views on the U.S.\neconomy and monetary policy in the Centre’s Distinguished Speakers Seminar series. I last had the honor\nof speaking to you in July 2019 in London. That was only about a year and a half ago, though time seems\nto be working differently these days. Someone recently quipped that it’s hard to believe that 2020 is over\nsince it started just 12 years ago!\n\nI do wish we could be meeting in person today – not just because London is one of my favorite cities but\nbecause it would mean that the scourge of the pandemic was behind us. Unfortunately, we are not there\nyet. The next few months will be challenging ones, as many countries, including yours and mine,\ncontinue to struggle with the increasing number of new cases of the virus as we await wider distribution\nof vaccines. Nonetheless, as we all turn the page on 2020, the prospects are good for a much more\nfavorable 2021. Today, I will discuss why I think that is the base case. Of course, the views I’ll present\nare my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nAt the start of 2020, before the pandemic, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. It was the 11th\nyear of the expansion, and things looked quite good from the perspective of our monetary policy goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. The unemployment rate was at historically low levels,\nemployment growth was strong, participation in the labor force was solid, and inflation was near the\nFOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nBut the pandemic changed all of that.\n\n\f2\nIn March, the U.S. took aggressive social-distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy\nsome time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus\nitself, and develop testing and treatments. As nonessential businesses shut down, there were swift and\nsevere effects across the U.S. economy. Our economy began to reopen in May as public health statistics\nbegan to improve and many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions.\nDuring this reopening phase, there were sharp rebounds in activity and hiring in those parts of the\neconomy that did not involve close physical contact. In fact, the rebound in activity was stronger than\nmany analysts were anticipating, a good reminder that we should never count out the resiliency of the\nU.S. economy or the ability of the American people to adapt to circumstances.\n\nThe U.S. economy is currently in what I call the pre-vaccination recovery phase. The pace of the\nrecovery has slowed compared to last spring and that slowdown is likely to continue in the near term as\nthe current surge in new virus cases has once again led to mandatory and voluntary restrictions on some\nactivities. The recovery, thus far, has varied considerably across sectors. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors,\nlike housing and autos, have been particularly strong. Sales of single-family homes, both new and\nexisting, are now well above pre-pandemic levels, and so is spending on durable goods, including autos.\nSpending on food in grocery stores surged in March and has remained elevated. But spending in other\nsectors, including travel, leisure, and hospitality, which involve more person-to-person contact, is still\nvery constrained compared to pre-pandemic levels. Performing arts institutions continue to struggle and\nlost a substantial income source with the cancelation of holiday performances. The commercial real\nestate sector is also feeling the strains as many businesses fight to stay afloat.\n\nBefore I turn to the outlook and a discussion of policy, let me show you a few charts to illustrate the\nphases the U.S. economy has been through.\n\n\f3\n[FIGURE 1. GDP growth and level] The official GDP data clearly show the deep plunge in activity\nassociated with the shutdown followed by a rebound as the economy reopened. Economic activity peaked\nlast February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. Real GDP fell at a 5 percent annual pace in the\nfirst quarter of last year and a record 31 percent annual pace in the second quarter. In the third quarter, as\nthe economy reopened, growth rebounded, with real GDP rising at a 33 percent annual pace. Growth\ncontinued in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace, and I expect 2020 ended with real GDP still\nsomewhat below where it was at the end of 2019.\n\n[FIGURE 2. Unemployment rate and employment level] We can see the same pattern in the labor\nmarket data. The unemployment rate was a low 3.5 percent in February and it surged to 14.8 percent in\nApril. It rapidly declined as the economy reopened and people on temporary furlough or layoff began to\nbe rehired.\n\nSimilarly, payroll employment plunged by 22 million jobs in March and April. To put that into\nperspective: that was about the same number of jobs the economy had added over the 10-plus years of the\nprevious expansion. When the U.S. economy reopened in May, hiring picked up rapidly. But since the\nsummer, the labor market has cooled. Some of that was expected after the reopening, but more recently,\nhiring has slowed even more given the re-imposition of some restrictions on activity due to the increase in\nnew virus cases. In fact, payrolls declined by 140 thousand jobs in December and employment remained\nmore than 6 percent, or almost 10 million jobs, below its level in February. A larger share of those\ncurrently unemployed are on permanent rather than temporary layoff compared to earlier in 2020, and the\nunemployment rate remains very elevated, at 6.7 percent in December, unchanged from November.\n\n[FIGURE 3. Change in unemployment by race and education] The disparate nature of the recovery,\nthus far, can be seen in some of the labor market statistics. In terms of the decline in unemployment rates\n\n\f4\nsince February, there has been less progress for nonwhites and for those without a college education, as\nseen here.1\n\n[FIGURE 4. Recovery in jobs by wage level and prime-age labor force participation rate by gender]\nRehiring by employers has been considerably slower for low-wage workers than for high-wage workers,\nwhose employment level has now returned to its pre-pandemic level. Among workers in the prime\nworking ages of 25 to 54, the labor force participation rate of women has recovered less than that of men.\nIn part, this reflects the types of jobs held by women and men, with a higher share of women working in\nindustries hit the hardest by the pandemic. But it also likely reflects the fact that the need to provide\nchildcare for pre-school children or those being schooled remotely is disproportionately affecting\nwomen’s ability to remain in the workforce or work their usual number of hours. On a more positive\nnote, our contacts from staffing companies report that while they have few people looking for job\nplacements, they have seen a significant increase in people taking their online training courses. This\nsuggests that people are preparing themselves to re-enter the labor force when their circumstances allow\nthem to do so.\n\n[FIGURE 5. Total and core inflation and durable goods and services inflation] Weakness in\neconomic activity and the uncertain outlook throughout last year put downward pressure on inflation,\neven though supply disruptions caused the prices of certain goods and services to rise. During the\nshutdown phase last spring, total PCE inflation fell to 1/2 percent and core PCE inflation, which excludes\nfood and energy prices, fell to under 1 percent. As the economy reopened and started to recover, inflation\nfirmed. The disparate nature of the recovery is seen in the inflation data, too. High demand has pushed\n\n1\n\nThe net increase in the unemployment rate between February and December was 3.9 percentage points for Blacks,\n4.9 percentage points for Hispanics, 3.5 percentage points for Asians, 3.0 percentage points for whites, 4.0\npercentage points for those without a high school diploma, 4.3 percentage points for those with a high school\ndiploma without any college, 3.3 percentage points for those with some college but less than a bachelor’s degree,\nand 1.9 percentage points for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher.\n\n\f5\ndurable goods inflation to a 25-year high, while the inflation rate for services, which includes the prices of\ntravel, hospitality, and other hard-hit sectors, remains in the bottom of its range over the last decade.\nOverall, inflation remains below the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent as measured by the year-overyear change in PCE inflation.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThat is a brief review of where the U.S. economy has been. Where it is going will largely depend on the\npath of the virus, which, in turn, is affected by our actions to control its spread, treat it, test for it, and\nvaccinate against it. It probably goes without saying that there is still a high degree of uncertainty around\nthe outlook, even though some of the worst-case scenarios and downside risks have lessened over time.\n\nThree key factors are shaping my thinking about the economic outlook. The first is the surge in new virus\ncases, which well exceed those seen last spring and summer and are straining hospital capacity in some\nparts of the U.S. The surge is exacting a heavy human toll and casting a shadow on the near-term\neconomic outlook.\n\nA second factor shaping my outlook is the positive developments on the vaccine front. These have made\nme more confident about the economy’s recovery over the medium run, notwithstanding the bumpy start\nto deployment of the vaccines in the U.S. It will take several months for vaccines to be widely distributed\nand for a large segment of the U.S. population to be vaccinated. But when that happens, economic\nconditions will look very different from what they look like today.\n\nThe third factor shaping my outlook is the fact that while the pace of the recovery has slowed from the\nstrong rebound seen in the third quarter of last year, so far the recovery has generally been stronger than\nanticipated. This suggests that we may have been underestimating the economy’s resilience and\n\n\f6\nunderlying momentum, as well as the ability of households and businesses to adapt to this unprecedented\nenvironment.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I expect the recovery to continue, but to be uneven over the year. In\nthe near term, the current surge in virus cases will likely weigh on economic activity this winter as it is\nmanaged through social distancing and targeted shutdowns, albeit ones that are less severe than those last\nspring. But as the surge is brought under control and more people become vaccinated, I expect economic\nactivity to pick up. Assuming that most people are vaccinated by the third quarter of the year, people and\nbusinesses will feel it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities and I expect a strong pickup in\neconomic activity in the second half of this year.\n\nThis post-vaccination phase of the recovery is likely to continue over the next few years, with growth\nabove trend, declines in the unemployment rate, and gradually rising inflation. Given the nature and the\nseverity of the pandemic shock, some sectors will recover slower than others. It will take time for some\nof the workers who have lost jobs to find new ones, either at another firm in their current industry or in a\nnew industry after they retrain. There may well be persistent changes in consumer preferences with\nrespect to shopping, dining, and housing and firms’ demand for office space. Those changes, as well as\nthe need to re-establish more robust supply chains, could necessitate structural changes to the economy\nthat will take time to unfold.\n\nPolicy\nMy modal outlook, which I just described, depends on appropriate policy. Both monetary and fiscal\npolicy have supported the recovery in the U.S. thus far, and in my view, both will continue to be needed\nto limit lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic and support the achievement of a broad-based\nsustainable recovery. Since the start of the pandemic, fiscal policy actions have included grants to\nindividuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities; expanded\n\n\f7\nunemployment benefits; and loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their\npayrolls. Federal Reserve actions have included buying Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS), implementing emergency facilities to backstop the flow of credit throughout the economy,\nensuring our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar funding, temporarily relaxing some\nof the regulatory requirements on banks so they have greater capacity to lend, and lowering the target\nrange of our policy rate, the federal funds rate.\n\nThe FOMC has been maintaining the fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent since March. We\nexpect it will be appropriate to maintain that range until labor market conditions have reached levels\nconsistent with our assessments of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also continues to increase its holdings of\nTreasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per\nmonth. We expect to continue doing so until substantial further progress has been made toward our\nmaximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nThe forward guidance in our December policy statement is entirely consistent with our revised monetary\npolicy strategy, which was summarized in a statement we released last August.2 Let me conclude with a\nfew comments on our revised strategy and its implications for monetary policy going forward.\n\nThe FOMC’s Revised Monetary Policy Strategy and Its Implications for Monetary Policy\nThe revised strategy statement summarizes the FOMC’s conclusions from a review of our monetary\npolicy framework that began in early 2019. The review was undertaken in light of changes in the\nFor more information on the new strategy, see Loretta J. Mester, “The Federal Reserve’s New Monetary Policy\nStrategy,” 6th Annual Monetary and Financial Policy Conference, Money Macro and Finance Society, London, U.K.\n(via videoconference), October 21, 2020 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp20201021-federal-reserves-new-monetary-policy-strategy.aspx).\n2\n\nThe revised strategy summarizes the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary policy framework,\nincluding strategy, tools, and communications (see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-ofmonetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm).\n\n\f8\neconomic environment that have implications for monetary policy. One change that has occurred in the\nU.S. and other advanced economies is the decline in the general level of interest rates consistent with\nsustainable growth and price stability. This decline reflects several factors, including the aging of the\npopulation, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth. It means that the level of the fed\nfunds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability is now lower than it has been in the\npast. So the FOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using its traditional policy tool\nand during economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds rate will be constrained by its\neffective lower bound. Households, businesses, and financial markets understand this constraint, so they\nare likely to think that inflation will remain low because of the lack of policy space. So the constraint\nimparts a downward bias to inflation expectations and inflation, and so increases the downside risks to\nachieving our policy goals.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment compared to past decades pertains to inflation dynamics.\nResource slack in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with actual inflation\nthan in the past, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation outcomes. This\nmakes it even more important that inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with\nour longer-run 2 percent inflation goal, especially because inflation running below our goal would result\nin even less policy space in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\nOur revised strategy incorporates these changes in the economic environment. We have reaffirmed that\nour longer-run inflation goal is 2 percent, but in order to achieve this goal, we will likely aim to have\ninflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time after periods in which inflation has been running\npersistently below 2 percent. In other words, not only will we be comfortable with serendipitous shocks\nthat move inflation above 2 percent, but we will set policy to intentionally move inflation moderately\nabove 2 percent for some time. The implication is that, all else equal, monetary policy will be somewhat\n\n\f9\nmore accommodative than in the past when inflation has been running persistently low in order to reach\nour longer-run inflation goal.\n\nWith respect to our employment goal, in the last expansion we learned over time that employment growth\ncould be stronger and the unemployment rate lower without generating inflation than one would have\nthought possible based on past decades of experience. Our new strategy clarifies that in the absence of\ninflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, strong employment is not a concern and monetary\npolicy will not react to it. Indeed, the benefits of a strong labor market in fostering economic inclusion\nfor all Americans are clear.\n\nThe approach to monetary policymaking as summarized in our strategy has implications for policy going\nforward. It is consistent with my view that based on my current outlook and assessment of risks around\nthe outlook, it will be appropriate for monetary policy to be patiently accommodative. A slowdown in the\neconomy in the first part of the year along the lines I am expecting would not require a change in\nmonetary policy so long as the medium-run outlook remains intact. Nor would the strengthening in\ngrowth I expect to see later this year necessitate a change in our policy stance because I expect that the\neconomy will still be far from our employment and inflation goals.\n\nOf course, there continues to be substantial uncertainty around the outlook, with both upside and\ndownside risks, and policymakers are not prescient. This is why framing our forward policy guidance in\nterms of the progress the economy is making toward our policy goals of maximum employment and price\nstability is so important. The past year reminds us that the economy could evolve in a materially different\nway than expected and risks, including those to financial stability, might emerge that could impede\nattainment of our monetary policy goals. On the other hand, the resiliency shown by the economy so far\nsuggests there is also the possibility that the post-vaccination recovery could be stronger than expected.\n\n\f10\nIn either case, consistent with our forward guidance, Federal Reserve policymakers stand prepared to\nrespond appropriately to continue to foster a broad-based sustainable recovery.\n\n\fCharts for\n“Moving Toward a\nBroad‐Based Sustainable Economic Recovery\nin the U.S.”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAmerican Economic Association Paper Session\nAllied Social Science Associations Annual Meeting\n(via videoconference)\nJanuary 4, 2021\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Stacy Dickert-Conlin for the opportunity to discuss two papers in this session: “Promoting Female\nInterest in Economics: Limits to Nudges,” by Todd Pugatch and Elizabeth Schroeder (2020), and “Can\nPositive Feedback Increase Female and Minority Undergraduates into Economics?” by Kelly Bedard,\nJacquie Dodd, and Shelly Lundberg (2020). My remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me start with a story about myself. One could say that I earned my Ph.D. in economics as the result\nof a nudge. I was a double major in math and economics at Barnard College. I applied to graduate school\nin math, but I ended up pursuing a Ph.D. in economics at Princeton because two professors there – male\nprofessors, I might add – wrote to me explaining that Princeton’s economics program was very\nmathematical and encouraged me to come to Princeton to study economics. I would not have done that\nhad it not been for their nudge.\n\nThat is just one anecdote. The papers I am discussing today are both systematic investigations of whether\nparticular types of nudges can interest more women and minorities to go into the field of economics.\n\nWhy Diversity in Economics Matters\nThe Federal Reserve System is one of the largest employers of economists. We have about 700 Ph.D.\neconomists and many other staff members with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics. I believe\nwe have a vested interest in helping to attract more women and minorities to the field. There are three\nmajor reasons. First, economics is a field that influences public policy, policy that affects the lives of all\ntypes of people. At the Fed, we work on behalf of the public. So we need to consider the effects of our\nmonetary, regulatory, and payments policies on all of our constituents. That is easier to do when your\nown staff reflects the public. Second, there is evidence that you end up making better decisions when\ndiverse views inform those decisions. Diverse teams tend to be more objective and to focus on the facts\n\n\f2\nwhen making decisions; they may process information more carefully because they are forced to confront\na different way of thinking and to convince those with alternative views; and firms with more diversity\ntend to be more innovative.1 Research also shows that firms with diverse management tend to have\nabove-average earnings.2 And third, it is important that the field of economics does not get stymied by\ngroup-think. Economics needs to continue to be a vibrant field, tackling new research questions and\ndeveloping innovative techniques and ways of analysis to arrive at answers to these questions. Broader\nrepresentation in economics means that a broader set of issues will be tackled and a broader set of\nresearch results disseminated. The field will continue to evolve, resulting in better policy outcomes that\nwill improve the economic well-being of a greater share of the population.\n\nSome Data on Diversity in Economics\nUnfortunately, economics is not a diverse field. Economics is a popular major in U.S. colleges and\nuniversities, but the field has had less success in attracting women or historically under-represented racial\nand ethnic minorities. While there has been some improvement compared to the 1970s, underrepresentation of women and minorities in the field of economics has been going on for many years.\nWomen earn between 30 and 35 percent of the bachelor’s degrees in economics, and this share has been\nrelatively stable over the past two decades.3 It is higher than the female share of bachelor’s degrees in\n\n1\n\nSee Rock and Grant (2016).\n\n2\n\nRock and Grant (2016) cite a Credit Suisse analysis of 2,400 companies worldwide that found that organizations\nwith at least one female board member had higher return on equity and higher net income growth than firms with no\nfemale board members. In addition, Hunt, Layton, and Prince (2015) report on a McKinsey & Company analysis of\n366 companies that found that those in the top quartile in terms of management’s ethnic and racial diversity were 35\npercent more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean, while those in the top quartile in terms of\nmanagement’s gender diversity were 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean.\nChevalier (2019) discusses the results from the American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of\nWomen in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) 2019 survey of economics departments. At the 126 schools CSWEP\npolled that have doctoral programs in economics, the female share of undergraduate seniors majoring in economics\nwas about 34 percent in 2019, and it has varied between 30 and 35 percent since 1994; of these schools, those with\nhigher ranked economics programs have a higher share of female undergraduate majors. Among the 112 schools\nwithout Ph.D. programs that responded to the CSWEP poll, the share was 35 percent in 2019, and has been\nrelatively stable at that level for the past 10 years. Using U.S. Department of Education data on four-year, nonprofit\ncolleges and universities over 2011-2015, Bayer and Wilcox (2017) find that women earned less than a third of the\nbachelor’s degrees in economics.\n3\n\n\f3\nsome of the STEM fields, including computer sciences, and engineering and engineering technology, but\nlower than the female share of bachelor’s degrees conferred in the physical sciences and in mathematics\nand statistics.4 Across all fields, women earn more than half of all bachelor’s degrees awarded.5 This\nmeans women are choosing to major in economics at only a third of the rate of men.6 But women are\nattracted to other social sciences and to the natural sciences as well. The humanities, including English,\nforeign languages, and visual arts, and nursing continue to attract women, as they have traditionally done.\nBut psychology is a relatively large major, accounting for almost 6 percent of all bachelor’s degrees\nconferred in the 2017-2018 academic year, with almost 80 percent earned by women.7 Business is a large\nmajor: almost 20 percent of bachelor’s degrees conferred were in business, with 47 percent of those\nearned by women. Biology accounts for about 6 percent of degrees conferred, with over 60 percent\nearned by women.8\n\nThe numbers in economics are even lower for under-represented minorities, who earn slightly more than\n20 percent of bachelor’s degrees and slightly less than 12 percent of economics degrees awarded,\n\n4\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated\nPostsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), in the academic year 2017-2018, women earned 20.0 percent of the\nbachelor’s degrees conferred in computer and information sciences, 21.0 percent of the bachelor’s degrees conferred\nin engineering and engineering technology, 40.0 percent of the bachelor’s degrees conferred in the physical\nsciences, and 42.4 percent of the bachelor’s degrees conferred in mathematics and statistics. For trends by field, see\nTables 325.35, 325.45, 325.70, and 325.65 in the IPEDS.\nWomen earned 57.3 percent of bachelor’s degrees conferred in the academic year 2017-2018. Author’s\ncalculations based on Tables 322.10 and 322.20 in U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education\nStatistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n5\n\n6\n\nAmong schools in the top 100 that offer both business and economics degrees, regardless of gender, students prefer\nthe business degree over economics, but women do so to a greater extent. See Goldin (2013, 2015).\nAuthor’s calculations based on Tables 322.10 and 322.50 in U.S. Department of Education, National Center for\nEducation Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n7\n\nAt the Ph.D. level, the female shares in psychology, business, and biology are also relatively high. Author’s\ncalculations based on Tables 324.10 and 324.35 in U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education\nStatistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n8\n\n\f4\nmeaning that minorities are choosing economics over other majors at only about half the rate of white\nstudents.9\n\nIn terms of upper-level degrees, about one-third of the Ph.D.s awarded in economics go to women. The\nshares of women professors in economics across the various ranks have risen over time, but women still\nmake up about 30 percent of assistant professors, about 26 percent of tenured associates, and about 15\npercent of full professors in economics.10\n\nRestricting attention to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, of the 464 economics doctorates awarded\nin 2018, only 46, that is, about 10 percent, were awarded to under-represented minorities.11 In the\nacademic professorial ranks, in the academic year 2018-2019, under-represented minorities made up\nabout 10 percent of assistant professors and a little over 5 percent of full professors.12\n\nWe can certainly applaud the progress that has been made in increasing the representation of women and\nunder-represented minorities in the field of economics since the 1970s, but more work needs to be done.\nWhile you do not need to have majored in economics to enter a Ph.D. program in economics, it is a\nnatural path. So the under-representation of women and minorities in economics at the undergraduate\nlevel factors into the under-representation of these groups at the graduate level and throughout the ranks\nof academia. Unless the entry of women and minorities into graduate school picks up, it is hard to see\nhow the numbers of Ph.D.s in the ranks of academia and in nonacademic positions that require a Ph.D. in\n\n9\n\nBayer and Wilcox (2017), Table 1. Data are for four-year, not-for-profit colleges and universities in the U.S. for\nthe period 2011-2015.\n10\n\nChevalier (2019).\n\n11\n\nThese statistics are from the U.S. Department of Education IPEDS data as reported in Table 1 of the Committee\non the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) (2019).\n12\n\nThese statistics are from the U.S. Department of Education IPEDS data as reported in Table 5 of the Committee\non the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) (2019).\n\n\f5\neconomics can increase. The fact that women are attracted to other social sciences and to business\nsuggests that it may not just be that women prefer other fields to economics. And even if it were, we\nshould try to shape those preferences because economics is an important and broad field that affects many\npeople’s lives. We need to make more progress in attracting those who are currently under-represented to\nthe field of economics.\n\nIncreasing Diversity in Economics with Nudges\nThe two papers I’ve been asked to discuss look at particular nudges aimed at increasing students’\nawareness of the field of economics and assess whether these nudges influence their choice of major, in\nparticular, for female and minority students.13 The literature indicates that information can affect a\ncollege student’s choice of major and the American Economic Association recommends sharing\ninformation about the economics major as a way of trying to address gender and racial disparities in\nknowledge about the field.\n\nThe paper by Pugatch and Schroeder looks at whether informing undergraduate females about the value\nof a degree in economics in terms of future salaries or the positive impact one might have on society will\nlead more women to choose economics as a field. The researchers used a sample of 2,277 students\nenrolled in Economics Principles courses at Oregon State University, randomly assigning them into one\nof five groups, four of which involved getting an email with some type of information about the\neconomics major and one group not getting an email. The four treatments were: basic information about\nthe economics major; basic information plus information on earnings of economics majors; basic\n\nBehavioral economists use the term “nudge” for something that isn’t mandated but points people in the right\ndirection and can change behavior. See Thaler (2017, 2018) and Sunstein (2014).\n13\n\n\f6\ninformation plus a link to an AEA career video; and basic information plus a link to video testimonials by\nOSU economics students and alumni.\n\nThey then looked at whether the student was an economics major in the winter of 2020, two to four terms\nafter the emails were sent. They found that receiving a message was associated with an increased\nprobability of the student majoring in economics. The likelihood was a statistically significant 2\npercentage points higher for those receiving basic information compared to those not receiving\ninformation. But this result was driven by male students. In fact, none of the four treatments had a\nsignificant effect on majoring in economics for female students, and this was not due to the smaller\nsample size of female students. The authors do a number of robustness tests and these results survive.\nWhen they simulate what would happen to the ratio of male to female majors in economics, they find that\nif the basic information treatment was applied, the ratio would rise from 1.4 to 2.7; that is, it would almost\ndouble the gender disparity. The video information does not seem to have an effect over and above the\nbasic email, but that is not surprising because few students actually clicked on the videos to view them.\n\nPerhaps it is ironic that one of the basic concepts taught in economics – the law of unintended\nconsequences – is rearing its head here. One conclusion from the study is that simple nudges could\nactually increase gender disparity in the field.\n\nBut before we give up on nudges altogether, we may want to consider whether honing the message could\nbe more effective. The fact that 60-80 percent of students opened the email message and that a simple\nemail message had a significant effect on the selection of a major is striking and gives us something to\nwork with. Further work might investigate whether messages could be better tailored to underrepresented groups. Following-up with this group of 2,000+ students after they have chosen a major to\nsee what influenced their choice and whether the email resonated or not might provide useful insights.\nGiven the popularity of the psychology major among women, emphasizing the behavioral aspects of\n\n\f7\neconomics and its wide application might help to attract women to the field. Perhaps giving the parents\nof college students information on the economics major would result in more students selecting\neconomics as a major. Of course, it might result in the exact opposite – another unintended consequence.\n\nBedard, Dodd, and Lundberg also look at the potential for nudges to affect the choice of economics as a\nmajor for females and under-represented ethnic and racial groups. Their experiment involved 2,338\nstudents who received a grade of C or better in the introductory principles of microeconomics course at\nthe University of California, Santa Barbara. These students received information about the school’s two\neconomics majors (Economics and Economics and Accounting, which prepares the students for\ncertification as a professional accountant), career information, and an invitation to an informational\nmeeting about the majors. Other results in the literature suggest that compared to male students, female\nstudents are more sensitive to grades and less likely to go on to major in economics if they feel they did\nnot do well enough in the introductory course. So a random sample of the students who received a B or\nbetter in the intro course were given additional positive feedback, including positive information on how\nthey performed in the course, how they were on track to do well in the major, and encouragement to\nconsider majoring in economics. The authors then assessed whether receiving positive feedback was\nassociated with a greater probability of attending the informational meeting and/or selecting the\neconomics major and whether there were differences by race/ethnicity and gender.\n\nThe authors find that the performance information is associated with a statistically significant higher\nprobability of attending the informational meeting, of about 6 percentage points, for both males and\nfemales. There is also a statistically significant increase in selection of one of the two economics majors\nfor males and females. The greatest effects are among Hispanic students: the probability of majoring in\nEconomics and Accounting after receiving the positive treatment is almost 17 percentage points higher\nfor Hispanic males and 48 percentage points higher for Hispanic females. The paper does not report the\nbaseline probabilities of attending the introductory meeting and choosing to be an economics major for\n\n\f8\nthe control groups so one cannot determine the economic significance of these effects. But they are\nsuggestive that informational nudges can work.\n\nFurther Steps\nI applaud the researchers of both papers. Economics is a data-intensive, results-driven field, so research\nlike this is welcome as a way to distinguish what we know from what we think we know. Both papers\nadd to a growing body of literature on what types of interventions could yield a more diverse pool of\nstudents going into economics. The basic conclusion I came away with is that the lack of diversity in\neconomics is a complex problem to solve. The approach is likely going to have to be of the “let a\nthousand flowers bloom” variety: trying many things on several fronts, and then evaluating their effects,\nas these papers do.\n\nThose of us in the profession should do what we can to ensure that we make the field inclusive. This\ncould mean providing information, changing course content, increasing mentoring throughout all\nuniversity levels, and ensuring that our workplaces have a culture that champions diversity and inclusion,\nnot merely in words but also in deeds.\n\nI think we also need to recognize that we are likely too late if we focus on undergraduates. To drive\nsignificant change in broadening the field, we need to start in kindergarten and elementary school, and\nthen continue throughout high school to explain basic economic thinking, what types of problems\neconomics can help solve, and what types of career paths economics opens up.\n\nI serve on the board of the Council for Economic Education (CEE), a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to educate students in kindergarten through high school about economics and personal finance.\nAccording to the CEE’s 2020 Survey of the States, only 25 states require high school students to take an\neconomics course to graduate. Expanding this requirement to more states would also give students a\n\n\f9\nbetter view of what economics is and, depending on how it is taught, might be effective in drawing more\npeople to the field. Another recent survey found that students who participate in the CEE’s National\nEconomics Challenge, a high school quiz bowl competition, do better than the national average on\nadvanced placement exams, with especially strong gains shown by female and minority students, and that\nparticipants are more likely than nonparticipants to choose to major in economics.14 This suggests that\nexposure to economics at a younger age can help spur knowledge of and interest in the field. This year\nthe Cleveland Fed will be hosting the CEE’s virtual National Personal Finance Challenge and we are\nlooking for ways to expand and strengthen our internship programs so that more students can learn about\ncareers in economics and that we can develop longer-lasting relationships with the interns over their\neducational years and as they enter the job market.\n\n14\n\nFricke, Grogger, and Steinmayr (2018), as referenced in Buckles (2019).\n\n\f10\nReferences\nBayer, Amanda, and David Wilcox, “The Unequal Distribution of Economic Education: A Report on the\nRace, Ethnicity, and Gender of Economics Majors at US Colleges and Universities,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2017-105, Divisions of Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs, Federal\nReserve Board, Washington, D.C.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017105pap.pdf)\nBedard, Kelly, Jacquie Dodd, and Shelly Lundberg, “Can Positive Feedback Increase Female and\nMinority Undergraduates into Economics?” December 9, 2020.

Over the years, the forum has had a number of\ndistinguished speakers and it is truly an honor to speak with you this evening about the outlook for the\neconomy and monetary policy. Of course, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nI would like to start with wishing everyone a happy and healthy new year. Wishing someone good health\nat the start of a new year is a time-honored tradition. But it has taken on a deeper meaning this year as we\nturn the page on 2020, a year in which the coronavirus pandemic inflicted pain and hardship on people all\nover the world. The pandemic was an unprecedented shock to global health and to the economy – the\nlargest shock in most of our lifetimes. With the distribution of vaccines now underway and with further\nfiscal policy relief for households and businesses on the way, the prospects are good for a much more\nfavorable 2021. Nonetheless, the next few months will be challenging ones, as the country continues to\nstruggle with increasing new cases of COVID-19, which are putting strains on our healthcare system and\nlimiting economic activity.\n\nI believe patience will prove to be a virtue as the year unfolds. Until the vaccines have been widely\ndistributed and many people have been vaccinated, we will all need to be patient and continue to follow\npublic health experts’ advice to socially distance, wear a mask, and wash our hands to help control the\nvirus’s spread. In addition, monetary policy will also need to remain patiently accommodative to support\na broad-based and sustainable recovery and achievement of our longer-run goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability.\n\nThe Economy\nIn thinking about the impact of the pandemic on the economy, I find it helps to think in terms of phases.\n\n\f2\nThe pre-pandemic phase at the start of last year found the economy on very solid footing. It was the 11th\nyear of the expansion, and from the perspective of our monetary policy goals, things looked quite good.\nThe unemployment rate was at historically low levels, employment growth was strong, and participation\nin the labor force was higher than what was expected given the aging of the population. And after several\nyears of running low, inflation was near our longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nBut the pandemic changed all of that. In March, the country took aggressive social-distancing measures\nto limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to\ncare for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. In this shutdown\nphase, there were swift and severe effects across the economy as nonessential businesses stopped\noperating and many activities came to a halt. But as public health statistics began to improve and many\nparts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, a reopening phase began in\nMay. This reopening phase saw sharp rebounds in activity and hiring in those parts of the economy that\ndid not involve close physical contact.\n\nAs the summer wore on, the economy entered its current phase – a pre-vaccination recovery phase. The\neconomy continued to recover but, as expected, at a slower pace than in the reopening phase. More\nrecently, the pace of activity has also been constrained by the current surge in new virus cases, which has\nresulted in mandatory and voluntary restrictions on some activities.\n\nIn this phase, the recovery has varied considerably across sectors. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors, like\nhousing and autos, have been particularly strong. Sales of single-family homes, both new and existing,\nare now well above pre-pandemic levels, and so is spending on durable goods, including autos. Spending\non food in grocery stores surged in March and has remained elevated. But spending in other sectors,\nincluding travel, leisure, and hospitality, which involve more person-to-person contact, is still very\nconstrained compared to pre-pandemic levels. Performing arts institutions continue to struggle and lost a\n\n\f3\nsubstantial income source with the cancelation of holiday performances. The commercial real estate\nsector is also feeling the strains as many businesses fight to stay afloat.\n\nThese phases of the economy – shutdown, reopening, pre-vaccination recovery – are clearly seen in the\ndata. So I would like to illustrate where things stand with a couple of slides before turning to the outlook.\nEconomists tend to look at growth rates when assessing the economy, but in this unprecedented situation,\nlooking at the level of activity also provides an important perspective.\n\n[FIGURE 1. GDP growth and level] The official GDP data clearly show the deep plunge in activity\nassociated with the shutdown followed by a rebound as the economy reopened. Economic activity peaked\nin February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. Real GDP fell at a 5 percent annual pace in the\nfirst quarter and a record 31 percent annual pace in the second quarter. The level of real GDP in the\nsecond quarter was back down to its level in early 2015 – a loss of over five years of output growth.\nGrowth rebounded in the third quarter as the economy reopened, with real GDP rising at a 33 percent\nannual pace; its level was back to where it was in early 2018. The rebound in activity was stronger than\nmany analysts were anticipating, a good reminder that we should never count out the resiliency of the\nU.S. economy or of the American people. Growth continued in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace,\nand I expect 2020 ended with real GDP still somewhat below where it was at the end of 2019.\n\n[FIGURE 2. Unemployment rates] The economic phases are also clearly seen in the labor market data.\nApril saw an unprecedented rise in unemployment and loss of jobs, particularly in sectors where people\ncould not work from home. The unemployment rate hit 14.7 percent in April, up from 3.5 percent in\nFebruary. But as the economy reopened, there was a rapid decline in the unemployment rate as people on\ntemporary furlough or layoff began to be rehired. The improvement in the labor market was faster than\nanticipated, but the pace has slowed and the overall unemployment rate remains very elevated, at 6.7\npercent in November.\n\n\f4\n\n[FIGURE 3. Change in unemployment by race and education] Moreover, some of the disparities in\nthe recovery thus far can be seen in labor market outcomes for different racial/ethnic groups and different\neducational attainment groups. All groups’ unemployment rates surged last spring and have fallen since\nthen but, as of November, there has been less progress for nonwhites and for those without a college\neducation. Relative to their pre-pandemic levels, the unemployment rates of Blacks, Hispanics, and\nAsians remain higher than that of whites, and the unemployment rate of high school graduates without\nany college is higher than that of college graduates.1\n\n[FIGURE 4. Labor force participation and change for prime age by gender] These unemployment\nrates would be even higher if people had not left the labor force over the course of last year. As of\nNovember, the labor force participation rate for those age 16 or older was almost 2 percentage points\nlower than it was in February. Among workers in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, women’s\nparticipation is down 2-1/2 percentage points compared to about 2 percentage points for men. In part, this\nreflects the types of jobs held by women and men, with a higher share of women working in industries hit\nthe hardest by the pandemic. Reports from regional contacts, as well as survey results from the Cleveland\nFed’s national daily Consumers and COVID-19 Survey, indicate that the need to provide childcare for\npre-school children or those being schooled remotely is disproportionately impacting the ability of\nwomen to remain in the workforce or work their usual number of hours. Firms also tell us that\nmaintaining productivity is now harder because of the variability they are experiencing in their workforce\nlevels – on any given day there are some workers who unexpectedly have to stay home because a school\nis closed or because they have been exposed to the virus.\n\n1\n\nThe net increase in the unemployment rate between February and November was 2.8 percentage points for whites,\n4.5 percentage points for Blacks, 4.0 percentage points for Hispanics, 4.2 percentage points for Asians, 4.1\npercentage points for those with a high school diploma without any college, and 2.3 percentage points for those with\na bachelor’s degree or higher.\n\n\f5\n\nOn a more positive note, our contacts from staffing companies report that while they have few people\nlooking for job placements, they have seen a significant increase in people taking their online training\ncourses. This suggests that people are preparing themselves to re-enter the labor force when their\ncircumstances allow them to do so.\n\n[FIGURE 5. Employment growth and level] The payroll employment data also tell a similar story\nacross the economic phases caused by the pandemic. In just the two months of March and April, the\neconomy lost 22 million jobs, the same number of jobs it had added over the entire previous expansion,\nwhich lasted over 10 years. More than three-quarters of those losses were in the sectors paying belowaverage wages. When the economy reopened in May, hiring picked up rapidly. As expected, the pace\nhas slowed since that rebound, and more recently, hiring has slowed even more given the re-imposition of\nsome restrictions on activity due to the increase in new COVID cases. As of November, employment\nremained more than 6 percent, or almost 10 million jobs, below its level in February, and a larger share of\nthose currently unemployed are on permanent rather than temporary layoff compared to earlier in the\nyear. It will take some time for these workers to get re-employed as they may need to retrain for other\noccupations.\n\n[FIGURE 6. Inflation] Weakness in economic activity and the uncertain outlook throughout last year put\ndownward pressure on inflation, even though supply disruptions caused the prices of certain goods and\nservices to rise. During the shutdown phase in the spring, total PCE inflation fell to 1/2 percent and core\nPCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, fell to under 1 percent. As the economy reopened\nand started to recover, inflation firmed. This is especially true for durable goods, where high demand has\ndriven inflation for these goods to a 25-year high. The inflation rates for services, which include sectors\nhardest hit by the pandemic, including travel and hospitality, have remained near the bottom of their\nranges over the last decade. Overall, inflation remains below the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\n\f6\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThat is a brief review of where the economy is, but I bet you are even more interested in where the\neconomy is headed. It continues to be the case that the path of the economy depends largely on the path\nof the virus, which is affected by our actions to control its spread, treat it, test for it, and vaccinate against\nit. This means there is still a high degree of uncertainty around the outlook, although some of the worstcase scenarios and downside risks have lessened over time. As shown in the December Summary of\nEconomic Projections, fewer FOMC participants see the balance of risks as weighted to the downside\nthan they did in September.2\n\nThree key factors are shaping my thinking about the economic outlook. They suggest that the near-term\noutlook is likely to be weak, while the medium-run outlook is likely to show considerable improvement.\nFirst, the U.S. and many other countries are experiencing a surge in new virus cases. The latest data for\nthe U.S. show some tempering over the past two weeks, but new case counts still well exceed those seen\nlast spring and summer. They are straining hospital capacity, necessitating more voluntary and mandated\nrestrictions on activity and casting a shadow on the near-term economic outlook.\n\nA second factor shaping my outlook is the positive developments on the vaccine front, which have made\nme more confident about the economy’s recovery over the medium run. It will take several months for\nvaccines to be widely distributed and for a large segment of the population to be vaccinated. But\nwidespread vaccinations will create economic conditions that look very different from the current\nconditions in the midst of the rapid rise in virus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n\n2\n\nFOMC Summary of Economic Projections, December 16, 2020\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20201216.pdf).\n\n\f7\nThe third factor shaping my outlook is the fact that while the pace of the recovery is slowing from the\nstrong rebound seen in the third quarter of last year, so far the recovery has generally been stronger than\nanticipated. This suggests that we may have been underestimating the economy’s resilience and\nunderlying momentum, as well as the ability of households and businesses to adapt to this unprecedented\nenvironment.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I expect the recovery to continue, but to be uneven over the year. In\nthe near term, the current surge in virus cases is likely to weigh on activity this winter as the surge is\nmanaged through social distancing and targeted shutdowns, albeit ones that are less severe than those last\nspring. As the surge is brought under control and more people become vaccinated, I expect economic\nactivity to pick up. Assuming that most people are vaccinated by the third quarter of the year, I expect to\nsee a strong pickup in economic activity in the second half of this year as people and businesses feel it is\nsafe to re-engage in a broad range of activities.\n\nI expect this post-vaccination phase of the recovery to continue over the next few years, with growth\nabove trend, declines in the unemployment rate, and gradually rising inflation. Given the severity of the\npandemic shock, it will take time to move to a more broad-based sustainable recovery. The recovery will\nlikely remain uneven for some time, as some sectors will recover faster than others. It will take time for\nsome of the workers who have lost jobs to find new ones, either at another firm in their current industry or\nin a new industry after they retrain. Changes in consumer preferences with respect to shopping, dining,\nand housing, firms’ demand for office space, and the re-establishment of more robust supply chains could\nall necessitate structural changes to the economy that will take time to unfold.\n\nPolicy\nMy modal outlook, which I just described, depends on appropriate policy. In my view, both fiscal policy\nand monetary policy will continue to be needed to limit lasting damage to the economy from the\n\n\f8\npandemic and support the achievement of a broader, sustainable recovery. Monetary and fiscal policy are\nnot substitutes; they are complements and we saw them working together very effectively earlier last year\nwhen the pandemic hit. Fiscal policy actions included grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest\nby the pandemic, and states and municipalities; expanded unemployment benefits; and loans to small\nbusinesses that became grants for firms maintaining their payrolls. The recently passed $900 billion of\nadditional fiscal relief will help support households and businesses hardest hit by the pandemic in the first\nhalf of 2021, helping to provide a bridge until the economy improves later in the year. Further investment\nin vaccine deployment and aid to states responsible for distributing the vaccines would support a broader\nand faster recovery.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve took actions to ensure that financial markets had enough liquidity to\ncontinue to function well, that credit could continue to flow to households and businesses, and that the\nstance of monetary policy was highly accommodative. These actions have included buying Treasury and\nagency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), implementing emergency facilities to backstop the flow of\ncredit throughout the economy, ensuring our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar\nfunding, temporarily relaxing some of the regulatory requirements on banks so they have greater capacity\nto lend, and lowering the target range of our policy rate, the fed funds rate.\n\nThe FOMC has been maintaining the fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent since March. We\nexpect it will be appropriate to maintain that range until labor market conditions have reached levels\nconsistent with our assessments of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also continues to increase its holdings of\nTreasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per\nmonth. We expect to continue doing so until substantial further progress has been made toward our\nmaximum employment and price stability goals. The forward guidance on our policy rate and asset\npurchases is entirely consistent with our revised monetary policy strategy, which was summarized in a\n\n\f9\nstatement we released last August.3 The forward guidance ties the stance of monetary policy to progress\non our mandated goals.\n\nThe guidance is also consistent with my view that policy patience will prove to be a virtue. The current\nstance of policy is well calibrated to my outlook. A slowdown in the economy in the first part of the year\nalong the lines I am expecting would not require a change in monetary policy so long as the medium-run\noutlook remains intact. Nor would the strengthening in growth I expect to see later this year necessitate a\nchange in our policy stance because I expect that the economy will still be far from our employment and\ninflation goals. Of course, if the economy evolves materially differently than expected or if risks,\nincluding those to financial stability, emerge that could impede attainment of our monetary policy goals,\nwe would be prepared to respond appropriately.\n\nBut given my outlook and assessment of risks, in my view, monetary policy will need to remain highly\naccommodative for quite some time because achieving our monetary policy goals is likely to be a journey\nand not a sprint. While achieving our goals will take some time, I do not view this as a failure of\nmonetary policy or a lack of commitment on the part of policymakers to achieve our goals. The\neconomy’s intrinsic dynamics suggest that inflation is not going to move up quickly above 2 percent.\nAnd the severity of the pandemic shock and its disparate impact across households, communities, and\nsectors suggest that it will take time to return to strong labor market conditions like those we experienced\nprior to the pandemic. The FOMC is, and will remain, fully committed to using our policy tools to\nachieve our goals, in support of a broad-based and sustainable recovery.\n\nFor more information on the new strategy, see Loretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nFourth Annual Fintech Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\n(via videoconference)\nNovember 9, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the other organizers for inviting me to speak at the\nfourth annual Fintech Conference. I spent most of my career at the Philadelphia Fed, so it is always a\npleasure to participate in one of its events. Since the beginning of this conference series, the discussions\nhave consistently been very topical, and the agenda for the next two days does not disappoint on that\nscore. The conference will cover many of the hot issues confronting practitioners, academics, and\npolicymakers as financial system innovation proceeds at a rapid pace. Today I will discuss the\nimplications of digitalization for financial inclusion and some steps that need to be taken to ensure that\ndigitalization helps to foster inclusion rather than promote exclusion. The views I will present today are\nmy own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\nFinancial Inclusion Has Benefits\nIt is probably best to start off with a definition of financial inclusion, and the World Bank provides us\nwith a workable one: financial inclusion refers to individuals and businesses having access to useful and\naffordable financial products and services that meet their needs and that are delivered in a responsible and\nsustainable way. 1 Much of the literature measures financial inclusion as households’ and businesses’ use\nof formal financial services from banks or other traditional providers, so-called mainstream financial\nservices. With the entry of fintech providers, that definition is expanding because fintech financial\nservices are moving into the mainstream.\n\nThe World Bank’s Global Findex database provides data on how people in 140 economies access\naccounts, make payments, save, borrow, and manage risks. It includes data on formal and informal\nfinancial services and the use of financial technology to conduct financial transactions. 2 The data indicate\n\n1\n\nThe World Bank, Financial Inclusion, https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview.\n\n2\n\nWorld Bank (2017).\n\n\f2\nthat across the globe financial inclusion has risen. The share of adults with an account at a financial\ninstitution or through a mobile money service rose from 62 percent in 2014 to 69 percent in 2017.\nNonetheless, there is still a large portion of the population that does not have access to or use financial\nservices. As of 2017, an estimated 1.7 billion adults around the world are unbanked or underserved.\nWomen lag behind men; the poor lag behind the wealthy; and developing economies lag behind\ndeveloped economies in the shares having formal accounts.\n\nIn the U.S., the level of financial inclusion is high: 93 percent of adults have an account at a bank or other\ntype of financial institution or use a mobile money service. But disparities exist: there is a 13 percentage\npoint gap between those in the richest 60 percent of households and those in the poorest 40 percent.\nFederal Reserve data indicate that, compared to whites, Blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. are less likely to\nhave a bank account and more likely to rely on alternative financial services such as money orders and\ncheck cashing services. 3 And compared to small firms with white ownership, those with Black ownership\nwere half as likely to have obtained financing from a bank in the past five years, relying more on online\nlenders, which, according to the survey respondents, provide less satisfactory service. 4\n\nTo address these types of gaps, many countries have set financial inclusion as a formal target. 5 This is\nreasonable because numerous studies have documented the contribution of a well-functioning financial\nsystem and higher levels of financial inclusion to longer-run macroeconomic goals of output and\n\n3\n\nAccording to a 2020 supplement to the Board of Governors’ Survey of Economic Well-Being, 14 percent of Black\nadults and 10 percent of Hispanic adults do not have a bank account, compared to 3 percent of white households.\n(See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (May 2020), Table 11, p. 28.) Unbanked is defined as not\nhaving a checking, savings, or money market account. Underbanked is defined as having a checking, savings, or\nmoney market account but having used one of these alternative financial services: money order, check cashing\nservice, pawn shop loan, auto title loan, payday loan, paycheck advance, or tax refund advance.\nAccording to the Fed’s most recent Small Business Credit Survey of firms with 1 -499 employees, 46 percent of\nfirms with white ownership, 32 percent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 23 percent of firms with Black\nownership had obtained financing from a bank in the past five years; 19 percent of firms with white ownership, 22\npercent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 27 percent of firms with Black ownership had obtained financing\nfrom an online lender in the past five years. (See Federal Reserve System (2020), p. 9.)\n4\n\n5\n\nSahay, et al. (2015).\n\n\f3\nproductivity growth. 6 On the macro level, healthy financial markets and institutions allow for more\nefficient allocation of capital and better monitoring and broader diversification of risk, which can enable\nhigher levels of overall growth. At the micro level, access to savings and credit via financial\nintermediaries connects households and businesses to economic opportunities that would not be available\notherwise. A sound financial system can spur entrepreneurship and support the competitive forces that\ndrive productivity in the economy.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, the distributional impacts of finance are worth considering. A body of work\nhas shown that finance can expand economic opportunities for those at the bottom of the income and\nwealth distributions and does not merely benefit those at the top. 7 For example, access to credit allows\naccess to education, which can have profound effects on an individual’s economic well-being, and it also\nallows households to build wealth through homeownership, which remains the most significant asset on\nmany U.S. families’ balance sheets.\n\nDigitalization Is Transforming Financial Services\nDigitalization of financial services is transforming the industry and expanding the range of financial\nservice providers to include not only fintech lending and payments firms but also so-called bigtech firms,\nincluding technology, social media, search platform, and e-commerce companies. Consumer demand is\none factor driving the rise in these services. EMarketer estimates that in 2019, 1.9 billion people\nworldwide purchased goods online. 8 In 2020, despite the global pandemic, retail e-commerce sales are\nestimated to rise to over $3.9 trillion and yearly sales growth has been in the 15 to 25 percent range over\nthe past three years. 9 As the costs of computing have declined and the demand for new services that offer\n\n6\n\nLevine (2009).\n\n7\n\nLevine (2009) and Demirgüç-Kunt and Levine (2009).\n\n8\n\nSee United Nations (2020) and Lipsman (2019).\n\n9\n\nSee Lipsman (2019) and Cramer-Flood (2020).\n\n\f4\nspeed and convenience at a lower price has risen, new firms have entered the financial services space.\nAccording to the U.S. Treasury, from 2010 to the third quarter of 2017, more than 3,330 new technologybased firms serving the financial services industry have been founded. The global market capitalization\nof fintech firms grew to $22 billion in 2017, 13 times what it was in 2010. Lending by these firms\naccounts for over 36 percent of personal loans in the U.S., up from under 1 percent in 2010. New tools\nand techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, are now routinely being applied in\nfinance.\n\nDigitalization Has the Potential to Increase Financial Inclusion\nLike past financial innovations, digitalization holds the promise of increasing the efficiency, productivity,\nand inclusiveness of the financial sector, thereby increasing the economic welfare of households and\nbusinesses. For example, a wide body of research indicates that tools that increase a household’s savings\nbehavior can have a substantial impact on household welfare. 10 Digital tools that give households and\nsmall businesses across the income spectrum the ability to track and understand their spending and\nsavings patterns can improve their ability to manage their finances, allow them to avoid more costly\nsources of credit, and increase their savings rate. There is evidence, reflected in several countries’\nexperiences, that access to savings accounts not only increases savings but also results in households\nshifting more of their spending to education and to healthier food. 11 Digitalization also provides\ncustomers with tools to search for and compare financial services across various vendors to determine\nwhich is more likely to meet their specific needs.\n\nOn the credit side, digital lending platforms hold the potential for more objective credit decisions, helping\nto guard against personal prejudices influencing those decisions. Bigtech companies have access to large\namounts of data, for example, from e-commerce platforms or search engines. Models to assess credit risk\n\n10\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\n11\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\n\f5\nbased on these alternative data hold the potential to increase credit access for households and small firms\nthat do not necessarily have a long credit history, audited financial statements, or collateral, which are\ntraditionally used to underwrite and monitor credit risk. And there is some research to back this up. A\nstudy co-authored by Julapa Jagtiani, one of the organizers of this conference, found that consumer loans\nmade by LendingClub, a large fintech lending platform, reached areas with fewer bank branches and\nlower-income borrowers. 12 Research published by the Bank for International Settlements found that the\ninternal credit scoring model built by and applied to small merchant customers of Mercado Libre, a large\ne-commerce platform in Latin America now offering financial services, has outperformed (at least in the\nshort run) models based on credit bureau ratings and traditional borrower characteristics. 13 And Mercado\nLibre was able to provide credit to merchants who would have been assessed as high risk by the credit\nbureau.\n\nInnovations in payments services also hold the potential to increase inclusion. Across the globe there is a\nmove toward faster, cashless payment systems, which can lower costs and provide more secure\ntransactions than cash. Early evidence from several countries shows that the move to digital payments\nhas had a positive impact on the well-being of individuals by strengthening their ties to other financial\nservices. 14 There is also evidence that the use of digital systems by governments to make transfer\npayments to individuals can significantly reduce the cost of distribution and the amount of fraud. 15\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s FedNowSM service, which is currently being built, will be an around-the-clock\nservice whereby payments can be originated, cleared, and settled within seconds. 16 The service is\n\n12\n\nJagtiani and Lemieux (2018).\n\n13\n\nSee Bank for International Settlements (2019) and Frost, et al. (2019).\n\n14\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\n15\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\nMore information on FedNow is available on the Fed’s website at https://www.frbservices.org/financialservices/fednow/index.html.\n16\n\n\f6\nexpected to provide clear public benefits in the form of safety, efficiency, and accessibility of instant\npayments. By lowering the cost of making payments in a secure way, FedNow can help promote\nfinancial inclusion by drawing more people into the financial system. This service, coupled with a\ndirectory service with accurate information on where to route payments for final distribution to\nhouseholds and businesses, could also make distribution of government benefits more efficient and solve\nsome of the challenges the government faced when distributing pandemic relief payments earlier this\nyear.\n\nSteps Need to Be Taken So That Digitalization Lives Up to Its Potential\nWhile digitalization holds a lot of promise to bring more households and businesses into the financial\nsystem, there is no guarantee this will happen. Indeed, digitalization could create more exclusion and\nincrease disparities rather than close the gaps. But steps can be taken to help ensure that digitalization\nlives up to its potential. Let me discuss five of these.\n\nClose the digital divide\nFirst, the digital divide in the U.S. needs to close so that more people can take advantage of digital\nfinancial services. Among communities with a population of 100,000 or more, the city of Cleveland has\namong the lowest home broadband access in the nation. 17 Only about 69 percent of households have\nbroadband subscriptions compared to over 84 percent in the city of Philadelphia and over 86 percent for\nthe nation as a whole. In the meantime, mobile phone technology, which has wide distribution, could\nsignificantly improve financial system access for unbanked adults. 18\n\n17\n\nThe data are available in Table GCT2801, U.S. Census American Community Survey (2019). In the cit y of\nCleveland, 69.3 percent of households have a broadband internet subscription. Only Lakewood Township, Ocean\nCounty, N.J. has lower internet connectivity, at 58.9 percent. The number for the U.S. is 86.4 percent and the\nnumber for the city of Philadelphia is 84.2 percent.\n18\n\nWorld Bank data indicate that two-thirds of unbanked adults globally have a mobile phone. See Demirgüç-Kunt,\net al. (2018), p. 91.\n\n\f7\nImprove financial literacy\nSecond, steps must also be taken to improve the reach and the effectiveness of financial literacy\nprograms. Digitalization increases the number of financial services providers and the types of services\nbeing offered. But to take advantage of these, people need to be able to assess their value. One study of\n188 financial literacy programs indicated that they had not, on average, increased financial knowledge or\nresulted in better financial choices. But the research also suggested that programs that included simple\nrules-of-thumb were more effective.19 Businesses also have to understand the costs and benefits of credit\ncoming from a fintech firm versus a traditional banking relationship, which may prove to be more stable\nin an economic downturn. Increasing the ability of the consumers of financial services to evaluate new\nservices will help ensure that these products add value.\n\nBuild trust\nThird, in order to increase inclusion, steps must be taken to build trust between potential customers and\nthe financial services industry. One Federal Reserve analysis indicated that one reason people do not\nhave a transaction account is the lack of trust in financial institutions. 20 Effective consumer protection\nregulations encompassing all providers of financial services would give potential customers more\nconfidence to use the services. Trust also depends on providers of financial services adequately\nprotecting their customers’ accounts against cybersecurity breaches, fraud, and data leakage. With the\nchanges in technology and rapid expansion of available data, the methods for protecting the data will need\nto adapt. The traditional way of keeping data private, by taking away names or otherwise anonymizing it,\nno longer works in a world rich with multiple data sources that can be cross-referenced to de-anonymize\nthe data and reveal identities. 21 New methods have to be evaluated. An example is the technique used to\nachieve differential privacy by carefully adding some statistical noise to the data to maintain individual\n\n19\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\n20\n\nHogarth, et al. (2004), as cited in Raskin (2011).\n\nKearns and Roth (2020) discuss how then-Massachusetts governor William Weld’s medical record was identified\nby combining the anonymized medical records released by the state with voter registration data.\n21\n\n\f8\nprivacy while maintaining statistical accuracy. 22 The U.S. Census Bureau plans to apply differential\nprivacy techniques to the statistics released as part of the 2020 census. 23\n\nTest the algorithms before deployment\nFourth, it must be recognized that just because it is an algorithm does not mean it is immune from\nproducing discriminatory underwriting and pricing decisions. Algorithms should be tested for bias before\nthey are deployed. Credit and pricing models produced by algorithms through machine learning are\nnecessarily complex because they are designed to reveal relationships in the data that are not revealed by\nstandard modeling. But their opacity and complexity – their black-box quality – make it more difficult to\nidentify these relationships and more difficult to uncover statistical discrimination or disparate impact and\nto enforce fair lending laws. 24\n\nWell-meaning algorithms can have unintended effects. Algorithms are trained on past data that may have\nreflected biased decisions or may not be representative of the entire population. With more pieces of data\navailable, there is more risk that data correlated with race or gender could be used in discriminatory ways.\nThis means machine learning algorithms could exacerbate disparities by reinforcing past decisions.\nKearns and Roth point out the need for what they call ethical algorithms, which are built to balance the\naccuracy of the model, for, say, assessing credit risk, with other desirable goals. 25 For example, the\ndeveloper could build the algorithm so that it has low error rates in identifying creditworthy borrowers\nand the error rate for one racial group is not disproportionately higher than that for another.\n\nAt present, much of the auditing of algorithms occurs in an ad hoc way after the algorithm has been put\n22\n\nDifferential privacy is achieved when no one, regardless of additional data, is able to determine better than\nrandom guessing whether any individual’s data were used to construct a data release. See Kearns and Roth (2020).\n23\n\nSee U.S. Census (2020).\n\n24\n\nMorse and Pence (2020) examine the ways in which technology may augment or deter discrimination in\nhousehold finance. See also Abuhamad (2019).\n25\n\nKearns and Roth (2019, 2020).\n\n\f9\ninto place and has had the opportunity to have a disparate impact. 26 A well-known example is the Apple\nCard: gender discrimination was alleged by some customers about the algorithms used by Goldman\nSachs, the issuer of the card, after the card was deployed. 27 Who should do the testing is an open\nquestion. A report from the Brookings Institution’s Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies\nInitiative recommends that the developer test the algorithm for disparate impact. Companies that use such\nalgorithms could engage independent third parties to evaluate them, with appropriate restrictions to guard\nthe firms’ intellectual property. Regulators may also have to play a larger role in testing algorithms.\n\nSince adequate data sets are needed for testing, the rules pertaining to data collections should be\nreviewed. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act restricts creditors from discriminating in credit transactions\nagainst credit applicants on any prohibited basis, including race and gender. The collection of data on\napplicants’ personal characteristics for home purchase and refinance loan transactions is required and the\ndata must be publicly disclosed. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires small business lenders to collect and\nreport race and gender data to federal regulators. But for other nonmortgage loans, creditors’ collection\nof these data is prohibited except for the creditors’ own use to conduct a limited self-test of their\ncompliance with the law. 28 The original prohibition was based on the notion that the data might be used\nin discriminatory ways. But experience with the collection of mortgage data suggests that this has not\nbeen the case and that the data have made it easier to monitor compliance and enforce the law. Extending\nmandatory data collection of personal characteristics for nonmortgage credit applicants may allow for\nbetter testing for compliance. But it would also entail costs for creditors that could partially be passed on\nto borrowers. With more entities offering credit, it is time to undertake a new review of the costs and\nbenefits of data collection for different types of nonmortgage credit.29\n\n26\n\nKleinberg (2018).\n\n27\n\nMacCarthy (2019).\n\n28\n\nData collected for such a self-test are not available to government agencies or credit applicants for use in\nexaminations or litigation. See Taylor (2011).\n29\n\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act does not address data collection. In 1995 and again in 1998, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System put out for public comment proposed amendments to Regulation B, which\n\n\f10\n\nRethink the regulatory framework\nFifth, a rethinking of the regulatory framework is needed to ensure that the financial innovations led by\ndigitalization are a net positive. Such innovations do not reduce the need for risk management, financial\nregulation and supervision, and good governance, although the form each takes is likely to be different\nthan what has been effective in the past. Existing regulatory and supervisory structures will need to adapt\nto keep up with the new ways that financial services are being delivered and the new players delivering\nthem. Under the principle, “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck,” a regulatory\napproach that shifts the focus from the type of institution offering the service to the type of activity would\nlikely be more effective in fostering the stability of the financial system and limiting regulatory arbitrage.\nThe extension of some regulations to new service providers is already occurring; for example, bigtech\nfirms’ payments services are subject to know your customer rules.\n\nBut the entry of fintech and bigtech providers of financial services also raises new issues. Data produced\nby bigtech firms are what make it attractive for these firms to enter into financial services in the first\nplace. But their ability to control the data also makes it harder for other firms to enter the market, thus\nlimiting competition. There are different approaches to regulating data usage in order to limit the market\npower of bigtech firm entrants and facilitate market contestability without stifling entry.30 Two examples\nare the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the open banking regulations, which\nare in place in many countries. Both approaches allow certain data to be shared directly with third parties\nbut place restrictions on the type of data and the kinds of authorizations that need to be garnered in order\nto allow for data sharing.\n\nimplements the ECOA, to eliminate the data ban and allow for voluntary collection of personal characteristics of\napplicants for nonmortgage credit. The final rules did not drop the ban. See Braunstein (2008), Government\nAccountability Office (2008), Taylor (2011), and Abuhamad (2019).\n30\n\nSee Frost, et al. (2009) for further discussion.\n\n\f11\nThe ability of bigtech firms to produce and to capture the benefits of big data depends on network effects.\nBenefits to users grow when there are more users of the services, and as the number of users increases,\nmore data are produced that can be garnered for use by the bigtech firm for the development of new\nservices, pricing, and marketing. For example, a firm that may have begun as an e-commerce firm may\nfind it beneficial to offer payment services as an adjunct to generate more e-commerce business, but the\ntransactions data can then be used to offer more services. 31 Once a bigtech firm is well established, it\nbecomes more difficult for other firms to enter. This adds concerns about market power to data privacy\nconcerns. Issues of pricing, cross-subsidization, product tying, and other anti-competitive practices that\nlead to less innovation, not more, deserve increased attention from financial services regulators.\n\nWith the entry of bigtech and fintech firms into financial services, the public policy approach will need to\nchange to include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data privacy\nregulation. There will need to be cooperation across these types of regulators within each country, and\nthis may entail creating structures that allow for more formal or systematic coordination across different\ntypes of regulators. The growth of digitalization also calls for a modernization of the antitrust laws and\npolicy, which is occurring in several countries. 32 The global nature of the bigtech firms entering financial\nservices means that effective international coordination among regulators and supervisors through the\nFinancial Stability Board and other international entities will be critical to ensuring that the benefits can\nbe captured and the risks managed. 33\n\nFinally, it is important that regulators and those responsible for enforcing fair lending and consumer\nprotections increase their expertise regarding the technologies being used in the marketplace. This is\n\nBank for International Settlements (2019) provides a nice description of network externalities in bigtech’s entry\ninto financial services.\n31\n\n32\n\nBank for International Settlements (2019) discusses some of the implications of bigtech for traditional competition\npolicy.\n33\n\nThe Financial Stability Board designated fintech as a key area of focus in its 2020 work program. See Financial\nStability Board (2019).\n\n\f12\nbeginning to happen as financial system regulators and supervisors are starting to use big data and data\nanalytics to improve their own assessments of banking and financial stability risks and to understand\ntrends in the industry more generally. Several countries have set up innovation hubs and regulatory\nsandboxes to encourage innovation in financial services. The Fed has been researching new technologies\nand innovations in financial services for some time. The System Payments Researchers, co-chaired by\nFumiko Hayashi of the Kansas City Fed and Bob Hunt of the Philadelphia Fed, are producing research on\nfintechs and digital currencies. The Board of Governors has set up a technology lab where researchers\nacross the System are building and testing a range of distributed ledger platforms to understand their\npotential benefits and tradeoffs. 34 The Boston Fed is working with the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology to experiment with digital currency technologies, and the New York Fed has established an\ninnovation center, in partnership with the Bank for International Settlements, to identify and develop indepth insights into critical trends and financial technology of relevance to central banks. 35\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, fintech, bigtech, algorithms, machine learning, and digitalization are rapidly transforming\nthe financial services industry. These innovations hold the promise of increasing financial inclusion for\nthe benefit of individuals, businesses, and the overall macroeconomy. But as with past innovations, they\nalso present challenges that will need to be addressed to ensure that the promised benefits are attained and\nrisks are well managed.\n\n34\n\nBrainard (2020).\n\n35\n\nBank for International Settlements (2020).\n\n\f13\nReferences\nAbuhamad, Grace M., “The Fallacy of Equating ‘Blindness’ with Fairness: Ensuring Trust in Machine\nLearning Applications to Consumer Credit,” Master of Science in Technology and Policy Thesis,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, June 2019.\n(https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/122094)\nBank for International Settlements, Annual Economic Report, June 2019.\n(https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2019e.htm)\nBank for International Settlements, “BIS Innovation Hub to Expand to New Locations in Europe and\nNorth America,” June 30, 2020.\n(https://www.bis.org/press/p200630a.htm)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S.\nHouseholds in 2019, Featuring Supplemental Data from April 2020,” May 2020.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-report-economic-well-being-us-households202005.pdf)\nBrainard, Lael, “An Update on Digital Currencies,” at the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco's Innovation Office Hours, San Francisco, CA (via webcast) August 13, 2020.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20200813a.pdf)\nBraunstein, Sandra F., “Equal Credit Opportunity Act,” testimony before the Subcommittee on Oversight\nand Investigations, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, July 17, 2008.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/braunstein20080717a.htm)\nCramer-Flood, Ethan, “Global ECommerce 2020,” eMarketer, June 22, 2020.\n(http://www.emarketer.com/content/global-ecommerce-2020)\nDemirgüç-Kunt, Asli, and Ross Levine, “Finance and Inequality: Theory and Evidence,” Annual Review\nof Financial Economics 1 (2009), pp. 287-318.\n(https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.financial.050808.114334)\nDemirgüç-Kunt, Asli, Leora Klapper, Dorothe Singer, Saniya Ansar, and Jake Hess, “The Global Findex\nDatabase 2017: Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution,” World Bank Group, 2018.\n(https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29510/211259ov.pdf)\nFederal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Small Business Credit Survey: 2020 Report on Employer\nFirms, 2020.\n(https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/FedSmallBusiness/files/2020/2020-sbcs-employer-firmsreport)\nFinancial Stability Board, “FSB Work Programme for 2020,” December 17, 2019.\n(https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P171219.pdf)\nFrost, Jon, Leonardo Gambacorta, Yi Huang, Hyun Song Shin, and Pablo Zbinden, “BigTech and the\nChanging Structure of Financial Intermediation,” BIS Working Paper No. 779, April 2019.\n(https://www.bis.org/publ/work779.htm)\nGovernment Accountability Office, “Fair Lending: Race and Gender Data Are Limited for Nonmortgage\nLending,” Report to Congressional Requesters, GAO-08-698, June 2008.\n\n\f14\n(https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-698)\nHogarth, Jeanne M., Chris E.

In my brief remarks today, I will give an overview of the changes to our monetary\npolicy strategy that the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the\nFederal Reserve, recently announced and discuss their implications for monetary policy going forward.\nAs always, the views I will present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRevised Statement on Long-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\nIn early 2019, the FOMC began a review of our framework for setting monetary policy – the strategy,\ntools, and communications we use in setting policy in pursuit of the monetary policy goals given to us by\nthe U.S. Congress. These goals are maximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term\ninterest rates. When prices are stable and the economy is at full employment, long-term interest rates are\ntypically at moderate levels. So it is often said that the U.S. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate\nof price stability and maximum employment. The framework review was informed by our experience\nduring and after the Great Recession, by economic theory and empirical analysis, and by consultations\nwith academic researchers and practitioners at research conferences. It was also informed by\nconversations with the public at large, through a series of Fed Listens events held across the country.1\nThe main conclusions of the review are captured in our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy, which the FOMC approved this August.\n\nThe framework review was undertaken in light of changes in the economic environment that have\nemerged since the FOMC’s first strategy statement was published in 2012. One change with important\nimplications for monetary policy is the decline in the U.S. and other advanced economies in the general\n1\n\nThe revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as well as other materials pertaining to\nthe review, is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategytools-and-communications.htm.\n\n\f2\nlevel of interest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline reflects several\nfactors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity\ngrowth. It means that the level of the federal funds rate, the policy rate in the U.S., consistent with\nmaximum employment and price stability is now lower than it has been in the past. This means that\nduring economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds rate will be constrained by its\neffective lower bound, and the FOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using its\ntraditional policy tool. This constraint, being understood by households, businesses, and financial\nmarkets, imparts a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations, and so increases the downside\nrisks to achieving our policy goals.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment with implications for monetary policy pertains to inflation\ndynamics. Resource slack in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with\nactual inflation than in the past, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation\noutcomes. This means it is even more important that inflation expectations remain well anchored at\nlevels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal. If expectations move below these levels, then it is\nmore likely that inflation will run below our goal, which would then result in even less policy space in a\nlow-interest-rate environment.\n\nThese changes in the economic environment warranted asking ourselves whether there were revisions to\nour monetary policy strategy that would make it more effective in promoting our policy goals. The\nreview led us to conclude that the answer was yes. And we made changes to our approach to both the\ninflation goal and the employment goal, which are summarized in our revised strategy statement.\n\nRevised Strategy Statement: Inflation Goal\nRegarding our approach to inflation, the first thing I want to note is something that did not change. The\nFOMC has reaffirmed the explicit inflation target first announced in 2012, namely, that a longer-run\n\n\f3\ninflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our statutory mandate. But our strategy statement is\nnow more explicit about how we will go about achieving this inflation goal. In particular, after periods in\nwhich inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we will likely aim to have inflation run\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. Doing so will help anchor inflation expectations , a main\ndeterminant of actual inflation, at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.\n\nThis new language is a stronger statement than we have made in the past as we have struggled to\neffectively convey that the longer-run goal of 2 percent should not be interpreted as a ceiling. In the past,\nmany of us on the FOMC have indicated that we would be comfortable with inflation running above 2\npercent for a time after it has run low for some time – a type of opportunistic reinflation. But now we are\ngoing to be deliberate rather than opportunistic. As the revised strategy indicates, after inflation has been\nrunning persistently below 2 percent, not only will we tolerate serendipitous shocks that move inflation\nabove 2 percent, but we will likely set policy with the intention of moving inflation moderately above 2\npercent for some time. The implication is that monetary policy will be somewhat more accommodative\nthan in the past when inflation has been running persistently low in order to reach our longer-run inflation\ngoal.\n\nRevised Strategy Statement: Employment Goal\nRegarding our employment goal, I view the changes we made in the strategy statement as an\nacknowledgment of the uncertainty around assessments of the level of maximum employment and a\nclarification to our approach to achieving this goal. This is consistent with something I have advocated\nfor some time: that policy communications should acknowledge uncertainty. 2 In the recent expansion, we\nsaw that employment growth could be stronger and the unemployment rate lower without generating\ninflation than one would have thought possible based on past decades of experience. Over the expansion,\nSee, e.g., Loretta J. Mester, “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” remarks at the Shadow Open Market Committee Fall\nMeeting, New York, NY, October 7, 2016. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp20161007-acknowledging-uncertainty.aspx)\n2\n\n\f4\nit took time to learn about these structural changes in the economy, and as the FOMC learned, its\nassessments of the longer-run unemployment rate came down significantly over time. Unfortunately, this\ntime-to-learn, combined with the previous strategy statement’s references to “deviations” of employment\nfrom maximum employment, has been misinterpreted by some as suggesting that the FOMC, at times,\ntakes deliberate policy action to bring employment down independently of our inflation goal. This is not\nthe case. The benefits of a strong labor market in fostering economic inclusion are clear.\n\nChanges in the economy underscore the difficulties in using the Phillips curve model to forecast inflation\nor to assess maximum employment in real time. The revised strategy statement clarifies that in the\nabsence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, strong employment is not a concern and\nmonetary policy will not react to it. This approach is consistent with the recent behavior of the FOMC.\nEstimates of simple monetary policy rules by the Cleveland Fed staff indicate that FOMC participants put\nless weight on the unemployment rate in determining the appropriate policy path in the last two years of\nthe most recent economic expansion than they did earlier in the expansion. 3\n\nAn Area for Further Work: Systematic Policymaking and Communications\nThe new strategy statement will guide FOMC monetary policy decisions both during and beyond the\npandemic. But bringing the new strategy to bear in our policymaking is a work in progress. So I will end\nmy remarks by discussing two areas for further work: first, systematic policymaking and\ncommunications, and second, the nexus between financial stability and monetary policy.\n\nSee Edward S. Knotek II, “Changing Policy Rule Parameters Implied by the Median SEP Paths,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland Economic Commentary Number 2019-06, April 15, 2019.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economiccommentaries/ec-201906-changing-policy-rule-parameters)\n3\n\n\f5\nOur September FOMC statement was the first to incorporate the new strategy.4 The statement indicated\nthat because inflation has been running persistently low, we will be aiming to achieve inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time and that we expect to maintain the current funds rate target\nrange of 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with our assessment\nof maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2\npercent for some time. As of September, the forecasts of FOMC participants, as indicated in the\nSummary of Economic Projections, showed that the majority thought it would not be appropriate to raise\nrates until after 2023. 5 However, importantly, the guidance is based on the state of the economy and not\non calendar dates. The economy could evolve so that the stipulated inflation and employment conditions\nare achieved earlier or later than currently projected, in which case, the anticipated policy path would\nappropriately adjust.\n\nI strongly believe that clear policy communications are an important part of effective monetary\npolicymaking. When the public has a better understanding of the goals and rationale for monetary policy\ndecisions, they are better able to hold policymakers accountable for their actions. Clear communication\nalso makes monetary policy itself more effective by providing the public with information about the\neconomic outlook and aligning the public’s expectations about future policy actions. When households,\nbusinesses, and investors have a better sense of how monetary policy is likely to change conditional on\nthe outlook, they can make better economic and financial decisions.\n\nEven though the September statement incorporated some aspects of the new strategy, Fed watchers and\nothers have asked for more context about what indicators the FOMC would be using to assess whether\nlabor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment, and how far above 2 percent would\nthe FOMC aim for inflation to be and for how long. While the context has changed, similar kinds of\n\n4\n\nThe September FOMC meeting statement is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916a.htm.\n5\n\nThe September Summary of Economic Projections is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200916ep.htm.\n\n\f6\nquestions about how the FOMC assessed whether or not its goals had been met were asked when we\noperated under the previous strategy as well. Work still needs to be done to ensure that our policy\ndecisions are systematically guided by our outlook and risks around the outlook and that our policy\ncommunications convey a good sense of the FOMC’s reaction function, especially now under the new\nstrategy.\n\nThe revised strategy leans heavily on the relationship between inflation expectations, inflation, and the\nability of monetary policy to influence both, but there is still much to learn about inflation dynamics and\ninflation expectations. The benefits of the move to a type of make-up strategy for inflation – that is,\nrunning policy to achieve inflation somewhat above 2 percent for a time after it has run persistently low –\ndepend on our ability to communicate that we have shifted to and will pursue this new strategy and our\nability to explain clearly how the new strategy differs from the old.\n\nRecent research from the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research suggests that we may have\nfurther to go on this score. Center researchers used the Cleveland Fed’s daily national survey of\nconsumers to examine the effect of Chair Jay Powell’s announcement of the new strategy on households’\nunderstanding of monetary policy and their expectations of inflation. 6 They obtained four interesting\nresults.\n\nFirst, while there was a surge in news coverage about monetary policy around the time of the Chair’s\nspeech, there was only a small increase in the number of respondents who reported having heard news\nabout monetary policy; most people did not recall anything.\n\nOlivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Edward S. Knotek II, and Raphael Schoenle, “Average Inflation Targeting\nand Household Expectations,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper 20-26, September 18, 2020.\n(https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202026)\n6\n\n\f7\nSecond, among the small group who had heard news, there was a sense that something had changed, but\nlittle recognition of what had changed in the approach to monetary policy.\n\nThird, there is considerable confusion about our goals: when presented with a list of options, more\nrespondents said that the Fed sets monetary policy with the aim of maintaining a strong dollar or keeping\ninterest rates low to reduce the government’s cost of borrowing than said we set policy to promote\nmaximum employment and price stability.\n\nFourth, when some individuals were selected at random and given information about average inflation\ntargeting, their expectations about future inflation over the next five years were no different than those of\nindividuals who were, instead, given information about traditional inflation targeting.\n\nOf course, it is important to remember that some of the gains from the new strategy will likely come from\nthe expectations and actions of sophisticated financial market participants who closely follow monetary\npolicy, thereby helping policy to transmit throughout the economy. It is also true that the survey was\ntaken over only a short period following the announcement, and as anyone who has ever taught or been a\nstudent knows, it takes time to master new material. Still, the results do suggest that more work needs to\nbe done on policy communications to ensure that households will understand the policy strategy and then\nincorporate it into their expectations and actions.\n\nAnother Area for Further Work: Financial Stability and Monetary Policy\nA second area that needs further work is understanding the nexus between monetary policy and financial\nstability. Our revised strategy statement explicitly acknowledges that sustainably achieving maximum\nemployment and price stability depends on a stable financial system. As part of its framework review, the\nFOMC considered the interactions between financial stability and monetary policy, particularly in the\n\n\f8\ncurrent environment of low neutral interest rates. 7 While monetary policy that leads to a stable\nmacroeconomy encourages financial stability, it is also possible that in an environment with low neutral\nrates, a persistently accommodative monetary policy could, in some cases, increase the vulnerabilities of\nthe financial system by encouraging higher levels of borrowing and financial leverage, increased\nvaluation pressures, and search-for-yield behavior. How best to approach the nexus between monetary\npolicy and financial stability in a low-interest-rate world deserves more consideration.\n\nAs indicated in the minutes of the January 2020 FOMC meeting, in discussing the framework, most\nFOMC participants agreed that supervisory, regulatory, and mac roprudential tools, including the\ncountercyclical capital buffer and stress tests, should be the primary way to address financial stability\nrisks rather than using monetary policy. But in the U.S., there are few countercyclical tools and they are\nnot designed to address vulnerabilities outside of the banking system. Therefore, there may be certain\ncircumstances where monetary policy may need to be adjusted in order to mitigate risks to financial\nstability. But when and how to do that needs further study. In addition, more study is needed of the\ntradeoffs and complementarities among our three sets of relevant polic ies: monetary policy,\nmacroprudential policy, and microprudential policy, which includes tools, such as capital and liquidity\nrequirements, that work throughout the business and financial cycles. As our framework review did with\nmonetary policy, the implications of a low-interest-rate world for both macroprudential policy and\nmicroprudential policy should be considered.\n\n7\n\nSee a summary of the discussion in the minutes to the January 2020 FOMC meeting at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200129.htm.\n\n\f"

Mester*\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGreater Cleveland Partnership Annual Meeting\n(videotaped October 6, 2020)\nOctober 14, 2020\n\n*\n\nThe views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fPage 1 of 4\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today. Let me start by congratulating Joe Roman on his upcoming\nretirement as president and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Partnership. Joe was one of the first civic\nleaders I met when I moved to Cleveland in 2014. From our very first conversation, it was clear that Joe\nwas passionate about Cleveland. Over his entire career, he has been a strong advocate for our region and\na strong adherent to the view that by working together, business, civic, and community leaders can get\nimportant things done. I am sure that Joe will show that same dedication and optimism in his new\nendeavors and I wish him well.\n\nWishing someone well has taken on new meaning this year. The coronavirus pandemic is a global public\nhealth crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all over the world. The pandemic was an\nunprecedented shock to the economy – the largest in most of our lifetimes.\n\nIn March, all but essential economic activity shut down when the country took aggressive social\ndistancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to\nincrease its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and\ntreatments.\n\n[FIGURE 1. Output and Employment through Q2] In the second quarter of the year, real output\ndeclined at a rate of about 31 percent measured on an annual basis. In just the two months of March and\nApril, payroll jobs dropped by 22 million. That is about the same number of jobs that the economy had\nadded over the entire recent expansion that lasted over 10 years. The unemployment rate, which had been\nat a fifty-year low of 3.5 percent in February, spiked to 14.7 percent in April. And despite supply\ndisruptions, inflation moved down with the drop in demand.\n\n\fPage 2 of 4\nIn May, as public health statistics began to improve, many parts of the country began to relax some of\ntheir stay-at-home restrictions, and the economy began to reopen. Activity, hiring, and inflation picked\nup – all good news. But there is quite a bit of difference across sectors.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive sectors, like housing and autos, have seen the sharpest rebounds. Other sectors,\nespecially service sectors like travel, hospitality, and leisure, are still very depressed.\n\n[Figure 2. Employment and Unemployment] September’s jobs report shows a continued pickup in\nhiring, although at a slower pace than in the summer. We have made up a little over half of the jobs lost\nin March and April as people returned to work from temporary furlough. But that still means we are\ndown almost 11 million jobs from February’s level. The unemployment rate fell to just under 8 percent\n(7.9 percent) in September, better than expected. But part of that drop reflects a drop in labor force\nparticipation, which remains well below February’s level.\n\n[Figure 3. Re-employment Rates by Income] It is clear that the adverse effects of the pandemic have\nnot been evenly distributed. They have been borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income\nand minority workers and communities; those who do not have the opportunity to work from home; those\nwho do not live in areas with reliable telecommunications and internet services or access to adequate\nhealthcare; and the smaller of small businesses.\n\nRehiring by employers has been slower for lower-income workers than for higher-income workers – at\nthe national level and in Cuyahoga county.\n\n[Figure 4. Progress on Unemployment by Race/Ethnicity and Educational Attainment] Over the\ncourse of the reopening, there has been less progress on reducing the unemployment rate for minorities\nthan for whites and for those with lower levels of education compared with those with higher levels .\n\n\fPage 3 of 4\n\nSo while the economy is recovering, it is still in a deep hole. Employment is about where it was in the\nmiddle of 2015 – so we’ve lost more than five years of job growth. Even if growth rebounds in the third\nquarter at the same pace at which it contracted in the second quarter, the level of output will be about\nwhere it was at the end of 2017, so the economy will have lost almost three years of output growth.\n\nBoth monetary policy and fiscal policy reacted swiftly and strongly to support the economy thus far. We\nhave in place very accommodative monetary policy: the fed funds rate is at its effective lower bound, we\nare purchasing Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, we have a number of liquidity and\nlending facilities in place to ensure that markets continue to function and that credit continues to flow to\nbusinesses and households, and we have temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements on\nbanks so they have greater capacity to lend.\n\nFiscal policy actions have included grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic,\nand states and municipalities; expanded unemployment benefits; and the Paycheck Protection Program,\nwhich offered loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their payrolls.\n\nIt will take some time to move from the somewhat fragile, disparate recovery we have now to a more\nsustainable, broader recovery. The path of the recovery is likely to be bumpy, with some fits and starts\nand uneven progress. It will take time for workers who have lost jobs to find new ones, either at another\nfirm in their current industry or in a new industry after they retrain. The commercial real estate mar ket\nhas been particularly hard hit. There was already a trend toward online shopping and remote work; the\npandemic has greatly accelerated that trend. The structural changes in the commercial real estate market\nwill take some time to sort out.\n\nProvided we continue to make progress on controlling the virus, activity and hiring will continue to\n\n\fPage 4 of 4\nexpand. By the end of this year, I expect that output will still be somewhat below its level at the end of\nlast year; that the unemployment rate will remain in the high single digits; and that inflation will be well\nbelow our longer-run 2 percent goal. The recovery should continue over the next couple of years\nprovided it is supported by very accommodative monetary policy and further fiscal policy actions . Fiscal\npolicy in the form of aid to households and small businesses most affected by the pandemic and to states\nand municipal governments, and increased investment in testing, contract tracing, treatment, and vaccine\ndevelopment would provide important support for the recovery.\n\nOf course, there is a lot of uncertainty around the forecast. It is highly dependent on the virus and our\nactions to control its spread. It is easy to think of downside scenarios. Many of our contacts in the\nregion, across all sectors, tell us that uncertainty about the course of the virus and about whether there is\ngoing to be additional fiscal support is clouding their outlook and holding back larger investments.\n\nBut there are upside scenarios as well. Development of a safe and effective vaccine that people have\nconfidence in and that can be widely distributed fairly quickly would be very positive for the outlook. In\naddition, we should not discount the fact that the pickup in activity we have seen so far has exceeded\nexpectations. It is a good reminder that we should never count out the resiliency of the U.S. economy and\nthe American people.\n\n\fCharts for\n“An Update on the Effects of the Pandemic\non the Economy”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nEconomic Equality Webinar\nAfrican American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania\nPittsburgh, PA\n(via videoconference)\nSeptember 28, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Doris Carson Williams and the members of the African American Chamber of Commerce of\nWestern Pennsylvania for the opportunity to speak with you today. As you may know, Doris is a member\nof the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. In the best of times, the valuable\ninsights provided by Doris, her fellow directors, and all of our contacts help us assess economic\nconditions and formulate monetary policy. But these are not the best of times. And I cannot overstate the\nimportance of the information that Doris and our other contacts are providing – real-time, on-the-ground\nreconnaissance on how businesses and households are faring during the evolving pandemic. While the\noutlook remains uncertain, one thing I am certain of is that we have a better understanding of the\neconomic impacts of the pandemic because of the public service of our directors and contacts. So, thank\nyou, Doris.\n\nIt is clear that the adverse effects of the pandemic have not been evenly distributed. They have been\nborne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority workers and communities;\nthose who do not have the opportunity to work from home; those who do not live in areas with reliable\ntelecommunications and internet services or access to adequate healthcare; and the smaller of small\nbusinesses. 1 Indeed, the results from a recent Fed survey show that between March and July, a larger\npercentage of low-income workers, less educated workers, and Black and Hispanic workers were laid off\ncompared to higher-income, more educated, and white workers. Rehiring by employers has been slower\nfor lower-income workers than for higher-income workers. 2 In addition, from February to April, the\n\nIn these remarks, I will use the term “race” to refer to race and ethnicity, and “Hispanic” to refer to Hispanic and\nLatinx.\n1\n\n2\n\nResults from the recently released Board of Governors survey on the economic well-being of households (Table 1,\np. 3 of Board of Governors, September 2020) show that between March and July, 28 percent of workers in families\nmaking less than $40,000 a year were laid off (including being told not to work any hours), considerably higher than\nthe 13 percent of workers from families with incomes over $100,000 a year. Furthermore, a quarter of workers in\nlow-income families who experienced a layoff reported that they had returned to work for the same employer, while\nnearly 40 percent of high-income workers did so. Twenty-three percent of workers with a high school diploma or\nless were laid off between March and July, compared to 13 percent of workers with a college degree or more, and 22\npercent of Black workers and 23 percent of Hispanic workers were laid off compared to 18 percent of white\nworkers.\n\n\f2\nnumber of active small business owners dropped by 3.3 million, a record 22 percent decline. 3 Compared\nto small firms overall, Black-owned businesses have been twice as likely to close and Hispanic-owned\nbusinesses have been one-and-a-half times as likely to close. It is distressing to see the disparate impact\nof the pandemic, but the differences in economic outcomes did not start with COVID-19. There were\nalready long-standing economic disparities in our economy.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will step back from the effects of the pandemic per se and examine the differences\nin economic opportunity that so many in America still experience at every phase of their lives. I will\nconclude with some thoughts, based on the research, on where we might focus in order to reduce these\ngaps and promote economic inclusion. As always, the views I will present are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nWhy Economic Inclusion Matters\nThe Federal Reserve System’s mission is to promote a healthy economy and stable financial system in the\nUnited States. Our monetary policy decisions, our actions as supervisors and regulators of banks, our role\nin the payments system, and our efforts to promote community development in low- and moderateincome areas all contribute to achieving a well-functioning economy and financial system in which\neveryone can participate. Opportunity and inclusion are important for achieving a strong economy, and\nthe recently announced revision to the Fed’s strategy for setting monetary policy explicitly states that we\nview maximum employment, one part of our statutory mandate, as a broad-based and inclusive goal.\n\nUnfortunately, today, the U.S. economy does not offer the same opportunities to all. There are racial\ndisparities in educational attainment, labor market outcomes, and access to credit. People born into areas\n3\n\nSee Fairlie (2020). Researchers at the New York Fed point to a number of contributing factors, including these\nfirms’ weaker financial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and funding gaps that existed prior to the pandemic,\nplus less access to federal relief funds . See Mills and Battisto (2020).\n\n\f3\nof concentrated poverty or predominantly minority areas are disadvantaged over their entire lifetimes, and\nso are their children. Unless actions are taken to promote an inclusive economy – one in which people\nhave the chance to move themselves and their families out of poverty, one in which systemic racism does\nnot limit opportunities, and one in which all people can fully participate – the U.S. economy will not be\nable to live up to its full potential and the country will suffer.\n\nUpward Mobility\n[Figure 1] All parents want to know that their children will be better off financially than they are. An\nimportant part of the American Dream is the idea that anyone can climb up the ladder through hard work\nand perseverance. But upward mobility – the probability that a child will be better off economically than\nhis or her parents – has fallen sharply in the U.S. since World War II. At last year’s Cleveland Fed Policy\nSummit, Harvard professor Raj Chetty presented some of his seminal research on income mobility. 4\nAround 90 percent of children born in 1940 earned more at age 30 than their parents did. 5 By the mid1980s, only about 50 percent did. And, although not shown in the figure, the largest declines have been\nin the middle class.\n\n[Figure 2] Many factors have contributed to this decline. One contributor is rising income inequality,\nwhich leads to advantages in terms of education and other social factors for those in the higher-income\ngroups compared to those in the bottom. Since the 1960s, the median level of income, adjusted for\ninflation, has risen over time, from about $48,000 in 1967 to about $69,000 in 2019. But those in the top\n10 percent of the income distribution have enjoyed sharper gains than those in the bottom 10 percent.\nThe U.S. has one of the lowest rates of intergenerational mobility among advanced economies and more\npronounced income inequality. 6\n\n4\n\nChetty and Williams (2019).\n\n5\n\nChetty, et al. (2017).\n\n6\n\nCorak (2013).\n\n\f4\n\n[Figure 3] To get the full picture, we need to look at disaggregated data. 7 Research by Chetty and his coauthors shows that upward mobility depends not only on the family’s characteristics but also on\nneighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, racial integration, the quality of schools, and\naccess to social services. 8 On this map, areas of relatively high intergenerational mobility are shown in\nshades of blue-green. Children who grew up in these places earn higher average income in their midthirties than their parents did at the same age. Shades of red indicate areas of low intergenerational\nmobility: places where children have not progressed very far in terms of income relative to their parents.\nAn important insight is that even areas with fairly good economies in terms of stronger output growth and\njob growth, like some places in the South, have not necessarily produced high levels of upward mobility\nfor the children growing up there. Strong economic factors certainly help, but they are not a panacea.\n\n[Figure 4] In Pittsburgh, mobility differs quite a bit across the city, and if you were to drill down even\nfurther, you would see differences even within neighborhoods.\n\nIn fact, research shows that moving a child from a low -mobility neighborhood to a high-mobility\nneighborhood can have profound effects on his or her future economic outcomes.9 This is true not only in\nthe U.S., but also in countries, like Australia, where income inequality is lower than it is here. 10\n\nSo place matters. But so does race. Research by Chetty and co-authors has found that there is a gap in\n\n7\n\nMaps showing income mobility at the zip code level for different levels of income, race, and gender are available\nat https://www.OpportunityAtlas.org, a collaboration between the U.S. Census Bureau and Opportunity Insights.\nThe map shown here is based on the average income at age 35 of a child whose parents earned in the 25 th percentile\nof the income distribution, in other words, in low-income families.\n8\n\nSee Chetty and Hendren (2018), Chetty, et al. (2018, revised 2020), and Chetty an d Williams (2019).\n\n9\n\nThe effect is found for children who move by the age of 13; it does not apply to adults. Each year of exposure to a\nbetter neighborhood has a greater benefit for the child. See Chetty, et al. (2018, revised 2020) and Chetty and\nHendren (2018).\n10\n\nOne study of Australia found that where a child grows up, especially in his or her teenage years, has a causal\neffect on adult outcomes. See Deutscher (2020).\n\n\f5\nearnings between Black males and white males even if their parents were at the same income level and\nthey grew up in the same neighborhood. 11\n\n[Figure 5] The research also shows that even conditional on where a child grows up, Blacks have a\nsignificantly lower chance of moving up in the income distribution than whites or Hispanics and a higher\nchance of moving down in the distribution. Strikingly, Blacks who happen to have been born to parents\nin the highest income quintile are almost as likely to move down to the lowest quintile as to stay in the\nhighest one.\n\nGaps in Income and Net Worth\n[Figure 6] According to the most recent Federal Reserve triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, in 2016,\nmedian income for white households was about 1-3/4 times that of Black families and 1-1/2 times that of\nHispanic families. 12 Earnings are an important driver of family net worth (financial and nonfinancial\nassets, like homes and autos, minus debt). 13 Racial gaps in net worth are much larger than income gaps:\nthe median net worth of white families in 2016 was almost 10 times as high as that of Black families and\nabout 8 times as high as that of Hispanic families. 14 These gaps are not a recent phenomenon: they have\nbeen around for decades.\n\n11\n\nControlling for parental income, in adulthood, Black males end up having lower earnings than white males in 99\npercent of Census tracts in the U.S. For those who grew up in neighborhoods of low poverty and higher rent, both\nBlack and white males have better outcomes, but the gap between them is greater than in high poverty areas. The\ngap is smaller when fathers are present and when measures of racial bias are lower. See Chetty, et al. (2020).\n12\n\nSee the Federal Reserve System 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) (2017). In 2016 dollars, the median\nincome in 2016 for white, Black, and Hispanic families were $61,000, $35,000, and $38,000, respectively .\n13\n14\n\nFor further discussion of racial net worth disparities over time, see Aliprantis, Carroll, and Young (2019).\n\nAccording to the SCF data, in 2016 dollars, the median net worth in 2016 of white, Black, and Hispanic families\nwere $171,000, $17,600, and $20,700, respectively.\n\n\f6\nGaps over the Life Cycle: Early Years\n[Figure 7] Many factors play a role in these gaps in income and net worth; in fact, if we look over a\nperson’s life, racial gaps exist every step of the way. From the beginning of life, Black children have only\nhalf the chance of reaching their first birthday compared to either white or Hispanic children. These gaps\nin infant mortality have existed over many years, and even if you control for the educational level of the\nmother, the gaps remain.\n\nBlack and white children tend to grow up in different neighborhoods, and this racial stratification leads to\nother risks that can affect longer-term economic outcomes. One example is children’s lead toxicity – the\namount of lead in one’s bloodstream – which at elevated levels causes brain damage and has significant\nadverse effects on a child’s ability to learn. A study of Chicago neighborhoods found that even though\nlead poisoning in children has fallen significantly over time as a result of public health policy, it is still\nthe case that those neighborhoods with the highest levels of toxicity are predominantly Black\nneighborhoods. 15\n\n[Figure 8] While lead poses one significant disadvantage to learning, lack of internet connectivity poses\nanother. Well before the coronavirus pandemic, access to the internet was an important avenue for\neducation, as well as for healthcare and job access. Usage of broadband at home is comparatively higher\nfor whites, those with higher incomes, and those in urban and suburban areas.16 Blacks and Hispanics are\nless likely to have a computer or broadband at home than whites, and when they do have a computer, they\nare less likely to have broadband service at home. 17 This puts Black and Hispanic families at a\n\n15\n\nSee Sampson and Winter (2016).\n\n16\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center survey data, in 2019, usage of broadband at home was 79 percent of whites, 66\npercent of Blacks, and 61 percent of Hispanics; 92 percent for those earning $75,000 or more per year and 56\npercent for those earning less than $30,000 per year; 75 percent for those in urban areas, 79 percent for those in\nsuburban areas, and 63 percent for those in rural communities. See Pew Research Center (2019).\n17\n\nEstimates for 2019 from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that about 2 percent of Asian households, 4 percent of\nwhite households, 4 percent of Hispanic households, and 7 percent of Black households do not have a computer at\nhome. About 95 percent of Asian households, 90 percent of white households, 88 percent of Hispanic households,\nand 84 percent of Black households have a computer and broadband at home. See U.S. Census Bureau, American\n\n\f7\ndisadvantage, especially now, given the pandemic, when remote in-home learning is the norm rather than\nthe exception.\n\n[Figure 9] In fact, during the spring, students in lower-income areas completed significantly fewer math\ncourses online than those in higher-income areas. 18 If these differences continue, there could be lasting\neffects on students’ earning potential throughout their lives, leading to further inequality.\n\nGaps over the Life Cycle: College Ages\n[Figure 10] Indeed, the accumulation of human capital via education is an important path to economic\ninclusion and opportunity, resulting in better economic outcomes for individuals, households, and the\ncountry at large. The median income for families whose head has a college degree is more than twice as\nhigh as that of a family whose head has only a high school diploma. Similarly, median net worth is\nconsiderably higher for those with a college degree. 19\n\n[Figure 11] While our workforce as a whole has become more educated over time, educational attainment\ndiffers by race, as does the likelihood of completing a degree. In the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances,\n39 percent of white heads of household held a college degree compared to 23 percent of Black heads of\nhousehold and 17 percent of Hispanic heads of household. 20\n\nCost can be an important barrier to entering college, particularly for those coming from lower-income\nfamilies. The average cost of tuition and fees at four-year institutions is now over $16,000 a year, and\n\nCommunity Survey, Subject Table S2802, 2019 1-year estimates. (Note: These estimates on broadband are higher\nthan those from Pew, cited in footnote 16, which pertain to usage.)\n18\n\nSee the Zearn math platform data at Opportunity Insights: Economic Tracker, and Chetty, et al. (2020).\n\n19\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve System 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, in 2016, the median income of\nfamilies whose head has a college degree was $90,000 compared with $40,000 for families whose head had only a\nhigh school diploma. See Federal Reserve System (2017).\n20\n\nSee Dettling, et al. (2017).\n\n\f8\nadjusted for inflation, it has more than doubled over the past three decades. 21 According to the Fed’s\nsurvey on economic well-being, as of late 2019, over 40 percent of those who went to college had taken\non debt for their education and about half of those people still owe money on this debt. 22 New York Fed\nanalysis shows that compared to borrowers in majority white areas, those in majority Black areas have\nhigher student loan balances and those in majority Black and majority Hispanic areas have higher rates of\ndefault on those loans. 23 These defaults can follow a person over time, making it harder to access credit\nin the future.\n\n[Figure 12] For those students who do find the financial means to enter college, the likelihood of\ncompleting a degree differs by type of institution and by race. The completion rates have remained\nparticularly low at for-profit institutions. At both public and nonprofit private institutions, the graduation\nrates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of Blacks remain well below\nthose of these other groups and have shown no progress over time.\n\nSatisfaction with college also varies by race. About 70 percent of white recipients of bachelor’s degrees\nfelt that their education was worth the cost, but only slightly more than half of Black recipients did. 24\n\nGaps over the Life Cycle: Earning Years – Labor Markets and Credit Markets\n[Figure 13] The differences in educational attainment across races follow people as they enter the\nworkforce. There are significant racial disparities in labor market outcomes. Unemployment rates among\nBlacks and Hispanics have been chronically above those of whites and Asians, and Blacks and Hispanics\nare more likely to lose their jobs during recessions. Although some progress had been made over the long\n\n21\n\nSee Digest of Education Statistics.\n\n22\n\nSee pp. 43-46, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (May 2020).\n\n23\n\nSee Chakrabarti, Nober, and van der Klaauw (2020).\n\n24\n\nSee Figure 28, p. 39, in Board of Governors (May 2020).\n\n\f9\neconomic expansion that ended in February, racial disparities remained. Research from Fed economists\nindicates that while lower educational attainment explains much of the difference in the unemployment\nexperience of Hispanics, this is not true for the Black-white gap. In fact, observable characteristics, like\neducation, age, or marital status, cannot fully account for the higher and more cyclical unemployment of\nBlacks relative to whites. 25\n\n[Figure 14] These long-standing labor market disparities spill over in other ways that limit Black\nhouseholds’ ability to fully participate in the economy. Worse and more volatile labor market outcomes\nmake it harder for nonwhite families to build assets and achieve sound financial health.\n\nFor those families that are able to get a mortgage, job insecurity makes the household less financially\nresilient and raises the risk that the household might fall behind on its mortgage or even default, putting\nthe family’s longer-term financial health at risk. Housing continues to be an important way for families to\nbuild wealth, but even controlling for income and other factors related to creditworthiness, there is a\nrising gap between the homeownership rate of whites and Blacks. This indicates that systemic racial\ndifferences in access to credit have persisted well after enactment of fair housing and lending legislation\nin the 1970s meant to address the scourge of redlining and discrimination in credit markets. 26,27\n\n[Figure 15] In terms of access to financial services, Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have a bank\naccount and more likely to rely on alternative financial services such as money orders and check cashing\nservices than whites. Being unbanked or underbanked makes it harder for these families to build a credit\nhistory. 28\n\n25\n\nSee Cajner, et al. (2017).\n\n26\n\nSee also Choi (2020).\n\n27\n\nFor documentation and discussion of the racial gaps in homeownership rates, see Haughwout, et al. (2020).\n\n28\n\nSee Table 11, p. 28, in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (May 2020). Unbanked is defined as\nnot having a checking, savings, or money market account. Underbanked is defined as having a checking, savings, or\n\n\f10\n\nThe use of bank financing by small businesses also varies significantly with the race of the owner.\nAccording to the Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey, compared to small firms with white ownership,\nthose with Black ownership were half as likely to have obtained financing from a bank in the past five\nyears, relying more on online lenders, which, according to survey respondents, provide less satisfactory\nservice. 29\n\nMuch Needs to Be Done to Address Economic Disparities and Promote Economic Inclusion\nEliminating racial and economic disparities, which have lasted over generations, is no easy task. It will\ntake concerted action at the individual, professional, and institutional level to change structures and\nsystems that perpetuate these gaps. But this work needs to be done so that all people have the opportunity\nto fully participate in the U.S. economy. The research I discussed today points to four priorities.\n\nInvesting in neighborhoods and communities must be a priority. Place matters and at smaller\ngeographical divisions than might be expected. Localized, neighborhood-based community development\nwork and investments aimed at reducing poverty rates, improving school quality and housing choices, and\nrevitalizing neighborhoods can offer families more stability. Focusing on improving neighborhoods can\nhave results. In 2016, the Cleveland Fed convened all those interested in contributing to the efforts of the\nLead Safe Cleveland Coalition and the city of Cleveland in preventing lead poisoning in the city. 30 And\nlast July, Cleveland City Council passed an important piece of legislation requiring, among other\nprovisions, that landlords pay for private inspections and certifications that their occupied units are lead-\n\nmoney market account but having used one of these alternative financial services: money order, check cashing\nservice, pawn shop loan, auto title loan, payday loan, paycheck advance, or tax refund advance.\nAccording to the Fed’s most recent Small Business Credit Survey of firms with 1-499 employees, 46 percent of\nfirms with white ownership, 32 percent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 23 percent of firms with Black\nownership had obtained financing from a bank in the past five years; 19 percent of firms with white ownership, 22\npercent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 27 percent of firms with Black ownership had obtained financing\nfrom an online lender in the past five years. See Federal Reserve System (2020), p. 9.\n29\n\n30\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2016).\n\n\f11\nsafe, with penalties for noncompliance. 31\n\nClosing the digital divide must be a priority. Among communities with a population of 100,000 or more,\nthe city of Cleveland has among the lowest home broadband access in the nation. 32 Business leaders\nthrough the Greater Cleveland Partnership are working with the city’s governmental leaders and other\norganizations to ensure that all residents in the Greater Cleveland area have access to in-home highquality broadband and devices to access it. Similar work is being done in Pittsburgh by the Allegheny\nConference on Community Development.\n\nIncreasing access to high-quality education at all levels must be a priority. Education is a significant\navenue to economic opportunity. Recognizing that a higher-skilled workforce benefits communities,\nOhio has a project underway to try to increase educational attainment. 33 Issues with cost and preparation\nneed to be addressed. Respondents to recent Fed surveys said that the cost of college and family\nobligations are among the reasons they did not complete their degree. 34 Low grades were also cited as a\nreason. Adequate preparation for college has an impact on completion rates and likely on satisfaction.\nResearch is increasingly pointing to the fact that children who fall behind have difficulty catching up. 35\nTutoring and mentoring throughout a student’s elementary, high school, and college years can support a\nstudent through to earning a degree.\n\n31\n\nSee Dissell and Zeltner (2019).\n\n32\n\nThe data are available in Table GCT2801, U.S. Census American Community Survey (2019). In the city of\nCleveland, 69.3 percent of households have a broadband internet subscription. Only Lakewood Township, Ocean\nCounty, N.J. has lower internet connectivity, at 58.9 percent. The numbers for the U.S. and for the city of Pittsburgh\nare 86.4 percent and 86.5 percent, respectively.\n33\nOhio Excels, partnering with the Complete to Compete Ohio Coalition, has developed a statewide action plan to\nincrease postsecondary educational attainment in the state. See Ohio Excels (2020) and Wright -McGowan (2020).\n34\n\nAccording to the Fed survey of economic well-being, of those respondents who could not complete their\nassociate’s or bachelor’s degree, among other reasons, 56 percent said it was because it was too expensive, 52\npercent said it was because they needed to earn money to take care of their family, and 22 percent said it was\nbecause of low grades. Respondents could choose more than one reason. See Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (May 2020), Table 23, p. 41.\n35\n\nSee Mester (2015).\n\n\f12\n\nIn addition, financial literacy should be included in elementary and high school curricula. Such courses\nwill give students the skills to evaluate the various options for financing their education, determine which\ntypes of educational institutions offer a good return on their investment, and lead to better savings,\ninvestment, and credit decisions throughout their lives. The Cleveland Fed actively supports economic\nand financial literacy programs, and this year we will be hosting the Council of Economic Education’s\nNational Personal Finance Challenge, a competition for high school students that encourages\ndevelopment of financial management skills.\n\nEliminating systemic inequities in access to credit and financial services must be a priority. The racial\ndisparities that still exist in banking and credit markets mean institutions need to reassess their business\npractices and change those that are found to be sources of such disparities. Similarly, policymakers need\nto strengthen policies meant to address such inequities. The Federal Reserve is currently working to\nstrengthen the regulations that implement the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The act, passed in\n1977, was intended to help address concerns about disinvestment in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods and the impact of illegal practices such as redlining. The CRA reaffirmed that insured\ndepository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business. Evidence\nshows that the CRA has provided tangible benefits to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. With\nthe many changes in banking since the 1970s, it is time to modernize the regulation so that it can help to\naddress systemic inequities in access to financial services and credit for low - and moderate-income and\nminority communities and individuals. 36\n\n36\n\nThe Board of Governors issued its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to strengthen, clarify, and\ntailor the CRA regulation, and other materials summarizing the ANPR on September 21, 2020. See Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (September 21, 2020) and Brainard (2020).\n\n\f13\nOf course, much more needs to be done. But if we have focus, perseverance, and a shared commitment to\neliminating systemic racism and increasing the breadth of economic opportunity, then together we can\nensure that instead of being a pipe dream for some, the American Dream is available to all.\n\n\f14\nReferences\nAliprantis, Dionissi, Daniel R.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Speech\n20 Anniversary Chicago Payments Symposium\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, IL\n(via videoconference)\nth\n\nSeptember 23, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a great pleasure being with you today as part of the 20th Anniversary Chicago Payments Symposium.\nOver the last two decades, this symposium has established itself as a valuable forum at which those\ninterested in the payments system can gather to learn and share ideas. In recent years, the symposium has\nfostered important conversations between industry practitioners and policymakers. Those conversations\nhave helped inform the Federal Reserve System’s initiative to improve and modernize the U.S. payments\nsystem. That work is ongoing and has reached important milestones this year, despite the pandemic.\nToday, I will discuss some of the effects the pandemic has had on the U.S. payments system and update\nyou on some of our ongoing efforts to modernize the payments system. As always, the views I’ll express\nare my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nI know I do not need to tell this audience that the payments system is a crucial part of the infrastructure of\nthe U.S. and a well-functioning and secure payments system is vital for a sound economy. As is true of\npretty much every aspect of life this year, the pandemic has affected the payments business, including\npayment patterns and volumes. The most important thing to recognize is that the U.S. payments system\nhas been weathering the pandemic without significant disruptions. This has taken the hard work of many\npeople in both the public sector and the private sector. Many of these workers were deemed to be\nessential, and we owe them all our deep gratitude for their dedication and public service. Because of the\nvital role played by the payments system, priorities had to change to meet the challenges posed by the\npandemic. At the same time, progress continued on important projects that have longer-run consequences\nfor the payments system.\n\nThere will be many lessons to take away from the current pandemic situation; two seem particularly\nrelevant to the payments work in which we are all engaged. First, although it is safe to say no one\nanticipated an event quite like the pandemic, the industry’s forethought, investment, and preparation to\n\n\f2\nensure that the payments system would be resilient to extreme scenarios has paid off greatly. It has\nallowed us to avoid a collapse of the payments system – an event that would have made what was already\na grave situation much, much worse. One big takeaway is that once we get through the current pandemic,\nmaking necessary investments to ensure that the U.S. payments system remains resilient in the face of\nextreme stress events will need to remain a priority.\nAnother key lesson is that having the right technology in place can make a big difference in being able to\naddress the challenges posed in an environment of rapid change in payments behavior. Industry\nparticipants may need to rethink their payments technology investment strategy once we are through the\npandemic. The changes we have seen in customers’ payment behavior since February have happened\nquickly. The spread of COVID-19 heightened the reliance of businesses and individuals on digital\nservices and faster connectivity, as many employees began to work from home and consumers turned to\nonline shopping. This is a global pandemic, and demand for consumer-to-consumer and cross-border\npayments has risen, as people want to send and receive payments in support of family and friends. Some\npayments technology is more resilient, scalable, and adaptable to such rapid changes in user behavior and\nvolume. Some industry participants note that cloud technologies are inherently more scalable and\nadaptable, and early adopters of the cloud are likely better positioned during these times compared to\nthose operating on mainframes. 1 It would be wrong to say that the pandemic has been the catalyst for\npayments system modernization: the Federal Reserve Banks have been assessing our payments\ntechnology for some time. We are investing in cloud technology and have platform modernization\ninitiatives at various stages of completion across nearly all of our business lines. However, the pandemic\ndoes underscore the need to have a technology strategy that will meet the needs of the future. Industry\nefforts to replace decades-old core banking systems with more flexible, resilient, and cloud-friendly\n\n1\n\nSee Fintech Advisory Group (2020).\n\n\f3\nplatforms, and to integrate the old with the new along the way, may need to be accelerated to ensure that\nwe are prepared for the future.\nLet me review some of the changes we have seen in payments activity during the pandemic.\n\nPayments Volume and Mix\nThe coronavirus pandemic and actions taken to contain its spread have had tremendous effects on\nhouseholds, businesses, and communities across America and on economic activity. So it is not\nsurprising that the pandemic has had significant effects on the types and volumes of payments flowing\nthrough the payments system. In March, the country took aggressive social-distancing measures to limit\nthe spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for\nthe sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. In March and April, with\nstay-at-home orders issued by state and local authorities in full swing, the number of checks processed by\nthe Reserve Banks declined substantially.\n\nBut at the same time, global demand for U.S. currency notes increased at unprecedented rates in March as\ncurrency orders from domestic and international banks spiked dramatically. At times of crisis, people\noften turn toward safety, and the U.S. dollar is viewed as a stable and safe asset across the world. So it is\nnot unusual that the pandemic has led to a shift toward cash, but the scale has been unprecedented.\nAdding to that, the fiscal support in the form of economic impact payments issued by the U.S.\ngovernment to millions of households also likely contributed to the higher demand in the U.S. as many\npeople converted the payments into cash for spending. On the supply side, just as in other industries, the\npandemic has affected the supply chain of cash. With the shutdown in full swing earlier this year,\ncurrency deposits to the Fed decreased, as retailers had less cash to deposit and banks wanted to maintain\nhigher inventories in their vaults. The Federal Reserve Banks had to adjust their usual cash operations to\nensure that cash inventories were maintained and cash was delivered to meet the higher demand.\n\n\f4\nAccording to a Federal Reserve survey of consumers taken in May of this year, participants reported that,\non average, during the pandemic, they had increased their holdings of cash on their person from $69 to\n$81, a 17 percent increase. 2 And the amount of cash stored at home or elsewhere rose even more, nearly\n90 percent, from an average of $250 to over $475. Thirty percent of consumers did report they were\navoiding using cash to pay for transactions, in favor of debit and credit cards. But even they were holding\nmore cash in May than they were before the pandemic. Now, since May, as states and localities have\nrelaxed stay-at-home restrictions and the economy has entered a reopening phase, the cash volumes at\nReserve Banks have begun to return to more normal levels.\n\nThe pandemic has also caused a disruption to normal patterns of coin circulation. Deposits by banks to\nthe Fed normally account for roughly 80 percent of the coins that the Federal Reserve puts back into\ncirculation, with the remaining 20 percent coming from new coin produced by the U.S. Mint, the issuing\nauthority for U.S. coin. While about $48 billion of coin is already in circulation, because coin-intensive\nbusinesses and bank branches have been less accessible during the pandemic, much of that coin has piled\nup in people’s homes and piggybanks and in businesses that were shuttered by the pandemic. 3 This has\nmade it more difficult to recirculate the coin where needed. This temporary supply disruption is likely to\ndissipate because as the reopening phase continues and more businesses resume normal activity, more\ncoins will flow back into retail and banking channels.\n\nElectronic payments have also been affected by the pandemic. Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nvolumes declined in late March and early April, driven by lower payroll processing, business-to-business\npayments, and online bill payments. Once the federal government’s economic impact payments were\ndisbursed and the Small Business Administration’s payroll protection plan loans were funded, there was a\n\n2\n\nSee Kim, et al. (2020)\n\n3\n\nU.S. Coin Task Force (2020).\n\n\f5\nrapid rebound in these types of payments and ACH volume has nearly recovered to its pre-pandemic\ngrowth trend.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is the primary collection agent for the U.S. Treasury, and in late\nMarch and early April, our receipts of credit and debit card payments to the Treasury dropped to about\nhalf of what they were compared to last year. On the other hand, the use of debit and credit card\npayments increased for some types of payments. In the Fed survey of consumers, about 20 percent of\nrespondents reported switching to paying online or over the phone for items from restaurants and big-box\nstores, and nearly two-thirds reported that they had made no in-person payments during the first several\nweeks of the pandemic. 4\n\nFinally, I will note that payments related to securities transactions have increased dramatically during the\npandemic amid increased volatility in financial markets, higher levels of government bond issuance, and a\nsurge in mortgage refinancings prompted by low interest rates. 5\n\nAll in all, the pandemic has had a wide-ranging and uneven impact across firms’ and households’\npayment behaviors and patterns. Some of the changes seen early during the pandemic have already\nreverted to pre-pandemic norms and others are likely to revert as the pandemic recedes. But it is also the\ncase that the changes we have seen for some forms of payment will be longer lasting. A consumer’s\ndecision to use a different form of payment during the pandemic may have been driven by circumstances,\nbut now that the consumer has had experience with it, that payment method may become a more routine\nchoice. Similarly, some of the changes in work and consumption patterns may last after the pandemic has\nended, altering payment mix and types of transactions more permanently.\n\n4\n\nSee Kim, et al. (2020).\n\nIncreases in average daily trading volumes for fixed-income municipal, U.S. Treasury, MBS, ABS, and corporate\ndebt for August 2020 year-to-date over the same period a year ago range from 15 percent to 40 percent (SIFMA,\nSeptember 3, 2020).\n5\n\n\f6\nFederal Reserve Payments Actions\nGiven the importance of the payments system to the U.S. economy and the potential for wide-ranging\neffects of the pandemic and the actions taken to stem its spread, the Federal Reserve has been focused on\nmitigating disruptions and preparing for the unexpected. The Fed has established an active inventory\nmanagement program to coordinate existing stores of cash and coin between Federal Reserve distribution\nlocations. This has allowed us to better serve areas in the country experiencing high demand for cash and\nto increase the supply of fit notes available to the public. To help address the national coin circulation\nissues brought on by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve established temporary caps on coin orders in\nJune. These caps, which have risen over time in response to changes in demand and supply conditions,\nhave helped to ensure smooth ordering and fair distribution to financial institutions of all sizes. The Fed\nhas also convened a U.S. Coin Task Force, with representatives from the Fed, the U.S. Mint, and the\nindustry, to identify actions that could be taken to improve coin circulation.\n\nThe Fed understands that financial institutions have had to cope with several pandemic-related challenges\n– after all, we have faced similar challenges. So to ease some of the burden, in May through July of this\nyear, the Fed offered a customer assistance package, including some fee concessions on reporting,\ntransactional, and electronic access services, and provided temporary relief from certain operational\nrequirements. We also announced that in 2021 we would hold our prices for most Federal Reserve\nfinancial services at their current levels.\n\nAs fiscal agent to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Banks also provided service\nto the Treasury by processing more than 160 million economic impact payments to households and small\nbusinesses authorized by the CARES Act to help recipients cope with the financial effects of the\npandemic. Payments were disbursed via ACH, check, and debit card in waves between April and August.\nThe payments were made relatively quickly to those recipients whose bank account details were available\nto the government from prior tax returns or Social Security payments. Recipients whose bank account\n\n\f7\ndetails were not known by the government could enter their account information on a specially created\nIRS website. Even so, this experience showed that the quality of recipients’ routing information needs to\nimprove in order to reduce the proportion of payments that cannot be posted automatically to the payee.\nAnd when exceptions occur, the processes for handling exceptions need to be sped up in order to avoid\ndelays. It was a much bigger challenge to reach those without a bank account. This is a sizeable group:\nin 2017, this number was almost 8-1/2 million households, or about 6.5 percent of U.S. households. 6\nRecipients without bank accounts had to wait much longer for their relief payments to be disbursed by\nchecks or debit cards through the mail, and unfortunately, many of these households tend to be lower\nincome and have the greatest need for speedy financial assistance. The pandemic has underscored the\nneed to ensure that during a crisis, payments can flow quickly and to everyone: those with and those\nwithout a bank account. 7\n\nAs many in this audience know, one of the goals of the Fed’s recent efforts to modernize the U.S.\npayments system is to speed up the flow of payments between payer and payees. Another goal is to make\nsure that all Americans have access to the payments system.\n\nFedNowSM\nThe Federal Reserve’s FedNow service, which is currently being built, will be an around-the-clock\nservice whereby payments can be originated, cleared, and settled within seconds. The service is expected\nto provide clear public benefits in the form of safety, efficiency, and accessibility of instant payments.\nYesterday, my colleague Ken Montgomery provided an excellent overview of FedNow features and\nfunctions, so let me touch upon a few points about how we’ll be rolling the service out.\n\n6\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2017).\n\n7\n\nGeorge (2020).\n\n\f8\nWhile COVID-19 has affected many parts of the payments system, it has not slowed down our work on\nFedNow. Our goal is to bring FedNow to market as soon as practicably possible. The target release date\nremains 2023 or 2024, but we will announce a more specific time frame once additional work is\ncompleted. In order to get the service up and running as soon as possible, we are taking a phased\napproach to its features. We will begin with the most important features and introduce enhancements\nquickly and iteratively thereafter. To inform the design and to determine which features to include at the\nstart, we have been engaging extensively with stakeholders through focus groups, industry meetings, and\nthe establishment of a stakeholder-wide FedNow community, and through the more formal public\ncomment process. We are working to finalize a technology strategy that will create a flexible\ninfrastructure, one that is scalable and can evolve with the times.\n\nIn addition to offering secure instant payments, an important goal of FedNow is to establish a nationwide\nreach for the service so that this new type of payment is broadly accessible to consumers and businesses\nalike. The Federal Reserve’s payments services have a broad reach, with connections to and customer\nrelationships with more than 10,000 diverse financial institutions across the country. This existing reach\nwill help support a nationwide infrastructure for FedNow instant payments. We are also working closely\nwith private-sector payment providers to explore the best approach to achieve wide accessibility.\n\nThinking ahead, a service like FedNow, coupled with a directory service with accurate information on\nwhere to route payments for final distribution to households and businesses, has the potential to solve\nsome of the challenges the government faced when distributing pandemic relief payments. Of course,\ncreating such a directory and ensuring it is kept up-to-date is complex, and several challenges, including\ndata privacy considerations, account information maintenance demands, and business case considerations,\nwould have to be solved. The Federal Reserve understands the potential value of such a service, and has\nbeen exploring these issues as it evaluates the features to eventually include in FedNow.\n\n\f9\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies\nThe experience with pandemic emergency payments has brought forward an idea that was already gaining\nincreased attention at central banks around the world, that is, central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nLegislation has proposed that each American have an account at the Fed in which digital dollars could be\ndeposited, as liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks, which could be used for emergency payments.\nOther proposals would create a new payments instrument, digital cash, which would be just like the\nphysical currency issued by central banks today, but in a digital form and, potentially, without the\nanonymity of physical currency. Depending on how these currencies are designed, central banks could\nsupport them without the need for commercial bank involvement via direct issuance into the end-users’\ndigital wallets combined with central-bank-facilitated transfer and redemption services. 8 The demand for\nand use of such instruments need further consideration in order to evaluate whether such a central bank\ndigital currency would allow for quicker and more ubiquitous payments in times of emergency and more\ngenerally. In addition, a range of potential risks and policy issues surrounding central bank digital\ncurrency need to be better understood, and the costs and benefits evaluated.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been researching issues raised by central bank digital currency for some time.\nThe Board of Governors has a technology lab that has been building and testing a range of distributed\nledger platforms to understand their potential benefits and tradeoffs. 9 Staff members from several\nReserve Banks, including Cleveland Fed software developers, are contributing to this effort. The Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston is also engaged in a multiyear effort, working with the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, to experiment with technologies that could be used for a central bank digital currency. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York has established an innovation center, in partnership with the Bank for\nInternational Settlements, to identify and develop in-depth insights into critical trends and financial\n\n8\n\nSee Mester (2020) for further discussion.\n\n9\n\nBrainard (2020).\n\n\f10\ntechnology of relevance to central banks. 10 Experimentation like this is an important ingredient in\nassessing the benefits and costs of a central bank digital currency, but does not signal any decision by the\nFederal Reserve to adopt such a currency. Issues raised by central bank digital currency related to\nfinancial stability, market structure, security, privacy, and monetary policy all need to be better\nunderstood.\n\nImproving Traditional Federal Reserve Financial Services\nFedNow and central bank digital currency have to do with the future, but the Fed is also working to\nenhance our current portfolio of payment services to ensure they meet evolving customer needs. We\ncontinue to make investments to modernize the technical platforms for traditional payment services,\nincluding the Fedwire Funds Service, FedACH, FedLine access channels, and currency-processing\nservices.\n\nWe are investigating expanding the operating hours of wholesale payment services to meet the interbank\nsettlement demands of a 24x7x365 world. We are enhancing services to facilitate cross-border payments,\nincluding expanding the reach of our FedGlobal ACH service and adopting the ISO 20022 global\nstandard for several of our payment services. We are investigating emerging technical approaches, like\nAPIs, to see whether they can be leveraged to facilitate broader access and efficiency. And, of course, we\nare doing what needs to be done to enhance the resilience of our platforms so that our services can run\nefficiently, reliably, and securely every day.\n\nConclusion\nI hope my remarks today give you some sense of the payments work that has been going on at the Federal\nReserve during the pandemic. The pandemic has triggered notable short-term changes to payments\n\n10\n\nBank for International Settlements (2020).\n\n\f11\nsystem patterns, practices, and usage. But the Federal Reserve and industry participants have responded\nto ensure that our payments system, a critical part of the U.S. infrastructure, continues to function well\nand to meet stakeholder needs. We have all learned a lot during the pandemic. We have seen that we can\nrespond to unforeseen events and that we can be flexible. We have seen the importance of investing in\nthe resilience of our payments system – such resilience helped ensure that the payments system was not\ndisrupted and did not add another challenge to the long list caused by the pandemic. We have seen the\nimportant role the payments system can play in an emergency by distributing funds to those in need.\nThere is some uncertainty about the extent to which some of the changes we have seen in consumer and\nbusiness behavior with respect to their payment choices will continue after the pandemic. But one thing\nis certain: we must ensure that our payments system remains modern, resilient, and able to adapt to\nchanging customer needs as they evolve. I am confident that by working together, the Fed and the\nindustry will be able to achieve that goal for the benefit of the public.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nBank for International Settlements, “BIS Innovation Hub to Expand to New Locations in Europe and\nNorth America,” June 30, 2020.\n(https://www.bis.org/press/p200630a.htm)\nBrainard, Lael, “An Update on Digital Currencies,” at the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco's Innovation Office Hours, San Francisco, CA (via webcast) August 13, 2020.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20200813a.pdf)\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “2017 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked\nHouseholds,” October 2018.\n(https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2017/2017report.pdf)\nFintech Advisory Group, “Minutes of the Regular Meeting of the Fintech Advisory Group,” Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, April 8, 2020.\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/aboutthefed/pdf/ftag-minutes-04082020.pdf)\nGeorge, Esther, “Pondering Payments: Challenges of Reaching All Americans,” KC Fed Policy\nPerspectives, June 30, 2020.\n(https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/speeches/2020/policy_perspectives_6_30_20.pdf?l\na=en)\nKim, Laura, Raynil Kumar, and Shaun O’Brien, “Consumer Payments & the COVID-19 Pandemic: A\nSupplement to the 2020 Findings from the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice,” Cash Product Office,\nFederal Reserve System, July 2020.\n(https://www.frbsf.org/cash/files/consumer-payments-covid-19-pandemic-2020-diary-consumer-paymentchoice-supplement.pdf)\nMester, Loretta J., “Modernizing Our Payments System,” remarks at the Fourth Annual Financial\nLiteracy Day: Understanding Global Markets and Finance, Global Interdependence Center, University of\nSouth Florida Sarasota-Manatee College of Business, Sarasota, FL, February 14, 2020.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20200214-modernizing-our-paymentssystem)\nSIFMA, U.S. Fixed Income Trading Volume, statistics, September 3, 2020.\n(https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-fixed-income-trading-volume/)\nU.S. Coin Task Force, “Statement from the U.S. Coin Task Force on the Coin Circulation Issue,” July 24,\n2020.\n(https://www.aba.com/-/media/documents/email-bulletins/us-coin-task-force-public-statement072420#_ga=2.166214334.1890085829.1597941665-539224350.1597941665)\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Session\n2020 Economic Measurement Seminar\nThe NABE Foundation\n(via videoconference)\nSeptember 2, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Jack Kleinhenz for inviting me to participate in the NABE Foundation’s 2020 Economic\nMeasurement Seminar. I last spoke at a NABE conference in February. That was only six short months\nago, but it seems like a lifetime. Many things have changed since then, including current economic\nconditions and the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. I want to compliment NABE for\nmaintaining its important programming throughout the pandemic. It is a demonstration of perseverance\nand resilience in the face of extraordinary circumstances, traits exhibited by many households, businesses,\nand organizations over the past several months. Such resilience is a hallmark of the U.S. economy, and it\nwill prove useful as the economy makes its way to a sustainable recovery. Before we turn to the question\nand answer part of this session, I’ll give you a brief update on the economic outlook and monetary policy,\nand touch on the changes to the FOMC’s policy strategy that were announced last week. The views I’ll\npresent are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nIn thinking about the economic impact of the pandemic, I find it helps to think in terms of phases. The\nshutdown phase started in March when the country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the\nspread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the\nsick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. There were swift and severe\neffects on the economy from the shutdown of nonessential businesses and activities.\n\nThe reopening phase started in May, as public health statistics began to improve and many parts of the\ncountry began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions. Economic activity and hiring in many\nsectors began to improve in May and June as businesses began to reopen and consumers began to reengage. Even sectors such as travel and leisure and hospitality saw some improvement, although these\nsectors are likely to remain weak for some time. Early in the reopening phase, many of our business\n\n\f2\ncontacts in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which includes Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania,\nKentucky, and West Virginia, told us that activity was picking up more than they had expected. And\nsome of the official statistics have come in stronger than economists had expected. The housing market\nhas been particularly strong, with both new home and existing home sales now back to or above prepandemic levels. Spending on durable goods, including autos, is well above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis is all good news. But the recovery in activity appears to be a fragile one. The most recent highfrequency data and discussions with regional contacts indicate that the pickup in activity seen in May and\nJune has slowed over the past couple of months. This slowdown has occurred as the number of virus\ncases began to rise again in some parts of the country in late June, causing some localities to put their\nreopening plans on pause or to reimpose restrictions on activity. Even in areas where authorities did not\nchange reopening plans, the rise in virus cases seems to have had a dampening effect on activity as people\npulled back, out of concern for their safety. The most recent virus data suggest the number of new cases,\nwhile still elevated, has turned back down, so I’ll be watching to see if the pace of activity picks up again.\n\nSince this is a measurement conference, it seems fitting that I should show you some charts illustrating\nsome of the data. Economists tend to look at growth rates when assessing the economy, but in this\nunprecedented situation of a shutdown followed by a reopening, looking at the level of activity compared\nto what it was before the pandemic is helpful in gauging the economic outlook.\n\n[FIGURE 1] The official GDP data clearly show the deep plunge in activity associated with the\nshutdown. Economic activity peaked in February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. Real GDP\nfell at a 5 percent annual pace in the first quarter and a record 32 percent annual pace in the second\nquarter, with nonresidential business fixed investment down 26 percent, and personal consumption down\n34 percent, at an annual rate. The level of real GDP in the second quarter was back down to the level it\nwas in 2014 – so we have lost six years of output growth.\n\n\f3\n\nThe recovery in some sectors, like services, will take longer than in others, and there will be fits and\nstarts, depending on the course of the virus. But I expect the second quarter to be the trough, a strong\nrebound in growth in the third quarter, and continued positive growth in the fourth quarter, but with the\nlevel of output still ending the year somewhat below where it was at the end of last year.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity in the first half of the year when the economy shut down put\ndownward pressure on inflation, even though supply disruptions have caused the prices of certain goods\nand services to rise. During the reopening phase, there has been some recovery in the inflation measures,\nbut I expect inflation to remain below our longer-run 2 percent goal for some time to come.\n\n[FIGURE 3] The shutdown and reopening had clear effects on the labor market. In April there was an\nunprecedented rise in unemployment and loss of jobs, particularly in sectors where people cannot work\nfrom home. Many workers reported that they expected their unemployment spell would be temporary,\nand as the economy has been reopening, we have seen a rapid decline in the unemployment rate as people\non temporary furlough began to be rehired. This is good news. But it is also good to keep these numbers\nin perspective. The unemployment rate was 10.2 percent in July, still slightly above its peak after the\nGreat Recession. There are still 16 million unemployed workers in the U.S., compared with 6 million in\nFebruary. This means that about one in 16 Americans over the age of 16 is unemployed, near the level\nafter the Great Recession. Moreover, the deterioration in the labor market has not been evenly shared,\nwith the net increase in the unemployment rate since February being higher for Blacks, Hispanics, and\nAsians than for whites.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The payroll employment data tell a similar story. In just the two months of March and\nApril, the economy lost 22 million jobs, the same number of jobs it had added over the entire recent\nexpansion that lasted over 10 years. More than three-quarters of those losses were in the sectors paying\n\n\f4\nbelow-average wages. The good news is that in just three months, the economy has added back over 9\nmillion jobs. Of course, this means we are less than half way back up to the pre-pandemic level of jobs,\nand the current level of employment is about what it was back in 2014. So like output, about 6 years’\nworth of job growth has been lost.\n\nGiven the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and economic shutdown, many economists, including\nthose at the Fed, have been looking at higher-frequency indicators to track developments. The Cleveland\nFed has been surveying our contacts with greater frequency and we have added a nationwide survey of\nconsumers to gauge how the virus has affected their attitudes and activities. These higher-frequency\nindicators clearly show the rebound in activity that came with the reopening of the economy, but they also\nshow that activity is correlated with data on the course of the virus.\n\n[FIGURE 5] For example, when virus cases began to rise again in late June, the data on mobility, or the\npercentage of time spent away from home, and the data on restaurant visits began to level off compared to\nMay when reopening began. Our contacts in the restaurant industry also confirmed that the pace of\nbusiness activity was dampening and some have begun to question the longer-run viability of many\nestablishments, especially those that have not been able to transition to takeout.\n\n[FIGURE 6] As the pandemic has worn on, businesses have begun to change their plans. Early on, many\ncontacts told us that they were not planning to make permanent reductions to their work force; however,\nthey eventually had to let some workers go. In our latest survey, over half of the firms told us that in light\nof the increase in virus cases since late June, they have made meaningful changes to their plans, including\nfor hiring and capital spending.\n\nSmall businesses have been disproportionately affected by the virus, and the smallest of the small\nbusinesses particularly so. Data from Homebase show that the strides made since April on employment at\n\n\f5\nsmall businesses have now begun to stall, with the number of hourly staff down about 20 percent since\nJanuary. As documented by researchers at the New York Fed, Black-owned businesses have been\nparticularly hard hit by the pandemic, and have been twice as likely to close as other firms during the\npandemic. The researchers point to a number of contributing factors including these firms’ weaker\nfinancial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and funding gaps that existed prior to the pandemic, plus\nless access to federal relief funds.1\n\n[FIGURE 7] The Cleveland Fed’s survey data show that both businesses and consumers are thinking\ndifferently about the pandemic than they did at the start. In our survey taken in late June, about half of\nour regional business contacts said it will take at least a year for their firms’ activity to return to prepandemic levels.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s national daily survey shows that consumers are now more willing to engage in\ncertain activities than they were at the start, but they also believe that the pandemic will last much longer\nthan they originally thought.2 In March, over 80 percent of respondents thought the pandemic would last\na year or less. In early August, only half think that, and the other half thinks it will be two years or even\nlonger.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\nThe link we’ve seen between the rise in virus cases and the dampening of activity underscores the fact\nthat the path of the economy depends on the path of the virus. Of course, the path of the virus can be\n\nClaire Kramer Mills and Jessica Battisto, “Double Jeopardy: Covid-19’s Concentrated Health and Wealth Effects\nin Black Communities,” Brief, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, August 2020\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/DoubleJeopardy_COVID19andBlackOwnedBusine\nsses).\n1\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s website provides updates of these survey results each Wednesday on the Consumers and\nCOVID-19 page, https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/consumers-and-covid-19.aspx. For\nfurther results from the survey, see Edward S. Knotek II, et al., “Consumers and COVID-19: A Real-Time Survey,”\nEconomic Commentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 2020-08, April 17, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbcec-202008).\n2\n\n\f6\naffected by our actions. These include public- and private-sector investments in expanded testing, contact\ntracing, treatments, and vaccines, as well as our own individual actions to safely engage in activity by\nwearing a mask that covers our noses and mouths, avoiding social gatherings, maintaining distance from\nothers, and washing our hands frequently.\n\nAssuming that we get the virus under control and people feel safe enough and businesses confident\nenough to re-engage in economic activity, the economy will move from the reopening phase to a more\nsustained recovery phase. This recovery is likely to take some time because the pandemic was a\nsignificant shock to the economy.\n\nBoth the federal government and the Federal Reserve took swift and significant actions to provide\nhouseholds and businesses with relief during the shutdown. Fiscal actions have included grants to\nindividuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities; expanded\nunemployment benefits; and loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their\npayrolls.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took actions to ensure that financial markets had enough liquidity to continue to\nfunction well and that credit could continue to flow to households and businesses, thereby avoiding\nfinancial instability on top of the pandemic. These actions have included buying Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities to address strains in these markets; making sure our central bank\ncounterparties abroad have access to dollar funding; setting up a variety of so-called 13(3) emergency\nfacilities, backed by the U.S. Treasury, that serve as a backstop to other key credit markets and support\nthe flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state and local governments; temporarily\nrelaxing some of the regulatory requirements on banks so they have greater capacity to lend; and since\nMarch, maintaining the fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent.\n\n\f7\nBy the end of this year, I expect that output will still be somewhat below its level at the end of last year;\nthat the unemployment rate will remain in the high single digits; and that inflation will be well below our\nlonger-run 2 percent goal. Of course, the uncertainty around this forecast is extremely high: we are in an\nunprecedented situation and outcomes depend on public health considerations. The outlook also depends\non appropriate economic policy. In my view, fiscal policy and monetary policy support are needed to\nlimit lasting damage to the economy and achieve a broader, sustainable recovery. Several key parts of the\nfiscal policy support already in place are expiring. Given economic conditions, it seems clear that further\nfiscal support is needed to provide a bridge for households, small businesses, and state and local\nmunicipalities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic until the recovery is sustainably in place.3\n\nFor the Fed’s part, the FOMC has indicated that we expect to maintain the fed funds rate target range at\n0 to 1/4 percent until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to\nachieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Our asset purchases continue to support\nmarket functioning and accommodative financial conditions. In addition, clear communications about our\npolicy strategy can also make any monetary policy actions we take more effective. Last week, the FOMC\nreleased a revised statement outlining our longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which should\nhelp clarify and reinforce the FOMC’s policy intentions.4 So let me conclude with a few highlights from\nthis statement. I direct you to Fed Chair Powell’s recent remarks for a fuller discussion of the statement.5\n\n3\n\nRecent Cleveland Fed research shows that there have been sizable declines in activities that typically produce the\nlargest share of state and local government tax revenue, including air transportation and gasoline sales. See Stephan\nWhitaker, “How Much Help Do State and Local Governments Need? Updated Estimates of Revenue Losses from\nPandemic Mitigation,” District Data Brief, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, June 29, 2020 (https://doi.org\n/10.26509/frbc-ddb-20200629).\nFor information about the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary policy framework, including strategy, tools,\nand communications, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-toolsand-communications.htm.\n4\n\nSee Jerome H. Powell, “New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,” remarks at\n“Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,” an economic policy symposium sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, WY (via webcast), August 27, 2020\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm).\n5\n\n\f8\nRevised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\nFor the past year and a half, the FOMC has been engaged in a review of our framework – the strategy,\ntools, and communications – for setting monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals to promote\nmaximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates. The review was informed\nby our experience during and after the Great Recession, by economic theory and empirical analysis, and\nby consultations with academic researchers and practitioners at research conferences and with the public\nat large, through a series of Fed Listens events held across the country.\n\nThe review, whose main conclusions are captured in the strategy statement, was undertaken in light of\nchanges in the economic environment that have emerged since our first strategy statement was published\nin 2012. One important change is the decline both here and abroad in the general level of interest rates\nconsistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline reflects several factors, including the\naging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth. It means that the\nlevel of the fed funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability is now lower than it\nhas been in the past. This means that during economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds\nrate will be constrained by its effective lower bound. In other words, in the wake of a downturn, the\nFOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using its traditional policy tool. With\nhouseholds, businesses, and financial markets all understanding this constraint, this imparts a downward\nbias to inflation and inflation expectations, and increases the downside risks to achieving both of our\npolicy goals.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment pertains to inflation dynamics. Resource slack has become\nless correlated with actual inflation than in the past, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in\ndetermining inflation outcomes. This makes it even more important that inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored at levels consistent with our longer-run 2 percent inflation goal, especially since inflation\nrunning below our goal would result in even less policy space in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\n\f9\n\nThe first thing to note about the revised strategy statement is that the FOMC has reaffirmed that a longerrun inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our statutory mandate. But our strategy statement is\nnow more explicit about how we will go about achieving this inflation goal. Namely, after periods in\nwhich inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we will likely aim to have inflation run\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. Doing so will help anchor inflation expectations, a main\ndeterminant of actual inflation, at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. The new language is a\nstronger statement than we have made in the past as we have struggled to effectively convey that 2\npercent should not be interpreted as a ceiling. We are now clear that after inflation has been running\npersistently below 2 percent, not only will we tolerate serendipitous shocks that move inflation above 2\npercent, but that we will likely set policy with the intention to move inflation moderately above 2 percent\nfor some time.\n\nI have spoken many times on the fact that policy communications should acknowledge uncertainty.6 The\nchanges made in the strategy statement about our employment goal are an acknowledgment of the\nuncertainty around assessments of the level of maximum employment. Indeed, the FOMC’s assessments\nof the longer-run unemployment rate have come down significantly over time, and employment growth\nover the expansion ended up being considerably stronger without generating inflation than past\nexperience suggested was possible. It took time to learn about these structural changes in the economy.\nAnd this time-to-learn, combined with the previous strategy statement’s references to “deviations” of\nemployment from maximum employment, has been misinterpreted by some as suggesting that the FOMC,\nat times, takes deliberate policy action to bring employment down independently of our inflation goal.\nThis is not the case. The benefits of a strong labor market in fostering economic inclusion for all\nAmericans are clear and we need to be humble about our abilities to assess maximum employment in real\n\nSee, e.g., Loretta J. Mester, “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” remarks at the Shadow Open Market Committee Fall\nMeeting, New York, NY, October 7, 2016 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp20161007-acknowledging-uncertainty.aspx).\n6\n\n\f10\ntime. The new statement language clarifies that in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to\nfinancial stability, strong employment is not a concern and monetary policy will not react to it.\n\nI strongly believe that clear policy communications are an important part of effective monetary\npolicymaking. The completion of the framework review and the revised strategy statement come at an\nopportune time, in support of the FOMC’s commitment to doing all that it can to support a sustainable\nrecovery back to maximum employment and price stability in service to the public.\n\n\fCharts for\n“An Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Session\n2020 Liberal Arts Macroeconomics Conference\nPomona College\nClaremont, CA\n(via videoconference)\nAugust 5, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Dean Croushore and the organizers of the 2020 Liberal Arts Macroeconomics Conference for\ninviting me to present in the keynote session. I also want to acknowledge the important role that the\nparticipants in this conference play in our economy and in society. In recent years, some have questioned\nwhether a liberal arts education offers the same value as it once did, and point to other types of programs\nthat, in their view, better prepare students for the job market. I take the opposite view: to me the value of\na liberal arts education has never been clearer. The current pandemic underscores the fact that the future\nis uncertain. A year ago, I certainly wasn’t imagining we would be in the place we find ourselves today.\nIf we want students to be prepared for the future, then we must give them the tools they will need to\nsuccessfully stand up to future challenges, think critically through possible approaches and solutions to\nthose challenges, be resilient in the face of adversity, and question the status quo. A broad-based liberal\narts education, which encompasses the study of history, literature, and the arts, as well as mathematics\nand the natural and social sciences, holds the best promise to prepare students for the future, whatever it\nmay bring. I applaud the professors taking part in this conference. Not only do you have to be\ninspirational teachers, but you also have to be excellent researchers who are pushing the boundaries of\nknowledge in economics forward. Both roles have become more challenging during the pandemic, with\nthe sudden need to move to remote teaching and the difficulty in keeping ongoing research on track. I\nappreciate your efforts and ask that you persevere in these very important roles.\n\nToday, before we open it up to questions, I’ll give you an update on the economy and on the Federal\nReserve’s policy response. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f2\nThe Economy\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all\nover the world. This is an unprecedented situation and unprecedented actions have been taken in\nresponse.\n\nIn thinking about the economic impact of the pandemic, it helps to think in terms of phases: the shutdown\nphase, the reopening phase, and a more traditional economic recovery phase. The shutdown phase began\nin March when the country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and\nto buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about\nthe virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. The shutdown had swift and severe effects on the\neconomy.\n\nThe economy entered the reopening phase in May, as the public health statistics began to improve in\nsome parts of the country. Many states began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, with some\nstates doing so more quickly and more broadly than others. We began to see some welcome rebound in\nthe economic data in May and June. But it is good to keep in mind that growth rates after a shutdown are\ngoing to look good as activity resumes. Given the deep hole we are digging out of, it is more informative\nto look at levels when gauging the economy and assessing the outlook.\n\nThe reopening phase has proved to be challenging. In late June, virus cases in many parts of the country\nbegan rising again and, in response, some states have hit the pause button on their reopening plans, while\nother states have reimposed some restrictions on activities. Although we don’t yet see the effects of the\npause in many of the official economic statistics, the higher-frequency data and discussions with regional\ncontacts do indicate that economic activity has slowed in recent weeks. Thus, the reopening phase may\nbe more protracted than many had anticipated when it started.\n\n\f3\n[FIGURE 1] At this point, the most dated of our official statistics are the GDP data. These statistics\nshow that economic activity peaked in February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. After\ndeclining at a 5 percent annual pace in the first quarter, real GDP plunged at a record 33 percent annual\npace in the second quarter, with nonresidential business fixed investment down 27 percent, and personal\nconsumption down almost 35 percent, at an annual rate. I expect that the second quarter will be the\ntrough in economic activity. Consumer spending rebounded in May and June, with June’s spending on\ngoods higher than it was in February, before the shutdown. But while spending on services, which\nincludes dining at restaurants, air travel, and hotel stays, moved up in May and June, it remains well\nbelow pre-pandemic levels.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity has put downward pressure on inflation. Both headline and core\ninflation readings moved down in March and April and remained low in May and June. It is true that\nsupply disruptions have caused the prices of certain goods and services to rise, but this upward pressure\nhas been more than offset by the downward pressure driven by the pullback in demand. And I expect\ninflation to remain low for some time to come.\n\n[FIGURE 3] The shutdown of the economy earlier this year led to an unprecedented rise in\nunemployment and loss of jobs. While many people can work from home, many others cannot. As\nreopening began, we started to see some improvement in labor markets. Both the unemployment rate and\npayroll employment have improved over the past two months. Recall that in February, the unemployment\nrate was 3.5 percent, its 50-year low. In April, the unemployment rate surged to 14.7 percent. As\nreopening commenced in May, people on temporary furlough began to be rehired. As of June, the\nunemployment rate is down to 11.1 percent. The fact that the unemployment rate is coming down is good\nnews. But we also need to put this into perspective. The current level is still above its peak in the\naftermath of the Great Recession. And there are still almost 18 million unemployed workers in the U.S.,\n\n\f4\ncompared with 6 million in February. This means one in 15 Americans over the age of 16 is unemployed,\nabout the same as at the height after the Great Recession.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The economy lost over 22 million jobs in March and April. This is a staggering number. It\nwould have been literally off the charts if I hadn’t changed the scale. In fact, the losses in just the two\nmonths of March and April were about the same as the number of jobs the economy added over the entire\nrecent expansion that lasted more than 10 years. The jobs added in May and June make up only about\none-third of the jobs lost.\n\n[FIGURE 5] To get a sense of where we are, it is helpful to look at employment in levels rather than\nmonthly changes. The current level of payroll jobs is now back to where it was in 2014. In other words,\nthe economy is still down about 6 years’ worth of job growth.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market is even sharper than these numbers indicate. Many people left the\nwork force at the beginning of the shutdown and consequently they do not show up in the unemployment\nrate, and many workers had their hours cut. Our survey of firms in the Fourth District, which includes\nOhio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia, indicates that firms have recalled workers\nmore slowly than they originally intended to. As of mid-July, over half of District contacts have told us\nthey are meaningfully altering their plans in response to the rise in virus cases, including reducing\nemployment or employee compensation or cancelling or postponing planned capital expenditures.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market has not been evenly shared. Net job losses have been predominantly\nin lower-paying jobs. Nearly half of the net private-sector job losses since February have been in the\nleisure and hospitality and the retail trade sectors, the two sectors ranked lowest in terms of average\nhourly earnings. Three-quarters of the job losses are in the sectors that pay below-average wages.\n\n\f5\n[FIGURE 6] There are racial disparities as well. Unemployment rates among Blacks and Hispanics have\nbeen chronically above those of whites and Asians. Over the long expansion, we had finally seen some\nprogress being made on that front, as the gap in unemployment rates narrowed. But the pandemic has\nincreased the disparities. The net increase in the unemployment rate since February is higher for Blacks,\nHispanics, and Asians than for whites. It is particularly distressing that much of the sacrifice over the\npandemic period is being borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority\nworkers and communities, and the smaller of the small businesses.\n\n[FIGURE 7] And it shines a bright light on long-standing economic inequality that needs to be addressed\nif the economy is to perform up to its potential. Education is a path to better economic outcomes for\nindividuals, households, and the country at large. According to data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer\nFinances, the median income for families whose head has a college degree was over $90,000 compared\nwith only $40,000 for families whose head has only a high school diploma. Similarly, median net worth\nis considerably higher for those with a college degree. 1\n\n[FIGURE 8] Our work force has become more educated over time. But educational attainment differs by\nrace, as does the likelihood of completing a degree. In the Fed’s survey, 39 percent of white heads of\nhouseholds held a college degree compared to 23 percent of Black heads of household and 17 percent of\nHispanic heads of household. 2\n\nInformation about and data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances are available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSee Lisa J. Dettling, Joanne W. Hsu, Lindsay Jacobs, Kevin B. Moore, and Jeffrey P. Thompson, “Recent Trends\nin Wealth-Holding by Race and Ethnicity: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,” FED Notes,\nSeptember 27, 2019 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-byrace-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm).\n\n\f6\n[FIGURE 9] Graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of\nBlacks remain well below those of these other groups and have shown no progress over time. Because\neconomic well-being rises with education, unless more is done to support those entering college so they\ncan complete their degrees, economic inequality is likely to continue to rise.3\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\nLet me now turn to the outlook and policy. Macroeconomic forecasting has been particularly challenging\nduring the pandemic. Higher-frequency indicators, including data on mobility, restaurant visits, debit and\ncredit card transactions, employment in small businesses, and the weekly initial claims for unemployment\ninsurance, all suggest that activity has begun to decelerate with the rise in virus cases. These recent\ndevelopments add uncertainty to what was already an uncertain outlook. Whether the rise in cases and\nthe deceleration in activity prove to be temporary or more persistent remains to be seen. At the very least,\nthey suggest that the economy will be in the reopening phase for a while longer.\n\nIt is clear that the path of the economy depends on the path of the virus. But that does not mean we are\nhelpless. The actions we take can help control the virus and thereby change the impact of the virus on the\neconomy. Increased government and private-sector investment in expanded testing, contact tracing, and\ndevelopments of therapeutics and vaccines will influence the path of the virus and our ability to re-engage\nin economic activity. Each individual can also influence the path of the virus: we can wear a mask that\ncovers our noses and mouths when out and about, we can avoid social gatherings and maintain our\ndistance from others, and we can wash our hands frequently. These simple steps have been shown to\nmake a difference in infection rates. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the latest estimates indicate that\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Community Development and Human Capital,” remarks at the 2015 Policy Summit on\nHousing, Human Capital, and Inequality, Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond,\nPittsburgh, PA, June 19, 2015 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20150619community-development-and-human-capital.aspx). And see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\n“Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2019, Featuring Supplemental Data from April 2020,”\nMay 2020 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019preface.htm).\n3\n\n\f7\nif 95 percent of Americans wore face coverings in public, COVID-related deaths could be reduced by up\nto 40,000 to 50,000. 4\n\nIn response to the increase in cases seen in Ohio, the governor recently upgraded the mask-wearing\nrecommendation to a mandate. This is occurring in other states as well. Evidence from the Cleveland\nFed’s daily national survey of households shows that the vast majority of the more than 1,000 survey\nrespondents would comply with such a mandate, with older people more likely to comply than younger\npeople. The vast majority also thought that mask-wearing is helpful in reducing transmission of the virus,\nand those who believed this are more likely to wear a mask. About 70 percent of respondents also\nreported that they feel more comfortable shopping when they see others wearing masks. 5\n\nAssuming that the virus gets under control once again and people feel safe enough and businesses\nconfident enough to re-engage in economic activity, the economy will move from the reopening phase to\nthe recovery phase. I anticipate that the recovery will take some time because significant sectoral\nreallocations are going to need to occur. Changes in consumers’ behavior, including their shopping,\ndining, and housing preferences; changes in firms’ demand for office space and work arrangements; and\nchanges in supply chains will all take time to sort out. The pandemic was a significant shock to the\neconomy – the largest in most of our lifetimes. A significant number of firms have already declared\nbankruptcy. Many workers will need to be rehired; some will have to find jobs in different industries.

Fiscal policymakers made grants to\nindividuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities. They offered\nexpanded unemployment benefits and loans to small businesses that turn into grants if they maintain their\npayrolls. It is clear that these programs made a significant difference; it is also clear that more fiscal\nsupport is needed to provide a bridge for households, small businesses, and state and local municipalities\nthat have borne the brunt of the economic shutdown until the recovery is sustainably in place.\n\nAs one indicator of the need, I point you to recent analysis by a Brookings Institution researcher of data\nfrom the Census Bureau’s Pulse Survey from the third week in June. These data show that 16.5 percent\nof households with children reported that sometimes or often their children were not eating enough due to\na lack of resources. This is more than 5 times as high as in 2018. It translates into 14 million children,\nwhich is over 2-1/2 times the number at the peak of the Great Recession.6\n\nUnlike the federal government, the Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken\nsignificant actions to ensure that financial markets have enough liquidity to continue to function well and\nthat credit can flow to households and businesses. Actions include buying Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities to address strains in these markets, and setting up a variety of so-called 13(3)\nfacilities. These emergency lending facilities, with the backing of the U.S. Treasury, serve as a backstop\nto other key credit markets and support the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state\n6\nLauren Bauer, “About 14 Million Children in the U.S. Are Not Getting Enough to Eat,” Up Front, The Brookings\nInstitution, July 9, 2020. (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/09/about-14-million-children-in-the-usare-not-getting-enough-to-eat/)\n\n\f9\nand local governments. The Fed is also ensuring that our central bank counterparties abroad have access\nto dollar funding. Because much of the flow of credit to households and businesses relies on the banking\nsystem, the Fed has encouraged banks to use its discount window as a source of liquidity and to work\nwith their borrowers affected by the virus. The Fed has temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory\nrequirements and supervisory oversight so that banks have greater capacity to lend, but it has also\nsuspended share buybacks, limited dividend distributions, and is requiring large banks to reassess their\nlong-run capital plans to ensure they remain adequately capitalized to sustain lending through the\ndownturn. Since March, the FOMC has set its fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent. At our\nmeeting last week, we reiterated that we expect to maintain this target range until we are confident that\nthe economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price\nstability goals.\n\nThe portfolio of Fed actions has helped to relieve stress in financial markets, improve market functioning,\nsupport the flow of credit to businesses and households, and contribute to very accommodative financial\nconditions in support of economic activity.\n\nAs the economy emerges from the reopening phase and moves into the recovery phase, the focus of Fed\npolicy will expand from supporting market functioning and the flow of credit to ensuring that appropriate\nmonetary policy accommodation remains in place to support the economy’s return to more normal levels\nof economic activity and employment and inflation’s moving back up. Although our policy rate is\nalready at its effective lower bound, the tools that we used to support the recovery from the Great\nRecession, including forward guidance about the future path of policy and purchases of longer-term\nTreasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities, can be used to provide additional accommodation.\nClear communications about our policy strategy, which is part of our current review of our monetary\n\n\f10\npolicy framework, can also make the monetary policy actions we take more effective. 7 As Fed Chair\nPowell indicated in his recent press conference, we plan to wrap up the review in the near future.8\n\nBy the end of this year, I expect that output will still be about 6 percent below its level at the end of last\nyear; that the unemployment rate will remain elevated, at around 9 percent or so; and that inflation will be\nwell below our 2 percent goal. Of course, the uncertainty around this forecast is extremely high: we are\nin an unprecedented situation and outcomes depend not only on appropriate economic policy but also on\npublic health considerations. The increase in virus cases that we’ve seen in recent weeks has raised the\ndownside risks to the outlook and is a stark reminder that there are several different scenarios that could\nplay out. While there are many uncertainties, there is one thing you can be certain of: the Federal Reserve\nis committed to using all of its policy tools to provide relief to households and businesses, to foster\nstability in the financial system, and to support the recovery back to maximum employment and price\nstability in service to the public.\n\nFor information about the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary policy framework, including strategy, tools,\nand communications, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-toolsand-communications.htm.\n7\n\nSee “Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference,” July 29, 2020\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200729.pdf).\n\n8\n\n\fCharts for “The Economy and Monetary Policy\nin Our Challenging Times”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nEconomists on the Economy\nCouncil for Economic Education\nNew York, NY\n(via videoconference)\nJune 17, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me start by thanking Nan Morrison and the Council for Economic Education for the opportunity to\nspeak today. I have the pleasure of serving on the council’s board so I have seen firsthand the important\nwork the council is doing to increase economic and financial literacy in the country. As the council’s\nmission statement explains, equipping students with this knowledge can help them make better decisions\nfor themselves, their families, and their communities. It is noteworthy that despite the burdens of the\npandemic, the council has found creative ways to carry on its mission, including its support of teachers,\nthe National Economics Challenge, and this speakers’ series.\n\nToday, before we open it up to questions, I’ll give you an update on the economy and on the Federal\nReserve’s policy response. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Current Economy\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all\nover the world. This is an unprecedented situation and unprecedented actions have been taken in\nresponse. The country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus,\nresulting in a shutdown of much of the economy starting in March. This was an investment in public\nhealth that bought some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, for\ndoctors and scientists to learn more about the disease itself, and for the country to begin to develop tests\nand treatments. But at the same time, the effect of the shutdown on the economy was swift and severe.\n\n[FIGURE 1] In the first quarter, real output declined at a 5 percent annual rate, with real consumption\ndown almost 7 percent and nonresidential business fixed investment down nearly 8 percent. These\ndeclines reflect what occurred in a single month, March. Earlier this month, the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee determined that economic activity peaked in\n\n\f2\nFebruary and that the U.S. economy entered a recession. I anticipate that the second quarter will show the\nmost severe effects of the pandemic shutdown on economic activity. Most private-sector forecasts for\nsecond quarter GDP growth range from minus 25 down to minus 40 percent, measured at an annual rate.\nI agree that second quarter growth could be the largest quarterly decline on record.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity led to both headline and core inflation readings moving down in\nMarch and April. I expect inflation to decline further this year because the sharp pullback in demand will\noutweigh any upward pressure coming from limited supplies of certain goods and services.\n\nIn recent weeks, states have begun to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, and we are beginning\nto see some positive signs in the data. Retail sales rebounded significantly in May, with sales up in all\nmajor categories. In the Fourth District, which includes Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and\nWest Virginia, some activities have picked up faster than our business contacts had expected. Tourism\nactivity increased after Memorial Day and foot traffic at retail stores in the region moved up. Even so,\nabout 40 percent of our contacts do not expect activity to recover to pre-pandemic levels for at least a\nyear.\n\nAs more regions and sectors of the economy reopen, rates of growth are going to look very good, but we\nare digging out from a very deep hole and it is more informative to think in terms of levels.\n\nOne of the most positive pieces of news we’ve received is the employment report for May. Instead of\nrising as most economists expected, the unemployment rate fell. And instead of losing jobs, payrolls\nincreased by 2.5 million jobs. This is great news and points to some stabilization in the labor market after\ntwo months of deep declines. I am hoping we will continue to see positive reports over coming months as\nmore of the economy opens up.\n\n\f3\nBut it is also important to put May’s report into perspective.\n\n[FIGURE 3] In April, the unemployment rate surged to 14.7 percent. In May, it fell to 13.3 percent, still\nconsiderably above its previous peak in October 2009, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and well\nabove the 3.5 percent it was as recently as February. In May, 21 million workers were unemployed\ncompared with 6 million in February. That is about one in 12 Americans aged 16 or older. This is worse\nthan in October 2009, when about one in 15 people were unemployed.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The gain of 2.5 million jobs in May was a record monthly gain, but it is only about 11\npercent of the job losses in March and April.\n\n[FIGURE 5] In fact, the level of employment is near the lows we saw right after the Great Recession. So\nthat means the economy has lost almost all of the jobs it added over the entire expansion of 10-plus years.\nEmployment is 13 percent below February’s level.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market is even sharper than these numbers indicate. Many people left the\nwork force at the beginning of the shutdown and they do not show up in the unemployment rate, and\nmany workers had their hours cut. Our survey of firms in the Fourth District indicates that while layoffs\nbegan to slow in May, firms have recalled workers more slowly than they originally intended to.\n\nMoreover, the improvements in May were not evenly shared. Indeed, half of the net private-sector job\nlosses since February have been in the leisure and hospitality and the retail trade sectors, the two sectors\nranked lowest in terms of average hourly earnings.\n\n\f4\n[FIGURE 6] The unemployment rates among blacks and Hispanics have been chronically above those of\nwhites and Asians. Over the long expansion, we had finally seen some progress being made on that front,\nas the gap in unemployment rates narrowed. But the pandemic has increased the disparities. All groups\nhave experienced an increase in their unemployment rate since February, but the increase was less for\nwhites than for the other groups. And in May, the unemployment rate for both blacks and Asians\ncontinued to edge up rather than fall. It is particularly distressing that much of the sacrifice over the\npandemic period is being borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority\nworkers and communities, and the smaller of the small businesses.\n\n[FIGURE 7] And it shines a bright light on long-standing economic inequality that needs to be addressed\nif the economy is to perform up to its potential. Like the Council for Economic Education, I believe that\neducation is a path to better economic outcomes for individuals, households, and the country at large. Our\nwork force has become more educated over time. But the likelihood of completing a degree varies by\nrace. Graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have risen over time, but those of blacks remain\nwell below those of these other groups and have shown no progress over time. Economic well-being rises\nwith education, so if more is not done to ensure that blacks who enter college have the support to\ncomplete their degrees, economic inequality is likely to continue to rise.1\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\nLet me now turn to the outlook and policy. Macroeconomic forecasting is particularly challenging at this\ntime. With states relaxing stay-at-home restrictions, I expect economic activity to pick up in the second\nhalf of the year. But there is considerable uncertainty about what the recovery will look like after the\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Community Development and Human Capital,” remarks at the 2015 Policy Summit on\nHousing, Human Capital, and Inequality, Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond,\nPittsburgh, PA, June 19, 2015 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20150619community-development-and-human-capital.aspx). And see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\n“Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2019, Featuring Supplemental Data from April 2020,”\nMay 2020 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019preface.htm).\n1\n\n\f5\neconomy reopens. The shape of the recovery will depend on the path of the virus and our ability to\nhandle its spread through testing, contact tracing, treatment, and risk-focused restrictions on activity. It\nwill also depend on the behavior of households and businesses and how comfortable they feel in reengaging in economic activity. The Cleveland Fed’s daily national survey of households suggests widely\nvarying views about the pandemic and how people plan to behave. About 60 percent of the respondents\nthink the pandemic will last a year or less, and on average, this group says they are likely to return to their\npre-pandemic usage of bars and restaurants, public spaces, public transportation, and crowded events.\nThe other 40 percent of the respondents expect the pandemic to last more than a year, and on average, this\ngroup says they will not engage in these activities to the same extent they once did, even after the\npandemic has ended. 2 It will be important to continue to monitor household and business attitudes in\nassessing the outlook.\n\nThe other important factor that will determine the path of the recovery is how successful policy actions\nare in ensuring that the temporary disruption in activity we have seen so far does not cause lasting damage\nto the economy and that the recovery has enough support to be sustained.\n\nLet me discuss some of these policy actions and then talk about the outlook. Both the federal government\nand the Federal Reserve took significant actions quickly to provide households and businesses with relief\nduring the shutdown. Fiscal policymakers made grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by\nthe pandemic, and states and municipalities. They have expanded unemployment benefits and have\nfunded the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides small businesses with loans that turn into grants\nif they maintain their payrolls. As the magnitude of the need has come into better focus, the federal\ngovernment has increased its level of support. Although the amount of support has been sizable, so is the\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s website provides updates of these survey results each Wednesday on the Consumers and\nCOVID-19 page, https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/consumers-and-covid-19.aspx.\n\n2\n\n\f6\ndepth of the economic downturn. In my view, further direct fiscal support will be needed for states and\nmunicipal governments and for households most affected by the pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken significant actions and has\ncommitted to using its full set of tools to support the economy, guided by our congressional mandate to\npromote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, the Fed began taking actions to help ensure that financial markets have enough\nliquidity to continue to function well. Well-functioning financial markets are what allow credit to flow to\nhouseholds and businesses and monetary policy to effectively transmit to broader financial conditions. So\nwhen conditions became strained, the Fed began buying Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and conducted operations in the repo market to ease those strains. At our meeting last week,\nthe FOMC said that over the coming months, the Fed would increase its holdings of Treasuries and\nmortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.\n\nThe Fed has also set up emergency lending facilities, with the backing of the U.S. Treasury, to serve as a\nbackstop to other key credit markets, including money market mutual funds and the commercial paper\nmarket. The Fed is also ensuring that our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar\nfunding. Although volatility and risk spreads have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, there has been a\nsignificant lessening of stress and an improvement in market functioning in many markets since these\nactions have been taken.\n\n\f7\nAnother set of our emergency lending facilities focuses more directly on supporting the flow of credit to\nhouseholds, to businesses of all sizes, and to state and local governments. 3 Included in this group are the\nMunicipal Liquidity Facility, which purchases short-term notes from states to help them manage cashflow pressures, and the Main Street Lending Program, which supports lending to small and medium-sized\nbusinesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the pandemic. Based on\nconsultations with both lenders and potential borrowers, the Fed has adjusted the terms on some of these\nprograms to ensure that they will support the economy as effectively as they can while safeguarding\ntaxpayer funds. And earlier this week the Fed announced it was seeking public feedback on a proposed\nexpansion of the Main Street program to nonprofits, which provide vital services in the economy.\n\nBecause much of the flow of credit to households and businesses relies on the banking system, the Fed\nhas encouraged banks to use its discount window as a source of liquidity and to work with their borrowers\naffected by the virus. The Fed has temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements and\nsupervisory oversight so that banks have greater capacity to lend.\n\nLast, but not least, in March the FOMC reduced its target range for the fed funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent.\nAt our meeting last week, we maintained the funds rate at that level and reiterated that we expect to\nmaintain this target range until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on\ntrack to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nAs more states relax restrictions on activity, the economy is moving from a shutdown phase, through a reopening phase, and into a recovery phase. As this happens, the focus of Fed policy will expand from\nsupporting market functioning and the flow of credit to supporting the recovery. I expect to see an\n\nIn addition to the Municipal Liquidity and the Main Street Lending Program, these facilities include the Paycheck\nProtection Program Liquidity Facility, the Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities, and the Term\nAsset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. More information on the Federal Reserve’s actions in response to the effects\nof the coronavirus on the economy is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/covid-19.htm.\n\n3\n\n\f8\nimprovement in the second half of the year as the economy reopens. But after that, I believe it will take\nquite some time for economic activity and job levels to approach more normal levels. The improvement\nwill vary across sectors, because even if people can resume some of their normal activities, they need to\nfeel some reassurance that it is safe to do so. In some industries, like travel and leisure and hospitality, it\nwill likely take quite a while longer for activity to pick up than in others. By the end of this year, I expect\nthat output will still be about 6 percent below its level at the end of last year, and the unemployment rate,\nwhile down from its peak, will still be around 9 percent. I expect inflation to remain below our 2 percent\ngoal for some time to come.\n\nIn my view, very accommodative monetary policy will be needed to support the recovery and the return\nto the FOMC’s goals of price stability and maximum employment over time. My economic forecast is\nvery similar to the median forecasts of the FOMC participants that were released last week, which show\nan economic recovery starting in the second half of the year and continuing over the next couple of years.\nAlmost all of my FOMC colleagues agree with me that it will be appropriate for the fed funds rate to\nremain at its current level through 2022, the end of our projection horizon, in support of the recovery. 4\n\nOver the next several weeks as more states reopen, we will get further readings on the condition of the\neconomy. The uncertainty surrounding the outlook is extremely high because we are in an unprecedented\nsituation. Outcomes depend not only on appropriate economic policy but also on public health\nconsiderations. Epidemiologists tell us to expect periodic upswings in the number of cases until a vaccine\ncan be distributed. We are seeing that today in some locations. People often say that the virus determines\nthe timeline. I agree, but that does not mean we are helpless to affect the outcomes. Increased investment\nwould speed up the progress on testing, contact tracing, and treatments, and help ensure that the\nhealthcare system has adequate capacity. Better adherence to the guidelines on social distancing, mask\n\nSee Press Conference Projection Materials, June 10, 2020\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20200610.htm).\n\n4\n\n\f9\nwearing, and hygiene would help to control the virus’s spread. These actions would make it safer for\npeople to re-engage in activity and would allow for interventions to become more focused on helping\nthose at highest risk from the disease, thereby supporting the recovery. And May’s positive employment\nand retail sales reports remind us of the resiliency of the U.S. economy. Of course, if the number of cases\nof the virus is not well-controlled and the healthcare system gets overwhelmed, then the economic\noutcomes I have discussed could turn out to be much more dire, with people and businesses restricting\ntheir own activity even if states do not reinstate restrictions.\n\nSo at this juncture, I think it makes sense for monetary policymakers to continue to monitor the economy\nas the country begins to re-engage in economic activity, to continue to support the flow of credit to\nhouseholds and businesses and ensure the smooth functioning of financial markets, to remember that\nthere are several different scenarios that could play out, and to stand ready to use all of our tools to\nmitigate lasting damage and to support the economy’s recovery back to maximum employment and price\nstability.\n\n\fCharts for “The Outlook for the Economy\nand Federal Reserve Policy”\nLoretta J.

            "content": "An Update on the Economy\nand the Federal Reserve’s Policy Response\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPOWER Series\nCFA Society Chicago\nChicago, IL\n(via videoconference)\nMay 12, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the CFA Society Chicago and the CFA’s Women’s Network for inviting me to speak today. In\npreparing my remarks, I noticed that the last formal speech I gave on the economy was on March 3,\nwhich seems like a lifetime ago, and it was in London, which seems like a world away. A lot has\nhappened since then. So before the question and answer portion of today’s session, I’d like to start with a\nbrief update on the economy and the Federal Reserve’s policy response. As always, the views I’ll present\nare my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all\nover the world. I want to express my deepest sympathies to those who have been affected by the virus.\nThis is an unprecedented situation. In the interests of public health, the country has taken aggressive\nsocial distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus, resulting in a shutdown of much of the\neconomy. This investment in public health is buying time for the healthcare system to increase its\ncapacity to care for the sick, for doctors and scientists to learn more about the disease itself, and for the\ncountry to develop tests and treatments. This investment is beginning to pay off in terms of fewer new\nhospitalizations in some locations. We owe a great deal of thanks to the healthcare workers, public health\nofficials, scientists, and all those who support them as they battle the virus, and to all the people working\nin essential activities, including grocery stores, delivery companies, and municipal services, whose\ndedication allows many of us to stay safely at home.\n\nWhile the shutdown has yielded public health benefits, its effects on the economy have been swift and\nsevere. In the first quarter, real output declined at a nearly 5 percent annual rate, with real consumption\ndown over 7-1/2 percent and nonresidential business fixed investment down nearly 9 percent. And these\nsharp declines reflect mainly what occurred in just one month, March. In April, the unemployment rate\nsurged to 14.7 percent, its highest level since the Great Depression. Remember, it was only this past\n\n\f2\nFebruary when the unemployment rate was a low 3.5 percent. Over the past two months, payrolls\ndeclined by more than 21 million jobs; that is nearly the same the number of jobs added over the entire\n10-plus-year expansion. There were losses across all major sectors. The deterioration in the labor market\nis even sharper than these numbers indicate. A large number of people left the workforce last month and\nthey do not show up in the unemployment rate, and many workers had their hours cut. Certainly, this is\nthe worst and speediest deterioration in the labor market many of us have ever seen.\n\nBoth headline and core inflation readings moved down in March, reflecting the drop in oil prices due to\nboth supply and demand conditions in global markets, and the start of the shutdown in activity. I expect\ninflation will move down further this year because the sharp pullback in demand will outweigh any\nupward pressure due to limited supply in certain goods and services.\n\nOur outreach at the Cleveland Fed is painting a very painful picture. Since mid-March, we have watched\nconfidence among regional businesses and households drop from week to week as the negative effects of\nthe virus have risen. Regional firms are taking defensive positions, pulling back from risk taking,\nconserving cash, putting capital expenditures on hold, and drawing on their credit lines. At the start of the\nshutdown, many told us that they intended to keep their employees on their payrolls, but over time, an\nincreasing number have felt the need to lay off or furlough workers. The Cleveland Fed’s national survey\nof consumers indicates that most respondents initially thought the virus outbreak would last less than six\nmonths. More now believe it will last one year, and a growing number think it could last two years.1\n\nIn some sense, the sharp contraction we are seeing should not come as a surprise: it is a direct result of the\nnecessary actions taken to shut down activity to try to limit the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, the\nnumbers are eye-popping. And it is worth noting that much of the sacrifice is being borne by the most\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s website provides updates of these survey results each Wednesday on the Consumers and\nCOVID-19 page, https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/consumers-and-covid-19.aspx.\n1\n\n\f3\nvulnerable in our economy: lower-income workers and communities and small businesses. In fact, the\njob losses in April fell disproportionately on lower-wage workers. This resulted in a sharp rise in average\nhourly earnings in the report, which was not indicative of the state of the job market. Our outreach paints\na more accurate picture. Over three-quarters of the regional community development organizations\nrecently surveyed by the Cleveland Fed said that the low- and moderate-income areas they serve are\nexperiencing significant disruptions that will hamper recovery.\n\nI anticipate that the second quarter will show the most severe effects on the economy. Given the\nunprecedented nature of the shutdown, private-sector forecasters are offering a wide range of estimates\nfor second quarter real GDP growth, with most falling in the range of minus 25 to minus 40 percent. My\nown estimate is in the middle of this range, but with numbers so bad, the precision seems less relevant. I\nanticipate that the reported unemployment rate is likely to go up further, perhaps to 20 percent or even\nmore.\n\nLooking ahead, parts of the country are beginning to relax some of the stay-at-home orders, and economic\nactivity will likely begin to pick up in the second half of the year. But these are still early days, and there\nis considerable uncertainty around what the recovery will look like. It will depend on the evolution of the\nvirus and the success of our methods to control its spread while it is still among us. It will also depend on\nhow successful policy actions are in ensuring that the temporary disruption in activity does not cause\nmore persistent damage to the economy and that the economy is well staged for a recovery. Let me\ndiscuss some of these policy actions and then talk about the outlook.\n\nUnprecedented times require unprecedented actions. Both the federal government and the Federal\nReserve took action quickly. These relief efforts can be viewed as building a bridge to get households\nand businesses from the generally good economy we had in February to the other side of the pandemic\nshutdown period. The shutdown period has lengthened over time, driven by the course of the disease. So\n\n\f4\nthe bridge has to be longer than first assumed, and it also has to be wider, as more households and firms\nare in need of some kind of help.\n\nFiscal policymakers have taken significant actions, including making grants to individuals, certain\nbusinesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities. They have expanded\nunemployment benefits and have funded the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides small\nbusinesses with loans that turn into grants if they maintain their payrolls. As the magnitude of the need\nhas come into better focus, the federal government has increased its level of support. Although the\namount of support has been sizable, so is the depth of the economic downturn. In my view, further direct\nfiscal support will be needed if we are to avoid the longer-lasting damage to the economy that would\nhappen if job losses become persistent and a large share of otherwise viable businesses fail.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken significant actions and has\ncommitted to using its full set of tools to support the economy, guided by our congressional mandate to\npromote maximum employment and price stability. The actions fall into three general categories. First,\nsome of the Fed’s actions focus on ensuring that financial markets have enough liquidity to continue to\nfunction well. Well-functioning financial markets allow credit to flow to households and businesses and\nmonetary policy to effectively transmit to broader financial conditions. The Fed aggressively responded\nto stresses in the U.S. Treasury market by purchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and by conducting operations in the repo market. With the approval and financial backing of\nthe U.S. Treasury, the Fed is also setting up emergency lending facilities to serve as a backstop to other\nkey credit markets, including money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. And the Fed\nis ensuring that primary dealers have access to liquidity and that our central bank counterparties abroad\nhave access to dollar funding. Although volatility and risk spreads have not returned to pre-pandemic\nlevels, there has been a significant lessening of stress and an improvement in market functioning in many\nmarkets since these actions have been taken.\n\n\f5\n\nA second set of Fed actions focuses more directly on supporting the flow of credit to households, to\nbusinesses of all sizes, and to state and local governments. These programs include the Paycheck\nProtection Program Liquidity Facility, the Main Street Lending Program, the Primary and Secondary\nMarket Corporate Credit Facilities, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, and the Municipal\nLiquidity Facility.2 Based on consultations with both lenders and potential borrowers, the Fed adjusted\nthe terms on some of these programs to ensure that they will support the economy as effectively as they\ncan while safeguarding taxpayer funds.\n\nThe third category of Fed actions focuses on banks because much of the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses relies on the banking system. The Fed has encouraged banks to use its discount window as a\nsource of liquidity and to work with their borrowers affected by the virus. The Board of Governors has\ntemporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements and supervisory oversight so that banks have\ngreater capacity to lend in a safe and sound manner through the downturn. Our current situation\nhighlights the value of a resilient banking system, one that builds up sufficient capital and liquidity\nbuffers in good economic times in preparation for bad ones.\n\nWhile this is a long list of actions, the Fed continues to look for gaps where our tools can be used to\nbenefit the economy. For example, the Board of Governors is evaluating an approach to meet the needs\nof nonprofits, including institutions of higher education, because they play an important role in the\neconomy. And I shouldn’t conclude this list of policy actions without discussing our usual tool of\nmonetary policy, the federal funds rate. The FOMC has reduced its target range for the fed funds rate to\n0 to 1/4 percent, and we have said that we expect to maintain this target range until we are confident that\nthe economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price\n\nMore information on the Federal Reserve’s actions in response to the effects of the coronavirus on the economy is\navailable at https://www.federalreserve.gov/covid-19.htm.\n2\n\n\f6\nstability goals. Low rates cannot stop the sharp drop in activity caused by the pandemic shutdown, but\nonce the economy begins to reopen, accommodative monetary policy will be needed for some time to\nsupport the recovery.\n\nSo what might that recovery look like? A reasonable baseline outlook is that as some of the stay-at-home\nrestrictions are lifted, the economy will begin to grow again in the second half of this year and\nunemployment will begin to move down, with continued recovery in 2021. I would expect this\nimprovement to start off slowly, with variation across sectors, because even if people can resume some of\ntheir normal activities, they need to feel some reassurance that it is safe to do so. In some industries, like\ntravel and leisure and hospitality, it will likely take quite a while longer for activity to pick up than in\nothers. Under this baseline, by the end of this year, output would still be below its level at the end of last\nyear, by 5 percent or even somewhat more, and the unemployment rate would still be in the high single\ndigits or low double digits. I expect inflation to remain low for the remainder of this year and for some\ntime to come.\n\nAchieving this outcome depends on a number of things falling into place. It depends on there being a\nsolid enough bridge of economic relief and support. It depends on the relaxation of stay-at-home\nrestrictions being based on public health criteria and being done in a careful and responsible way,\nrespecting guidelines on social distancing, mask-wearing, and hygiene. It depends on more progress\nbeing made on testing and treatments so that the virus can be better controlled and people feel safe reengaging in activity. And it depends on the medical system being prepared to handle the periodic\nincreases in cases that epidemiologists tell us to expect. These are a lot of conditions, which is another\nway of saying there is considerable risk around this outcome. It isn’t difficult to imagine more\npessimistic scenarios, especially if an upsurge in virus cases necessitates shutting down activity again or if\nthere is considerably more harm in terms of business and personal bankruptcies or if instabilities in the\n\n\f7\nbanking system arise. At this point, I think some of the more pessimistic outcomes are almost as likely as\nthe reasonable baseline I just described.\n\nSo I think it makes sense for policymakers to continue to monitor the economy, continue to support the\nflow of credit to households and businesses and the smooth functioning of financial markets, evaluate\nseveral scenarios rather than focusing only on a modal forecast, and stand ready to address the challenges\nthat will arise as the country incrementally re-engages in economic activity as the year progresses.\n\n\f"

            "content": "Statement Regarding My Dissenting Vote at the Meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee Held on March 15, 2020*\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMarch 17, 2020\n\n*\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f1\nI usually discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy in public speeches. Because of the\ncoronavirus, my upcoming speeches have been canceled, so I am providing this statement in lieu of a\nspeech.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, I dissented from the action of the majority of the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC). As the post-meeting statement issued by the Committee notes, I was fully supportive of all of\nthe actions taken to promote the smooth functioning of markets and the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses but preferred to reduce the target range of the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent instead of\nto 0 to 1/4 percent as was done.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is harming communities and disrupting economic activity in the U.S. and other\ncountries. In the Fourth Federal Reserve District and elsewhere in the country, steps are being taken to\nprotect people’s health, including practicing social distancing, canceling gatherings, and closing schools.\nWhen they are able to, businesses have invoked work-from-home practices and many have restricted all\nnonessential travel. These are necessary steps taken in the interest of public health. There will be a sharp\npullback in economic activity, at least in the near term, as the country focuses on tackling the challenges\nposed by the virus. The recent fiscal policy actions to increase access to testing and healthcare for those\nwho are sick, to support public and private healthcare providers who are dealing with virus containment\nand the treatment of ill patients, and to help workers and small businesses that will be most affected by\nwork stoppages are the types of government policy measures that can be most helpful in defending\nagainst the adverse consequences of the disease for individuals and the economy.\n\nIn the wake of the widening spread of the virus and the rising level of uncertainty it brings, global\nfinancial conditions have tightened considerably, as investors, businesses, and financial institutions\nreassess their tolerance for risk and their economic outlooks. In the week leading up to our recent FOMC\nmeeting, increased stress and illiquidity were seen in financial markets, including the U.S. Treasury\n\n\f2\nmarket, a foundational market for the world’s financial system. In response, the Federal Reserve\nexpanded its overnight and term repurchase agreement operations to help to improve liquidity, and I fully\nsupported this action. However, illiquid market conditions continued.\n\nLack of liquidity in financial markets is a first-order problem that can reverberate through the financial\nsystem and the economy and hinder the transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. It is\ncritical that there is sufficient liquidity to allow markets to function in an orderly way so that credit\ncontinues to flow to households and businesses. So I fully supported all of the actions that the Federal\nReserve announced on March 15 to help ensure that there is adequate liquidity in financial markets so that\ntrades can be made and credit can continue to flow. These measures include increasing our holdings of\nU.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities; lowering the rate on the standing U.S. dollar\nliquidity swap arrangements; reducing the spread between the rate at which depository institutions can\nborrow at the Federal Reserve’s discount window (the primary credit rate) and the top of the federal funds\nrate target range to 0 basis points; instituting term discount window lending; encouraging banks to use the\nliquidity and intraday credit available at the Federal Reserve’s discount window and to use their own\ncapital and liquidity buffers as they lend to households and businesses affected by the coronavirus; and\nreducing reserve requirement ratios to zero percent.\n\nIf market illiquidity continues, I will support our taking further actions to address funding needs,\nincluding activating facilities like those the Federal Reserve has used in the past, including the\ncommercial paper funding facility, to help ensure access to credit by small businesses, and the term\nauction facility to auction term funds to depository institutions should their use of the discount window\nprove insufficient.\n\nWhen markets are not functioning well, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy\nis disrupted, and any reduction in the target federal funds rate will have less of an impact on the real\n\n\f3\neconomy. In current circumstances, with social distancing and the stoppage of spending activity, rate cuts\nare also less impactful. I dissented because I viewed a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate as\nappropriate, in support of the liquidity actions we were taking and in light of the outlook. I did not favor\nreturning the funds rate to zero and using up all of our interest-rate policy space at this time when the\ntransmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy is impaired. I preferred to stage our policy\nactions by first providing liquidity to improve market functioning, supported by a smaller reduction in the\nfunds rate. This would have preserved the option of a further cut in the funds rate, if needed, for a time\nwhen market functioning had improved and such an action could be expected to be most effective in\nsupporting the economy as it emerges from the health crisis after the medical response has been put in\nplace, new cases of the virus have begun to stabilize, social distancing has eased, and life begins to return\nto some semblance of normal.\n\nDespite my dissent at our recent meeting, I have the utmost respect for Chair Jay Powell and other\ncolleagues on the FOMC who reached a different conclusion than I did and for the Federal Reserve’s\npolicymaking process, which allows for a full discussion of the issues and the opportunity to express\ndissenting views, as we all work to set monetary policy to promote our longer-run goals of price stability\nand maximum employment on behalf of the American public.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nShadow Open Market Committee\nNew York, NY\nMarch 6, 2020\n\n*\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f1\nA tradition at FOMC meetings is that the research directors go out for dinner the night before the\nmeetings. Sometimes some of the Reserve Bank presidents join this group. Shortly after I had been\nappointed research director at the Philadelphia Fed in 2000, a group of us, which included my president\nand Marvin Goodfriend, were walking to dinner when an accident happened. In the midst of a robust\nconversation, the Philadelphia Fed president walked into a metal parking sign and cut his forehead. The\nprospect of losing the Bank’s president to a bout of tetanus flashed through my mind: it was clear he had\nto go to the emergency room to get patched up. It took some convincing, but he and I headed over to\nGeorge Washington University hospital where he was quickly taken to the back for triage. That was the\nlast I saw of him for a very long time. If any of you have ever experienced the waiting area of a large\nurban emergency room you understand that it’s not the most comfortable place to be. After a couple of\nhours, you can imagine my surprise when I saw Marvin Goodfriend walking through the emergency room\ndoor. Dinner was over and he had come back to check on me, knowing it was going to be a long night. I\nhave never forgotten this act of kindness and caring for an individual. I tell you this story now to\nillustrate the kind of person Marvin was. He a great scholar who advanced knowledge in the field of\nmonetary policy, not just out of intellectual curiosity but because he cared about people. He understood\nthat if policymakers did things right they could improve how the economy works for real people. I feel\nvery fortunate to be a part of this conference that honors Marvin Goodfriend and recognizes his many\ncontributions to the theory and practice of monetary policy.\n\nOur session discusses the contributions Marvin made to our understanding of the role of transparency and\ncommunication in monetary policymaking. I will frame my remarks around the two things Marvin\nindicated in his confirmation hearing statement that he would pursue if confirmed. First, Marvin planned\nto draw on his “academic and professional experience to promote policies that would further increase\ntransparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve.”1 This is a worthy pursuit. Congress has given\n\n“Statement of Marvin Goodfriend, Nominee to be a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem” before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, January 23, 2018.\n(https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/01-23-18%20Goodfriend%20Testimony.pdf)\n1\n\n\f2\nthe Fed a mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, and it has given the Fed\nindependence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. This independence has been\nshown to yield better economic outcomes. But a central bank cannot expect to remain independent from\nthe political process unless it is held accountable for its policy decisions and is transparent about the basis\nfor these decisions.\n\nMarvin was a strong advocate of transparency in monetary policymaking and clear communications about\nthe strategy policymakers use to set policy. He was also a persuasive advocate: many of Marvin’s\nsuggestions that were contrary to how policy setting was being done at the time have become standard\noperating practice in central banking. Recall that it wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to explicitly\nannounce changes in its fed funds rate target. At a time when the Federal Reserve was still quite\nsecretive, Marvin argued that more transparency would confer social benefits by helping to align markets’\nand policymakers’ expectations.2 Well before the Fed adopted its explicit numerical inflation target in\n2012, Marvin had been explaining the benefits such an explicit goal could play in anchoring inflation\nexpectations. He argued further that the Fed’s actions and its communications needed to be designed so\nas to make this goal a credible commitment on the part of the Fed. One way to do this is to ensure that\npolicymakers are taking a systematic approach to setting policy, which can help align the public’s policy\nexpectations with policy decisions, thereby helping to transmit monetary policy to the broader economy.\nPolicy rules are one way to foster systematic policymaking and Marvin suggested that the FOMC refer to\na Taylor-type rule when explaining its policy decisions.3\n\nSee, for example, Goodfriend, Marvin, “Monetary Mystique: Secrecy and Central Banking,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics, 17 (January 1986), pp. 63-92. (https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3932(86)90006-1)\n2\n\nGoodfriend, Marvin, “The Fed Needs a Credible Commitment to Price Stability,” testimony before the\nSubcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives,\nMarch 16, 2017. (https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/03.16.2017_marvin_goodfriend_testimony.pdf)\n3\n\n\f3\nThe FOMC has been reluctant to relinquish policymaking to following a simple rule because no one rule\nworks well enough across a variety of economic models and circumstances, and judgment will likely\nalways need to be a part of policymaking. Nonetheless, rules provide useful benchmarks. The Board of\nGovernors has begun to include a discussion of rules as benchmarks in the monetary policy report.4 In\nsome of my speeches I have referred to simple rules that have been shown to yield good economic\noutcomes as reference points to explain my own views of appropriate policy.5 The Cleveland Fed’s\nwebsite regularly updates the outcomes of seven simple policy rules across several forecasts.6\n\nOf course, one of the communications challenges for the FOMC continues to be how to convey to the\npublic a good sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy evolves without\nimplying that policy is pre-committed to a particular policy path regardless of how the economy evolves.\nMy own view is that if the Committee were willing to expand what it says in its post-meeting statement, it\ncould give a better sense of its reaction function, its medium-run outlook, the risks around the outlook,\nand policy rationale. The statement could provide a summary of changes in a consistent set of indicators\non inflation, inflation expectations, the unemployment rate, employment growth, output growth, and\nfinancial conditions that the Committee regularly assesses to formulate its outlook and view of\nappropriate policy. The statement would convey whether the accumulated changes in these indicators\nhave materially changed the Committee’s outlook. That outlook and the risks around the outlook would\nalso be summarized. The statement would then describe the Committee’s policy decision, tying that\npolicy to the achievement of its policy goals, given the outlook and risks. The statement would articulate\nthe considerations the Committee would take into account when determining future changes in policy to\n\nSee Board of Governors, “Monetary Policy Report,” February 7, 2020, pp. 33-37.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20200207_mprfullreport.pdf)\n4\n\nSee, for example, Mester, Loretta J., “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy in 2020,” National\nAssociation for Business Economics, 36th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference, Washington, DC, February\n24, 2020. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20200224-outlook-for-the-economyand-monetary-policy-in-2020)\n5\n\nSee “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/ourresearch/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules)\n6\n\n\f4\nhelp the public anticipate how policy is likely to change in response to changes in economic\ndevelopments that affect the economic outlook, without having to be prescient about how those\nconditions will actually evolve. Since the FOMC’s assessment of risks is an important part of the policy\ndiscussion, for the four meetings a year in which the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP), the Committee could release the balance of risk graphs that are part of the SEP with\nthe other charts released at the time of the press conference, rather than waiting three weeks to release\nthem with the minutes of the meeting. I believe enhancements like this would allow the FOMC to better\ncontrol the narrative about its economic and policy views and they are consistent with Marvin’s desire to\nincrease FOMC transparency in a productive way.\n\nA second thing Marvin said in his confirmation hearing statement was that his years at the Richmond Fed\n“gave him a deep appreciation of the role of the regional Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System,”\nand that the regional structure encourages diverse perspectives and innovative thinking that he would\nconsider in formulating monetary policy.7 In 1998, Marvin was a presenter at a workshop on the structure\nof the newly formed European Central Bank and laid out some of the benefits of the decentralized\nstructure of the Federal Reserve System.8 The regional structure enhances credibility by making the\ninstitution less prone to political pressure. The diffusion of power across the 12 regional Reserve Banks\nhelps build rapport with constituencies throughout the country. The regional structure also aids\ncommunication. It helps the institution collect information on economic and financial developments\nacross the country. Reserve Banks have boards of directors drawn from the private sector and typically\nhave multiple advisory councils; their presidents and staffs speak regularly with a large number of\ncontacts representing business, labor, consumers, and banking. In a dynamic economy, anecdotal\n\n7\n\nSee “Statement of Marvin Goodfriend (2018).\n\nSee Goodfriend, Marvin, “The Role of a Regional Bank in a System of Central Banks,” Carnegie-Rochester\nConference Series on Public Policy, 51, 1999, pp. 51-71. (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-2231(00)00004-X) and\nreprinted in Economic Quarterly, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 86, Winter 2000, pp. 7-25.\n(https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2000/winter/goodfriend). The workshop\nwas “Monetary Policy of the ESCB: Strategic Implementation Issues,” sponsored by the Bank of Italy, IGIER, and\nBocconi University, July 6-7, 1998, in Milan, Italy.\n8\n\n\f5\ninformation from the regional Reserve Banks can provide early indications of changing sentiment or\ndeveloping trends well before they show up in the data. Because the dispersion of activity across the\ncountry is not even, the regional structure also allows for some specialization in expertise about particular\nindustries relevant to each region, expertise that can be called on when needed.\n\nA further benefit of the regional presence is that it helps the Fed disseminate its policy messages via\nspeeches and presentations made by Reserve Bank officials. In addition, it provides a way to collect\ninformation about the impact of its policy in the community. An example of the power of the regional\nstructure in action was the program of Fed Listens events that the System held as part of its ongoing\nreview of its monetary policy framework. These events were held across the country to gain the\nperspectives of people with diverse backgrounds and in different economic circumstances about how our\ndual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices affect them.9\n\nAs has been documented, the regional Reserve Banks have also been able to provide thought leadership\nwithin the Federal Reserve System.10 Reserve Bank economists regularly interact with academic\neconomists and have provided a way for diverse analytical methods and innovative thinking to enter into\nthe process of monetary policymaking, helping the institution to guard against group think and leading to\nbetter policy outcomes. Ideas such as rational expectations, time consistency, the important roles of\ncredibility and commitment, and inflation targeting first came into the System via a Reserve Bank.11 The\nA summary of the Cleveland Fed’s Fed Listens event is available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/events/2019/policy-summit/fed-listens.aspx. A full list of Fed Listens events is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fedlistens-events.htm.\n9\n\nSee Bordo, Michael D., and Edward S. Prescott, “Federal Reserve Structure, Economic Ideas, and Monetary and\nFinancial Policy,” NBER Working Paper No. 26098, July 2019 and Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working\nPaper No. 19-13, June 2019.

However, the reality is that the economy is complex and so is monetary\npolicymaking. Different models, techniques, and measurements need to be brought to bear in order to\nassess appropriate monetary policy. Participants on the FOMC bring their perspectives to the table and\nthese perspectives are inputs into the consensus-building process. While the FOMC works hard to get to\na consensus, there will inevitably be times when individual policymakers hold different views. These\ndiverse views are shared with the public and ultimately result in better policymaking as sound ideas gain\ntraction. Indeed, the contributions that Marvin Goodfriend made while he was an economist and policy\nadvisor at the Richmond Fed prove this point. His arguments on the value of transparency and good\ncommunication in monetary policymaking began in the 1980s and ultimately gained traction within the\nSystem. The FOMC can thank Marvin Goodfriend for starting us on our journey toward better policy\ncommunications in support of more effective monetary policy, a journey that continues to this day.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Society of Professional Economists\nAnnual Dinner\nLondon, United Kingdom\nMarch 3, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nGood evening. I thank the Society of Professional Economists for inviting me to speak at the society’s\nannual dinner. It is truly an honor to join you and to count myself among the list of distinguished\nspeakers who have addressed you at previous events. This evening I will update you on the outlook for\nthe economy and monetary policy from my side of the pond and on the Federal Reserve’s review of our\nmonetary policy framework: the strategy, tools, and communications we use to make monetary policy.\nAs always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or\nof my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook for the U.S.\nLet me start with the topic on everyone’s mind: the coronavirus. The recent emergence of the coronavirus\nin Wuhan, China, and its spread to other countries in the world, including the U.K. and the U.S., is\ncausing considerable human suffering. It is also clouding the outlook for the global economy. This is a\nrapidly evolving situation that we are continuing to monitor closely. For the U.S. economy, the risks and\nuncertainty surrounding the outlook have increased in a short period of time. In China, the reductions in\ntravel and shutdown in activity are widely expected to cause a sharp decline in output in China in the first\nquarter. China is a large player in the global economy, accounting for 16 percent of global GDP. So\nwhat happens there will have effects in other countries, especially those with strong trade ties to China.\nTrade and supply chain disruptions, travel spending cuts, and declines in consumer and business\nsentiment will also weigh on U.S. growth at least in the first half of the year, as will the extreme moves\nwe have experienced in U.S. financial markets. These moves have reflected a sharp pullback in investors’\nwillingness to take on risk and the flight to quality into U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nAt this point, both the magnitude and duration of the economic effects of the virus are highly uncertain.\nThey will depend on how the disease progresses, the efficacy of the actions countries take to help contain\nthe spread of the virus and treat the sick, public health officials’ contingency planning and\n\n\f2\nimplementation of those plans, and other actions policymakers take to mitigate the effects on sentiment\nand economic activity. Today, the FOMC reduced its target range for the federal funds rate, our policy\nrate, by 50 basis points to 1 to 1-1/4 percent in response to the risks to the outlook.\n\nI am currently putting together the forecast I will submit as part of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic\nProjections, which will be released after the conclusion of our March FOMC meeting in two weeks. In\nstructuring my remarks, I thought it would be helpful to first discuss my views on the U.S. economy\nbefore the emergence of the coronavirus, and then discuss the potential ramifications of this risk.\n\nThe economic expansion in the U.S. is now in its 11th year, the longest expansion on record. The course\nof the expansion has seen its ups and downs, but the resiliency of the U.S. economy has been remarkable.\nLast year, uncertainties around trade policy and tariffs, as well as slow global growth, clouded the U.S.\noutlook. In prior years, the sharp drop in oil prices and strength of the dollar weighed on the U.S.\neconomy. Yet, with support from fiscal and monetary policy, the expansion continued. The Federal\nReserve has a statutory mandate to set U.S. monetary policy to achieve the longer-run goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. Viewed through this lens, the U.S. economy has been performing\nwell.\n\nLast year, real GDP grew at a 2.3 percent pace, above my 2 percent estimate of its longer-run trend and\nbetter than many economists and businesses had expected. Indeed, at the start of last year, concerns\ndeveloped that a sharper slowdown in the economy was a real possibility. In light of the FOMC’s\nreassessment of its outlook and risks, the FOMC’s anticipated path of appropriate monetary policy\nflattened, leading to more accommodative financial conditions that helped to support the expansion. As\nthe year wore on, several downside risks to the outlook worsened and new ones emerged. These risks\nincluded those associated with trade policy and slower global growth, as well as geopolitical risks\nsurrounding the possibility of a “hard” Brexit, social unrest in Hong Kong, and rising tensions in the\n\n\f3\nMiddle East. The FOMC responded to these risks to the outlook by lowering the federal funds rate, our\npolicy rate, a cumulative 75 basis points. More accommodative financial conditions, coupled with some\neasing of trade tensions and uncertainty by the end of the year, helped to support last year’s above-trend\ngrowth.\n\nWith respect to the mix of growth across sectors it has been a tale of two cities. Business spending has\nbeen soft, while consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of output in the U.S., has been\nsolid. Business investment, manufacturing, and exports declined over most of last year. Slow growth\nabroad, especially in Europe and China, and uncertainty over trade policy and tariffs have weakened\ndemand for U.S. exports, which has weighed on the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors.\nProblems with the Boeing 737 MAX airplane also weighed on investment and the decision to halt\nproduction of the plane will be a drag on U.S. growth at least in the first quarter of this year and perhaps\nlonger. On the positive side, some of the uncertainty over trade policy and its impact on business\nsentiment eased with the signing of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the\nPhase One trade deal with China.\n\nIn contrast to soft business spending, consumer spending has been driving the U.S. economy forward, and\nthat has been the case for most of the expansion. Solid fundamentals have helped to support consumer\nspending. Household balance sheets are healthy. Low mortgage rates contributed to the turnaround in\nresidential investment in the second half of 2019, which rose for the first time since the end of 2017.\nHousehold income has been growing, reflecting the solid performance of the labor market.\n\nLast year, firms added an average of 175,000 jobs per month to their payrolls, and in January, an even\nstronger 225,000 jobs were added. So the pace of job growth in the U.S. has been well above trend,\nwhich most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. A benefit of the long expansion is\nthat more people have been drawn into the labor force. The participation rate has held up even though the\n\n\f4\nlarge baby boom generation is aging and leaving the workforce through retirement. The prime-age\nparticipation rate of those between ages 25 and 54 has been rising and is now at its highest level of the\nexpansion, led by women. The unemployment rate, at 3.6 percent, is near its 50-year low; it has fallen\nnearly half of a percentage point over the past year. Broader measures of the unemployment rate that\ninclude discouraged workers and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work are also near\nhistoric lows.\n\nStrong labor markets mean aggregate wages are rising in the U.S., especially for lower paying jobs. But\nwages have not accelerated as much as one might have expected based on the reports from firms about\nhow hard it is to find workers. This could reflect labor mix: older workers exiting the labor force\ntypically are higher paid than those entering. It could also reflect a faster pace of automation, one way\nsome of our business contacts are addressing labor shortages. Other contacts tell us that they don’t\nbelieve raising wages will attract qualified workers and are not willing to go that route to fill positions. It\nremains to be seen how much longer that situation can last, especially if labor markets tighten further.\n\nIn assessing how the labor market is doing relative to what is sustainable over the longer run, we need to\nremain humble. Five years ago, FOMC participants’ estimates of unemployment over the longer run\nranged from 5.0 to 5.8 percent; the current range is 3.5 to 4.5 percent. I’ve brought my estimate down\nover time and recently I’ve been estimating a range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent. But if the unemployment rate\ncontinues at these low rates and wage pressures remain muted, I’m open to lowering my estimate again.\n\nTurning to inflation, the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal is 2 percent, as measured by the year-overyear change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This measure moved up to 2\npercent in 2018, but the increase wasn’t sustained as PCE inflation moved back down in 2019; it stood at\n1.7 percent in January. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices to strip out some\nvolatility, also moved down last year; it now stands at 1.6 percent. But other measures of inflation show\n\n\f5\nfirmer readings, at or above 2 percent.1 These alternative gauges are not a substitute for the PCE inflation\nmeasure that the FOMC has targeted, but they do reduce my concern that inflation will continue to be\nweak. Inflation expectations have been relatively well anchored near 2 percent. Conditional on that,\nresearch done by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research suggests that if labor markets remain\nstrong, then we should see the components of PCE that are more responsive to labor market conditions\ncontinue to firm, helping total PCE inflation return to our 2 percent goal on a sustainable basis over time.2\n\nMonetary Policy\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking and\ndetermine what interest rate path will best achieve the FOMC’s longer-run goals of price stability and\nmaximum employment, based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nAt our meeting at the end of January, the FOMC maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at\n1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. I agreed with this decision because it seemed appropriate to take the opportunity\nto assess the cumulative effects of last year’s policy easing on the economy and whether the economy is\nevolving according to our outlook. Even before last year’s cumulative 75 basis point reduction, monetary\npolicy had become easier as the Committee’s view of the appropriate policy path had flattened. You can\nsee this by looking at FOMC projections. In September 2018, the median participant thought it\nappropriate for the fed funds rate to rise to 3.4 percent by the end of this year. By June 2019, that rate had\nfallen over a percentage point, to 2.1 percent. The most recent reading from last December was 1.6\npercent. I viewed this flatter policy path as being consistent with taking an opportunistic approach to\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure was 2.6 percent in January and the Dallas Fed’s trimmedmean PCE inflation measure has been stable at 2 percent. In January, CPI inflation rose to 2.5 percent, core CPI\ninflation was 2.3 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed-mean CPI measures were 2.9 and 2.4\npercent, respectively.\n1\n\nSee Saeed Zaman (2019) “Cyclical versus Acyclical Inflation: A Deeper Dive,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland Economic Commentary 2019-13, https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economic-commentaries/ec-201913-cyclical-versus-acyclicalinflation.\n2\n\n\f6\nraising inflation to our symmetric goal – refraining from taking deliberate policy action to lift inflation\nmore quickly but also refraining from taking deliberate action against shocks that would, for a time, move\ninflation somewhat above 2 percent. This approach attempts to keep inflation sustainably in a reasonable\nrange around 2 percent, consistent with our symmetric 2 percent objective, while balancing our dual\nmandate goals and risks to financial stability.\n\nBefore the emergence of the coronavirus, my expectation was that output growth would be about trend\nthis year, with solid performance in the labor market, and inflation continuing to move up gradually over\nthe next year or two to the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent. The underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy\nremain strong, but the coronavirus will weigh on U.S. growth at least during the first half of the year, with\na pullback in spending by households and businesses. It is what economists call a negative supply shock.\nMuch is still unknown about the disease making it difficult to predict how large and persistent the\neconomic impact will be. Heightened and persistent uncertainty can affect the economy. It raises the\npossibility that negative effects on consumer and business sentiment and a pullback in investor risk-taking\ncould last after the spread of the coronavirus has stabilized. The supply shock could evolve into a\ndemand shock.\n\nThe extreme volatility in financial markets is noteworthy. When a shock like this hits financial markets,\nthe first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets\nto continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of extreme volatility, and to assure the public that\nthey are prepared to act as necessary. Fed Chair Jay Powell issued such a statement last Friday. The\nBank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank took similar steps; the International\nMonetary Fund and World Bank jointly stated that they stand ready to help affected countries with\nemergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance; and the G7 finance ministers and central\nbankers released a joint statement this morning reaffirming their commitment to use all appropriate policy\ntools to support growth and safeguard against downside risks. Times like this underscore the value of an\n\n\f7\neffective framework of financial system regulation and supervision to help ensure that the financial\nsystem is well-capitalized and resilient, enabling financial institutions to better withstand volatility so that\nthey can continue to extend credit to households and businesses.\n\nWhile the economic fundamentals underlying the U.S. economy remain strong, in light of the risks to the\noutlook and guided by our statutory goals to promote price stability and maximum employment, today the\nFOMC lowered its target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The\nvirus’s near-term effects on the supply side of the economy, including the reduction in activity from\nclosures, reduced social interactions, cuts in travel and tourism, and disruptions in supply chains, are not\nthings that can be affected by lowering interest rates. However, the action taken by the FOMC can help\nsupport confidence and ease financial conditions of indebted households and firms, thereby helping to\nmitigate potential demand-side impacts of the virus. It was within this context that I supported today’s\ninterest rate reduction, while recognizing that appropriate actions taken by other parties, including global\npublic health officials and fiscal authorities, would likely do more to support confidence and spending by\nhelping to contain the spread of the virus, ensure adequate healthcare services are available to the sick,\nspeed development of a vaccine, and provide relief to workers and smaller businesses that are affected by\nthe pullback in activity.\n\nReview of the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Framework\nLet me now step away from current monetary policy and discuss future monetary policy. While the U.S.\nCongress has specified the Fed’s longer-run monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment, it has given the Fed considerable independence in choosing the framework used to achieve\nthese goals.3 The FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework\n\nSection 2A of the Federal Reserve Act says that the Fed should conduct monetary policy to “promote effectively\nthe goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm) When prices are stable and the economy is at\nmaximum employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels, so it is often said that the U.S.\nCongress has given the Fed a dual mandate.\n3\n\n\f8\nrecognizes that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying\nreal structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum\nemployment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment\naround maximum employment. The framework is briefly described in the FOMC’s statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy, which was originally released in January 2012.4\n\nThe flexible inflation-targeting framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in\npromoting our monetary policy goals. But the economic environment of the future is likely to differ from\nthe past environment in some important dimensions. The expected slowdown in population growth and\nlower labor force participation rates due to changes in demographics will weigh on long-run economic\ngrowth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the longer-term equilibrium interest rate.5 This is true not\nonly in the U.S., but in other advanced economies as well.6 Real interest rates are expected to remain\nlower than in past decades. If so, this means there will be less room for monetary policymakers to\ncushion against a negative economic shock by lowering its policy rate and a higher likelihood that the\npolicy rate will hit its effective lower bound more frequently. In this case, tools including forward\nguidance and balance-sheet policies such as longer-term asset purchases will need to be used more often.\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012;\nas amended effective January 29, 2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\n4\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Demographics and Their Implications for the Economy and Policy,” Cato Journal, 38\n(Spring/Summer 2018), pp. 399-413. (https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2018/5/cjv38n2-6.pdf)\n5\n\n6\n\nFOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the fed funds rate that will be consistent with maximum\nemployment and price stability over the longer run. The median estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March\n2014 to 2.5 percent in December 2019, the most recently available estimate. (See the Summary of Economic\nProjections included in the Minutes of the FOMC, March 18-19, 2014, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20140319.pdf, and the Summary of Economic\nProjections included in the Minutes of the FOMC, December 10-11, 2019, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20191211.pdf.) Also, empirical estimates of the\nequilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are lower than in the past. For a review of\nthe literature on the equilibrium interest rate, see Hamilton, James D., Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D.\nWest, “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate: Past, Present and Future,” IMF Economic Review 64, 2016, pp. 660-707.\n(https://doi.org/10.1057/s41308-016-0015-z)\n\n\f9\nIn past recessions, the FOMC has reduced the federal funds rate target by 5 to 6 percentage points. With\ninterest rates expected to stay low, that policy space will not be available. Moreover, in some economic\nmodels, the proximity to the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates can impart a downward bias\nto inflation, making it harder for central banks to hit their inflation targets. And inflation now appears to\nbe less responsive to resource slack than it once was.\n\nIn light of these structural changes in the economic environment and our experience during the Great\nRecession and its aftermath, the FOMC has engaged in a review of our monetary policy framework to\nensure it will continue to be effective in maintaining macroeconomic stability in the future. The review\ncovers our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications, taking as given our statutory mandate\nand that an inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the long run with this mandate.\n\nSince the FOMC announced its review in November 2018, it has been spending time at its regularly\nscheduled meetings considering various aspects of its framework.7 The Committee is evaluating different\nstrategies such as whether to target inflation, average inflation, or the price level. These latter two\nstrategies attempt to make up for past misses on the inflation target; in contrast, targeting inflation lets\nbygones be bygones. We are also analyzing the types of policy tools and best formulations of these tools\nthat could be used to add accommodation in a future downturn, once our policy rate has been brought\ndown to its effective lower bound. The FOMC did not use negative interest rates during the Great\nRecession and its aftermath, but our review is open minded and we are taking a look at the experience of\nother central banks that have used negative interest rates to address low inflation and low growth. A third\naspect of our framework review is monetary policy communications. Policy communications are an\nimportant part of policymaking because they can increase the effectiveness of monetary policy in a\nnumber of ways. For example, communications can help to anchor inflation expectations at the target and\n\nInformation about the Fed’s monetary policy framework review is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-andcommunications.htm.\n7\n\n\f10\nthey can better convey the rationale for policymakers’ decisions, helping to transmit monetary policy\nthroughout the economy. Various aspects of the FOMC’s communications are being evaluated, including\nforward guidance used as a policy tool at the effective lower bound on interest rates.\n\nIn addition to internal discussions, the Fed engaged with academics at a research conference held last\nJune; selected papers from the conference were published in the International Journal of Central\nBanking.8 We also held a series of Fed Listens events across the U.S. to gain the perspectives of people\nwith diverse backgrounds and in different economic circumstances about how our dual mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices affect them. The Cleveland Fed held our Fed Listens event at\nour Community Development Policy Summit in Cincinnati.9 One of the main themes that came out of\nthis discussion was the importance of jobs. People were less concerned about inflation; in fact, some\nwere skeptical of the Fed’s view that inflation was too low, because in their experience it is costing more,\nnot less, to get by. This lack of concern about inflation partially reflects the success the Fed has had in\nachieving price stability. If inflation were to get out of hand again as it was in the 1970s and early1980s\nin the U.S., it would become a major concern again for everyone. From an individual’s perspective, low\ninflation is not a problem. But inflation running below our goal is a problem for the macroeconomy and\nfor monetary policymakers. When inflation runs persistently below our goal, expected inflation can move\nlower, which can put further downward pressure on inflation and pull down interest rates, which then puts\nfurther constraints on monetary policy’s ability to stabilize the economy.\n\n“Special Issue: Federal Reserve System Conference on Monetary Policy - Strategy, Tools, and Communication\nPractices,” International Journal of Central Banking, February 2020. (https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb2002.htm)\n8\n\nA summary of the Cleveland Fed’s Fed Listens event is available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/events/2019/policy-summit/fed-listens.aspx. A full list of Fed Listens events is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fedlistens-events.htm.\n9\n\n\f11\nOur framework review seeks to ensure that we are approaching monetary policy in the most effective way\nto achieve our mandated longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability. The minutes of\nthe FOMC meetings summarize the initial impressions of the Committee participants on the topics raised\nin the framework review. I’d like to conclude with some of my thoughts on the three broad areas of the\nreview.\n\nRegarding monetary policy strategy, in my view, while make-up strategies like price-level targeting tend\nto work well in some models, I am skeptical that they would be as effective in the real world because their\nbenefits depend on high levels of credibility and commitment. For example, I question whether the public\nwill think it credible that policymakers will keep interest rates low to make up for past shortfalls even\nwhen demand is growing strongly or that the public will believe that policymakers will tighten policy\nwhen demand is weak after a supply shock has raised the price level. Instead of adopting a make-up\nstrategy, I think some changes to communication could help to convey a better sense of the FOMC’s\napproach and commitment to its policy goals. For example, I think it would be useful for us to explain\nthat it is normal for inflation to vary in a range around our target due to a number of factors, including\nmeasurement issues, idiosyncratic shocks, and economic developments. It would also be useful to\nexplain that the lower general level of interest rates likely to prevail in the future and changes in inflation\ndynamics suggest that inflation would likely be lower during economic downturns. In terms of strategy,\nafter a period when inflation has been running below our goal for a sustained period, I would be\ncomfortable with inflation moving somewhat higher than 2 percent for a time during economic\nexpansions in order to help anchor inflation expectations and achieve our long-run symmetric 2 percent\ninflation goal.\n\nRegarding tools, I believe that asset purchases and forward guidance have been and will continue to be\nuseful tools at the effective lower bound. I am skeptical that the benefits of negative interest rates would\noutweigh the costs in the U.S. The experiences in Europe and Japan suggest that negative rates may have\n\n\f12\nsome beneficial effects on bank lending and so far have not had adverse effects on market functioning or\nfinancial stability. But the financial markets in the U.S. are considerably different and are less bankcentric than those in Europe or Japan.\n\nRegarding policy communications, I have spoken often about improvements the FOMC might make to\nthe way we explain the rationale for our policy decisions, thereby making monetary policy more\neffective.10 Indeed, for forward guidance at the effective lower bound to work, people need to understand\nthat we have entered a different mode and are using it as a policy tool. But that means they need to\nunderstand our policy setting in normal times: in particular, the goals we are trying to achieve; how we\nuse changes in the fed funds rate to influence inflation, economic activity, and the labor market; and the\nkey elements in our reaction function. A post-meeting policy statement that gives a fuller view of the\nCommittee’s outlook and attendant risks to the outlook, and that ties the Committee’s policy decisions to\nthat outlook and assessment of risks would be a worthwhile enhancement.11\n\nThese are some of my own thoughts, but our review is ongoing and Federal Reserve Chair Powell has\nindicated that the FOMC will publicly report the outcome of the review once it is completed.\n\nOne can view the FOMC’s review of its monetary policy framework as a form of good governance that is\nbecoming a standard best practice of central banks around the world.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNational Association for Business Economics\n36th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference\nWashington, DC\nFebruary 24, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. I thank the National Association for Business Economics for inviting me to participate\nin this year’s economic policy conference. I had the pleasure of speaking at this conference five years\nago and I recall a very engaging question-and-answer session following my remarks. I hope we will have\na similar session today because I believe that one of the responsibilities (and pleasures) of being a\nmonetary policymaker is listening to other people’s perspectives and learning from them. Today, I will\ngive you an update of my own take on the economy and monetary policy for the coming year. As always,\nthe views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Growth\nThe U.S. economic expansion is now in its 11th year, making this the longest expansion on record. It has\nnot been a smooth ride; risks of various kinds have risen and ebbed over the journey. Last year,\nuncertainties around trade policy and tariffs and slow growth abroad clouded the outlook. In prior years,\nthe sharp drop in oil prices and strength of the dollar weighed on the U.S. economy. Yet, with support\nfrom fiscal and monetary policy, the expansion continued. The length of the expansion is a true testament\nto the resiliency of the U.S. economy. For 2020, my outlook is for the expansion to continue, with\ngrowth around trend, solid performance in the labor market, and low and stable inflation. As is always\nthe case, there are risks to the outlook, including the recent emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan,\nChina. There are also longer-run challenges for the U.S. economy, including low productivity growth,\nlimits on access to education and training for the jobs of the future, and rising income inequality. But\nviewed through the lens of the Fed’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability, the\neconomy has been performing well and I expect that to continue.\n\nLast year, real GDP grew at a 2.3 percent pace, down a bit from 2018’s 2.5 percent pace. My estimate of\nlonger-run growth is 2 percent, so the economy has been growing somewhat above trend. Indeed, last\n\n\f2\nyear’s performance was better than many economists and businesses had expected. Before the start of\nlast year, it was widely anticipated that output growth would be slower than in 2018 because the effects of\nthe fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts and federal government spending were expected to wane and\nfinancial conditions were expected to be less accommodative. But as 2019 started, concerns developed\nthat a sharper slowdown in the economy was a real possibility. In light of the FOMC’s reassessment of\nthe outlook and risks, the FOMC’s anticipated path of appropriate monetary policy flattened, leading to\nmore accommodative financial conditions that helped to support the expansion. As the year wore on,\nseveral downside risks to the outlook worsened and new ones emerged. These risks include those\nassociated with trade policy and slower global growth, as well as geopolitical risks surrounding the\npossibility of a “hard” Brexit, social unrest in Hong Kong, and rising tensions in the Middle East. The\nFOMC responded to these risks to the outlook by lowering the federal funds rate a cumulative 75 basis\npoints. More accommodative financial conditions and some easing of trade tensions and uncertainty by\nthe end of the year helped to support last year’s above-trend growth.\n\nWith respect to the mix of growth across sectors, it is a tale of two cities. For most of the expansion,\nconsumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of output, has been driving the economy\nforward; the strength in business spending has varied and it has been weak of late. Although consumer\nspending softened a bit in the fourth quarter, this isn’t troubling as it followed strong readings in the\nsecond and third quarters. Solid fundamentals will continue to support consumer spending this year. The\nstrong performance of the labor market has brought more people into the labor force and has sustained\nwage growth, so household incomes are rising. Measures of consumer confidence are at high levels. And\nhousehold balance sheets, at the aggregate level, are healthy. Equity prices have been rising and the\ninterest rates paid by consumers are at low levels.\n\nThese same factors have led to a pickup in housing market activity over the past year. Residential\ninvestment turned around in the second half of 2019, rising for the first time since the end of 2017. On a\n\n\f3\nyear-over-year basis, housing starts, new single-family home sales, and existing home sales all posted\ndouble-digit rates of increase at the end of last year. Demand is outstripping supply. One indicator of this\nis the month’s supply of homes on the market. At the December sales pace, the current inventory of\nhomes up for sale would last three months. This is the lowest level in the history of the series, which\ndates back to 1982. As a consequence, house prices are beginning to accelerate.\n\nIn contrast to the strength in consumer spending and the improvement in housing conditions, business\ninvestment, manufacturing, and exports have been weak, declining over most of last year. Slow growth\nabroad, especially in Europe and China, and uncertainty over trade policy and tariffs have weakened\ndemand for U.S. exports, which has weighed on the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The\nuncertainty also dampened business sentiment and caused some firms to postpone planned investment. If\nit continues, the low level of investment will be troubling for the economy over the longer run. The\neconomy’s long-run growth potential is determined by the growth of its labor and capital stock and how\nproductively it uses these inputs. Without investment in new technologies and capital, productivity will\ncontinue to be weak, dampening the economy’s growth potential and living standards.\n\nFortunately, the picture for 2020 is somewhat better on the trade front. Some of the uncertainty over trade\npolicy eased with the signing of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Phase\nOne trade deal with China; this reduction in uncertainty should prove positive for investment.\nNevertheless, some long-lasting effects arising from the trade war are likely. For example, some of our\nbusiness contacts report that foreign firms have reoriented their supply chains away from U.S. firms,\nwhich means these exports may be permanently lost.\n\nThe start of the year brought some tentative signs that growth abroad in our trading partners was\nstabilizing. But offsetting the positive news on foreign growth and trade are the continuing problems with\n\n\f4\nthe Boeing 737 MAX airplane. The decision to halt production of the plane will be a drag on growth at\nleast in the first quarter of this year and perhaps longer.\n\nIn addition, the coronavirus is exacting a heavy human toll. It is also clouding the near-term economic\noutlook for China, with potential spillovers to the rest of the world. Most estimates of the possible impact\ndraw on the experience of the SARS epidemic in 2003. A Brookings study suggested that that epidemic\nreduced growth in China by about 1 percentage point in 2003 and growth in the U.S. by only about 0.1\npercentage point.1 However, there are many differences between 2003 and 2020. China was not as big a\nplayer in the global economy back then as it is today, so there is the potential for a larger impact, through\ndecreases in tourism and travel, reductions in consumer spending in China and by Chinese tourists\nelsewhere, disruptions in supply chains, and a pullback in investors’ willingness to take on risk. On the\nother hand, China now has more resources with which to address the epidemic than it had in 2003 and\nearly actions have been taken to try to limit the spread and cushion the Chinese economy. This might\nmean a larger negative impact on growth in China in the near term but perhaps a less protracted one. At\nthis point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects, but this new source of uncertainty\nis something I will be carefully monitoring. I’ve incorporated it as a downside risk to my modal forecast,\nwhich calls for growth to continue at trend, slightly slower than the pace of last year, with continued\nhealthy consumption growth and some pickup in investment spending.\n\nLabor Markets\nSupporting this forecast is the strength we’ve seen in labor markets. I expect solid labor market\nconditions to continue. Last year, firms added an average of 175,000 jobs per month to their payrolls, and\nin January, an even stronger 225,000 jobs were added. So the pace of job growth has been well above\n\nJong-Wha Lee and Warwick J. McKibbin, “Globalization and Disease: The Case of SARS,” Brookings Discussion\nPapers in International Economics, No. 156, February 2004.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20040203-1.pdf)\n1\n\n\f5\ntrend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The unemployment rate, at\n3.6 percent, is near its 50-year low; it has fallen nearly half of a percentage point over the past year. A\nbroader measure of the unemployment rate, the U-6 measure, which includes workers who haven’t been\nactively looking for work and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work, is under\n7 percent, near its lowest level since the start of this series in January 1994. In the Cleveland Fed’s\nDistrict, which includes the state of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the panhandle of\nWest Virginia, the unemployment rate is about 4-1/4 percent, near the lowest levels seen in two decades.\nMy expectation is that job growth will remain solid and the unemployment rate will remain near its\ncurrent level this year.\n\nA benefit of the long expansion is that more people have been drawn into the labor force. Even though\ndemographic forces such as the aging of the large baby boom generation mean people are leaving the\nworkforce through retirement, the participation rate has held up. The prime-age participation rate of those\nbetween ages 25 and 54 has been rising and is now at its highest level of the expansion. Women have\nbeen leading this rise. The participation rate for prime-age women has risen over 2 percentage points\nover the past two years, and the rate for men has edged up as well.2 Business contacts have continually\nreported that they are having trouble finding qualified workers. Some tell us that they have turned away\norders and would be able to take on more work if they could attract and retain the employees they need.\n\nAggregate wages have been rising in line with productivity growth and inflation, and we’ve seen stronger\nwage gains for lower paying jobs. But wages have not accelerated as much as one might have expected\nbased on the reports from firms about how hard it is to find workers. It could be a question of labor mix,\nwith those older workers exiting the labor force typically being higher paid than those entering. It could\n\n2\n\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as compiled by Haver Analytics, the (combined) prime-age\nparticipation rate rose to 83.1 percent in January 2020, its highest level since August 2008. From January 2018 to\nJanuary 2020, the participation rate for prime-age women rose from 74.8 percent to 77.0 percent; over the same\nperiod, the rate for prime-age men edged up from 89.0 percent to 89.3 percent.\n\n\f6\nalso reflect a faster pace of automation. Some of our business contacts have told us they are substituting\nmachines for workers rather than increasing wages. Others tell us they don’t believe that raising wages\nwill attract qualified workers and are not willing to go that route to fill positions. It remains to be seen\nhow much longer that situation can last, especially if labor markets tighten further.\n\nAssessing how the labor market is doing relative to what is sustainable over the longer run is a key factor\nwhen setting monetary policy, as maximum employment and price stability are our mandated goals. The\nbehavior of the labor market over this expansion has led me to believe that one needs to be humble about\nthis assessment and let not only past experience but also current experience be a guide. In fact, the strong\nperformance of the labor market over this expansion has made many economists reevaluate what\nunemployment rate is sustainable over the longer run and consistent with price stability. This is true of\nparticipants on the FOMC as well. Five years ago, their estimates of the unemployment rate over the\nlonger run ranged from 5.0 to 5.8 percent; the current range is 3.5 to 4.5 percent.3 I’ve brought my\nestimate down over time and recently have been estimating a range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent. But if the\nunemployment rate continues at these low rates and wage pressures remain muted, I’m open to lowering\nmy estimate again.\n\nInflation\nTurning to inflation, the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal is 2 percent, as measured by the year-overyear change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This measure moved up to\n2 percent in 2018, but the increase wasn’t sustained as PCE inflation moved back down in 2019 and stood\nat 1.6 percent in December. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices to strip out some\nvolatility, also moved down to 1.6 percent. Although core inflation is often used as an indicator of the\n\n3\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections included in the Minutes of the FOMC, December 16-17, 2014, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20141217.pdf and the Summary of Economic\nProjections included in the Minutes of the FOMC, December 10-11, 2019, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20191211.pdf.\n\n\f7\nunderlying trend in inflation, it is important to remember that a sizable fraction of the variability of core\ninflation is due to idiosyncratic factors, for example, changes in Medicare reimbursement rates or cell\nphone prices. So to gauge the underlying trend I look at a broad set of inflation measures. These\nmeasures show firmer inflation readings. The CPI measures typically run about 1/4 percentage point\nabove the PCE measures. In January, CPI inflation rose to 2.5 percent and core CPI inflation was 2.3\npercent. The Dallas Fed’s trimmed-mean PCE inflation measure has been stable at 2 percent. The\nCleveland Fed’s new Center for Inflation Research is carrying on the pioneering work done at the Bank to\ndevelop better measures of underlying inflation trends.4 In January, the Cleveland Fed’s median and\ntrimmed-mean CPI measures were 2.9 and 2.4 percent, respectively, and our median PCE inflation\nmeasure was 2.6 percent in December. These alternative gauges are not a substitute for the PCE inflation\nmeasure that the FOMC has targeted, but they do reduce some of my concern that inflation will continue\nto be weak. Indeed, research done by our Center suggests that if labor markets remain strong, then we\nshould see the components of the PCE that are more responsive to labor market conditions continue to\nfirm, helping total PCE inflation return to our 2 percent goal on a sustainable basis over time.5\n\nThis forecast depends on inflation expectations remaining stable. If firms and households begin to expect\nthat lower inflation will prevail over the longer run, the Fed would have a harder time hitting its inflation\ntarget, because theory suggests that these expectations influence actual price- and wage-setting decisions.\nLower inflation expectations could lead to lower inflation. In my view, expectations have been relatively\nwell anchored near 2 percent. The movements in the monthly readings of some of the measures have\nbeen within the typical variation seen in these measures. The Cleveland Fed produces a measure of\ninflation expectations that combines survey readings with market-based readings; the 5-year/5-yearThe Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research aims to further the understanding of inflation among\npolicymakers, researchers, and the public by providing data, forecasts, analysis, and research. The Center’s website\nis https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n4\n\nSee Saeed Zaman (2019) “Cyclical versus Acyclical Inflation: A Deeper Dive,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland Economic Commentary 2019-13, https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economic-commentaries/ec-201913-cyclical-versus-acyclicalinflation.\n5\n\n\f8\nforward reading on inflation from this measure has been fairly stable over the past 12 months, although\nsomewhat under 2 percent.\n\nMy projection is that PCE inflation will move up to our 2 percent goal in line with the FOMC’s objective,\nbut this will be a gradual return over the next year or two.\n\nMonetary Policy\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking and\ndetermine what interest rate path will best achieve the FOMC’s dual mandate goals of price stability and\nmaximum employment over the longer run, based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nAt our meeting at the end of January, the FOMC maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at\n1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. I agreed with this decision. Keeping the fed funds rate at current levels for a time\ngives us an opportunity to assess the cumulative effects of last year’s policy easing on the economy and to\nassess whether the economy is evolving according to our outlook. Even before last year’s cumulative 75\nbasis point reduction, monetary policy had become easier as the Committee’s view of the appropriate\npolicy path had flattened. You can see this by looking at FOMC projections. In September 2018, the\nmedian participant thought it appropriate for the fed funds rate to rise to 3.4 percent by the end of this\nyear. By June 2019, that rate had fallen over a percentage point, to 2.1 percent. The most recent reading\nfrom last December is 1.6 percent. Given the risks from slower growth abroad and trade policy\nuncertainty, I believed a flatter policy path was appropriate, although I would have preferred to wait for\nclearer evidence that the downside risks were materially affecting the economy before actually cutting the\nfunds rate last year. Still, I am comfortable with the current stance of policy. While some of the\ndownside risks have eased, including trade tensions, the possibility of a “hard” Brexit, and continued\nweakening of global growth, other risks like the coronavirus have emerged. In my view, our current\npolicy stance is appropriate given the outlook of growth near its trend pace, solid labor market conditions,\n\n\f9\nand inflation rates not far from the FOMC’s symmetric 2 percent objective, and given the risks around the\noutlook that we continue to monitor.\n\nI am committed to achieving both of our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.\nAs many of you know, the FOMC is in the process of assessing our monetary policy framework,\nincluding our strategy, tools, and policy communications. As part of that review, we conducted Fed\nListens events around the country to hear from various groups about how our dual mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices affect them. The Cleveland Fed held our Fed Listens event at\nour Community Development Policy Summit in Cincinnati.6 One of the main themes that came out of\nthis discussion was the importance of jobs. People were less concerned about inflation; in fact, some\nwere skeptical of the Fed’s view that inflation was too low, because in their experience it is costing more,\nnot less, to get by. This lack of concern about inflation partially reflects the success the Fed has had in\nachieving price stability. It’s a tribute to the late Paul Volcker, former Fed chair. If inflation were to get\nout of hand again as it was in the 1970s and early 1980s, it would become a major concern again for\neveryone. From an individual’s perspective, low inflation is not a problem. But inflation running below\nour goal is a problem for the macroeconomy and for monetary policymakers. When inflation runs\npersistently below our goal, expected inflation can move lower, putting further downward pressure on\ninflation and pulling down interest rates. Lower rates constrain monetary policy’s ability to stabilize the\neconomy by giving us less room to reduce rates in the event of a future downturn. So hitting our\nsymmetric inflation goal is an important part of ensuring a healthy economy over the longer run.\n\nA summary of the Cleveland Fed’s Fed Listens event is available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/events/2019/policy-summit/fed-listens.aspx. A full list of Fed Listens events is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fedlistens-events.htm.\n6\n\n\f10\nWe have been undershooting our inflation goal for some time, so a natural question is whether\npolicymakers should add even further accommodation to spur a faster return of inflation to our goal. I\nwould not favor that at this time. In my view, doing so would raise the risk of generating imbalances that\nwould threaten the expansion and undermine our employment goal. Even given the low level of interest\nrates, equity prices and commercial real estate valuations are elevated; corporate debt levels are high; and\nunderwriting standards on leveraged loans are weak. While commercial banks are well capitalized, their\ncapital buffers are falling, which could potentially limit their ability to lend through the cycle should a\nnegative shock hit. I think we should be particularly attuned to financial market developments in the\ncurrent environment.\n\nGiven the low level of the funds rate and the outlook for growth and the labor market, and the fact that\ninflation rates are already near our objective, I support taking an opportunistic approach to raising\ninflation to our symmetric goal. This entails leaving policy at current levels for a time to support a\nfirming in inflation rates, refraining from taking deliberate policy action at this point to try to lift inflation\nmore quickly, and also refraining from taking deliberate action against shocks that would, for a time,\nmove inflation somewhat above 2 percent. This approach attempts to keep inflation sustainably in a\nreasonable range around 2 percent, consistent with our symmetric 2 percent objective, while balancing\nour dual mandate goals and risks to financial stability. I don’t view this opportunistic approach as\nignoring the inflation undershoot because it works to move inflation up by keeping policy more\naccommodative than if the Committee were behaving as it has in the past, as illustrated by the range of\nmonetary policy rules that the Cleveland Fed publishes on its website.7\n\nIn assessing the appropriate path of policy going forward, I will be monitoring incoming economic and\nfinancial data and reports from District contacts to assess the outlook and risks to the outlook. My\n\nSee the Cleveland Fed’s simple monetary policy rules at https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicatorsand-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx.\n7\n\n\f11\ncurrent view is that monetary policy is well calibrated to support our dual mandate goals, and a patient\napproach to policy changes is appropriate unless there is a material change to the outlook.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks at the\n2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nSponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets\nat the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\n*\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nWelcome to this session entitled “Hall of Mirrors: Feedback Between Monetary Policy and Financial\nMarkets.” I thank Anil Kashyap and Ric Mishkin for inviting me to moderate today’s panel discussion. I\nhave been attending the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum for many years, and I marvel at the organizers’\nprescience in anticipating the issues confronting monetary policymakers. This panel’s topic is no\nexception. It ties together various aspects of modern monetary policymaking, including the information\ncontent in asset prices, the role of expectations in monetary policy transmission, policy communications,\nand the wisdom of crowds.\n\nAs most of you know, the title of the session harkens back to a 2004 speech made by former Fed Chair\nBen Bernanke. Speaking about how monetary policymakers can gain insights from asset price\nmovements, he pointed out that if policymakers are too concerned about meeting market expectations for\nfear of creating excess volatility, then this undermines the information content of asset prices. As he put\nit: “Such a strategy quickly degenerates into a hall of mirrors” in which the policymaker is at once\nsending signals to the market about future policy and trying to gain insights from the market.\n\nHowever, if the market’s expectations get too far out of alignment with those of the policymaker, the\npolicymaker finds herself in a difficult situation. If financial markets expect easier policy than what the\npolicymaker feels is appropriate and she chooses to accommodate the markets’ belief, this suboptimal\npolicy could lead to macroeconomic instability in the future. If, instead, the policymaker chooses to\ndisappoint the markets, she risks increased volatility and an unwanted tightening of financial conditions.\nEven a policymaker who declares that surprising the markets won’t deter her from following appropriate\npolicy might find that this declaration is not time consistent when faced with such a choice.\n\nAt the same time, as Amato, Morris, and Shin (2002) point out, the policymaker’s view of the world may\nnot be correct. If policymakers are successful in getting agents to accept their view, then the\n\n\f2\ninformational content one might glean from agents’ decisions just reflects back the policymakers’ view\nand not the agents’ own private information. The potential is that asset prices could deviate far from\nfundamentals if the policymakers’ view is wrong.\n\nThe question is: how can policymakers best avoid the “expectations trap” (Chari, Christiano,\nEichenbaum, 1998), and utilize the information content in asset prices?\n\nBernanke emphasizes the role of communications. In his view, policymakers should pay attention to the\nmarket’s expectations for policy because they are a check on how well the central bank is communicating.\nWhen expectations are not well aligned, either policymakers aren’t communicating the rationale for their\nown policy views very well, or they are communicating, but market participants aren’t buying it. Thus,\nmarket expectations speak directly to two factors that are paramount in effective monetary policymaking:\ntransparency and credibility.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been on a journey of increased transparency for some time now in order to better\ncommunicate the Committee participants’ current views on the economic outlook and appropriate policy.2\nNonetheless, the Committee’s views and those of the market are not always in alignment.\n\nIn these cases, policymakers shouldn’t just capitulate to the market.3 But they should be open to\nreassessing their view of the economy based on all incoming information, including the views of\nparticipants in the financial markets. We have to be open to the possibility that the markets’ view may be\n2\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was launched in October 2007. It summarizes information about the\nindividual FOMC participants’ views on the economic outlook based on their own individual assessments of the\nappropriate path of policy. In January 2012, the SEP began including information on the individual appropriate\npolicy paths, summarized in the well-known dot plot. In September 2015, the FOMC began publishing the median\nSEP responses for each variable in the projections. And in March 2017, the SEP began including confidence bands\naround the median path for each variable.\n3\n\nJeremy Stein and Adi Sunderam (2018) present a model in which society is worse off if the central bank cares too\nmuch about bond market volatility and moves policy rates too gradually.\n\n\f3\nmore in alignment with fundamentals than the policymakers’ view. Significant misalignment between the\ncentral bank’s views and market expectations should also prompt the chair to augment communications in\nintermeeting periods and to consider improvements in how the central bank explains the rationale for its\noutlook for the economy, the risks around the outlook, and its view of appropriate monetary policy based\non the outlook and risks.\n\nI don’t want to underplay the challenges of formulating effective policy communications. Consider the\nFOMC’s post-meeting statement. It is pretty sparse. The chair’s press conference does give more\ncontext, but I’d like to see more of that information in the Committee’s statement, to provide more of a\nsense of our outlook and why we think our anticipated policy path is appropriate. Our assessment of risks\nis an important part of the policy discussion. We should provide more information on risks in the\nstatement and consider releasing the balance of risk graphs that are part of the SEP with the other charts\nreleased at the time of the press conference. Currently, these charts are released with the minutes three\nweeks later. What I’m advocating would result in a longer statement – which may not be fashionable in\nthe age of Twitter. But I think it would help us escape the statement’s “Hotel California” problem: words\ncheck in but they don’t check out. The market hangs on each word in the statement, so there is a\nlegitimate reluctance to change any word from one meeting to the next because of the signal it might send\nto the market. If we used more words to explain things, each word would carry less weight. The\nlanguage would be less boilerplate. This would free us to explain our rationale and change the\nstatement’s language productively from meeting to meeting without fear of sending the wrong message.\n\nOne last comment before I introduce our speakers. I’ve been talking about the market’s expectations as if\nthere is one monolithic market. But, of course, that isn’t correct. The market is made up of many\nindividual participants. In liquid markets, asset prices aggregate these individual investors’ beliefs about\nthe current and future state of the economy, but the diversity of views can still matter. The so-called taper\ntantrum in mid-2013 comes to mind. Before the FOMC communicated that tapering its asset purchases\n\n\f4\nmight soon be appropriate, it looked as if market expectations were in alignment. Nonetheless, financial\nmarkets reacted sharply when the communication actually came. Both Jeremy Stein (2014) and Stan\nFischer (2017) have discussed the episode, pointing out that the distribution of views across market\nparticipants and how strongly they hold these views are important determinants of how asset prices might\nreact to an announcement, even one that is aligned with the median view in the market. The point being\nthat even the best policy communications won’t be able to prevent market swings all the time and\npolicymakers and markets need to understand that.\n\nAs you can see, there are many things to talk about in this session.

As you probably know, the Federal\nReserve is very interested in promoting financial literacy. One reason is that our economy performs\nbetter if people are equipped with the knowledge to make sound savings and investment decisions.\nAnother reason is that our monetary policy is actually more effective if people understand how it works. I\nam proud to be on the board of the Council for Economic Education (CEE), which is a champion of both\neconomic and financial literacy for students from kindergarten through high school. The CEE recently\nreleased the 2020 Survey of the States, a biennial look into the state of K-12 economic and financial\neducation in the U.S. 1 The results show that progress is being made. Twenty-one states now require high\nschool students to take a course in personal finance, four more than in 2018, and 25 states now require an\neconomics course, three more than in 2018. The CEE is working to encourage more states to adopt such\nrequirements because research indicates that they lead students to make more informed real-world\neconomic decisions, such as those pertaining to college financing. I am also proud that the Cleveland Fed\nis an active partner with schools across the Fourth Federal Reserve District to improve the financial skills\nof students and members of our community. You are welcome to visit our learning centers in Cleveland\nor Cincinnati, but some of our materials are also available online for those of you who’d prefer to stay in\nthe warmth of the Florida sun. 2\n\nI want to spend my time with you today focusing on one particular aspect of our country’s financial\nsystem, one that is less understood and is undergoing rapid change: the payments system. The Federal\nReserve System plays an important role in helping to ensure that our payments system is efficient, secure,\n\nThe Council for Economic Education offers many materials to advance financial literacy and economic education\non its website at www. https://www.councilforeconed.org/. The Survey of the States is available at\nhttps://www.councilforeconed.org/survey-of-the-states-2020/. EconEdLink, at https://www.econedlink.org/, is\nCEE’s web portal of resources supporting K-12 teachers of economics and finance.\n1\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s Learning Center and Money Museum provides materials to foster financial and economic\nliteracy on its website at https://www.clevelandfed.org/learningcenter/explore.aspx.\n2\n\n\f2\nand effective. I recently became chair of the Financial Services Policy Committee (FSPC), which\noversees the provision of payment services to depository institutions and the U.S. Treasury by the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks. So as a follow-up to the discussion we just heard about new forms of payments, I\nthought it would be useful to provide you with an update on some of the Fed’s ongoing work to\nmodernize the U.S. payments system, and then offer a policymaker’s perspectives on some payments\ninnovations. Of course, the views I will present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFedNowSM Service 3 Will Be a New Service for Making Real-Time Payments in the U.S.\nIt shouldn’t surprise anyone when I say that a well-functioning and secure payments system is an essential\ningredient for a sound economy. Like highways, bridges, and railroads, the payments system is a critical\npart of the infrastructure of our country; everyone has a stake in a healthy U.S. payments system.\nAccording to the 2019 Federal Reserve Payments Study, noncash payments have been growing by almost\n7 percent per year since 2015; these include debit and credit card transactions, checks, and direct deposit\nand automatic payment transactions that go through the automated clearing house system. In 2018 there\nwere 174 billion noncash transactions made in the U.S. – more than 500 payments for every American.4\nThese transactions totaled over $97 trillion. As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve works to\npromote the macroeconomic and financial stability of our $21 trillion economy and the Fed’s oversight of\nand participation in the payments system is a vital part of this work.\n\nLast year, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced that the Fed would develop a\nnew service called FedNow. This new interbank payments service will allow people all over the country\nto make payments securely and in real time, at all times of the day and night, including on weekends and\n\n3\n\n“FedNow” is a service mark of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\n4\n\nSee Federal Reserve System (2019).\n\n\f3\nholidays. 5 Although payments made through mobile apps and the internet appear to be instantaneous, the\nunderlying infrastructure does not move funds immediately from the payer’s bank to the payee’s bank.\nCurrently, this takes several days. With FedNow, you’ll be able to send and receive payments securely at\nany time and anywhere, and get access to funds within seconds. This speed will provide economic\nbenefits, making it easier for individuals and businesses to manage money and make time-sensitive\npayments. This service, along with similar private-sector alternatives like The Clearing House’s RealTime Payments (RTP®) service, may be especially beneficial for those households and businesses that\ndon’t have as much funds in reserve, allowing them to avoid late fees when making last minute payments.\nSimilarly, workers who aren’t getting regular payroll checks will be able to get faster access to their\nwages.\n\nThe history of the U.S. payments system shows the need for the FedNow service. Over the decades, the\nevolution of the payments landscape has led to a patchwork of payment vehicles and providers, often\nlacking interoperability with one another or the ability to combine billing invoice information with a\npayment. Our payments system is concentrated in the banking system but is quite complex. Currently,\nthere are several platforms for making payments. The automated clearing house (ACH), which was\nconceived of in the late 1960s, handles smaller value, regularly scheduled payments, like your paycheck\nor your utility bills, via batch processing of a group of transactions during a predetermined time period.\nAlthough ACH was conceived as a way to eliminate the use of paper checks, checks are still used for\nmaking some payments. There are credit and debit card systems as well. This complexity makes it\nharder to foster payments innovations. Indeed, not all parts of the U.S. payments system have kept up\nwith the evolving expectations and demands of consumers and businesses. This has allowed nonbank\nproviders, including fintech companies, to enter the payments business, offering consumers and\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019). More information on FedNow is available at the\nFedNow web site: https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/index.html.\n5\n\n\f4\nbusinesses more modern payments methods that clear and settle on the bank-centric traditional payments\ninfrastructure. The consumers and businesses enjoy a more user-friendly experience, and while it appears\nthat the payments are moving in real time, the actual clearing and settlement of payment instructions on\nboth sides of these transactions take place through the traditional system: transactions are settled in\nperiodic batches, processed one or more days later, and available only during regular banking hours. Of\ncourse, this creates some risk because banks might choose to make final funds available to the customer\nbefore receiving the covering funds from the payer’s bank.\n\nThis highlights the need for an updated U.S. payments system that is faster from end-to-end and meets the\nneeds of consumers, businesses, and financial institutions in a safe and efficient way. To address this\nneed, the Fed engaged in several years of study and consultation with a diverse group of payment system\nstakeholders, including financial institutions of all sizes, private-sector payment networks, businesses,\nconsumers, fintech companies, and software vendors. Those stakeholders made clear that they wanted\naccess to enhanced interbank settlement mechanisms 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\nThis was reinforced when the vast majority of respondents to a 2018 Federal Reserve request for\ncomment advocated for the Fed to build a faster payment system. 6 In response to this demand, the\nFederal Reserve has embarked on building a resilient real-time payments system that will enable our\nnation’s more than 10,000 banks and credit unions of all sizes to use their existing electronic connections\nto the Fed and their existing Fed settlement accounts to process real-time retail payments for consumers\nand businesses. This payments system modernization will bring the U.S. in line with other countries that\nhave developed faster payment networks, including Australia, the U.K., Singapore, India, Mexico, and\nsome European countries.\n\nBefore making the decision to move forward with the FedNow service, the Fed determined that the\n\n6\n\nSee the Federal Register Notice in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019).\n\n\f5\nservice met its established criteria for offering a new payments service. These criteria are, first, that it is a\nservice that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and\nequity; second, that there is a clear public benefit; and, third, that the Fed be will able to fully recover its\ncosts of providing the service over the long run.\n\nIt is important to know that the Fed will offer FedNow alongside payments services operated by privatesector companies, just as it does today with check, ACH, and wire transfer services. This will encourage\ncompetition among operators and provide an added layer of resiliency in the event of downtime at any\none of the real-time payment systems. The Fed is working closely with financial institutions and\ntechnology firms to prepare for an anticipated launch of the FedNow service in 2023 or 2024. An official\nlaunch date has not been announced, as ongoing work to finalize business requirements and design\nfeatures to meet the needs of potential users of the service will help determine the timeline for\nimplementation. The project is complex, and we want to get it right.\n\nAchieving a Broad Reach for Faster Payments to Serve the Public\nThe FedNow service is being developed with the aim of having a broad nationwide reach and the ability\nto work across different systems. Payments industry stakeholders have emphasized the importance of\nestablishing a real-time payment capability for the nation whereby any payer can reach any payee,\nregardless of which real-time retail payments system is used by their banks. Such interoperability has not\nalways been a given in the U.S. and no doubt will be a challenge. For example, in the early 1970s, there\nwere several regional automated clearing house associations, each providing clearing and settlement\namong and between only their own bank members. In most cases, the ACH associations had an\nagreement with the regional Federal Reserve Banks to help operate the ACH networks. In 1974, the\nregional ACH associations formed Nacha to facilitate the nationwide clearing of ACH transactions. And\nby 1978, an interoperator agreement between the Federal Reserve and Nacha was executed to link local\nACHs on a nationwide basis. The message exchange protocols that allowed that to happen are still in\n\n\f6\nplace today. Interoperability is also a feature of debit cards and of wire transfers. For each of these\nservices, interoperability also evolved over decades and followed different paths to arrive at different\nmodels.\n\nToday, the Fed, private sector-operators, and other stakeholders are exploring options to ensure a broad\nreach for faster payments. Interoperability as currently achieved in the ACH system is one possible\napproach. Another approach is dual participation, where some banks choose to join more than one\noperator network. This is the prevailing model for high-value, urgent payments processed through the\nwire transfer networks. Hybrid models are also possible, where service providers are designated as agents\nin each network and route payments to the receiving bank’s network of choice. A broad reach is achieved\nby relying on relatively few service providers, each of which establishes connections to all of the payment\noperators for that payment type, thereby acting as hubs. This type of interoperability characterizes\ntoday’s debit card networks.\n\nThe Fed will be exploring the various possibilities, working with private-sector stakeholders, to arrive at\nthe best solution for ensuring that we deliver a faster payment service that is broadly accessible to\nconsumers and businesses alike so that it best serves the public.\n\nBeyond the development of FedNow, the Fed is actively monitoring and studying new technologies and\napproaches to payments. These approaches don’t always rely on sovereign currency or a country’s\ncentral bank to settle payments, or on traditional bank accounts to transact payments. I will use the\nremainder of my time to discuss one of these payments innovations: digital currencies.\n\nDigital Currencies\nCryptocurrencies\nBy now, everyone has heard of Bitcoin, an example of a digital currency, which was introduced in 2008,\n\n\f7\nholding the promise that it could serve as a means of faster payments, as a unit of account, and as a store\nof value. 7 Since Bitcoin’s introduction, thousands of other digital currencies have been created. Such\ncurrencies present an innovative approach to processing payments in which a bank or central authority is\nreplaced with a distributed group of anonymous people who verify the accuracy and trustworthiness of\nthe transaction over the internet. Distributed ledger technology, open source software, and a\ndownloadable database of account balances allow decentralized members of the network to vote with\ntheir computing power to determine whether a transaction is valid or not. 8 Since transactions are\ncryptographically secured, many have adopted the term “cryptocurrencies” to describe Bitcoin and other\nsimilar products.\n\nAlthough its market capitalization has grown to over 100 billion euros, Bitcoin has not seen wide\nadoption as a means of payment. 9 Its value is volatile, driven by speculation in the currency, making it\nless useful as a unit of account. Its settlement time has been too slow to make it practical for mainstream\npayments. In addition, the real costs of operating the system, driven by energy consumption to power a\nvast web of computers, are much higher than those associated with traditional sovereign currency. The\ndistributed nature of the governance system around Bitcoin and similar digital currencies also makes it\nmore difficult to resolve any disputes that may arise or to decide on technical changes that likely would be\nneeded as the platform grows. 10\n\nStablecoins\nIn part to address some of these challenges, there has been a proliferation of so-called “stablecoins.” 11\n\n7\n\nSee Nakamoto (2008).\n\n8\n\nSee Craig and Kachovec (2019).\n\n9\n\nBrainard (December 18, 2019).\n\n10\n\nSee Craig and Kachovec (2019).\n\n11\nFor informative overviews of stablecoins, including their benefits and challenges, see Bank for International\nSettlements (October 2019 and December 2019), Financial Stability Board (October 10, 2018; June 6, 2019; and\nOctober 18, 2019), Brainard (October 16, 2019 and December 18, 2019), and Evans (2019).\n\n\f8\nStablecoins are digital currencies designed to minimize price volatility by pegging their value to the value\nof a stable asset or basket of assets, such as commodities, commercial bank deposits, government\nsecurities, or sovereign currencies. This limits the price volatility in the stablecoins, making them\ncandidates for payments that require a stable medium of exchange.\n\nThe practice of backing a form of money by a stable asset is not new. The gold standard, in which the\neconomic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold, was widely used in the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies. Another example is Kenya’s M-PESA system, established in 2007 to enable transfers of\nmobile phone account balances backed by deposits held at commercial banks, which in turn hold\ngovernment securities. Facebook’s June 2019 announcement of Libra, a stablecoin to be made available\nto its more than 2.5 billion users, garnered considerable attention because of its potential to reach a global\nscale in a short period of time. Announcements such as this have served as a wakeup call to regulators,\nstandards-setting bodies, and central banks around the world for the need to study the benefits and risks of\nstablecoins.\n\nA global stablecoin has the potential to deliver some benefits by increasing the speed of certain payments\nand improving competition in and lowering the cost of making cross-border payments. By enhancing the\ndiversity of the payment system infrastructure, global stablecoins could increase resiliency. Stablecoins\nmight also be attractive to countries that prefer an alternative to the U.S. dollar or the euro for making\ninternational transactions, and they could provide an efficient mechanism for commercial banks to settle\nthe payment leg of a wholesale transaction involving the sale of another digital asset.\n\nBut against these potential benefits, stablecoins also pose some challenges, including a range of legal,\ngovernance, and compliance issues. It is likely that there are conflicts in the legal frameworks of different\njurisdictions that a global currency may traverse, and such conflicts would need to be reconciled before\nadoption. For example, there would need to be clarity about when the finality of the payment is achieved\n\n\f9\nand around the rights and obligations of all parties, including on whom or what the stablecoin holder has a\nclaim. Regulators would need to understand who is responsible for operating different aspects of the\nsystem, and how international safety and soundness standards, such as the principles for financial market\ninfrastructures, would apply to this type of payments system. In recent congressional testimony, Fed\nChair Jerome Powell highlighted some of the concerns about compliance with consumer privacy and\nprotection statutes, including the rules around know-your-customer, anti-money laundering, and\nconsumer data privacy. 12 Policymakers also need to assess potential risks to financial stability if\nstablecoins gain traction. While the availability of stablecoins may enhance payments system resiliency,\nit could also undermine stability if there is a loss of confidence in a global stablecoin that leads to runs on\nstablecoin redemptions. Similarly, understanding whether stablecoins would impact the effectiveness of\ntraditional monetary policy tools must also be part of the research agenda.\n\nCentral bank digital currencies\nAnother development under study is digital currency issued by a central bank. 13 This would be just like\nthe physical currency issued by central banks today, but in a digital form and, potentially, without the\nanonymity of physical currency. Depending on how these currencies are designed, central banks could\nsupport them without the need for commercial bank involvement via direct issuance into the end-users’\nwallets combined with central-bank-facilitated transfer and redemption services. Of the 66 central bank\nrespondents to a 2020 survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, 80 percent are\ncurrently or soon will be engaged in digital currency work, mostly related to researching, planning for, or\npiloting the technology. 14 China, Europe, and Russia, among other jurisdictions, have initiatives\nunderway. Some countries, like Sweden, cite the declining use of cash as motivating their interest in\n\n12\n\nPowell (July 10, 2019).\n\nPowell (November 19, 2019) discusses the Fed’s view on this subject. Also see Brainard (September 16, 2019,\nand December 18, 2019), and Evans (2019).\n13\n\n14\n\nSee Boar, Holden, and Wadsworth (2020).\n\n\f10\ncentral bank digital currencies.15 To the extent that they displace cash, such currencies may help to\nprevent money laundering and tax evasion. Of course, for the same reason, if they are designed without\nanonymity, they could be used by a totalitarian regime to control its citizenry. In other jurisdictions, like\nUruguay, central bank digital currency offers the promise of broadening financial inclusion by being more\naccessible to underserved segments of the population compared with bank accounts. In another survey,\nmany of the responding central banks expressed interest in central bank digital currency as a way to\nmaintain payment systems that are competitive with costly cash issuance or emerging private-sector\nalternatives, like Libra. 16 Others have suggested that central bank digital currency could enhance the\ntransmission of monetary policy, offering a more practical way to implement negative interest rates,\nwhich some central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss\nNational Bank, are currently imposing on reserve deposits to address low inflation and low growth. 17\n\nJust as with private-sector digital currencies, a range of potential risks and policy issues surrounding\ncentral bank digital currency need to be better understood, and the costs and benefits evaluated, before a\ncentral bank would implement a central bank digital currency. In the U.S. a basic question is whether the\nFederal Reserve has the legal authority to issue such a currency and offer transfer and safekeeping\nservices directly to consumers and businesses. Another is whether the central bank would need to gain\naccess to sensitive consumer and business information in order to issue digital currency and how privacy\ncould be protected. In addition, the design features necessary to prevent illicit activities would need to be\ndetermined. Finally, monetary policy transmission, potential disruption to short-term funding markets,\nand financial stability issues would need to be evaluated.\n\nInformation on the Swedish central bank’s e-krona project is available on its website at\nhttps://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments--cash/e-krona/. See also Sveriges Riksbank (2018) for several articles on\nthe e-krona, the Riksbank’s potential digital currency.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nSee Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (2019).\n\n17\n\nSee Rogoff (2016) and Bordo and Levin (2017).\n\n\f11\nThe outcome of the cost-benefit analysis may differ across countries. The status of the U.S. dollar as a\nglobal reserve currency, the stable demand for U.S. bank notes, and the mature, developed nature of the\nU.S. financial system are all distinguishing factors that would need to be taken into account when\nconsidering the benefits vs. the costs of central bank digital currency in the U.S. Central banks around the\nworld, including the Federal Reserve, continue to research this potential payments innovation, and they\nare sharing what they learn with one another and the public.\n\nConclusion\nThe payment system is undergoing a period of rapid change. The emergence and widespread adoption of\nnew technologies have shaped the public’s expectations for faster, more efficient, secure, and broadly\naccessible payment services. In the U.S., FedNow, a new real-time payments system, will be an integral\npart of this modernized payment system. As work on FedNow proceeds, so does the evolution of other\npayment methods like digital currencies. While each payments innovation offers benefits, it also comes\nwith some risks and policy implications that need to be evaluated. The Federal Reserve is monitoring\ndevelopments, evaluating potential new payments enhancements, and engaging with private-sector\nstakeholders and fellow central banks, as we work to modernize the payment system on behalf of the\npublic.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nBank for International Settlements, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, “Wholesale\nDigital Tokens,” December 2019.\n(https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d190.pdf)\nBank for International Settlements, G7 Working Group on Stablecoins, “Investigating the Impact of\nGlobal Stablecoins,” October 2019.\n(https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d187.pdf)\nBoar, Codruta, Henry Holden, and Amber Wadsworth, “Impending Arrival – A Sequel to the Survey on\nCentral Bank Digital Currency,” Bank for International Settlements, BIS Papers No. 107, January 2020.\n(https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap107.pdf)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Announces Plan to Develop a New\nRound-the-Clock Real-Time Payment and Settlement Service to Support Faster Payments,” August 5,\n2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190805a.htm)\nBordo, Michael D., and Andrew T.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2019 Financial Stability Conference\nFinancial Stability: Risks, Resilience, and Policy\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of Financial Research\nCleveland, OH\nNovember 21, 2019\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for what I expect to be a very\nengaging discussion of issues surrounding the stability of the financial system. I extend a special thanks\nto our partner, the Office of Financial Research (OFR), and Stacey Schreft, deputy director of research\nand analysis at the OFR. She and Joe Haubrich of the Cleveland Fed have worked diligently to put\ntogether this two-day program, the sixth joint conference between our two institutions. A look back at\nthose past programs shows that much work has been done to increase our understanding of the risks\nfacing the global financial system and the effectiveness of policies intended to foster increased resilience.\nAdvances in research, data collection, and risk-monitoring have given us all a better appreciation of the\ninterlinkages underlying the global financial system and the ability of a disturbance in one part of the\nsystem to propagate across the system. The horizontal approach to risk-monitoring, including stress\ntesting, has been an important advance in the supervisory tool kit. Policymakers are gaining a better\nsense of how macroprudential policy and monetary policy interact, the appropriate role of liquidity and\ncapital regulations, and the importance of taking a balanced approach to supervision and regulation,\nwhich supports both financial system resilience and the ability of financial firms to offer sound credit,\nliquidity, and payments services throughout the business cycle. Regulatory changes and the steps bankers\nthemselves have taken to shore up their risk-management practices have led to a stronger and safer\nfinancial system.\n\nBut as much as we have learned and accomplished, there is still more to do. The financial system is\ndynamic: it is constantly evolving. Technological change is happening at a rapid pace. Machine learning,\nartificial intelligence, distributed ledgers, and other technological advances all hold the promise of\nmaking our financial and payments systems more efficient and effective for more people and of creating\nbetter analytical tools with which to monitor and manage risks. But these advances also pose challenges\nand have the potential to create new risks and imbalances that may be more difficult to monitor. With the\nadvent of new technologies, some firms offering financial services do not fit neatly into the current\n\n\f2\nregulatory framework, and monitoring risks outside of the traditional banking sector presents some\nchallenges. In a financial system that is rapidly adopting new technologies, our knowledge can rapidly\nbecome obsolete, as can the constructs we use to monitor and manage risks to financial stability. When\nthe nature of the risks is changing, we need to ensure that our methods of assessing risks are nimble\nenough to adapt to the changing landscape.\n\nIn my limited time this morning, I will focus on one area of rapid change pertinent to financial stability:\nnamely, the risks to cybersecurity and our ability to handle these risks. Of course, the views I will present\ntoday are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nCybersecurity and Financial Stability\nAs businesses have become more reliant on technology, efforts to disrupt a financial institution’s\noperations; to steal, corrupt, or destroy data and intellectual property; or to divert funds have become\nmore prevalent. As the Financial Stability Board points out, several recent events show the sizeable\ndamaging effects such cyber incidents can have on the financial system. These include the attack on the\nBangladesh Bank in 2016, which resulted in the theft of $81 million; the WannaCry ransomware attack in\n2017, which infected more than 250,000 computer systems in 150 countries; and the Equifax hack in\n2017, which compromised the personal information of over 146 million people. 1\n\nIt is difficult to come up with firm numbers about the costs of malicious cyber activity – a fact that itself\nindicates we need to do more to monitor these risks. The U.S. Council of Economic Advisers has\nestimated that malicious cyber activity cost the U.S. economy between $57 billion and $109 billion in\n2016, and other estimates suggest that those costs are rising rapidly, by 23 percent between 2016 and\n\n1\n\nFinancial Stability Board (2018).\n\n\f3\n2017 according to one study. 2 Firms are spending significant amounts on their cybersecurity, with one\nestimate at nearly $124 billion globally in 2019. 3 While all businesses face cyber risks, the stakes are\nparticularly high in the financial services industry, given the critical role the financial system plays in the\noverall health of the U.S. and global economy.\n\nOne might be tempted to view cyber risk as a form of operational risk and treat it within the frameworks\nwe have already established for assessing such risks. Instead, I think it pays to put cyber risks into a\nspecial category, 4 recognize they are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and realize that creative new\nsolutions are needed to monitor and mitigate these risks. Cyber attacks have become more systematic,\nmaliciously targeting financial firms and playing out over time for maximum effect. Detection can be\ndifficult; an institution may believe it has backed up its good data, but those data may already have been\ncompromised by malicious code that has infiltrated the institution’s system. Data integrity will\nincreasingly need to be a focus as firms develop plans for how they will recover from the inevitable\nattack. As financial institutions have adopted new technologies, sometimes through third-party suppliers,\nthey are susceptible to risks that they may not have faced before. Those making the attacks are also\nadopting new technologies that more easily exploit gaps in financial firms’ information technology,\npayment messaging and transaction authorization systems, and supply chains, which can widen the extent\nof the attack and make response or recovery more difficult. In such a landscape, weaknesses in financial\nfirms’ governance and communications structures – for example, not being clear about who has the\ndecision rights to turn off a system, or what effect turning off one system will have on other systems – can\nexacerbate problems faced by a firm under attack.\n\n2\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers (2018) and Kashyap and Wetherilt (2019).\n\n3\n\nSee Kashyap and Wetherilt (2019).\n\nKashyap and Wetherilt (2019) and Healey, et al. (2018) discuss how cybersecurity differs from other types of\noperational risks in the financial sector.\n4\n\n\f4\nInstead of being idiosyncratic and affecting only a few firms, as many operational risks are, cyber threats\nare more likely to be correlated across institutions because of the complex interconnections and\ndependencies among financial firms. This means that cyber threats are more likely to have wider spread,\nand potentially systemic, negative impacts than a typical operational problem that might arise from a\nfailed system or process. Trading platforms, settlement and payments systems, and central securities\ndepositories are all critical infrastructures on which financial firms depend, and if these systems go down,\nthere are few substitutes. In addition, the advent of new technologies and the move to cloud computing\ncreate additional concentrated risk, as only a handful of third-parties provide these services.\n\nAs much as individual firms are investing in cybersecurity – and it is a lot – as a nation and globally, we\nare likely underinvesting. This is because cybersecurity is a public good: the overall financial system\nconveys benefits to us all. Individual institutions certainly have incentives to invest in their own\ncybersecurity. As they have considered the tradeoff between the risk of loss to their firm from a cyber\nattack versus the cost of protection, financial services firms have been making major investments to\nmonitor and protect their systems against attack. But the social benefit conveyed by a well-functioning\nand resilient financial system, one in which the public can continue to have a lot of confidence, requires a\nhigher level of investment in cybersecurity than what individual firms would decide to do on their own.\nIn addition, many individual firms rely on shared services. In considering how much to invest in their\nown cybersecurity, each firm should be entertaining the possibility that those shared services could come\nunder significant stress in the event of a major attack on multiple firms at the same time 5 or that the\nshared service itself could be the entry point for a system-wide attack. These types of externalities may\nnot be part of any one firm’s investment decision. In addition, there could be free-rider problems: an\n\n5\n\nSee Kashyap and Wetherilt (2019).\n\n\f5\nindividual firm may rely on others in the shared network to make investments to increase the security of\nthe network, but if every firm thinks this way, there will be underinvestment in security. 6\n\nCybersecurity and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGiven the changing environment, both financial services firms and their supervisors are making\ncybersecurity a high priority. In fact, because the stakes are so high, the banking industry is one of the\nmost responsive industries in efforts to combat cybersecurity threats. Banks have strengthened their\ndefenses and are detecting breaches in a more timely manner, shortening the time it takes to detect a\nproblem once an attacker has entered a system. 7 Institutions are engaging in tabletop exercises,\nenhancing their incident response playbooks, and testing systems to strengthen their ability to recover\nfrom attacks. Firms are testing applications within sandboxes and using artificial intelligence to help\ndetect cyber intruders. Realizing their common interests in effectively managing these risks, financial\nfirms have been working on some joint efforts. Sheltered Harbor is an industry initiative that provides\nparticipant financial institutions a way to store data independent of the bank’s own infrastructure. This\ncan help make recovery quicker after an attack is detected. Sheltered Harbor reports that as of\nMarch 2019, its members accounted for 71 percent of U.S. deposit accounts and 55 percent of U.S. retail\nbrokerage client assets. 8\n\nCybersecurity is a high priority for the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s approach builds on techniques that we\nhave successfully applied to other forms of financial system oversight. We are developing clear and\nconsistent standards for assessing financial institutions’ preparedness and establishing corporate\ngovernance best practices with respect to cybersecurity. We are also acquiring and deploying Fed staff\n\nSablik (2017) discusses the underinvestment problem. See also the Council of Economic Advisers (2018). The\nU.S. Department of the Treasury (2013) outlines the role government incentives can play in driving private-sector\nactions to strengthen defenses against cyber threats.\n\n6\n\nSee FireEye Mandiant Services (2019), p. 7. Across industries, the median detection time in North and South\nAmerica has fallen from 99 days in 2016 to 71 days in 2018.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nSee shelteredharbor.org for further information.\n\n\f6\nwith the necessary technical skills to assess risk-management practices at financial firms, and we are\nencouraging and creating avenues for information sharing among financial institutions and regulators.\nThe Fed has increased coordination with the other federal banking agencies in assessing cybersecurity at\nthe nation’s largest, most complex firms. We are aligning what we expect of banks in terms of\nidentifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber attacks with the best-practice\nstandards in the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) cybersecurity framework. 9 The\nbanking agencies coordinate their annual reviews of the large, complex institutions, targeting key areas of\nsupervisory interest, including cyber governance and risk management, incident response, and the ability\nto restore critical services. We have raised the expectations of cyber preparedness for all of the\ninstitutions we supervise, including regional and community banks.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed is playing an important role in the Federal Reserve’s cybersecurity initiatives in\nseveral ways. Since 2015, the Cleveland Fed has been co-leading the Federal Reserve System’s annual\nnational horizontal review of cybersecurity for banks with assets between $100 billion and $500 billion.\nFed examiners assess a bank’s cybersecurity along a number of dimensions. Effective cybersecurity\nrequires sound cyber-risk governance, including leadership’s engagement in oversight of the firm’s\ncybersecurity programs. An institution needs to have effective programs for identifying and managing\nrisks and vulnerabilities, including those within its own technology infrastructure, those associated with\nvendors and third-party technology providers, and those posed by new products. Examiners assess a\nbank’s incident response and recovery plans, as well as basic elements of good cyber hygiene, such as\nadequate technology inventories; safeguards for hardware, software, and customer and transaction data;\nand access and patch management.\n\n9\n\nSee Quarles (2018)\n\n\f7\nThe Cleveland Fed is also playing a national role in the collection of threat information. The Federal\nReserve System’s Cybersecurity Analytics Support Team (CAST) was created in 2015 and is based at the\nCleveland Fed. 10 This team tracks the latest cybersecurity developments across the U.S. financial sector\nin critical payment, clearing, and settlement systems, allowing it to gain a wide perspective on potential\nthreats to the overall financial system and to better calibrate threat severity and impact. As its name\nimplies, Cleveland’s CAST group casts a wide net in its 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a\nyear monitoring of cybersecurity risks in the financial system, working with the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury, other bank regulatory agencies, and the FBI. The Cleveland Fed staff is sharing its expertise on\ncybersecurity topics at industry and regulatory forums, and last month held its second conference on\nmanaging cyber risks, with financial industry risk and information security officers participating.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is a provider of both wholesale and retail payment services to the public and the U.S.\ngovernment, and we recently launched a project called FedNow, to build a real-time gross settlement\nsystem to promote a safe and efficient faster payments system available to all. We need to maintain the\npublic’s trust and confidence in our ability to deliver those services, so we are highly engaged in work to\nenhance the resilience of our own systems, applications, and data against cybersecurity risks. The\nCleveland Fed is one of the four Reserve Banks that provide payment services to the U.S. Treasury. Our\neGov function focuses on revenue collections and eCommerce on behalf of the U.S. Treasury’s Bureau of\nthe Fiscal Service, maintaining and operating multiple systems for collecting funds for federal\ngovernment agencies and providing solutions to take advantage of newer payments technologies. In\naddition to managing operational risks, our staff is constantly monitoring cybersecurity risks and potential\nfraudulent transactions on these critical payments services.\n\nMore information on the Cleveland Fed’s work on cybersecurity is available on our website at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/multimedia-storytelling/cybersecurity.aspx.\n10\n\n\f8\nFour Recommendations to Enhance Cybersecurity\nWhile the financial services industry and the supervisory agencies have made significant progress, the\ncybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving amid rapid technological change. So let me offer four\nrecommendations to enhance the cyber resilience of the global financial system.\n\nFirst, financial system supervisory agencies need to become more agile to ensure that our supervisory\nframeworks are up to the task of monitoring cybersecurity. The Federal Reserve continues to work with\nthe other federal banking agencies to harmonize our cybersecurity examination requirements, but progress\nhas been slow. In October 2016, the three federal banking regulatory agencies published an advance\nnotice of proposed rulemaking inviting comment on a set of potential enhanced cybersecurity riskmanagement and resilience standards. This draft guidance is still in process. Given the changes in\ntechnology, including the move to cloud technology, the supervisory program applied to the most critical\nthird-party service providers needs to be updated. We need to become agile in our approach to\nsupervision; otherwise, changes in technology will overtake our ability to monitor and manage risks.\n\nSecond, given the systemic nature of cyber risks and the potential for widespread disruption, further\ncollaboration between the regulators, government, financial institutions, and other private-sector firms\nwill be a crucial ingredient for improving our cybersecurity. One form of this collaboration is tabletop\nexercises, which can improve the readiness of the industry and the government to respond to a cyber\nincident. The Fed participates in the Hamilton Series of tabletop exercises, in collaboration with the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS–\nISAC), an important banking industry forum that promotes collaboration on critical security threats.\nThese exercises are intended to improve public- and private-sector management of cyber risks.\nParticipants have told us that they value these exercises because they promote consistent approaches and\nbest practices in event response and recovery and they foster relationships with key regulatory officials.\n\n\f9\nBecause cyber threats are not restricted by national borders and because the financial system is\ninterconnected, cross-border collaboration must also advance. In November 2015, the U.S. and U.K.\ngovernments conducted a joint exercise with leading global financial firms to determine how the two\ngovernments would perform in the event of a large cyber attack on the financial systems in both\ncountries. 11 The Fed participated in the exercise, which evaluated incident-response handling and\nrecovery, coordination, public communication, and information handling. These types of exercises\nshould be expanded and carried out on a more frequent and regular basis. This will help those who have\nnot been exposed to such situations learn how to handle them and allow the lessons to become second\nnature to all bank and supervisory staff.\n\nThird, further development and use of stress testing to assess the financial system’s resilience to cyber\nrisks are needed. Just as horizontal stress testing has proven to be a useful tool in assessing the overall\nresilience of the financial system to credit and liquidity risks, stress testing could be used to assess how\nprepared individual firms and the overall system are to respond to and recover from a systemic cyber\nevent such as the shutdown of a major clearing or settlement bank. Such a test could help evaluate the\nfinancial system’s plans for data and core systems recovery and its reliance on third parties to implement\nthat plan. As part of the recovery plan, data integrity needs to be a focus: how can the institution ensure\nthat the data it backed up have not already been altered?\n\nThe G7 has provided a guide to authorities for assessing resiliency through the use of simulations, such as\nthreat-led penetration tests. To test the resiliency of an institution’s systems and its ability to recover\nfrom an attack, these tests are carried out without advance knowledge using the techniques and tactics of\nactual malicious attackers. 12 The Bank of England is applying stress-testing techniques to evaluate\nwhether financial firms are able to resume services within the tolerance set by the Bank of England in the\n\n11\n\nSee U.S. Department of the Treasury (2015).\n\n12\n\nSee G7 Cyber Expert Group (2018).\n\n\f10\nface of a system-wide attack or data corruption that affects multiple firms and their service providers. 13\nAdapting and adopting some of these practices in the U.S. would be worthwhile.\n\nFourth, information gathering, sharing, and analysis need to be promoted as critical ingredients for\nimproving our cybersecurity. The Financial Stability Board recently published a cyber lexicon. 14 A\ncommon language is crucial to ensure consistent data collection and reliable measurement. Another\ncrucial ingredient for effective monitoring is firms’ willingness to share information on cyber incidents.\nWithout such sharing, it is much harder to develop metrics to evaluate cyber resilience, to assess whether\nthreat levels are rising or beginning to propagate through the financial system, and to determine whether\nthe practices firms have in place actually are working to mitigate the risks. So the Fed has been working\nwith FS-ISAC to promote information sharing.\n\nBut collecting and sharing the data are not enough. With the constant evolution of the threats, advanced\ntechniques for analyzing those data need to be developed so that evolving trends can be identified. Here,\ntechnological advances like machine learning and artificial intelligence can be helpful, if applied\ncorrectly. But if not applied correctly, they can result in false positives, diverting attention from actual\nrisks and vulnerabilities. Given that the necessary skill sets are difficult to acquire, especially by\nregulatory agencies without deep pockets, the agencies should be willing to develop appropriate\ncollaborations with universities and other entities with an aptitude and interest in using such techniques\nfor the good of the public.\n\nIn summary, my four recommendations are: an agile supervisory framework for cybersecurity; global\nindustry and agency collaboration; cybersecurity stress testing; and more robust data gathering, sharing,\nand analytics about cyber incidents. I see these areas as those in which the most urgent actions are needed\n\n13\n\nSee Kashyap and Wetherilt (2019).\n\n14\n\nSee Financial Stability Board (2018).\n\n\f11\nto help promote the resilience of our financial system. Given the nature of the financial services industry,\nwith interconnections and dependencies on third-party providers, and advances in technology, this list can\nbe expected to evolve. I hope it evolves because we have made significant progress in these four areas\nand not because the list has expanded to include new vulnerabilities that could have been avoided had we\nmade better progress.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nCouncil of Economic Advisers, “The Cost of Malicious Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy,” February\n2018.\n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-Cost-of-Malicious-Cyber-Activity-to-theU.S.-Economy.pdf)\nFinancial Stability Board, “Cyber Lexicon,” November 12, 2018.\n(https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P121118-1.pdf)\nFireEye Mandiant Services, “Special Report: M-Trends 2019,” 2019.\n(https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends)\nG7 Cyber Expert Group, “G7 Fundamental Elements for Threat-Led Penetration Testing,” October 15,\n2018.\n(https://www.fin.gc.ca/activty/G7/pdf/G7-penetration-testing-tests-penetration-eng.pdf)\nHealey, Jason, Patricia Mosser, Katheryn Rosen, and Adriana Tache, “The Future of Financial Stability\nand Cyber Risk,” The Brookings Institution Cybersecurity Project, October 2018.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-future-of-financial-stability-and-cyber-risk/)\nKashyap, Anil K., and Anne Wetherilt, “Some Principles for Regulating Cyber Risk,” American\nEconomic Association Papers and Proceedings 109, May 2019, pp. 482-487.\n(https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pandp.20191058)\nQuarles, Randal K., “Brief Thoughts on the Financial Regulatory System and Cybersecurity,” at the\nFinancial Services Roundtable 2018 Spring Conference, Washington, D.C, February 26, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20180226b.htm)\nSablik, Tim, “Cyberattacks and the Digital Dilemma,” Econ Focus, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,\nThird Quarter 2017.\n(https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2017/q3/\ncover_story.pdf)\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, “Treasury Department Report to the President on Cybersecurity\nIncentives Pursuant to Executive Order 13636,” 2013.\n(https://www.treasury.gov/presscenter/Documents/Supporting%20Analysis%20Treasury%20Report%20to%20the%20President%20on%\n20Cybersecurity%20Incentives_FINAL.pdf)\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, “Joint Statement from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Her\nMajesty’s Treasury,” November 12, 2015.\n(https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/jl0262.aspx)\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMellen Executive Speaker Series\nJohn Carroll University\nUniversity Heights, OH\nOctober 10, 2019\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Professor William Elliott and John Carroll University for inviting me to participate in the Mellen\nExecutive Speakers series. It was a pleasure meeting with John Carroll students earlier this afternoon,\nand I am looking forward to the question and answer session moderated by Jack Kleinhenz. Jack is not\nonly one of John Carroll’s impressive alumni, but he is also chief economist for the National Retail\nFederation, so hearing his views on the economy is always valuable. Before we get started, I thought it\nmight be useful to set the stage by giving you a brief update of my own take on the economy and\nmonetary policy. It is important to point out that the views I’ll present today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nIn July, the U.S. economic expansion entered its 11th year, making this the longest expansion on record.\nLast year, we saw strong economic growth: real GDP grew at a 2.5 percent pace, well above most\neconomists’ estimates of trend growth. This growth was supported by fiscal stimulus in the form of tax\ncuts to households and businesses and higher federal government spending. In addition, financial\nconditions were accommodative for much of the year. It was widely anticipated that output growth would\nslow this year as this stimulus waned. But over the course of this year, several risks to the outlook\nemerged. These risks include those associated with trade policy, tariffs, and slower growth abroad, as\nwell as geopolitical risks including Brexit, the events in Hong Kong, and tensions in the Middle East.\nThe question is whether the economy will remain resilient, with growth stepping down to its trend pace,\nwhich I estimate to be about 2 percent, or whether these downside risks will lead to a more significant\ndeceleration in growth.\n\nDespite the risks to the outlook, the data indicate that the economy continues to perform well along a\nnumber of dimensions. Over the first half of the year, the economy grew at about a 2.5 percent pace, the\n\n\f2\nsame as last year. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of GDP, continues to show\nstrength, buoyed by solid fundamentals. Household balance sheets are healthy, consumer sentiment is at\na high level, and incomes are growing thanks to the solid performance of the labor market.\n\nPayroll job growth has averaged about 160,000 jobs per month this year; the expected benchmark\nrevisions will lower this number somewhat. This pace is a step down from last year’s strong pace of over\n220,000 jobs per month. But it is important to put this into context. Most economists estimate that the\neconomy can sustain job growth in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on what one\nassumes about trend labor force participation. Demographic factors, including the aging of our\npopulation, have resulted in a downward trend in participation, which is one of the reasons trend\nemployment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago. Rather than declining like its trend, the\nparticipation rate has actually been relatively stable over the past three years, a sign of the robust labor\nmarket.\n\nLast month, the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent, and the broader measures of\nunemployment that include discouraged workers and those working part-time who would prefer to work\nfull-time are at very low levels. In the Cleveland Fed’s District, which includes the state of Ohio, western\nPennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the panhandle of West Virginia, the unemployment rate is about 4\npercent, near the lowest level seen in four decades.\n\nCongress has given the Fed two long-run monetary policy goals: maximum employment and price\nstability. So assessing how the labor market is doing relative to what is sustainable over the longer run is\na key factor when setting monetary policy. The strong performance of the labor market over this\nexpansion has made many economists reevaluate what unemployment rate is sustainable and consistent\nwith price stability. This is true of participants on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as well.\nFive years ago, their estimates of unemployment over the longer run ranged from 5 to 6 percent; the\n\n\f3\ncurrent range is 3.6 to 4.5 percent. I recently lowered my own estimate to a range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent, in\nrecognition of the fact that the unemployment rate has been quite low for some time and inflation has\nremained subdued. But it’s important to remember that there is quite a bit of uncertainty about such\nestimates.\n\nEven with economists reevaluating the degree of tightness in the labor market, if you speak to business\nowners, it is hard to conclude that labor markets aren’t tight. We have heard from firms of all sizes that\nthey cannot find workers with the skills they need; even for the relatively lower-skill positions, workers\nare hard to come by. Firms have been raising wages and benefits to attract and retain workers. Some\nfirms have told us they have had to turn away business because labor is so scarce. The steady\nacceleration in labor compensation associated with such a vibrant labor market is a positive for consumer\nspending. But there is a downside to the tightness. Several members of our Cleveland Business\nAdvisory Council have mentioned that their ability to innovate has been lessened because so much of\ntheir time is spent on recruiting, and less innovation could negatively affect future growth. Other firms\ntell us that because workers are so hard to find, they are speeding up their efforts to automate more of\ntheir operations. In the long run, such automation can make production more efficient and raise the\npotential growth rate of the economy. However, in the short to medium run, workers without the\nnecessary skills to operate in a highly automated production process may be left behind. This makes the\nneed for affordable training programs even more urgent so that workers can acquire the skills that are in\ndemand now and in the future. Educational institutions like John Carroll will continue to play an\nimportant role as technological change remains a driving force in our economy.\n\nOffsetting the positives of consumer spending and labor market conditions are developments in the\nbusiness sector. After increasing robustly last year, growth of business investment in equipment\nweakened sharply over the first half of this year, and manufacturing activity has declined. New orders\nand shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft have decelerated from their year-ago levels,\n\n\f4\nand orders and shipments of aircraft have decreased sharply since the start of the year, reflecting the\nproblems with Boeing’s 737 MAX airplane. Business sentiment has deteriorated.\n\nThis turn of events reflects a slowdown in growth abroad, especially in Europe and China; the imposition\nof an expanding menu of tariffs; and continued uncertainty about where trade policy is going. These\ndevelopments have weakened demand for U.S. exports, which has weighed on the U.S. manufacturing\nand agricultural sectors. As trade tensions between the U.S. and China have continued to escalate, the\nuncertainty around trade policy has dampened business sentiment and has caused some firms to postpone\ninvestment. Rising geopolitical risks, including Brexit, events in Hong Kong, and the attack on oil\nproduction facilities in Saudi Arabia, have also weighed on sentiment. Firms in the Cleveland Fed\nDistrict have been citing the uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy as a concern for some time.\nWhile many have not yet postponed planned investments, they have told us they are beginning to reassess\nthose plans in light of the cloudy picture surrounding future tariffs and the outlook for U.S. growth.\n\nOn balance, I continue to expect that we will avoid a more serious turndown in the economy and that\ngrowth will be near its trend pace and the unemployment rate will remain below 4 percent over the next\ntwo years. As indicated by FOMC participants’ economic projections, my colleagues have a similar\nview.1 The current period shares some similarities with the period from 2014 to 2016, when the\nslowdown in global demand, a decline in oil prices, and appreciation in the dollar caused a drop-off in\ninvestment and manufacturing activity. In that period, the overall economy proved to be quite resilient.\nNonetheless, the nature of the downside risks this time is different, and it is not too difficult to envision a\nscenario in which adverse shifts in business sentiment and uncertainty over the outlook cause firms not\nonly to reduce capital spending but also to pull back on hiring, which then causes consumer sentiment and\nspending to weaken and unemployment to rise, with inflation staying below our target because of weak\n\n1\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections, September 2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20190918.htm)\n\n\f5\naggregate demand. The declines in longer-term Treasury yields and other sovereign debt yields over the\npast two months suggest that bond investors are putting a higher likelihood on this scenario than they did\nearlier this year. While lower bond rates have meant lower mortgage rates and some increased activity in\nhousing markets, the overall signal about the outlook from the bond market is a negative one.\n\nTurning to inflation, as I mentioned, despite the tightness in labor markets, inflation has remained\nsubdued over much of the expansion. Last year, inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in\nthe personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, moved up to 2 percent, the FOMC’s target.\nHowever, this year, inflation moved back down, with total PCE inflation weighed down by declines in\nenergy prices earlier in the year. Total PCE inflation remains low at 1.4 percent. The core measure,\nwhich excludes food and energy prices, also moved down early this year because of transitory declines in\napparel prices and imputed prices of financial services. But since then, core PCE inflation has moved up\nto 1.8 percent. Although we use core inflation as an indicator of the underlying trend in inflation, it is\nimportant to remember that a sizable fraction of the variability of core inflation is due to idiosyncratic\nfactors, for example, changes in Medicare reimbursement rates or cell phone prices. When we look at\nother measures of the underlying inflation trend, which try to control for this, we also find that inflation is\nfirming and close to our goal. These include the Dallas Fed’s trimmed-mean PCE inflation measure,\nwhich has been stable at 2 percent; the Cleveland Fed’s trimmed-mean CPI measure, which was 2.2\npercent in August; and an experimental measure of median PCE produced by the Cleveland Fed staff,\nwhich was 2.7 percent in August.\n\nBecause understanding inflation dynamics is essential for making effective monetary policy, the\nCleveland Fed has established a Center for Inflation Research.2 The center builds on the pioneering work\nthe bank has done over many years to measure and forecast inflation. One of the center’s recent studies\n\nFor more on the Cleveland Fed’s inflation research and inflation-related products, see the Cleveland Fed’s Center\nfor Inflation Research website: https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n2\n\n\f6\nsheds some light on the recent behavior of inflation.3 This research disaggregates inflation into cyclical\ncomponents, which vary with the degree of tightness in the labor market, and acyclical components,\nwhich are relatively unresponsive to the tightness in labor markets. The cyclical part of inflation accounts\nfor only about 40 percent of core PCE inflation, but it has continued to rise over the expansion as the\nlabor market has continued to tighten. The Cleveland Fed staff analysis indicates that as long as labor\nmarkets remain strong, cyclical inflation should continue to firm, helping headline inflation return\ngradually to our 2 percent objective over time.\n\nWhile inflation tends to fluctuate around trend due to changes in resource utilization, changes in\ncommodity and other input prices, and idiosyncratic factors, the underlying trend in inflation is\ndetermined by businesses’ and households’ expectations of inflation over the long run. Forecasts of\ninflation gradually returning to 2 percent are dependent on long-run inflation expectations remaining\nstable. If firms and households begin to expect lower inflation to prevail over the longer run, this would\nmake it even harder for the Fed to hit its inflation target, because theory suggests that these expectations\ninfluence actual price- and wage-setting behavior. Recent readings on long-run inflation expectations\nhave been mixed. So far, the softer readings in some of the household survey measures are in line with\nthe typical variation in these measures, but these movements bear watching.\n\nMonetary Policy\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking. So\nthe current uncertainty around the economic outlook poses some challenges. At each of its meetings in\nJuly and September, the FOMC reduced the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points; the\ncurrent target range is 1-3/4 to 2 percent. The Committee said that it views sustained expansion of\n\nSee Saeed Zaman (2019) “Cyclical versus Acyclical Inflation: A Deeper Dive,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland Economic Commentary 2019-13, https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economic-commentaries/ec-201913-cyclical-versus-acyclicalinflation.\n3\n\n\f7\neconomic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2\npercent objective as the most likely outcomes, but that uncertainties about this outlook remain. In light of\nthe implications of global developments for the outlook and muted inflation pressures, the Committee\ndecided to take these actions.\n\nI was certainly sympathetic to the view expressed by the majority; indeed, my view of appropriate policy\nhas become more accommodative since last year based on my assessment of economic and financial\nmarket developments. But my preference was to leave the fed funds rate unchanged at the July and\nSeptember meetings. My preferred strategy was to take action only if there were evidence of a material\ndeterioration in the outlook and not merely on heightened risks. Coming into those meetings, the overall\neconomy was still performing well, financial conditions were accommodative, and access to credit was\nnot the source of weakness in the business sector. Indeed, corporate debt is at a high level, and in the\nmost recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), small businesses\nindicated that credit conditions are about as accommodative as they have ever been in the survey’s almost\nfive-decade history.\n\nIn assessing the path of policy going forward, I will be monitoring incoming economic and financial data\nand reports from District contacts. I will be particularly attentive to signs that the weakness in investment\nand manufacturing is broadening, and spilling over to reductions in hiring and household spending, and to\nsigns that long-run inflation expectations are destabilizing. Such signs would point to a material change\nin the outlook that could warrant policy action. Absent those signs, with labor markets strong and growth\nnear trend, maintaining a shallow policy path for a while to support a gradual rise in inflation and not\noverreacting to shocks that might, for a time, move inflation somewhat above 2 percent would be\nappropriate, in my view. It would be consistent with keeping inflation within a reasonable range around 2\npercent, and balance the risks to achieving our dual-mandate goals.\n\n\f"

It was three years ago, almost to the day, when I was last before\nyou. Since that time, there have been several economic and policy developments in the U.S. that I will\nupdate you on today. One thing has not changed: monetary policymakers are operating in a world of\neconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that cloud the outlook. When I was here three years ago, U.K.\nvoters had just decided to exit the European Union, and it was too soon to determine with any precision\nwhat the ramifications of that vote would be for the U.K. and global economy. Today, the terms of Brexit\nremain unresolved while a new source of uncertainty has emerged, namely, international trade policy.\nPolitical tensions in the Middle East have also arisen, with implications for energy prices and financial\nmarkets. Of course, forecasting in an uncertain world is a difficult task, but it is something economists\nand monetary policymakers must always do.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a statutory mandate to set U.S. monetary policy to achieve the longer-run goals\nof price stability and maximum employment. At its meeting two weeks ago, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), the Fed’s monetary policymaking body, decided to maintain the target range of the\nfederal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. In its statement, the FOMC indicated that it “continues to\nview sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the\nCommittee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this\noutlook have increased.” The Committee said that “in light of these uncertainties and muted inflation\npressures,” it “will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook\nand will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its\nsymmetric 2 percent objective.”\n\nToday, I will discuss why I agree with this assessment of the economic outlook, and its implications for\nmonetary policy. It is important to point out that the views I’ll present today are my own and not\n\n\f2\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe Economy\nLast month, the U.S. economic expansion reached its 10-year anniversary. For the past couple of years,\nthe economy has been growing at an above-trend pace, and last year, real GDP growth was a strong\n3 percent. Growth was supported by fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts to households and businesses\nand higher federal government spending, as well as financial conditions that were accommodative for\nmuch of the year. I anticipated that output growth would slow this year as this stimulus waned. The\nquestion is whether growth will slow toward a more sustainable trend pace, which I estimate to be around\n2 percent, or whether we will see a more significant deceleration in output and labor market conditions.\nIn my view, the most likely outcome continues to be that the economy will maintain its good performance\nin 2019 – a sustainable-growth scenario in which output growth slows to a sustainable pace, labor markets\nremain strong, and after some near term softness, inflation moves back to our 2 percent goal over time.\nBut mixed recent data suggest that the downside risks to this forecast have risen and that there is some\nchance that an alternative, weak-growth scenario could be emerging, one in which growth slows more\nsignificantly, the unemployment rate rises, and inflation remains low because aggregate demand is weak.\nThe declines in longer-term Treasury yields and other sovereign debt yields over the past two months\nsuggest that bond investors are putting a higher likelihood on this scenario than they did earlier this year.\n\nThe path to sustainability is rarely smooth, and this year has been no different. Real GDP growth\nremained at a strong 3.1 percent in the first quarter, but about half of that growth came from inventory\ninvestment and net exports, which is not sustainable. Most estimates of second quarter growth suggest\ngrowth will slow to a range of 1.5 to 2 percent. Of course, this still means a solid showing for the first\nhalf of the year.\n\n\f3\nThere is variation across sectors in terms of their contributions to overall growth. On the positive side is\nconsumer spending. Although the monthly readings have been volatile, the overall data suggest that\nconsumer spending picked up in the second quarter after being subdued in the first quarter. First quarter\nspending was weighed down in part by the partial federal government shutdown that delayed income tax\nrefunds and by declines in equity prices at the end of last year, which reduced household wealth. These\ntemporary factors have dissipated. The healthy labor market is adding jobs and producing wage gains in\nexcess of inflation, which are supportive of consumer spending. Financial conditions remain relatively\naccommodative by a number of measures, even with the increase in volatility of late. While consumer\nconfidence and sentiment fell in June, they remain at relatively high levels and it is too soon to determine\nwhether June’s drop is the start of a more sustained falloff in consumer attitudes that could weigh on\nconsumer spending.\n\nOn the neutral side is the housing market, which has seen only a protracted recovery from the Great\nRecession. Indeed, residential investment subtracted from growth throughout 2018 and in the first quarter\nof this year. Until very recently, affordability was becoming an issue because the 30-year mortgage rate\nhad been trending up since mid-2016 and house price appreciation was exceeding income growth. In\naddition, recent changes to the U.S. tax code reduced the deductibility of housing-related taxes for some\ntaxpayers, affecting the incentives to own a home. Going forward, several factors should help stabilize\nthe housing sector. These include the recent decline in mortgage rates; slower house price appreciation,\nwhich was running 6 to 7 percent in early 2018 and is now in the 3 to 4 percent range; and an increase in\nhousehold formation driven by the strong labor market, which allows more people to commit to\npurchasing a home. On balance, I don’t expect housing to contribute much to economic growth this year,\nnor do I expect to see a sharp pullback in the sector.\n\nOn the negative side is business investment. Business investment in equipment was strong last year, but\nweakened sharply in the first quarter despite favorable earnings and lower taxes. Surveys of business\n\n\f4\nactivity point to solid conditions in the services sector, but manufacturing activity has softened. New\norders and shipments of capital goods excluding aircraft and defense have decelerated from their year-ago\nlevels, and orders and shipments of aircraft have decreased sharply since the start of the year, reflecting\nthe problems with Boeing’s 737 Max airplane. Thanks to shale, the U.S. is now a major energy producer.\nOil prices are about $12 per barrel lower than they were a year ago. Lower energy prices are weighing a\nbit on oil and natural gas drilling activity and investment. But this downturn is slight compared to the\ndecline seen from mid-2014 to early 2016, when oil prices fell from over $100 per barrel to about $30 per\nbarrel. We will need to gather further data and anecdotal reports to determine whether the slowdown in\nbusiness spending will be sustained over the rest of the year or whether activity will remain consistent\nwith trend growth.\n\nInternational economic developments are weighing on the U.S. outlook and contributing to the recent\nslowdown in investment. Sometimes I am asked why the Federal Reserve takes into account how other\neconomies are doing when our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment pertain\nto the U.S. economy. The answer is because economic and financial conditions in other parts of the\nworld can spill over to the U.S. through trade linkages and financial markets. Global growth slowed in\nthe second half of last year and forecasts have been revised down. Subdued global growth and the\nstrengthening dollar have weighed on U.S. export orders and manufacturing. As I mentioned earlier,\nuncertainty around trade policy and tariffs is also clouding the outlook. Indeed, it was a factor cited by\nconsumers in the recent confidence and sentiment surveys.\n\nThe direct effects of the tariffs already imposed have been relatively modest. However, some\nmultinational firms have taken steps to reorganize their supply chains to limit the tariffs’ effects on their\ncost of production. So the imposition of tariffs creates deadweight losses to the extent that the new\nsuppliers are not as efficient as the old ones sans the tariff. Firms in the Cleveland Federal Reserve\nDistrict have been citing the uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy as a concern for some time. That\n\n\f5\nconcern is growing, especially in light of the announcement of potential tariffs with Mexico, in addition to\na possible expansion of tariffs to more goods imported from China. Many of our firms tell us they have\nnot yet postponed their planned investment, but some firms say they are beginning to reassess those plans\nand others are holding off on acquiring financing for new projects because of the trade uncertainty. If\nmore firms begin to take a wait-and-see attitude, the uncertainty itself could dampen business spending\nfor some time to come. The effects could be amplified through adverse shifts in business, consumer, and\nfinancial market sentiment. On the other hand, a favorable outcome from trade talks could boost\nsentiment.\n\nDespite firms’ concerns about trade policy, labor market conditions have remained strong and consistent\nwith continued expansion. In May, payroll job growth slowed to about 75,000, but over the past three\nmonths, it has averaged about 150,000 jobs per month. This is a step down from last year’s strong pace\nof over 220,000 per month, but it is still well above trend, which most estimates put in a range of 75,000\nto 120,000 per month. In my baseline outlook, as output growth slows toward a more sustainable pace, I\nexpect job growth to slow toward trend as well, but to be strong enough to absorb those entering the labor\nforce, keeping the unemployment rate low and under 4 percent. The unemployment rate, which has been\nat or below 4 percent for over a year, is currently at 3.6 percent, its lowest level in nearly 50 years. The\nbroader measures of the unemployment rate that include discouraged workers and those working parttime who would prefer to work full-time are at the lowest levels of this business cycle. In my view, the\nunemployment rate is below the level that is sustainable over the longer run, but in recognition of the fact\nthat it has been very low for some time and inflation has remained subdued, I recently lowered my\nestimate of the longer-run unemployment rate. I had been estimating this rate to be about 4.5 percent; I\nnow put it between 4 and 4.5 percent. Even with this revision, labor markets are tight. This is the\nresounding theme we have heard from all of our contacts for some time, across a variety of occupations\nand sectors. And according to the most recent survey of small businesses conducted by the National\nFederation of Independent Business, a quarter of firms reported that the quality of labor was their single\n\n\f6\nmost important problem, matching the highest reported share since the survey began asking this question\nin 1974.\n\nThe strength in the labor market has led to a steady acceleration in labor compensation. Aggregate\nmeasures of compensation are now in the 3 percent range, after being quite subdued earlier in the\nexpansion. While this acceleration is not as strong as was seen in earlier expansions, the rise has been in\nline with productivity growth and inflation, and it has not added to inflationary pressures. Recent\nreadings indicate a pickup in productivity growth; if this is sustained, it would be a positive development\nfor wage growth going forward.\n\nBefore I turn to inflation, let me mention that the aggregate numbers on the labor market hide a lot of\nheterogeneity across locations and demographic groups. The Cleveland Fed recently held our biennial\nPolicy Summit where issues facing low- and moderate-income communities were discussed at length with\npractitioners, researchers, and policymakers.1 While more people have been brought into the labor force,\nincluding those from underrepresented groups, it should be recognized that not everyone has enjoyed the\nbenefits of the 10-year expansion of the U.S. economy. In certain communities there is limited access to\njobs because of gaps in the transportation system, a lack of affordable housing near the available jobs, and\nfew daycare options. Some people cannot afford the costs of training and education to advance in the job\nmarket, and are having to juggle multiple jobs to earn a living wage. These are not cyclical problems that\ncan be solved with monetary policy. Trying to do so would create other imbalances that ultimately\ndisproportionately harm the very people the policy was meant to help. But as our Policy Summit\ndiscussions revealed, well-designed government policies can be used to address these structural issues and\nhelp ensure that the aggregate longer-term gains from technological change and globalization are better\ndistributed so that everyone can have the opportunity to benefit from a vibrant economy.\n\n1\n\nMore information about the Cleveland Fed’s Policy Summit is available on our website at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/events/2019/policy-summit.aspx.\n\n\f7\nTurning to inflation, as I mentioned, despite the tightness in labor markets, inflation pressures have been\nmuted. The FOMC has set a goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Over the expansion, inflation\nhas gradually moved up, and last year, it was near our 2 percent goal. More recent readings of total PCE\nand core PCE inflation, which omits food and energy prices, have been soft, with year-over-year total\nPCE and core PCE inflation at 1.5 and 1.6 percent, respectively, in May. Total inflation was held down\nin part by declining energy prices, which will likely further weigh on inflation in the near term. Both total\nand core inflation readings also reflect some idiosyncratic, and likely transitory, declines in selected\ncomponents, including apparel and imputed prices of financial services. In the 1990s, the Cleveland Fed\npioneered measures of inflation that omitted components showing the most extreme price movements in\nany month to better gauge inflation trends.2 These indicators of underlying inflation trends have been\nmore stable and point to inflation gradually rising back to trend. The Cleveland Fed’s median and\ntrimmed mean CPI measures, which tend to run higher than PCE inflation, were 2.7 and 2.2 percent,\nrespectively, in May, in line with their levels for most of the year. The Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean PCE\ninflation measure has been running between 1.9 and 2 percent over the past year and currently is at 2\npercent.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics because they help to guide\nprice- and wage-setting decisions. While expectations have been relatively stable, there was a softening\nin the latest readings of the University of Michigan and New York Fed survey measures of longer-term\ninflation expectations, while the Cleveland Fed’s 5-year/5-year-forward measure, which combines survey\nreadings with market-based readings, was little changed in June. We have seen mixed data on inflation\nand inflation expectations at other points over the expansion. But the recent declines bear watching\n\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research aims to further the understanding of inflation among\npolicymakers, researchers, and the public by providing data, forecasts, analysis, and research. The center’s website\nis https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n\n\f8\nbecause if inflation expectations become unanchored, it will be more difficult for inflation to be\nmaintained near our target.\n\nIn light of the data, I have revised down my inflation forecast for this year. I continue to think that the\nmost likely case is that inflation expectations will remain relatively well anchored and that this, coupled\nwith continued strength in labor markets and output growth near trend, will support a gradual, although\nslower, rise in inflation back to 2 percent over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, it is important to\nacknowledge that there are structural factors holding back inflation, including technological change and\nproduct innovation. These are nonmonetary factors, and they may be more powerful than I have\nassumed. If so, inflation could remain lower for longer than in my baseline forecast. On the other side,\nthere is also the possibility that tariffs could be passed along to customers, as some firms have told us\nthey are beginning to do. While this would be a one-time change in the level of prices, to the extent that it\nchanges inflation expectations, it could put upward pressure on inflation as well. Tightness in labor\nmarkets might also begin to put more pressure on wages and prices than we’ve yet seen.\n\nMonetary Policy\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking. So\nthe current uncertainty around the economic outlook poses some challenges for policymakers. At our\nrecent meeting, the FOMC maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.\nIn assessing whether monetary policy is well calibrated, I will be monitoring incoming economic and\nfinancial data and reports from District contacts to determine whether my positive baseline outlook – the\nsustainable-growth scenario – remains intact or whether the downside risks are coming to pass and a\nmaterial change in the outlook to the weak-growth scenario is underway. At the present time, I believe it\nis too soon to make that determination, and I prefer to gather more information before considering a\nchange in our monetary policy stance. If I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing\nactivity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of\n\n\f9\nlonger-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the\nweak-growth scenario. In this scenario, the economy’s short- to medium-term equilibrium interest rate\nwould be moving down, and our policy rate could need to move down with it in order to sustain the\nexpansion and foster achievement of our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nOn the other hand, throughout this expansion, the U.S. economy has proven itself resilient to a variety of\neconomic shocks, headwinds, and uncertainties. We have seen similar episodes of soft data and sentiment\nthat subsequently reversed. If that is the case this time, and the sustainable-growth scenario plays out,\nthere is still a question of how the Fed should react to the lower inflation readings we’ve seen in recent\nmonths. Some would argue that lowering the funds rate would be appropriate in an attempt to push up\ninflation expectations. However, if it is the case that nonmonetary structural factors are holding back\nmeasured inflation, thereby putting downward pressure on inflation expectations, rather than an aggregate\ndemand problem, it is not clear how effective this policy would be. Cutting rates at this juncture could\nreinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and\ncould encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be\ncounterproductive.\n\nThe current period shares some similarities with the period from 2014 to 2016, when the slowdown in\nglobal demand, the decline in oil prices, and the appreciation in the dollar caused a drop-off in investment\nand manufacturing activity at the same time inflation was well below target. The Fed was patient during\nthis period, with one rate increase in December 2015 and another in December 2016, allowing inflation to\ngradually move up. So long as the sustainable-growth scenario of continued expansion and strong labor\nmarkets remains the baseline outlook, I would favor taking a similar opportunistic approach to the recent\nsoftness in the inflation readings instead of trying to proactively move inflation up with rate cuts.3 This\n\n3\n\nLarry Meyer, while he was a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, described a strategy he termed “opportunistic\ndisinflation.”\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1996/19960908.htm)\n\n\f10\nwould mean maintaining a shallow policy path: keeping the funds rate at current levels for a while to\nsupport a gradual rise in inflation and not overreacting to shocks that might, for a time, move inflation\nsomewhat above 2 percent. The strategy would be consistent with keeping inflation within a reasonable\nrange around 2 percent. Given the current level of the funds rate, which is low but appears to be near\nneutral, and my current baseline outlook, I view this strategy as one that appropriately balances the risks\nto achieving our dual-mandate goals, avoiding a buildup in risks to macroeconomic stability, distortions\nin labor markets, or financial imbalances driven by low costs of borrowing.\n\nGiven the uncertainties around the outlook, it should not be surprising that views vary across the\nindividuals on the FOMC, even though we all share the same longer-run monetary policy goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. The economic projections released at our recent meeting show that\nin pursuit of our goals, some policymakers believe it will be appropriate to maintain the funds rate at\ncurrent levels this year, while others believe it will be appropriate to reduce rates. But the projections also\nindicate that conditional on appropriate policy, the Committee sees the economy managing through the\nuncertainties, with growth slowing toward trend, labor markets remaining strong, and inflation gradually\nmoving up to 2 percent over time. This would be a favorable outcome and one consistent with the\nresilience the U.S. economy has shown throughout this expansion.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks for “Strategies for Monetary Policy: A Policy Conference”\nThe Hoover Institution, Stanford University\nStanford, CA\nMay 3, 2019\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank John Taylor for inviting me to participate in this conference. It’s a real pleasure to be on a panel\nmoderated by Charles Plosser, whom I worked with at the Philly Fed. Although I learned a lot from\nCharles, the views I’ll present are my own and are not necessarily shared by my fellow panelists, other\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe FOMC currently uses what has been called a flexible inflation-targeting framework to set monetary\npolicy. It is briefly described in the FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy\nstrategy. 1 In my view, this framework has served the FOMC well in effectively promoting our policy\ngoals. A milestone was reached in January 2012 when the U.S. adopted an explicit numerical inflation\ngoal. I am certain that Charles remembers very well the careful analysis and discussions that helped the\nFOMC reach a consensus on the explicit 2 percent goal and the statement that describes the FOMC’s\napproach to setting policy to promote its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment.\n\nThe FOMC is currently reviewing its policy framework. I am very supportive of this initiative. As a\nmatter of good governance, a central bank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and\nmodels, and to inform its evaluation, it should seek a wide range of perspectives, including those from\nexperts in academia, the private sector, and other central banks. Another motivation to undertake the\nreview now is that the post-crisis economic environment is expected to differ in some important ways\nfrom the pre-crisis world. Based on the aging of the population and the expected slowdown in population\ngrowth, higher demand for safe assets, and other factors, many economists anticipate that the longer-term\nequilibrium real interest rate will remain lower than in past decades. 2 In fact, empirical estimates of the\n\n1\n\nSee FOMC (2019).\n\n2\n\nSee Mester (2018a).\n\n\f2\nequilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are generally lower than in the\npast. 3 This means there is a higher chance that the policy rate will be constrained by the zero lower\nbound, and that nontraditional monetary policy tools will need to be used more often. To the extent that\nthese tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are otherwise constrained, the\npotential is for longer recessions and longer bouts of inflation well below target. 4 In addition, fiscal\npolicy’s ability to buffer against macroeconomic shocks is also likely to be constrained, given projected\nlarge fiscal deficits and high government debt-to-GDP ratios. 5 This raises the question of whether\nchanges to our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability in\nthis environment.\n\nA number of suggestions have been made for alternative monetary policy frameworks that potentially\noffer some benefits in a low-interest-rate environment. These include setting an inflation target that is\nhigher than 2 percent (an option not being considered by the FOMC in its framework review), using\nprice-level targeting or nominal GDP targeting instead of inflation targeting, targeting average inflation\nover the business cycle or some other time frame, or using what former Chair Ben Bernanke has called\ntemporary price-level targeting (which is essentially doing inflation targeting in normal times and pricelevel targeting once the policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound). An idea that has received\nsomewhat less attention is defining the inflation goal in terms of a range centered on 2 percent rather than\na point target. 6 Although these alternative frameworks have theoretical appeal, none of them is without\nimplementation challenges. For example, many of them work well in models of perfect credibility and\nFor FOMC projections, see FOMC (2014) and FOMC (2019). For a review of the literature on the equilibrium\ninterest rate, see Hamilton, et al. (2015).\n\n3\n\nOther government policies might also be brought to bear to increase the long-term growth rate and equilibrium\ninterest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Such policies would focus on increasing\nproductivity growth and labor force growth.\n4\n\n5\n\nSee Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell (2018).\n\n6\n\nFor further discussion of these monetary policy frameworks, see Mester (2018b) and Mester (2018c).\n\n\f3\ncommitment, where the public understands the framework and believes future Committees will follow\nthrough, and the Committee actually does follow through, implying that the Committee has control of\ninflation expectations. Whether these assumptions would hold in practice is an open question. One needs\nto ask whether it is credible for policymakers to commit to keep interest rates low to make up for past\nshortfalls of inflation from target even when demand is growing strongly or to act to bring inflation down\nin the face of a supply shock by tightening policy even in the face of weak demand. It is not clear what\nactually would happen to inflation expectations in these scenarios despite what is assumed in the models.\nSo the FOMC is going to have to evaluate the assumptions that drive the theoretical appeal of each\nframework and determine whether in practice the net benefits of any of the alternatives will outweigh\nthose of the flexible inflation-targeting framework, and if not, what, if any, enhancements should be made\nto our current framework.\n\nRegardless of the framework the FOMC ultimately decides on, the public’s expectations about future\nmonetary policy are an important part of the transmission mechanism of policy to the economy. This\nmeans effective communication will be an essential component of the framework. I believe there are\nways we can enhance our communications about our policy approach that would make any framework\nmore effective. Let me touch on three.\n\n(1) Clarify how monetary policy affects the economy and which aspects of the economy can be influenced\nby monetary policy and which aspects cannot.\nMonetary policy is more effective when the public’s and market participants’ policy expectations are\naligned with our policy decisions. Before this alignment can occur, the public needs to have a basic\nunderstanding of our monetary policy goals and what monetary policy can achieve and what it cannot.\nMy concern is that this understanding has diminished since the Great Recession. Regardless of the\nframework, the FOMC’s strategy document should articulate the relationship between monetary policy\nand our two policy goals of price stability and maximum employment. We should clarify that over the\n\n\f4\nlonger run, monetary policy can affect only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the\neconomy such as the long-run natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment. Although this\nconcept is touched on in our current monetary policy strategy document, I do not think that the public\nfully understands. Indeed, former Chair Janet Yellen had to explain in one of her post-FOMC meeting\npress conferences that in an earlier speech, she did not mean to imply that she favored running a highpressure economy as an experiment to affect longer-run growth and unemployment. 7\n\nI think we could do a better job of explaining how monetary policy promotes the economy’s growing at\npotential and operating at maximum employment. In particular, we tend to move our policy rate up when\nresource utilization tightens and down when resource utilization eases in order to bring our policy rate\ninto alignment with the economy’s natural rate of interest, which changes over the business cycle as the\neconomy adjusts to shocks. There doesn’t need to be an exploitable Phillips curve tradeoff between the\nunemployment rate and the inflation rate in order for policymakers to want to respond to changes in the\nunemployment rate, an indicator of resource utilization. 8 The response is not an attempt to actively use\nmonetary policy to affect the longer-run growth rate of the economy or the longer-run unemployment\nrate. A benefit of explaining things in this way makes it clear that the FOMC is not trying to rob the\neconomy of jobs when it raises interest rates. Another benefit is that it should allay concerns that because\nthe empirical Phillips curve has flattened, monetary policy has become anemic.\n\nImproving the public’s understanding of how monetary policy works and what it can achieve would help\nnot only in normal times but also in bad times. The Great Recession was an enormous negative shock,\nsome part of which was likely permanent or very persistent rather than transitory. Monetary policy\n\n7\n\nSee Yellen (2016), p. 9.\n\n8\n\nBrainard (2018) discusses the shorter-run neutral rate and longer-run equilibrium interest rate.\n\n\f5\nshould not have been expected to make up for that permanent loss. Fiscal policy should have taken on a\nlarger part of the burden.\n\n(2) Clarify how uncertainty is accounted for in monetary policymaking and incorporate this uncertainty\ninto monetary policy strategy to avoid giving a false sense of precision.\nAccording to Voltaire, “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.” In our\ncontext, this means it is important to convey that monetary policymakers have to deal with uncertainty in\nseveral forms. Monetary policy has to be forward looking because it affects the economy with a lag, but\nthe economy is buffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than\nanticipated. Moreover, our view of economic conditions in real time can be cloudy because the data\ncome in with a lag and many economic data are revised over time. In addition, there is model uncertainty.\n\nThe public needs to understand that given the lags and revisions in the data, incoming information can\nalter not only the policymaker’s view of the expected future evolution of the economy but also his or her\nunderstanding of current and past economic conditions. New information could alter the expected future\npath of policy and might even result in ex post regret of a recent action. Robert Hetzel says that\npolicymaking has a flavor of “guess and correct.” 9 It is a normal part of monetary policymaking that\npolicymakers will always be learning about whether their policy settings are the appropriate ones to\npromote their goals.\n\nThe public has to hold the FOMC accountable for its performance, but it should not hold monetary\npolicymakers to an unrealistic standard. The FOMC took an important step in communicating uncertainty\nwhen it began showing 70 percent uncertainty bands around the median projections of FOMC\nparticipants, but these are not emphasized. I think they deserve more attention and should be released at\n\n9\n\nSee Hetzel (2019).\n\n\f6\nthe time of the post-FOMC press conference. They are a good illustration of the reasonable amount of\ndeviation to expect between the projections and outcomes. Some have argued that the FOMC’s\nprojections of appropriate monetary policy, the so-called dot plot, should be dropped because actual\npolicy can differ from the projections. I think that would be a mistake. The dots can change over time\nbecause of economic developments, but that’s a design feature, not a flaw. Omitting the dot plot would\nnot eliminate the uncertainty around the projections, the divergence in views across FOMC participants,\nor the fact that policymaking always entails learning and recalibration, but it would be a significant step\nback in transparency.\n\nWe need to recognize uncertainty in our broader monetary policy strategy as well. Consider the FOMC’s\ninflation target. After much deliberation, the Committee chose a point target instead of a range and a total\ninflation measure rather than a core measure. While there were arguments on both sides, the Committee\nwas persuaded that a point target would better anchor inflation expectations. Implicit in the choice was\nthat the Committee would tolerate small deviations from target given the precision with which we can\nmeasure inflation, the precision with which we can guide the economy, and the typical revisions to the\nPCE inflation measures, which tend to be revised up over time. 10 It is interesting to think through\nwhether our policy choices or communications since 2012 might have differed had the Committee opted\nfor a range rather than a point target, as some other central banks do, and for a core measure rather than a\ntotal measure of inflation. These data revisions and measurement issues, as well as potential difficulties\nin maintaining anchored inflation expectations during the periods of higher inflation meant to make up for\nperiods of lower inflation, and vice versa, would seem to be amplified in price-level targeting and\nnominal GDP targeting frameworks.\n\n10\nCroushore (forthcoming) finds that the average revision from initial release to first annual benchmark revision to\nfour-quarter PCE inflation over the period 1965Q3 to 2015Q4 was 0.10 percentage point and the average revision to\nfour-quarter core PCE inflation over the period 1995Q3 to 2015Q4 was 0.14 percentage point.\n\n\f7\n(3) Clarify our monetary policy strategy by taking a more systematic approach to our policy decisions\nand in how we communicate those decisions.\nHouseholds, businesses, and investors make economic and financial decisions based on their expectations\nof the future, including the future course of monetary policy, and the FOMC strives to avoid surprising\nthe public with its policy decisions. The communications challenge for the FOMC is to give the public a\ngood sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy evolves without implying\nthat policy is pre-committed to a particular policy path regardless of how the economy evolves.\nEssentially, the FOMC needs to convey the strategy it uses to determine its policy actions over time to\npromote achievement of its policy goals, i.e., its reaction function. And this will be true regardless of\nwhich monetary policy framework the FOMC ultimately adopts. Ironically, the FOMC’s strategy\ndocument does not offer much in the way of strategy, and this can lead to a misunderstanding that our\npolicy decisions are discretionary. The term “data-dependent” has been used to explain the FOMC’s\npolicymaking strategy, but this term could be potentially misinterpreted as suggesting that policy will\nreact to every short-run change in the data rather than the accumulation of changes that affect the\nmedium-run outlook.\n\nA more systematic approach to setting monetary policy can better align the public’s policy expectations\nwith policy decisions and help to reduce some of the uncertainty around how we conduct monetary\npolicy. It can help insulate monetary policy from short-run political considerations, and it can also offer\nmore policy continuity over time as Committee members change. In a time of rising public skepticism\nabout “experts,” which can undermine public trust in institutions, being systematic will help the public\nunderstand how our decisions are actually made, which can enhance the Fed’s credibility.\n\nThe question is how to ensure that we are setting policy systematically and how to convey this to the\npublic. I have three suggestions. First, while judgment will likely always be a part of policymaking,\nsimple monetary policy rules can play a more prominent role in our policy deliberations and\n\n\f8\ncommunications. 11 The FOMC has been reluctant to relinquish policymaking to following a simple rule,\nbecause no one rule works well enough across a variety of economic models and circumstances. But the\nBoard of Governors has begun to include a discussion of rules as benchmarks in the monetary policy\nreport, 12 and frameworks that try to build in some commitments and constraints on future policy actions,\nsuch as price-level targeting, average inflation targeting, and nominal GDP targeting, are being discussed.\nThis suggests that systematic policymaking is garnering more support. As a first step, selecting a few\nbenchmark rules that have been shown to yield good economic outcomes and using these as reference\npoints to aid policy discussions and communicating why our policy may or may not differ from the rules’\npolicy descriptions could go some way in ensuring that our decisions are derived in a systematic way and\ncould help us explain our own policy reaction function to the public.\n\nA second suggestion is to enhance our own FOMC projections by asking the participants to provide a set\nof economic projections conditioned on a common policy path, in addition to the current projections,\nwhich are conditioned on each individual participant’s view of appropriate policy. This common path\nmight come from a policy rule. This would be a step toward achieving a coherent consensus FOMC\nforecast, which has been a challenge but which could serve as the benchmark for understanding the\nFOMC’s policy actions and post-meeting statements, a recommendation I have made in the past. 13\n\nMy third suggestion to help communicate systematic policymaking is to make our post-meeting FOMC\nstatement consistent from meeting to meeting and less focused on short-term changes in the data released\nbetween FOMC meetings and more focused on the medium-run outlook and a consistent set of indicators\nThe Cleveland Fed provides updates for a set of monetary policy rules and their outcomes across several forecasts\non the Cleveland Fed’s website, and the Federal Reserve Board’s Monetary Policy Report now includes a section on\npolicy rules. See Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (March 22, 2019).\n11\n\n12\n\nSee Board of Governors (2019), pp. 36-39.\n\n13\nSee Mester (2016). Hetzel (2019) also proposes a method to determine an FOMC consensus forecast that would\nentail the Committee’s agreeing to its preferred reaction function at the start of each year, and then using an iterative\nprocess among FOMC members based on that rule and the Board staff’s economic model.\n\n\f9\non inflation, inflation expectations, the unemployment rate, employment growth, output growth, and\nfinancial conditions. Each statement could provide the rationale for the policy decision in terms of how\naccumulated changes in this consistent set of economic and financial conditions have or have not\ninfluenced the Committee’s assessment of the factors relevant for policy, i.e., the arguments in our\nreaction function. The statement would also consistently articulate the Committee’s assessment of risks\nto the outlook and other considerations that the Committee is taking into account in determining current\nand future policy. This assessment would be informed by the analysis of alternative forecast scenarios,\nwhich are discussed at each FOMC meeting. If we provided more consistency about the conditions we\nsystematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy, the public and market participants would get a\nbetter sense of the FOMC’s reaction function over time and their policy expectations would better align\nwith those of policymakers.\n\nI note that all of the suggestions I have made today are relevant regardless of the framework the FOMC\nultimately decides to use for setting monetary policy.\n\n\f10\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Monetary Policy Report,” February 22, 2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20190222_mprfullreport.pdf)\nBrainard, Lael, “What Do We Mean by Neutral and What Role Does It Play in Monetary Policy?”\nRemarks at the Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, MI, September 12, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180912a.htm)\nCroushore, Dean, “Revisions to PCE Inflation Measures: Implications for Monetary Policy,”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking (forthcoming).\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” update of March 22, 2019.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 18-19, 2014,” April 2014.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20140319.pdf)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 19-20, 2019,” April 2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20190320.pdf)\nFOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” January 29, 2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\nHamilton, James D., Ethan S.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2019 Ohio Bankers Day\nOhio Division of Financial Institutions\nColumbus, OH\nApril 4, 2019\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions for inviting me to be a part of the 2019 Ohio Bankers\nDay. Bankers have a unique perspective from which to gather information on the health of the economy.\nI appreciate the insights I gain from speaking with bankers throughout the Cleveland Fed’s District,\nincluding those who serve on our Board of Directors and our Community Depository Institutions\nAdvisory Council, and I am looking forward to hearing your questions and comments after my prepared\nremarks.\n\nI do not need to tell this audience that banking plays an important role in supporting a strong economy.\nThe credit, savings, and payment services banks provide help to foster economic growth. In offering\nthese financial services, banks have to take on risk, and managing that risk is essential to ensuring that the\nfinancial system remains resilient. The financial crisis painfully demonstrated the high costs imposed on\nhouseholds, businesses, and banks – indeed, the entire economy – when the financial system is impaired.\n\nMuch progress has been made since those dark days. Regulatory changes and the steps bankers\nthemselves have taken to shore up their risk management practices have led to a stronger and safer\nbanking system. The banking system is better capitalized, institutions are in a stronger liquidity position,\nthere is an effective regime for stress testing, and the ability to resolve the largest institutions when they\nfalter has been improved. Regulators are now in the process of tailoring the regulatory regime so that the\nstrictest requirements are imposed on those institutions that pose the largest risks and the regime can\ncontinue to support financial system resiliency.\n\nEven though progress has been made, we should never forget that the financial system is constantly\nevolving and there will always be new risks on the horizon to assess and manage. Perhaps the most\ndynamic risks are those related to cybersecurity, which I will focus on for the majority of my talk. But\nbefore that, I would like to spend a few minutes on the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the\n\n\f2\nviews I will present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Economy and Monetary Policy\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy goals, which are mandated by Congress, are price stability and\nmaximum employment. Currently, with respect to these goals, the overall economy is doing well: labor\nmarkets are strong and underlying inflation is consistent with our 2 percent goal. But recent data have\nbeen mixed and indicate that growth softened in the first quarter compared to last year’s 3 percent pace.\nIn my view, the most likely case is that this weakness will be temporary and that growth for the year will\nbe at or slightly above my estimate of 2 percent trend growth, that labor markets will continue to be\nstrong, and that inflation will stay near 2 percent, aside from the transitory effects of changes in energy\nprices and the usual volatility in the monthly data.\n\nOn the positive side, incomes continue to grow, reflecting the strength of the labor market, and recent\nreadings indicate that labor productivity is rising after being quite low over the past five years. In\naddition, the tightening in financial conditions in the fourth quarter of last year has mostly reversed, and\nbusiness, consumer, and investor sentiment have improved since the start of the year. The postponement\nof additional tariffs that were set to be imposed on imports from China has reduced some uncertainty and\nhas given firms more time to reorient their supply chains. A resolution of uncertainty around trade policy\ncould encourage further investment spending. Our District contacts across a number of sectors report that\nbusiness is good and has picked up after slowing at the end of last year. On the down side, continued\nuncertainty over trade policy could weigh on investment spending; growth abroad, including in Europe\nand China, is slowing; and the outcome of Brexit is unclear. In addition, corporate debt is at very high\nlevels; underwriting standards on leveraged loans have been weakening for some time, with a larger share\nof these loans going to less creditworthy borrowers; and commercial real estate valuations remain lofty.\nThese factors have the potential to amplify an economic downturn, were one to occur.\n\n\f3\nAt its March meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC elected not to make any change in its policy rate, the\nfederal funds rate, and I supported that decision. The current target range for the federal funds rate is\n2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, which is at the bottom of the range of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longerrun neutral rate, a level that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with maximum\nemployment and price stability. Given the current level of interest rates, and little sign that inflation is\npoised to rise appreciably despite the strength in labor markets, I see no urgency to change our policy\nstance. In my view, monetary policy does not appear to be far behind or far ahead of the curve. Before\ndetermining any further adjustments in the policy rate, we can take the opportunity to continue to gather\ninformation, see how the economy is evolving, and assess our medium-run economic forecast and the\nrisks to that forecast. Could we be done with policy rate increases this cycle? It is possible, but if the\neconomy performs along the lines I think is the most likely case – with growth picking back up to, or\nslightly above, trend, labor markets remaining strong, and inflation staying near 2 percent – the fed funds\nrate may need to move a bit higher than current levels. As we continue to assess the outlook, I believe\nthat the economy is going to give us a good sense of whether policy is where it needs to be or whether\nfurther action is needed.\n\nAt its March meeting, the FOMC also released further information regarding our plans for normalizing\nthe Fed’s balance sheet. Our intention is to hold no more assets than the amount necessary to implement\nmonetary policy effectively and efficiently within an abundant reserves framework. The Fed’s balance\nsheet grew as a result of actions we took to address the financial crisis and Great Recession. Once we had\nmoved our policy rate down to essentially zero, to add further monetary accommodation, we began\npurchasing agency mortgage-backed securities, agency debt, and longer-term Treasury securities in order\nto put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. The assets on the Fed’s balance sheet swelled, and\nbank reserves, one of the liabilities on our balance sheet, rose substantially. Since October 2017, the Fed\nhas been letting these longer-term assets gradually roll off our balance sheet, and bank reserves are now\ndown considerably from their peak level. We will be slowing the asset runoff in May and will cease the\n\n\f4\nrunoff at the end of September. At that point, the average level of reserves will still likely be somewhat\nabove the level needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. So we anticipate\nkeeping the amount of assets on our balance sheet roughly constant for a time, and as currency and other\nnon-reserves liabilities continue to gradually rise, reserves will gradually fall. Once the FOMC decides\nthat reserves have declined to the necessary level, assets will begin to rise again to keep pace with the\ntrend growth in demand for our non-reserves liabilities and to maintain the appropriate level of reserves in\nthe system. 1 In terms of the composition of the Fed’s balance-sheet assets, the FOMC plans to return to\nholding mainly Treasury securities and will be making decisions on how best to make that transition at\nupcoming meetings.\n\nThat is a brief summary of my views on the economy and monetary policy. Now let me turn to\ncybersecurity.\n\nCybersecurity Is an Important Part of Financial Stability\nIt would be difficult to determine the level of safety and soundness of an individual bank or of the\nfinancial system overall without paying attention to the risks to cybersecurity. While much progress has\nbeen made to address more typical banking risks, including credit, liquidity, and operational risks, cyber\nrisks are expanding. As businesses have become more reliant on technology, efforts to disrupt an\ninstitution’s operations; to steal, corrupt, or destroy data and intellectual property; or to divert funds have\nbecome more prevalent. Although it is hard to come up with firm numbers, the U.S. Council of\nEconomic Advisers has estimated that malicious cyber activity cost the U.S. economy between\n$57 billion and $109 billion in 2016, and other estimates suggest those costs are rising. 2 Firms are\nspending significant amounts on their cybersecurity, with one estimate at nearly $124 billion globally in\n\n1\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2019).\n\n2\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers (2018) and Kashyap and Wetherilt (2018).\n\n\f5\n2019. 3 While all businesses face cyber risks, given the critical role the financial sector plays in the\noverall health of the U.S. and global economy, the stakes are particularly high in the financial services\nindustry.\n\nCyber risks could be viewed as a form of operational risk, but given the potential for the widespread\nimpact of cyber attacks on the financial sector, I think it pays to put cyber risks into a special category. 4\nOne reason is that cyber risks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber attacks have become more\nsystematic, maliciously targeting financial firms and playing out over time for maximum effect. So,\nincreasingly creative solutions must be found to address cyber risks. One example is Sheltered Harbor, an\nindustry initiative that provides participant financial institutions a way to store data independent of the\nbank’s own infrastructure. This can help make recovery quicker after an attack is detected. 5 But a further\ncomplication is that detection can be difficult; an institution may believe it has backed up its good data,\nbut those data may already have been compromised by malicious code that has infiltrated the institution’s\nsystem.\n\nInstead of being idiosyncratic and affecting only a few firms, as many operational risks are, cyber threats\nare more likely to be correlated across institutions because of the complex interconnections and\ndependencies among financial firms. This means cyber threats are more likely to have wider spread\nnegative impacts than a typical operational problem that might arise from a failed system or process.\nTrading platforms, settlement and payments systems, and central securities depositories are all critical\ninfrastructures on which financial firms depend, and if these systems go down, there are few substitutes.\nIn addition, the advent of new technologies like cloud computing creates another concentrated risk, as\nthere are only a handful of third-party providers of these services.\n3\n\nSee Kashyap and Wetherilt (2018).\n\nKashyap and Wetherilt (2018) and Healey, et al. (2018) discuss how cybersecurity differs from other types of\noperational risks in the financial sector.\n\n4\n\n5\n\nSee shelteredharbor.org for further information.\n\n\f6\n\nAs much as individual firms are investing in cybersecurity – and it is a lot – as a nation and globally, we\nare likely underinvesting. This is because cybersecurity is a public good: the overall financial system\nconveys benefits to us all. Individual institutions certainly have incentives to invest in their own\ncybersecurity, and banks have been making major investments to monitor and protect their systems\nagainst attack. But the social benefit conveyed by a well-functioning and resilient financial system, one\nin which the public can continue to have a lot of confidence, likely requires a higher level of investment\nin cybersecurity than what individual firms would decide to do on their own, as they consider the tradeoff\nbetween the risk of loss to their firm from a cyber attack versus the cost of that investment. In addition, to\nthe extent that individual firms are relying on shared services, in considering how much to invest in their\nown cybersecurity, they should be entertaining the possibility that those shared services could be heavily\ntaxed in the event other firms are attacked at the same time they are 6 or that the shared service itself could\nbe the entry point for a system-wide attack. These types of externalities may not be part of any one firm’s\ninvestment decision. Moreover, an individual firm may rely on others in the shared network to make\ninvestments that make the network more secure, but if every firm thinks this way, there will be\nunderinvestment in security. 7\n\nCybersecurity and the Fed\nThe public good aspect of cybersecurity and the Federal Reserve’s role in ensuring the resiliency of the\nfinancial system mean that cybersecurity is a high priority for the Fed. The Fed’s approach builds on\ntechniques that we have successfully applied to other forms of financial system oversight, namely,\ndeveloping clear and consistent standards for assessing financial institutions’ preparedness; establishing\ncorporate governance best practices with respect to cybersecurity; acquiring and deploying Fed staff with\n\n6\n\nSee Kashyap and Wetherilt (2018).\n\nSablik (2017) discusses the underinvestment problem. See, also, the Council of Economic Advisers (2018). The\nU.S. Department of the Treasury (2013) outlines the role government incentives can play in driving private-sector\nactions to strengthen defenses against cyber threats.\n\n7\n\n\f7\nthe necessary technical skills to assess risk-management practices; and encouraging and creating avenues\nfor information sharing among financial institutions and regulators.\n\nWhile much of the Fed’s cybersecurity effort focuses on the nation’s largest, most complex banking\norganizations, we have raised the expectations of cyber preparedness for all of the institutions we\nsupervise, including regional and community banks. In fact, since 2015, the Cleveland Fed has been coleading the Federal Reserve System’s annual national horizontal review of cybersecurity for banks with\nassets between $100 billion and $500 billion. Fed examiners assess a bank’s cybersecurity along a\nnumber of dimensions. Effective cybersecurity requires effective cyber-risk governance, including\nleadership’s engagement in oversight of the firm’s cybersecurity programs. The bank needs to have\neffective programs for identifying risks and vulnerabilities, including those within its own technology\ninfrastructure, those associated with vendors and third-party technology providers, and those posed by\nnew products. The bank is also assessed on its ability to monitor and manage those risks. This includes\nbasics such as adequate technology inventories and timely software patching to more complex processes\nfor incident response and plans for timely recovery and restoration of critical functions.\n\nThe Fed continues to work with other U.S. financial regulatory agencies and international authorities to\nharmonize cyber risk-management standards and regulatory expectations. We are looking for ways to\ncoordinate cyber-risk supervisory activities for institutions subject to oversight from multiple regulators.\nThe Fed is also aligning what it expects of banks in terms of identifying, protecting, detecting, responding\nto, and recovering from cyber attacks with the best-practice standards in the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology’s (NIST) cybersecurity framework. 8\n\nGiven the systemic nature of cyber risks and the potential for widespread disruption, collaboration\nbetween the regulators, government, financial institutions, and other private-sector firms is a crucial\n8\n\nSee Quarles (2018)\n\n\f8\ningredient for improving our cybersecurity. One form of this collaboration is tabletop exercises, which\ncan improve the readiness of the industry and government to respond to a cyber incident. The Fed\nparticipates in the Hamilton Series of tabletop exercises, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS–ISAC), an important\nbanking industry forum that promotes collaboration on critical security threats. These exercises are\nintended to improve public- and private-sector management of cyber risks. Participants have told us that\nthey value these exercises because they promote consistent approaches and best practices in event\nresponse and recovery, and foster relationships with key regulatory officials.\n\nFurther development and use of stress testing to assess the financial system’s resilience to cyber risks\nwould be helpful. Just as horizontal stress testing has proven to be a useful tool in assessing the overall\nresilience of the financial system to credit and liquidity risks, stress testing could be used to assess how\nprepared individual firms and the overall system are to respond to and recover from a systemic cyber\nevent such as the shutdown of a major clearing or settlement bank. Such a test could help evaluate firms’\nplans for data and core systems recovery and their reliance on third parties to implement that plan. The\nBank of England is applying these stress-testing techniques to evaluate whether financial firms are able to\nresume services within the tolerance set by the Bank of England in the face of a system-wide attack or\ndata corruption that affects multiple firms and their service providers.9\n\nBecause cyber threats are not restricted by national borders, cross-border collaboration is also being\npursued. For example, in November 2015, the U.S. and U.K. governments conducted a joint exercise\nwith leading global financial firms to determine how the two governments would perform in the event of\na large cyber attack on the financial systems in both countries. 10 The Fed participated in the exercise,\nwhich evaluated incident-response handling and recovery, coordination, public communication, and\n\n9\n\nSee Kashyap and Wetherilt (2018).\n\n10\n\nSee U.S. Department of the Treasury (2015).\n\n\f9\ninformation handling.\nIndeed, information sharing is another critical ingredient for improving our cybersecurity. Without firms’\nwillingness to share information on cyber incidents, it is much harder to develop metrics to evaluate cyber\nresilience, to assess whether threat levels are rising or beginning to propagate through the financial\nsystem, and to determine whether the practices firms have in place actually are working to mitigate the\nrisks. The Fed has been working with FS-ISAC to promote information sharing, and the Cleveland Fed is\nplaying a national role in the collection of threat information. The Fed’s Cybersecurity Analytic Support\nTeam (CAST) was created in 2015 and is based at the Cleveland Fed. This team tracks the latest\ncybersecurity developments across the financial sector in critical payment, clearing, and settlement\nsystems, allowing it to gain a wide perspective on potential threats to the overall financial system and to\nbetter calibrate threat severity and impact. As its name implies, CAST casts a wide net in collecting this\ninformation and collaborates with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, other bank regulatory agencies,\nand the FBI. In addition to Federal Reserve System-level activities, the Cleveland Fed staff is also\nsharing its expertise on cybersecurity topics at industry and regulatory forums, and last year, the staff\norganized a regional conference on managing cyber risks from the C-suite, which some of you attended. 11\n\nFinally, the Federal Reserve is a provider of both wholesale and retail payment services to the public and\nthe U.S. government. We need to maintain the public’s trust and confidence in our ability to deliver those\nservices, so we are highly engaged in work to enhance the resiliency of our own systems, applications,\nand data against cybersecurity risks. We continue to be pro-active in looking for emerging threats and\ntesting our systems and processes for vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is only a brief summary of the work that is being done at the Federal Reserve, in partnership with\nother financial regulators, government agencies, and financial institutions, to help address the cyber risks\n11\nMore information on the Cleveland Fed’s work on cybersecurity is available on our website at clevelandfed.org.\nSee, for example, Stone (2018), which discusses key cybersecurity risks and implications for the financial sector and\nconsumers.\n\n\f10\nto our financial system. The work includes enhancing systems for detecting and monitoring cyber risks,\nas well as improving our collective ability to respond to and recover from an attack. The landscape is\nvery dynamic. New cyber risks are emerging; they are becoming more sophisticated and complex. Given\nthe importance of the financial system to our economic health, it is incumbent on us all to continue to\nwork together with some urgency so that we are better prepared for cyber threats to our financial stability.\n\n\f11\nReferences\nCouncil of Economic Advisers, “The Cost of Malicious Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy,” February\n2018.\n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-Cost-of-Malicious-Cyber-Activity-to-theU.S.-Economy.pdf)\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), “Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans,” March\n20, 2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm)\nHealey, Jason, Patricia Mosser, Katheryn Rosen, and Adriana Tache, “The Future of Financial Stability\nand Cyber Risk,” The Brookings Institution Cybersecurity Project, October 2018.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-future-of-financial-stability-and-cyber-risk/)\nKashyap, Anil K., and Anne Wetherilt, “Some Principles for Regulating Cyber Risk,” Centre for\nEconomic Policy Research (CEPR) Discussion Paper No. DP 13324, November 17, 2018, and American\nEconomic Review Papers and Proceedings, forthcoming.\n(http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/papers/Some_Principles_for_Regulating_Cyber_\nRisk.pdf)\nQuarles, Randal K., “Brief Thoughts on the Financial Regulatory System and Cybersecurity,” at the\nFinancial Services Roundtable 2018 Spring Conference, Washington, D.C, February 26, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20180226b.htm)\nSablik, Tim, “Cyberattacks and the Digital Dilemma,” Econ Focus, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,\nThird Quarter 2017.\n(https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2017/q3/\ncover_story.pdf)\nStone, Sydney, “The Threats, the Criminals, the Motives – Cybersecurity at the Fed,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, November 26, 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/multimedia-storytelling/cybersecurity.aspx)\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, “Treasury Department Report to the President on Cybersecurity\nIncentives Pursuant to Executive Order 13636,” 2013.\n(https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/Documents/Supporting%20Analysis%20Treasury%20Report\n%20to%20the%20President%20on%20Cybersecurity%20Incentives_FINAL.pdf)\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, “Joint Statement from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Her\nMajesty’s Treasury,” November 12, 2015.\n(https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/jl0262.aspx)\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSecond Annual Women in Economics Symposium\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, MO\nFebruary 28, 2019\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for inviting me to speak at the second\nannual symposium on women in economics. The St. Louis Fed has been a leader within the Federal\nReserve System in focusing attention on attracting and retaining the talents of women in the economics\nprofession. The Bank’s series of podcasts with women in the field and this symposium have highlighted\nthe challenges women face but also their successes. I believe that increasing awareness of what can be\naccomplished if one pursues an economics degree – that is, explaining “the value proposition” as they say\nin business – can play an important role in attracting people to the field of economics. I also believe we\nshould not assume that people, even those in the profession, realize how significant the differences in\noutcomes for males and females in the profession are. So it is important to document and publicize the\nevidence that women and minorities are under-represented in economics, and to provide information on\ninterventions that have been shown to help level the playing field. Today’s symposium does an excellent\njob on these scores. Thanks to the work of the St. Louis Fed and others, the Federal Reserve System is\naware of where it stands in terms of diversity, it has a better understanding of the value of promoting a\ndiverse culture, and the System is taking concrete steps to increase diversity, inclusion, and opportunity\nacross the institution. Of course, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nI am sure that many of you are expecting me to start my remarks with a brief anecdote of how, at some\npoint in my career, I was mistreated in some way because I am a woman. It is clear that this has\nhappened to others and it is wrong, but I’ve been very lucky. In fact, I came into economics quite by\naccident. I didn’t start out to be an economist. I majored in mathematics at Barnard College but also\npursued a second major in economics because it seemed interesting and didn’t require much additional\ncourse work. I applied to graduate school in math but ended up in the economics Ph.D. program at\nPrinceton because two professors there – male professors, I might add – wrote to me explaining that\nPrinceton’s economics program was very mathematical and encouraging me to come to Princeton and\nstudy economics. I’ve always thought that I lucked into economics. It has provided me with a fascinating\n\n\f2\ncareer, one that presents new questions to answer each day, and I hope that at least in a small way I’ve\nbeen able to provide some good in return through economic research and policymaking. Yet, economics\nas a field is not diverse.\n\nWhat Is the State of Diversity in Economics?\nEconomics is a popular major in U.S. colleges and universities, but the field has had less success in\nattracting women or historically under-represented racial and ethnic minorities. While there has been\nsome improvement compared to the 1970s, this under-representation has been going on for many years.\nWomen earn between 30 and 35 percent of the bachelor’s degrees in economics, and this share has been\nrelatively stable over the past two decades.1 It is higher than the female share of bachelor’s degrees in\nsome of the STEM fields, including computer sciences, and engineering and engineering technology, but\nlower than the female share of bachelor’s degrees conferred in the physical sciences and in mathematics\nand statistics. 2 Across all fields, women earn more than half of all bachelor’s degrees awarded. 3 This\nmeans women are choosing to major in economics at only a third of the rate of men. 4 The numbers are\nlower for under-represented minorities, who earn slightly more than 20 percent of bachelor’s degrees and\n\nLundberg (2018) discusses the American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of Women in the\nEconomics Profession (CSWEP) 2017 survey results of economics departments. At the 126 schools CSWEP polled\nthat have doctoral programs in economics, the female share of undergraduate seniors majoring in economics was\nabout 35 percent in 2017, and it has varied between 30 and 35 percent since 1998; of these schools, those with\nhigher ranked economics programs have a higher share of female undergraduate majors. Among the 113 schools\nwithout Ph.D. programs that responded to the CSWEP poll, the share was 35 percent in 2017, and has been\nrelatively stable at that level for the past 10 years. Using U.S. Department of Education data on four-year, nonprofit\ncolleges and universities over 2011-2015, Bayer and Wilcox (2017) find that women earned less than a third of the\nbachelor’s degrees in economics.\n1\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated\nPostsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), in the academic year 2016-2017, women earned 19.1 percent of the\nbachelor’s degrees conferred in computer and information sciences, 20.3 percent of the bachelor’s degrees conferred\nin engineering and engineering technology, 39.7 percent of the bachelor’s degrees conferred in the physical\nsciences, and 41.8 percent of the bachelor’s degrees conferred in mathematics and statistics. Author’s calculations\nbased on Tables 322.10 and 322.50 in the IPEDS. For trends by field, see Tables 325.35, 325.45, 325.70, and\n325.65 in the IPEDS.\n2\n\nWomen earned 57.3 percent of bachelor’s degrees conferred in the academic year 2016-2017. Author’s\ncalculations based on Tables 322.10 and 322.50 in U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education\nStatistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n3\n\nAmong schools in the top 100 that offer both business and economics degrees, regardless of gender, students prefer\nthe business degree over economics, but women do so to a greater extent. See Goldin (2013, 2015a).\n\n4\n\n\f3\nslightly less than 12 percent of economics degrees awarded, meaning that minorities are choosing\neconomics over other majors at only about half the rate of white students.5\n\nIn the professorial ranks, there were large gains in female representation in economics in the 1970s and\n1980s, but since then, progress has slowed. Lundberg and Stearns (2019) examined the data available\nback to the 1970s on the Chairman’s Group of 43 economics departments, which are the highly ranked\ndepartments and which granted about two-thirds of U.S. economics Ph.D.s in the 1970s. Gender diversity\ndeclines as one moves up the academic ranks, but at these institutions, the female shares rose significantly\nacross the three ranks: the female share of full professors rose from 2 percent in 1972 to 6 percent in\n1993. Similarly, over the same period, the female share of associate professors in the Chairman’s Group\nof institutions rose from 4 percent to 11 percent, and the female share of assistant professors rose from 9\npercent to 21 percent. By 2017, the female share of full professors and associate professors had more\nthan doubled, up to more than 13 percent for full professors and 23 percent for associate professors. But\nat this group of schools, the female share of assistant professors peaked at 29 percent in 2009, and has\nfallen to 24 percent since then, meaning little net growth for more than two decades.\n\nThe American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession\n(CSWEP) does an annual survey of a broad group of economics departments, with data going back to the\n1990s. In 2017, CSWEP surveyed 126 doctoral departments and 125 nondoctoral departments, and\nreceived responses back from all the doctoral programs and 113 of the nondoctoral programs. 6 At the\ndepartments offering Ph.D.s in economics, the assistant professor share has not regressed since 2009 as it\n\n5\nBayer and Wilcox (2017), Table 1. Data are for four-year, not-for-profit colleges and universities in the U.S. for\nthe period 2011-2015.\n6\n\nSee Lundberg (2018).\n\n\f4\ndid in the Chairman’s group of schools, but it has not grown either. 7 And in the CSWEP sample, in 2017\nabout 32 percent of first-year Ph.D. students in economics were women and women accounted for about\nthe same share of those who earned Ph.D.s in economics in 2017. These shares have basically stayed\nbetween 30 and 35 percent over the past two decades. 8\n\nOur focus today is on women in the profession, but minorities are also under-represented in economics.\nAnalysis of minority representation in graduate economics is complicated a bit by the fact that almost 60\npercent of doctorates awarded in economics are awarded to nonpermanent resident students. Some of\nthese graduates return to their own countries, while others stay in the U.S. Restricting attention to U.S.\ncitizens and permanent residents, of the 468 economics doctorates awarded in 2017, only 34, that is, 7\npercent, were awarded to under-represented minorities: 15 were earned by African Americans, 18 by\nHispanics or Latinos, and 1 by an American Indian or Native Alaskan. 9 This is a lower percentage than\nearned Ph.D.s across the STEM fields, where under-represented minorities earned 11 percent of the\nPh.Ds. in 2017. 10 In the academic professorial ranks in economics, under-represented minorities make up\na little over 10 percent of assistant professors and about 7 percent of full professors.\n\nWe can certainly applaud the progress that has been made since the 1970s, but it is clear that there is more\nwork to be done. While you don’t need to have majored in economics to enter a Ph.D. program in\neconomics, it is a natural path. So the under-representation of women and minorities in economics at the\nundergraduate level factors into the under-representation of these groups at the graduate level and\nthroughout the ranks of academia. Unless the entry of women and minorities into graduate school picks\n7\n\nAccording to the CSWEP survey data, as of 2017, at programs that offer Ph.D.s in economics, 13.9 percent of full\nprofessors, 23.0 percent of associate professors, and 28.8 percent of assistant professors in economics were women.\nThe comparable numbers for schools without doctoral programs were higher: 24.1 percent of full professors, 39.3\npercent of associate professors, and 43.4 percent of assistant professors in economics were women. See Table 5,\nLundberg (2018).\n8\n\nSee Lundberg (2018).\n\nThese statistics are from the U.S. Department of Education IPEDS data as reported in Table 1 of the Committee on\nthe Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) (2018).\n\n9\n\n10\n\nSee Table 2, Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) (2018).\n\n\f5\nup, it is hard to see how the numbers of Ph.D.s in the ranks of academia and in nonacademic positions\nthat require a Ph.D. in economics can increase.\n\nA natural question to ask is: what fields are women choosing to go into, if not economics? The\nhumanities, including English, foreign languages, and visual arts, and nursing continue to attract women,\nas they have traditionally done. But women have been selecting other social sciences as well. Data from\nthe National Center for Education Statistics indicate that psychology is a relatively large major,\naccounting for about 6 percent of all bachelor’s degrees conferred in the 2016-2017 academic year, with\nabout 78 percent earned by women. 11 Business is a large major: almost 20 percent of bachelor’s degrees\nconferred were in business, with 47 percent of those earned by women. Women have also been selecting\nthe sciences. Biology accounts for about 6 percent of degrees conferred, with about 61 percent earned by\nwomen. At the Ph.D. level, the female shares in these fields are also relatively high. 12\n\nThe fact that women are attracted to other social sciences, some of the natural sciences, and business\nsuggests more progress can and should be made to attract women to economics.\n\nWhy Does It Matter?\nYou might ask: why should we care? Shouldn’t students be able to choose their field of study and career\npath? Something that interests them and in which they have a comparative advantage in succeeding? The\nlow level of diversity in economics may just reflect people’s preferences. That’s a possibility, but the fact\nthat the business major is attractive to women may suggest something else. And even if that’s the case,\nthen it is incumbent upon those of us in the field and upon educators to ensure that students can make\ninformed choices and that they understand the value of an economics degree to the individual and to\nAuthor’s calculations based on Tables 322.10 and 322.50 in U.S. Department of Education, National Center for\nEducation Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n11\n\n12\nAuthor’s calculations based on Tables 324.10 and 324.35 in U.S. Department of Education, National Center for\nEducation Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n\n\f6\nsociety. And it is imperative that we offer them the opportunity to perform on a level playing field and\neliminate barriers that women and minorities face when pursuing a career in economics.\n\nBut there is a bigger reason as well. Economics is a field that influences public policy, policy that affects\nall types of people. So it is important that we have diverse views informing that policy. I believe Fed\npolicymakers like me need to consider the effects of our monetary, regulatory, and payments policies on\nall our constituents. We are, after all, working on their behalf. That becomes easier to do when we have\na diverse staff. The Federal Reserve System employs about 700 Ph.D. economists and many others with\nbachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics. In order to maintain a diverse staff, it is important that\nmore women and minorities be attracted to the field.\n\nMoreover, I have seen firsthand how having a diversity of views expressed and discussed around the table\ncan actually lead to better policy decisions. Sometimes what seems to be a nonmainstream idea when\nfirst offered, in time, becomes the leading idea. There is research to back this up. Group dynamics are\ndifferent when teams are diverse. Participants don’t necessarily find it as comfortable to serve on a\ndiverse team, but the diversity helps to avoid everyone thinking in the same way. Diverse teams tend to\nbe more objective and to focus on the facts when making decisions; they may process information more\ncarefully because they are forced to confront a different way of thinking and convince those with\nalternative views; and firms with more diversity tend to be more innovative. 13 Research also shows that\nfirms with diverse management tend to have above-average earnings. 14 Perhaps the better decisionmaking and innovation associated with diversity is showing up on the bottom line.\n\n13\n\nSee Rock and Grant (2016).\n\nRock and Grant (2016) cite a Credit Suisse analysis of 2,400 companies worldwide that found that organizations\nwith at least one female board member had higher return on equity and higher net income growth than firms with no\nfemale board members. In addition, Hunt, Layton, and Prince (2015) report on a McKinsey & Company analysis of\n366 companies that found that those in the top quartile in terms of management’s ethnic and racial diversity were 35\npercent more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean, while those in the top quartile in terms of\nmanagement’s gender diversity were 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean.\n14\n\n\f7\nBeyond current policy and business outcomes, another reason I would like to see more diversity in the\nfield of economics is so the field itself doesn’t get stymied by group-think. To expand our knowledge,\neconomics needs to continually take on new research questions and develop innovative techniques and\nways of analysis to arrive at answers to these questions. Broader representation in economics means a\nbroader set of issues will be tackled and a broader set of research results disseminated. The field will\ncontinue to evolve, resulting in better policy outcomes that will improve the economic well being of a\ngreater share of the population.\n\nWhat Can Be Done to Increase Diversity in Economics?\nThe natural next question to ask is: what can we do to increase diversity in the field of economics? This\nis a complex problem, with no easy answers. The good news is that there is an increasing awareness of\nthe diversity problem, some programs have been developed to try to address the issue, and solid research\ndesign methods are being applied to evaluate potential interventions. 15 This research can help guide us,\nbut at this stage of the journey toward increased diversity, the approach likely has to be of the “let a\nthousand flowers bloom” variety: trying many things on several fronts, and then evaluating their effects.\nSo let me conclude my remarks with a few suggestions.\n\n(1) Convince those in charge there is a problem and get them involved in finding solutions.\nI start with the mindset described by the adage: don’t attribute to malice what is best explained by\nignorance. We need to convince more of those in charge that there is a problem. I applaud the work that\nhas been done in documenting the trends in diversity in the field of economics. Economics is a dataintensive field. Coupling the data with the research indicating diversity has positive returns should be\npersuasive to other economists. We cannot just convince the women in the field there’s an issue; we also\nneed to convince the men, who, as the numbers show, are in the majority and therefore have decision\nrights. This has to be done not only in universities but also at major employers, like the Fed, and at\n\n15\n\nBuckles (2019) discusses some of this research.\n\n\f8\nimportant institutions like the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\n\nThe good news is that this is already happening. The American Economic Association is taking a close\nlook at diversity in the economics profession and is offering programs and resources aimed at increasing\ndiversity at all levels. The Undergraduate Women in Economics (UWE) Challenge, funded by the\nAlfred P. Sloan Foundation, and run by Tatyana Avilova and Claudia Goldin, is a randomized controlled\ntrial that is offering grants to economics departments for efforts to increase the number of female majors.\nThe fact that the researchers received such positive interest suggests that many departments see increasing\ndiversity in economics as a worthy goal. 16 Diversity and inclusion have become a focus at the Fed, and\nalso at other major employers of economists like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank of\nEngland, and the European Central Bank (ECB). This symposium established by the St. Louis Fed is an\nexample of some of the work being undertaken at the Federal Reserve System. I am happy that the\nCleveland Fed will host this symposium next year.\n\nAnother reason we need to convince more men that this is an issue is that, for the time being, they make\nup the majority of the role models available for women economics students and for women in the\nprofession. The empirical evidence on role models is somewhat mixed. 17 One study of a selective liberal\narts college that essentially involved random assignment of students to instructors found that having an\ninstructor of the same gender didn’t increase the probability of a student taking more classes or majoring\nin the field, regardless of the gender distribution in the department, although it did have some effect on\n\n16\n\nGoldin (2015b) and Avilova and Goldin (2018).\n\n17\n\nGoldin (2013) and Griffith (2013).\n\n\f9\ngrading. 18 But these results do not suggest that mentoring itself is not helpful. The AEA’s mentoring\nworkshop, CeMENT, held after the annual winter meetings, in which participants present and receive\nfeedback on their research, does seem to have resulted in an increase in overall and top-tier publication\nrates and grant receipts. 19\n\nIn addition, we should not be requiring women to do all the mentoring of other women. This places an\nundue burden of service on them, which may disadvantage female professors as they seek advancement\nup the professorial ranks. We need to let female students know that the lack of available women does not\nmean a lack of role models.\n\n(2) Increase demand for an economics degree through increasing awareness.\nA second step is to increase the demand for an economics degree among women and minorities. The\nfinancial crisis and Great Recession led many, no doubt, to question the usefulness of the profession,\ndespite the fact that economists created many of the remedies. I believe those in the profession – both\nmale and female – need to do more to explain what economics is and the many ways it can be used to\nhelp society. Merriam-Webster defines economics as “a social science concerned chiefly with description\nand analysis of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.” Who wants to\nstudy that? I’d rather be working on robotics and autonomous vehicles, too. Others view economics as a\npath to working in finance or running a business, but that limited view may put off people who are more\nmotivated to help society. We need to embrace the fact that economics is a social science, one that helps\nus think about how people use scarce resources, interact in markets or in other economic settings, respond\nGriffith (2014). The study found that students earned a higher grade in fields dominated by the opposite gender\nwhen they had an instructor of the same gender. That is, female students received higher average grades from\nfemale instructors when taking courses in fields dominated by men (such as economics) – the difference was on the\norder of moving from a B-minus to a B. And there was a similar effect for males, who received higher average\ngrades from male instructors when taking courses in female-dominated fields (such as education). A separate study,\nCarrell, Page, and West (2010), in a different setting found evidence that such grade differentials reflected\nachievement differentials and not just inflated grading. So the availability of role models appears to positively affect\nstudent achievement, but a lack of role models isn’t the whole story about why some students choose not to continue\nin economics.\n18\n\n19\n\nBuckles (2019) and Blau, et al. (2010).\n\n\f10\nto incentives, and make trade-offs. The fact that economics involves people and their choices makes\neconomics complicated but also impactful to society and an interesting intellectual pursuit. Given the\npopularity of the psychology major among women, emphasizing the behavioral aspects of economics and\nits wide application could help to attract women to the field.\n\nIndeed, some of the interventions being examined in the UWE Challenge are intended to provide more\naccurate information on the breadth of application of economics and the career paths available to\neconomics majors. Preliminary results from a field experiment undertaken by Southern Methodist\nUniversity, a participant in the Challenge, suggest these types of informational interventions can\neffectively raise the number of women choosing to major in economics. 20 Another study found that firstyear college students at a Swiss university who were assigned to write a paper on economics were more\nlikely to major in economics, evidence that learning more about the field can attract students to it.\nHowever, the effect on choice of major was driven by male students; for females, the effect was not\nstatistically significant.\n\nWe likely need to start much earlier than college if we hope to attract more women and minorities to the\nfield. I serve on the board of the Council for Economic Education. This nonprofit organization’s mission\nis to educate students in kindergarten through high school about economics and personal finance so they\ncan make better decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities. In addition to providing\nmaterials to teachers, the council runs the National Economics Challenge, a quiz bowl competition that\nreaches a wide population of students in terms of gender, race, and income. A recent survey found that\nchallenge participants’ performance on advanced placement exams exceeds the national average, with\nespecially strong gains shown by female and minority students, and that participants are more likely than\nnonparticipants to choose to major in economics. 21 This suggests that exposure to economics at a younger\nage can help spur knowledge of and interest in the field.\n20\n\nAvilova and Goldin (2018).\n\n21\n\nFricke, Grogger, and Steinmayr (2018), as referenced in Buckles (2019).\n\n\f11\n(3) Ensure people have the opportunity to succeed once they choose economics and be cognizant of the\nfact that some policies have unintended consequences.\nEconomics is a quantitative field. The answer to getting more women to choose economics is not to make\nit less mathematical. Indeed, the argument that women may be turned off by the quantitative nature of the\nfield is not supported by the evidence. Recall that women earn over 40 percent of bachelor’s degrees in\nmath and statistics, a higher share than in economics.22 In addition, women do well in math at the high\nschool level; women are selecting other fields that are very quantitative, like psychology; and studies\nindicate that math aptitude doesn’t explain gender differences in participation in upper-level economics\ncourses. 23 Instead, it is important that students know early on that mathematics, statistics, and\neconometrics are necessary if they are to pursue an advanced degree. I was always struck by the fact that\nthe undergraduate economics curriculum seems very different from graduate-level economics. That’s\nlikely because economics is taken by many who do not plan to do graduate work in the field. In order to\nensure that students don’t learn too late what skills they need to enter graduate school, several universities\nhave interdisciplinary programs combining economics and mathematics so that students have the proper\nfoundation for advancing in the field.\n\nThe American Economic Association offers a summer training and scholarship program to help prepare\nstudents for graduate school and, with the National Science Foundation, a Summer Economics Fellows\nProgram, which is designed to increase the participation and advancement of women and underrepresented minorities in economics. The Cleveland Fed held the first workshop for research assistants\nacross the Federal Reserve System to give them a sense of what is required to get into and succeed in\ngraduate school. We will be holding our second workshop this summer.\n\nIn thinking about ways to spur more diverse participation, it is always good to remember a lesson from\nTable 325.65, U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary\nEducation Data System (IPEDS).\n22\n\n23\n\nSee Goldin (2013), and Bayer and Rouse (2016).\n\n\f12\neconomics: with any intervention there can be unintended consequences. For example, many universities\nhave enacted policies that allow assistant professors to extend their tenure clocks when they have\nchildren. In the interest of fairness, they have made these policies gender neutral. But at least one study\nfinds that the policies increase the probability that men get tenure in their first job but reduce the\nprobability that women get tenure, even when controlling for number of publications. 24 This leads me to\nmy last suggestion: the use of “nudges.”\n\n(4) Use nudges to change behavior.\nBehavioral economists use the term “nudge” for something that isn’t mandated but points people in the\nright direction and can change behavior. 25 We are all born with unconscious biases – we tend to relate\nbetter to people who are more like us. This presents a challenge to women and under-represented\nminorities trying to get ahead in the field, affecting recommendation letters, the probably of getting\npublished, and tenure decisions. 26 Making decision-makers aware of these biases has been shown to\naffect behavior in a positive way; so disseminating the research that shows that women are treated\ndifferently in the profession to those in the profession is useful.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the junior people in the economics profession to do the best work they can,\nwhich means learning all they can, seeking out opportunities to present their own research, and asking for\nadvice. It is the responsibility of the senior people in the profession to cultivate an inclusive environment\nso that all have the opportunity to reach their potential. Some people feel that the atmosphere in\neconomic seminars is too aggressive; others feel it helps generate better research. Rather than change the\nseminar culture, we should do what we can to make women feel comfortable in that setting. After all,\ncritique is part of research, and to be successful at publishing your work, one has to get used to it and\npersevere. As I learned in my German course, “Übung macht den Meister,” that is, “Practice makes\n24\n\nSee Antecol, Bedard, and Stearns (2018) and Lundberg and Stearns (2019).\n\n25\n\nSee Thaler (2017, 2018) and Sunstein (2014).\n\n26\n\nSee Lundberg and Stearns (2019) for a summary of some of the research.\n\n\f13\nperfect.” Practice seminars and study groups can help people become more comfortable sharing ideas and\nquestioning others. Senior members of the profession can help ensure that their study groups are more\ninclusive and they can draw out those reluctant to speak up. And in a meeting, when Sheila offers an idea\nthat is totally ignored until Bruce repeats it and is declared a genius, point out to the group that Sheila\nmade the same point earlier and ask her to elaborate. If you find yourself putting together a program\ncommittee to select papers for a conference, or organizing the conference or a seminar series, work hard\nto ensure there is diversity on the committee, on the program, and in the seminar series. This does take\nsome effort, but it can be done. If you are sponsoring a conference or seminar series, make diversity a top\npriority.\n\nFinally, you may have noticed the title of my talk and thought: “Perspectives of a brown-eyed economist?\nThat’s silly!” You’re right. But how many would have thought that if I had titled this “Perspectives of a\nwoman economist?” That seems more natural – but it shouldn’t. No one really wants to be known as a\nwoman economist, or a woman chef, or a woman banker. We don’t want to be qualified by our gender.\nWe are economists, chefs, and bankers who just happen to be women.\n\nIt is difficult to change institutions and cultures. But I am confident that with concerted efforts from both\nmen and women, economics will become more diversified and inclusive, which will strengthen economic\nresearch and policymaking and, in turn, help promote a healthier economy for a wider group of people. I\nlook forward to the time when the top women in the field are not considered top women economists, but\ninstead are viewed as unqualified successes.\nReferences\nAntecol, Heather, Kelly Bedard, and Jenna Stearns, “Equal but Inequitable: Who Benefits from GenderNeutral Tenure Clock Stopping Policies?” American Economic Review 108 (2018), pp. 2420-2441.\n(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160613)\nAvilova, Tatyana, and Claudia Goldin, “What Can UWE Do for Economics?” National Bureau of\nEconomic Research Working Paper 24189, January 2018.\n(http://www.nber.org/papers/w24189.pdf)\n\n\f14\nBayer, Amanda, and Cecilia Elena Rouse, “Diversity in the Economics Profession: A New Attack on an\nOld Problem,” Journal of Economic Perspectives 30 (Fall 2016), pp. 221-242.\n(https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.30.4.221)\nBayer, Amanda, and David Wilcox, “The Unequal Distribution of Economic Education: A Report on the\nRace, Ethnicity, and Gender of Economics Majors at US Colleges and Universities,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2017-105, Divisions of Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs, Federal\nReserve Board, Washington, D.C.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017105pap.pdf)\nBlau, Francine D., Janet M.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nUniversity of Kentucky Gatton College of Business and Economics\n2019 Economic Outlook Conference\nLexington, KY\nFebruary 13, 2019\n\nThe remarks on the national economy and monetary policy are the same as those delivered February 12,\n2019.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the University of Kentucky’s Gatton College of Business and Economics for inviting me to\nparticipate in the 2019 Economic Outlook Conference. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is\npleased to have a productive, ongoing relationship with the Gatton College, including co-sponsorship of\nannual workshops and seminars presented by Gatton faculty and Cleveland Fed researchers. I am\nespecially looking forward to hearing the other speakers’ take on the economy and the question and\nanswer portion of the program because as we navigate through the year, we will need to be particularly\nattuned to what is happening on the ground.\n\nAs many of you probably know, Lexington falls within the Cleveland Fed’s District, which includes the\nstate of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The Cleveland Fed is one of 12\nregional Reserve Banks distributed across the country that, along with the Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C., comprise the Federal Reserve System. This regional structure helps us to collect\ninformation from around the country so that our monetary policy decisions can take into account the\ndiversity of the American economy and its people. I am very grateful for the many contacts throughout\nour District who generously share with us their insights into business activity, labor markets, and financial\nconditions. This timely information is collected through our surveys and in meetings of our advisory\ncouncils and boards of directors. We have a business advisory council here in Lexington, and I would\nlike to thank Dr. Ken Troske for serving on the group. The information he and his colleagues provide is\nvery helpful to me as I formulate my economic outlook and monetary policy views, which I’ll speak\nabout today. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body\nwithin the Fed.\n\n\f2\nThe National Economic Outlook\nEconomic growth\nCongress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment. From\nthe standpoint of those goals, the U.S. economy is doing very well. The economy has been growing at an\nabove-trend pace for the past couple of years, with estimates suggesting that growth was a strong\n3 percent last year. Labor market conditions continue to be very strong, with above-trend job growth and\nvery low unemployment. And after several years of being below-target, inflation has moved up and has\nbeen relatively stable around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\n\nMy expectation is that the economy will maintain its good performance in 2019. In my view, the most\nlikely case is that we will see somewhat slower growth than we did last year, reflecting less of a boost\nfrom fiscal stimulus and less accommodative financial conditions. I expect growth to be at or slightly\nabove trend, in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range. Employment growth will also slow a bit, but it will remain\nstrong enough to absorb those entering the workforce, and I expect the unemployment rate to remain at or\nbelow 4 percent. As this transition toward a sustainable pace occurs, I expect inflation to remain near 2\npercent, with the usual transitory ups and downs.\n\nIf this outlook comes to pass, we will chalk up 2019 as another very good year for the economy. But the\npath to sustainability is rarely smooth, and uncertainty is clouding the outlook. The partial shutdown of\nthe federal government is a case in point. It caused significant hardships for the workers who weren’t\ngetting paid and for businesses that rely on the parts of the government that weren’t operating. In terms\nof the overall economy, we will see somewhat slower growth in the first quarter than we otherwise would,\nbut I expect that to be made up in the second quarter, as long as we avoid another shutdown. The\nshutdown came at a time when people were already feeling a bit uneasy. In the fourth quarter of last year,\ninvestor sentiment shifted and investors began putting significant weight on downside risks to the\nforecast. As a result, there was a sharp increase in volatility, a decline in equity prices, and an increase in\n\n\f3\nthe credit spread of corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields. It was a good reminder that the\neconomy is dynamic and can take unexpected turns. While we all have to look forward and make our\nbest assessment of how the economy is doing, we also have to be ready to change those views should the\nincoming information warrant it.\n\nSince the start of the year, conditions in financial markets have eased, although they remain tighter than\nthey were last fall. Surveys indicate that households and businesses are less confident about the economy\nthan they were, but so far, much of the incoming data are consistent with slower but still solid growth.\nHousehold incomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market and lower taxes. In the\naggregate, households have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making\nfor sound balance sheets. These factors have been supporting solid consumer spending, which is over\ntwo-thirds of output. Going forward, we will need to keep a close eye on whether household sentiment\nweakens so much that people postpone spending or whether they remain cautiously optimistic and\ncontinue to spend.\n\nThe housing market has slowed over the past year. Affordability is becoming an issue because the 30year mortgage rate has been trending up since mid-2016 and house price appreciation continues to exceed\nincome growth. Looking forward, the tax changes contain several provisions that affect homeownership,\nincluding the limits on deductions for mortgage interest and for state and local taxes, which includes\nproperty taxes. On the other hand, strong labor markets mean more people are now in the position to\nmake the commitment to purchase a home. On balance, I don’t expect housing to contribute much to\neconomic growth this year, but I don’t expect to see a sharp pullback in the sector either.\n\nBusiness spending was quite strong in the first half of last year, supported by strong earnings growth and\nchanges in tax policy that included lower corporate tax rates and full expensing of investment in\nequipment and intangibles. But business spending moderated in the second half of the year, as financial\n\n\f4\nconditions tightened and uncertainty over tariffs, trade policy, and growth abroad began to weigh on\nmanufacturers and other firms dependent on exports.\n\nSometimes I am asked why the Fed takes into account how other economies are doing when our monetary\npolicy goals pertain to the U.S. economy. The answer is because how economies in the rest of the world\nfare can spill over to the U.S. through trade and financial markets. Growth abroad, including China and\nEurope, is expected to slow this year, but there is some uncertainty around how much of a slowdown\nthere will be. The path and outcome of Brexit add further uncertainty, as does the outcome of trade and\ntariff negotiations. Indeed, some of the slowdown abroad is likely related to changes in and uncertainty\nover trade policy. So far, the majority of our business contacts continue to report that while their\nconcerns about trade policy and global growth are rising, their investment plans remain intact. But some\nlarger multinational firms have become more hesitant, and several manufacturing contacts have said that\nthe tariffs have been disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face\nincreasing costs of production. Should the slowdown in the economies of our major trading partners,\nincluding China and Germany, be sharper than expected or should the continued uncertainty persuade\nmore firms to take a wait-and-see attitude, U.S. growth may slow more than anticipated. Of course, a\nfavorable resolution to some of the uncertainty could buoy sentiment and lead to a pickup in investment\nand stronger than expected growth in the U.S.\n\nOverall, in my view the most likely outcome is that the economic expansion will continue this year, with\ngrowth moving down to a more sustainable pace, at or slightly above trend, but the risks around the\nforecast, including slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade policy, tighter financial conditions, and\nthe changes in business and consumer sentiment, bear watching.\n\nLabor markets\nThe strong economic growth we have experienced over the past few years has been accompanied by\n\n\f5\nstrong labor market conditions. Last year, the economy added more than 2.6 million jobs; that’s over\n220,000 jobs per month. In January, payrolls rose by more than 300,000 jobs. This is much stronger than\ntrend job growth, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The\nunemployment rate has been at or below 4.0 percent for almost a year, which is near the historical lows\nseen over the past 50 years. It seems unlikely that this low level can be maintained over the longer run.\nOur business and labor contacts, across a variety of industries, have been reporting to us for quite some\ntime that it is very difficult to find workers across all skill levels. Some firms have shifted from looking\nfor new hires to doing all they can to retain their current workers, including offering more flexible work\nschedules and raising wages. These anecdotal reports have shown through to the national statistics.\nAggregate measures of compensation are now in the 3 percent range, after being quite subdued earlier in\nthe expansion. This is a welcome increase. It gives workers more purchasing power, but because the\npickup has been in line with productivity growth and inflation, it has not added to inflationary pressures.\n\nInflation\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in\nthe price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Our goal is symmetric,\nmeaning that we don’t want to see inflation run either persistently above or persistently below this goal.\nWhen assessing where the economy is relative to our goal, monetary policymakers look through shortterm variations in the inflation measures and focus on the underlying medium- to long-term trends in\ninflation.\n\nAfter running below 2 percent for much of the expansion, inflation rates have firmed over the last several\nyears. Last year, higher energy prices boosted headline PCE inflation above 2 percent, and the recent\ndecline in energy prices will likely mean that inflation will move below 2 percent in the first part of the\nyear. But the core inflation measures, which exclude food and energy prices, show that underlying trend\ninflation is essentially at the Fed’s goal of 2 percent. The key to this good performance is that\n\n\f6\nexpectations about inflation over the medium to longer term have been stable. This has kept inflation\npressures at bay despite the tightness in labor markets, the strength of the economy, and reports from\nbusiness contacts that they have more pricing power now than they have had in many years. Going\nforward, with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy that maintain stable inflation expectations, my\noutlook is that inflation will remain near our symmetric 2 percent goal.\n\nBefore turning to monetary policy, let me say something about the regional economy.\n\nThe Regional Economy\nThe Lexington metropolitan area has shown some of the strongest economic performance in the\nCleveland Fed’s District, and this performance has been aided by strong longer-term fundamentals. For\nexample, from 1996 to 2008, the Lexington metro area saw a strong 20 percent increase in population,\nabout double that of the state of Kentucky, and stronger than the 16 percent pace seen for the U.S. as a\nwhole. This strong population growth was accompanied by solid job growth of 11 percent, somewhat\nhigher than what the state saw, though not quite as high as the national pace. 1 Lexington’s performance\ncompares very favorably to that of the Cleveland metro area, which lost about 3 percent of its population\nand more than 3 percent of its jobs over the same time period.\n\nSince the expansion began in June 2009, the relative economic performance of Lexington has remained\nsolid. Both population growth and job growth in the Lexington metro area have significantly outpaced\nthe nation’s. On net, payroll jobs are about 18 percent higher than they were when the expansion started.\nThe metro area’s unemployment rate peaked at 8.8 percent in the aftermath of the recession, well below\nthe 10 percent peak seen for the nation as a whole. Lexington’s unemployment rate is now down to 3.3\npercent, well below the nation’s 4 percent rate. The one place where Lexington has not kept pace with\n1\n\nFrom 1996 to 2008, payroll jobs grew by 14 percent in the U.S. and by about 10 percent in Kentucky.\n\n\f7\nthe nation is in real per capita income growth. It has been rising over the expansion, but only between a\nhalf and two-thirds of the national pace.\n\nResearch shows that regions that are resilient, that is, regions that have been able to avoid persistent\ndeclines in population over the long run, tend to have a more diverse industry mix and a more educated\npopulation. 2 Lexington scores well on both counts. Like many parts of the Cleveland Fed’s District,\nhistorically manufacturing has accounted for a relatively larger share of the Lexington metro area’s jobs\ncompared to the nation. That is still true, but over time, Lexington’s industry mix has become more\ndiversified. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented 16 percent of Lexington’s jobs; that share has now\nfallen to about 11 percent. 3 In addition to manufacturing, the mining and government sectors also\nrepresent a larger share of jobs in Lexington than they do at the national level. But over the expansion,\nthe region has been adding jobs in education, healthcare, and professional and business services.\n\nEducation is the key to helping ensure that a region’s population acquires the necessary skills for the jobs\navailable now and in the future. 4 In terms of education, the Lexington metro area compares quite\nfavorably with the nation, with a higher percentage of the population having earned a bachelor’s degree or\n\nJeffrey Lin, “Regional Resilience,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper No. 13-1, December 17,\n2012. (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2013/wp131.pdf?la=en)\n\n2\n\nIn the U.S., the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen from about 15 percent in the 1990s to about 8 percent\ntoday. The comparable declines in shares were from 20 percent to about 12 percent in Ohio and from 18 percent to\n13 percent in Kentucky.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, in our District, education levels were consistently one\nof the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth and that counties with higher levels of high\nschool graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.\nSee “Altered States: A Perspective on 75 Years of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005\nAnnual Report. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/annual-reports/ar-2005perspective-on-75-years-of-state-income-growth/ar-200502-altered-states-essay.aspx)\nand Mark Schweitzer and Peter Rupert, “Understanding the Persistence of Poverty,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland 2006 Annual Report.

Not all jobs will require a college degree. Cleveland Fed research\nindicates that compared to other parts of the country, Lexington has a somewhat higher share of so-called\n“opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay above-median wages but don’t require a bachelor’s\ndegree. 6 These types of jobs still require training, but it often takes less time and money to transition into\nthem. In addition to a skilled workforce, effective leadership and collaboration among businesses,\ngovernment, nonprofits, and individuals have helped areas navigate economic transitions driven by\ntechnological change and globalization. 7 Workforce development will need to remain an important focus\nof civic and business leaders in the region to ensure that Lexington will be able to extend its solid\neconomic performance into the future.\n\nNow that I have given you a sense of my outlook for the economy, let me conclude with some remarks on\nmonetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nSince December 2015, when the expansion was well underway, the FOMC has been gradually moving\nthe policy rate up from the extraordinarily low level that was needed to address the Great Recession.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nFinancial Executives International and the Williams College of Business, Xavier University\nCincinnati, OH\nFebruary 12, 2019\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Cincinnati chapter of Financial Executives International and the Williams College of Business\nat Xavier University for inviting me to speak this evening. This fall marks a milestone for Xavier\nUniversity: the 50th anniversary of the opening of the undergraduate day program to women. My\nunderstanding is that the university has many activities planned to recognize the significant contributions\nwomen have made to Xavier and to the world at large. So this is an exciting time for me to be at Xavier\nUniversity.\n\nIn addition to being the home of Xavier, Cincinnati is also home to one of the branches of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland. Our other branch is in Pittsburgh, and our District includes the state of Ohio\nand parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Many of you probably know that the Federal\nReserve System comprises 12 regional Reserve Banks, distributed across the country, and the Board of\nGovernors in Washington, D.C. But we also have 24 branch offices. This regional structure helps us to\ncollect information from around the country so that our monetary policy decisions can take into account\nthe diversity of the American economy and its people. I am very grateful for the many contacts\nthroughout the Cleveland Fed’s District who generously share with us their insights into business activity,\nlabor markets, and financial conditions. This timely information, collected through our surveys and in\nmeetings of our advisory councils and boards of directors, is very helpful to me as I formulate my\neconomic outlook and monetary policy views, which I’ll speak about tonight. My remarks will reflect my\nown views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the Fed.\n\nThe National Economic Outlook\nEconomic growth\nCongress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment. From\nthe standpoint of those goals, the U.S. economy is doing very well. The economy has been growing at an\n\n\f2\nabove-trend pace for the past couple of years, with estimates suggesting that growth was a strong\n3 percent last year. Labor market conditions continue to be very strong, with above-trend job growth and\nvery low unemployment. And after several years of being below-target, inflation has moved up and has\nbeen relatively stable around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\n\nMy expectation is that the economy will maintain its good performance in 2019. In my view, the most\nlikely case is that we will see somewhat slower growth than we did last year, reflecting less of a boost\nfrom fiscal stimulus and less accommodative financial conditions. I expect growth to be at or slightly\nabove trend, in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range. Employment growth will also slow a bit, but it will remain\nstrong enough to absorb those entering the workforce, and I expect the unemployment rate to remain at or\nbelow 4 percent. As this transition toward a sustainable pace occurs, I expect inflation to remain near 2\npercent, with the usual transitory ups and downs.\n\nIf this outlook comes to pass, we will chalk up 2019 as another very good year for the economy. But the\npath to sustainability is rarely smooth, and uncertainty is clouding the outlook. The partial shutdown of\nthe federal government is a case in point. It caused significant hardships for the workers who weren’t\ngetting paid and for businesses that rely on the parts of the government that weren’t operating. In terms\nof the overall economy, we will see somewhat slower growth in the first quarter than we otherwise would,\nbut I expect that to be made up in the second quarter, as long as we avoid another shutdown. The\nshutdown came at a time when people were already feeling a bit uneasy. In the fourth quarter of last year,\ninvestor sentiment shifted and investors began putting significant weight on downside risks to the\nforecast. As a result, there was a sharp increase in volatility, a decline in equity prices, and an increase in\nthe credit spread of corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields. It was a good reminder that the\neconomy is dynamic and can take unexpected turns. While we all have to look forward and make our\nbest assessment of how the economy is doing, we also have to be ready to change those views should the\nincoming information warrant it.\n\n\f3\nSince the start of the year, conditions in financial markets have eased, although they remain tighter than\nthey were last fall. Surveys indicate that households and businesses are less confident about the economy\nthan they were, but so far, much of the incoming data are consistent with slower but still solid growth.\nHousehold incomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market and lower taxes. In the\naggregate, households have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making\nfor sound balance sheets. These factors have been supporting solid consumer spending, which is over\ntwo-thirds of output. Going forward, we will need to keep a close eye on whether household sentiment\nweakens so much that people postpone spending or whether they remain cautiously optimistic and\ncontinue to spend.\n\nThe housing market has slowed over the past year. Affordability is becoming an issue because the 30year mortgage rate has been trending up since mid-2016 and house price appreciation continues to exceed\nincome growth. Looking forward, the tax changes contain several provisions that affect homeownership,\nincluding the limits on deductions for mortgage interest and for state and local taxes, which includes\nproperty taxes. On the other hand, strong labor markets mean more people are now in the position to\nmake the commitment to purchase a home. On balance, I don’t expect housing to contribute much to\neconomic growth this year, but I don’t expect to see a sharp pullback in the sector either.\n\nBusiness spending was quite strong in the first half of last year, supported by strong earnings growth and\nchanges in tax policy that included lower corporate tax rates and full expensing of investment in\nequipment and intangibles. But business spending moderated in the second half of the year, as financial\nconditions tightened and uncertainty over tariffs, trade policy, and growth abroad began to weigh on\nmanufacturers and other firms dependent on exports.\n\nSometimes I am asked why the Fed takes into account how other economies are doing when our monetary\npolicy goals pertain to the U.S. economy. The answer is because how economies in the rest of the world\n\n\f4\nfare can spill over to the U.S. through trade and financial markets. Growth abroad, including China and\nEurope, is expected to slow this year, but there is some uncertainty around how much of a slowdown\nthere will be. The path and outcome of Brexit add further uncertainty, as does the outcome of trade and\ntariff negotiations. Indeed, some of the slowdown abroad is likely related to changes in and uncertainty\nover trade policy. So far, the majority of our business contacts continue to report that while their\nconcerns about trade policy and global growth are rising, their investment plans remain intact. But some\nlarger multinational firms have become more hesitant, and several manufacturing contacts have said that\nthe tariffs have been disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face\nincreasing costs of production. Should the slowdown in the economies of our major trading partners,\nincluding China and Germany, be sharper than expected or should the continued uncertainty persuade\nmore firms to take a wait-and-see attitude, U.S. growth may slow more than anticipated. Of course, a\nfavorable resolution to some of the uncertainty could buoy sentiment and lead to a pickup in investment\nand stronger than expected growth in the U.S.\n\nOverall, in my view the most likely outcome is that the economic expansion will continue this year, with\ngrowth moving down to a more sustainable pace, at or slightly above trend, but the risks around the\nforecast, including slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade policy, tighter financial conditions, and\nthe changes in business and consumer sentiment, bear watching.\n\nLabor markets\nThe strong economic growth we have experienced over the past few years has been accompanied by\nstrong labor market conditions. Last year, the economy added more than 2.6 million jobs; that’s over\n220,000 jobs per month. In January, payrolls rose by more than 300,000 jobs. This is much stronger than\ntrend job growth, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The\nunemployment rate has been at or below 4.0 percent for almost a year, which is near the historical lows\nseen over the past 50 years. It seems unlikely that this low level can be maintained over the longer run.\n\n\f5\nOur business and labor contacts, across a variety of industries, have been reporting to us for quite some\ntime that it is very difficult to find workers across all skill levels. Some firms have shifted from looking\nfor new hires to doing all they can to retain their current workers, including offering more flexible work\nschedules and raising wages. These anecdotal reports have shown through to the national statistics.\nAggregate measures of compensation are now in the 3 percent range, after being quite subdued earlier in\nthe expansion. This is a welcome increase. It gives workers more purchasing power, but because the\npickup has been in line with productivity growth and inflation, it has not added to inflationary pressures.\n\nInflation\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in\nthe price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Our goal is symmetric,\nmeaning that we don’t want to see inflation run either persistently above or persistently below this goal.\nWhen assessing where the economy is relative to our goal, monetary policymakers look through shortterm variations in the inflation measures and focus on the underlying medium- to long-term trends in\ninflation.\n\nAfter running below 2 percent for much of the expansion, inflation rates have firmed over the last several\nyears. Last year, higher energy prices boosted headline PCE inflation above 2 percent, and the recent\ndecline in energy prices will likely mean that inflation will move below 2 percent in the first part of the\nyear. But the core inflation measures, which exclude food and energy prices, show that underlying trend\ninflation is essentially at the Fed’s goal of 2 percent. The key to this good performance is that\nexpectations about inflation over the medium to longer term have been stable. This has kept inflation\npressures at bay despite the tightness in labor markets, the strength of the economy, and reports from\nbusiness contacts that they have more pricing power now than they have had in many years. Going\nforward, with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy that maintain stable inflation expectations, my\noutlook is that inflation will remain near our symmetric 2 percent goal.\n\n\f6\nBefore turning to monetary policy, let me say something about the regional economy.\n\nThe Regional Economy\nThe Cincinnati metropolitan area continues to experience some of the best economic performance in the\nCleveland Fed District, and this performance has been aided by solid longer-term fundamentals. For\nexample, from 1996 to 2008, in the Cincinnati metro area, population and jobs each grew by about 11\npercent. This was about two-thirds of the growth rate of population and about three-quarters of the\ngrowth rate of jobs for the U.S. as a whole. 1 But Cincinnati’s performance compares very favorably to\nthat of the Cleveland metro area, which lost about 3 percent of its population and more than 3 percent of\nits jobs over the same time period, and with the state of Ohio, which gained 3 percent in population, but\nshowed no job gains, on net. This better job growth meant that per capita income growth, adjusted for\ninflation, was stronger in Cincinnati than in either Cleveland or Ohio.\n\nSince the expansion began in June 2009, the relative economic performance of Cincinnati has remained\nsolid. While Cincinnati’s population growth has not been as strong as the nation’s, its job growth and real\npersonal income growth have been. On net, payroll jobs are 13 percent higher than they were when the\nexpansion started, and the metro area’s unemployment rate, which peaked at 10.5 in the aftermath of the\nrecession, has fallen to 4.2 percent, just slightly higher than the nation’s. This is strong labor market\nperformance.\n\nResearch shows that regions that are resilient, that is, regions that have been able to avoid persistent\ndeclines in population over the long run, tend to have a more diverse industry mix and a more educated\n\n1\n\nFrom 1996 to 2008, population grew by 16 percent and payroll jobs grew by 14 percent for the U.S. as a whole.\n\n\f7\npopulation. 2 Cincinnati scores well on both counts. Cincinnati has become less reliant on manufacturing\njobs than it was in the past. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented 16 percent of Cincinnati’s jobs; that\nshare has now fallen to about 11 percent. 3 The region has been adding jobs in finance and banking, as\nwell as healthcare. Hospitals are expanding, and there have been substantial venture capital investments\nin health information technology and pharmaceuticals.\n\nEducation is the key to helping ensure that a region’s population acquires the necessary skills for the jobs\navailable now and in the future. 4 In terms of education, the Cincinnati metro area compares quite\nfavorably with the nation, with higher percentages of high school graduates and of those with a bachelor’s\ndegree or further education. 5 In addition, it is home to Xavier and other strong colleges and universities.\nNot all jobs will require a college degree. Cleveland Fed research indicates that compared to many parts\nof the country, Cincinnati has a higher share of so-called “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that\npay above-median wages but don’t require a bachelor’s degree.6 These types of jobs still require training,\n\nJeffrey Lin, “Regional Resilience,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper No. 13-1, December 17,\n2012. (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2013/wp131.pdf?la=en)\n2\n\nIn the U.S., the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen from about 15 percent in the 1990s to about 8 percent\ntoday. The comparable declines in shares were from 20 percent to about 12 percent in Ohio and from 18 percent to\n13 percent in Kentucky.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, in our District, education levels were consistently one\nof the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth and that counties with higher levels of high\nschool graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.\nSee “Altered States: A Perspective on 75 Years of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005\nAnnual Report.

In addition to a skilled workforce, effective\nleadership and collaboration among businesses, government, nonprofits, and individuals have helped\nareas navigate economic transitions driven by technological change and globalization. 7 Workforce\ndevelopment will have to remain an important focus of civic and business leaders in the region to ensure\nthat Cincinnati will be able to extend its solid economic performance into the future.\n\nNow that I have given you a sense of my outlook for the economy, let me conclude with some remarks on\nmonetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nSince December 2015, when the expansion was well underway, the FOMC has been gradually moving\nthe policy rate up from the extraordinarily low level that was needed to address the Great Recession.

Assets held by the Fed are now about\n$4 trillion, down about $0.5 trillion, or over 10 percent, since their peak, and reserves are now about $1.6\ntrillion, down about $1.2 trillion, or over 40 percent, since their peak.\n\nAt coming meetings, we will be finalizing our plans for ending the balance-sheet runoff and completing\nbalance-sheet normalization. As we have done throughout the process of normalization, we will make\nthese plans and the rationale for them known to the public in a timely way because transparency and\naccountability are basic tenets of appropriate monetary policymaking.\n\n\f"

            "content": "Perspectives on the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy in the Coming Year\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe 50 Club\nCleveland, OH\nFebruary 4, 2019\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\nI thank Barbara Snyder and The 50 Club for inviting me to speak tonight about the economy and\nmonetary policy. I am especially looking forward to the question and answer portion of the program\nbecause as we navigate through the year, we will need to be particularly attuned to what is happening on\nthe ground. The Federal Reserve System is actually well structured to do that. The Federal Reserve Bank\nof Cleveland, right up the street, is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country that,\nalong with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., comprise the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCongress designed the Fed more than 100 years ago as a decentralized central bank, independent within\nthe government but not independent from the government. The Fed was designed to balance public-sector\nand private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns. This design has served the country\nwell by allowing monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy\nand its people. The regional structure also allows us to carry out our other responsibilities, including\nsupervising and regulating banks, offering financial services to the U.S. government, overseeing the\npayments system, and identifying policies that can help promote economic progress and access to credit\nin low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed is proud to be part of the civic landscape in Cleveland and the rest of our District,\nwhich includes the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Many of you\nprovide us with your insights into business activity, labor markets, and financial conditions, collected\nthrough our surveys and advisory councils, and I thank you for that public service. This timely\ninformation is very helpful to me as I formulate my economic outlook and monetary policy views, which\nI’ll speak about tonight. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking\nbody within the Fed.\n\n\f2\n\nThe National Economic Outlook\nRather than “bury the lede,” let me start with last week’s FOMC decision. The FOMC decided to keep\nthe target range for the federal funds rate, our policy rate, at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and we have adopted a\nwait-and-see approach regarding future rate adjustments. I fully supported this decision because I believe\nthat policy, for the time being, is well-calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that\noutlook.\n\nEconomic growth\nCongress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, and\nfrom the standpoint of those goals, the U.S. economy has been doing very well. We have enjoyed abovetrend output growth for the past couple of years, with estimates suggesting that growth was around 3\npercent last year. After several years of being below-target, inflation has moved up and has been\nrelatively stable around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, and labor markets are very strong, with abovetrend job growth and very low unemployment.\n\nThe question is whether the economy can maintain its good performance in 2019. My expectation is that\nit will. In my view, the most likely case is that we will see somewhat slower growth than we did last\nyear, in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range, reflecting less of a boost from fiscal stimulus and less\naccommodative financial conditions. But this pace is still at or slightly above trend. Employment growth\nwill also slow a bit, but it will remain strong enough to absorb those entering the workforce, and I expect\nthe unemployment rate to remain at or below 4 percent. As this transition toward a sustainable pace\noccurs, I expect inflation to remain near 2 percent, with the usual transitory ups and downs.\n\nIf this outlook comes to pass, we will chalk up 2019 as another very good year for the economy. But the\npath to sustainability is rarely smooth, and uncertainty is clouding the outlook. The partial shutdown of\nthe federal government is a case in point. It caused significant hardships for the workers who weren’t\n\n\f3\n\ngetting paid and for businesses that rely on the parts of the government that weren’t operating. In terms\nof the overall economy, we will see somewhat slower growth in the first quarter than we otherwise would,\nbut I expect that to be made up in the second quarter, as long as we avoid another shutdown. The\nshutdown came at a time when people were already feeling a bit uneasy. In the fourth quarter of last year,\ninvestor sentiment shifted and investors began putting significant weight on downside risks to the\nforecast. As a result, there was a sharp increase in volatility, a decline in equity prices, and an increase in\nthe credit spread of corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields. It reminded me of Bette Davis’s\nline in All About Eve: “Fasten your seatbelts; it’s going to be a bumpy night.”\n\nSince the start of the year, conditions in financial markets have eased, although they remain tighter than\nthey were last fall. The shift in sentiment is a good reminder that the economy is dynamic and can take\nunexpected turns. While we all have to look forward and make our best assessment of how the economy\nis doing, we also have to be ready to change those views should the incoming information warrant it.\n\nAlthough surveys of households and businesses indicate they are less confident about the economy than\nthey were, much of the incoming data are consistent with slower but still solid growth. Household\nincomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market and lower taxes. In the aggregate,\nhouseholds have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making for sound\nbalance sheets. These factors have been supporting solid consumer spending. Lower equity prices and\nhigher volatility no doubt add an air of caution, but many households benefit from lower oil and gasoline\nprices. Consumer spending is over two-thirds of output, so we will need to keep a close eye on whether\nhousehold sentiment weakens so much that people postpone spending or whether they remain cautiously\noptimistic and continue to spend.\n\nThe housing market has slowed over the past year. The 30-year mortgage rate moved up nearly 1\npercentage point from late 2017 to late 2018, and house price appreciation continues to exceed income\n\n\f4\n\ngrowth, making affordability an issue for many households. Looking forward, the tax changes contain\nseveral provisions that affect homeownership. There is a limit on the deduction for state and local taxes,\nwhich includes property taxes, and a limit on the deduction for mortgage interest, both of which will\naffect those taxpayers who continue to itemize deductions. On the other hand, strong labor markets mean\nmore people are now in the position to make the commitment to purchase a home. On balance, I don’t\nexpect housing to contribute much to economic growth this year, but I don’t expect to see a sharp\npullback in the sector either.\n\nBusiness spending was quite strong in the first half of last year, supported by strong earnings growth and\nchanges in tax policy that included lower corporate tax rates and full expensing of investment in\nequipment and intangibles. But business spending moderated in the second half of the year, as financial\nconditions tightened and uncertainty over tariffs, trade policy, and growth abroad began to weigh on\nmanufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Lower energy prices benefit consumers, but they\ntend to dampen mining and drilling investment. I don’t expect the drag on investment in this sector to be\nnearly as large as in 2015-2016, unless energy prices fall considerably more.\n\nWhile the Fed’s monetary policy goals pertain to the U.S. economy, how economies in the rest of the\nworld fare can spill over to the U.S. through trade and financial markets. Growth abroad, including China\nand Europe, is expected to slow this year, but there is some uncertainty around how much of a slowdown\nthere will be. The path and outcome of Brexit add further uncertainty, as does the outcome of trade and\ntariff negotiations. Indeed, some of the slowdown abroad is likely related to changes in and uncertainty\nover trade policy. China is Ohio’s third largest export destination, after Canada and Mexico, and Ohio’s\nlargest import source. The majority of our business contacts continue to report that while their concerns\nabout trade policy and global growth are rising, their investment plans remain intact. But some larger\nmultinational firms have become more hesitant, and several manufacturing contacts have said that the\ntariffs have been disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face\n\n\f5\n\nincreasing costs of production. You can think of the tariffs as a tax on inputs to U.S. production; they\nreduce profitability or are passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. To the extent that the\ntariffs disrupt the most efficient use of resources, they are a headwind to longer-term productivity growth,\nwhich has already been low during the expansion. Should the slowdown in the economies of our major\ntrading partners, including China and Germany, be sharper than expected or should the continued\nuncertainty persuade more firms to take a wait-and-see attitude, U.S. growth may slow more than\nanticipated. Of course, a favorable resolution to some of the uncertainty could buoy sentiment and foster\na pickup in investment, leading to stronger than expected growth in the U.S.\n\nOverall, in my view the most likely outcome is that the economic expansion will continue this year, with\ngrowth moving down to a more sustainable pace, at or slightly above trend. But the move may not be a\nsmooth one and there is uncertainty around the forecast. Slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade\npolicy, tighter financial conditions, and the downturn in sentiment pose risks to this forecast and bear\nwatching.\n\nLabor markets\nStrong economic growth like we have seen over the past few years is usually accompanied by strong\nlabor market conditions, and 2018 was no exception. Last year, the economy added more than 2.6 million\njobs, over 220,000 jobs per month, and more than 300,000 jobs were added in January. This is much\nstronger than the estimates of trend job growth, which range from 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The\nunemployment rate has been at or below 4.0 percent for almost a year, near the historical lows seen over\nthe past 50 years. It seems unlikely that this low level can be maintained over the longer run. Business\nand labor contacts throughout the Cleveland Federal Reserve District, across a variety of industries, have\nbeen reporting to us for quite some time that it is very difficult to find workers across all skill levels.\nSome firms have shifted from looking for new hires to doing all they can to retain their current workers,\nincluding offering more flexible work schedules and raising wages. These anecdotal reports have shown\n\n\f6\n\nthrough to the national statistics. Aggregate measures of compensation are now in the 3 percent range,\nafter being quite subdued earlier in the expansion. This is a welcome increase. It gives workers more\npurchasing power, but because the pickup has been in line with productivity growth and inflation, it has\nnot added to inflationary pressures.\n\nInflation\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in\nthe price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Our goal is symmetric,\nmeaning that we don’t want to see inflation run either persistently above or persistently below this goal.\nThere is always some short-term variation in the inflation measures, but monetary policymakers focus on\nthe underlying medium- to long-term trends in inflation.\n\nAfter running below 2 percent for much of the expansion, inflation rates have firmed over the last several\nyears. Last year, higher energy prices boosted headline PCE inflation above 2 percent, and the recent\ndecline in energy prices will likely mean that inflation will move below 2 percent in the first part of the\nyear. But the core inflation measures, which exclude food and energy prices, show that underlying trend\ninflation is essentially at the Fed’s goal of 2 percent. The key to this good performance is that\nexpectations about inflation over the medium to longer term have been stable. This has kept inflation\npressures at bay despite the tightness in labor markets, the strength of the economy, and reports from\nbusiness contacts that they have more pricing power now than they have had in many years. Going\nforward, with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy that maintain stable inflation expectations, my\noutlook is that inflation will remain near our symmetric 2 percent goal.\n\nBefore turning to monetary policy, let me say something about the regional economy.\n\n\f7\n\nThe Regional Economy\nHow the Cleveland region has fared over the economic expansion reflects not only trends in the national\neconomy but also the region’s own transformation over the past couple of decades. From 1996 to 2008,\nthe metro area lost about 3 percent of its population and more than 3 percent of its jobs. In contrast,\nOhio’s population grew by 3 percent, and while the state didn’t add jobs, on net, it didn’t lose them either.\nThe U.S., overall, did much better than either Cleveland or Ohio: population grew by 16 percent, and jobs\ngrew by 14 percent, or a compounded rate of 1 percent per year. This better job growth meant that per\ncapita income growth, adjusted for inflation, was stronger for the nation than for either Cleveland or\nOhio.\n\nBut recent trends have been more positive. Over the past five years, the regional economy has grown\nslowly but steadily, the population decline has slowed considerably, the metro area has been adding jobs,\nand real per capita income growth has been similar to that of the U.S. Demographics suggest that the\nregion’s trend job growth will remain below that of the nation and our unemployment rate will be higher.\nBut the metro area has benefited by becoming more diversified. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented\nalmost 20 percent of Cleveland’s and Ohio’s jobs; that share has fallen to about 12 percent.\nManufacturing is still a relatively more important sector here than in other parts of the country, so the\nregion has been particularly affected by the downward trend in manufacturing employment. 1 But the\nregion now has specializations in healthcare, insurance, and business management, which should make it\nmore resilient.\n\nOf course, this shift in sectoral mix presents a challenge: As the regional economy becomes less reliant on\nlower-skilled manufacturing, and more reliant on higher-skilled manufacturing and service-sector jobs,\n\nIn the U.S., the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen from about 15 percent in the 1990s to about 8 percent\ntoday.\n\n1\n\n\f8\n\nhow can it ensure that its population acquires the necessary skills for jobs available now and in the future?\n\nInvestments in education and training will be key. 2 Cleveland is off to a good start. The metro area\ncompares favorably with the nation, with a slightly higher percentage of high school graduates and a\nsimilar share of those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, 3 and we are home to strong universities. Not all\njobs will require a college degree. Cleveland Fed research indicates that compared to many parts of the\ncountry, Cleveland has a higher share of so-called “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay\nabove-median wages but don’t require a bachelor’s degree. 4 These types of jobs still require training, but\nit often takes less time and money to transition into them. The area has a number of innovative training\nprograms, including those offered at Cuyahoga Community College’s Manufacturing Technology Center,\nwhich I had the pleasure of touring.\n\nIn addition to a skilled workforce, effective leadership and collaboration among businesses, government,\nnonprofits, and individuals have helped areas navigate economic transitions driven by technological\n\nCleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, in our District, education levels were consistently one\nof the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth and that counties with higher levels of high\nschool graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.\nSee “Altered States: A Perspective on 75 Years of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005\nAnnual Report. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/annual-reports/ar-2005perspective-on-75-years-of-state-income-growth/ar-200502-altered-states-essay.aspx)\nand Mark Schweitzer and Peter Rupert, “Understanding the Persistence of Poverty,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland 2006 Annual Report. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/annualreports/ar-2006-understanding-the-persistence-of-poverty/ar-200602-understanding-the-persistence-of-poverty.aspx)\n2\n\nOf the population age 25 years and over, 27.3 percent in the U.S. and 29.5 percent in the Cleveland metro area\nearned a high school diploma as their terminal degree, and 30.9 percent in the U.S. and 30.2 percent in the Cleveland\nmetro area earned a bachelor’s degree or higher.\n\n3\n\nThe researchers found that roughly a third of the jobs in the Cleveland region are in opportunity occupations,\nalmost 10 percentage points higher than for the nation as a whole. See Keith Wardrip, Kyle Fee, Lisa Nelson, and\nStuart Andreason, “Identifying Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies,” Federal\nReserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta, September 2015. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroomand-events/publications/special-reports/sr-20150909-identifying-opportunity-occupations.aspx)\n\n4\n\n\f9\n\nchange and globalization. 5 So our region will benefit from the work of many of the people in this room,\nwho are already dedicated to addressing workforce development issues so that Cleveland remains\neconomically competitive in the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\nLet me conclude with a few more remarks on where monetary policy goes from here. Since December\n2015, when the expansion was well underway, the FOMC has been gradually moving the policy rate up\nfrom the extraordinarily low level that was needed to address the Great Recession. Our policy rate is now\nat the lower end of the range of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run neutral rate, a level that\nneither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with maximum employment and price\nstability, and our most recent policy rate increases are still working themselves through the economy. In\naddition, we have also been letting the longer-term assets that we purchased to add accommodation\nduring the recession gradually roll off the Fed’s balance sheet, and we have made considerable progress\nin bringing bank reserves down to more normal levels. As the FOMC announced last week, we plan to\ncontinue to use our current operating framework for implementing monetary policy, and at coming\nmeetings, we will be finalizing our plans for ending the balance-sheet runoff and completing balancesheet normalization.\n\nWith respect to our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, the economy is in\na very good spot. Growth is slowing from an above-trend pace, and labor markets are strong. While the\nunemployment rate is lower than the level that is sustainable in the longer run, inflation is near 2 percent\nand does not show signs of appreciably rising. In my view, monetary policy does not appear to be far\n\n“Reinvigorating Springfield’s Economy: Lessons from Resurgent Cities,” Public Policy Discussion Paper No. 096, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 1, 2009. (https://www.bostonfed.org//media/Documents/Workingpapers/PDF/ppdp0906.pdf)\n\n5\n\n\f10\n\nbehind or far ahead of the curve. This environment gives us the opportunity to continue to gather\ninformation on the economy and assess our forecast and the risks, before making any further adjustments\nin the policy rate. If the economy performs along the lines that I’ve outlined as most likely, the fed funds\nrate may need to move a bit higher than current levels. But if some of the downside risks to the forecast\nmanifest themselves, and the economy turns out to be weaker than expected and jeopardizes our dual\nmandate goals, I will need to adjust my outlook and policy views. While I cannot predict what the future\nwill bring, there is one thing I can say with certainty: My colleagues and I on the FOMC will strive to\nbring the best analysis and judgment to our monetary policy decisions, doing our part to support a healthy\neconomy on behalf of the public.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nOpening Remarks at the\nCollaboration for Inclusive Economic Development:\nA Forum for Philanthropies, Policymakers, and Practitioners\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, MA\nNovember 29, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Eric Rosengren, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and the Living Cities Collaborative for\norganizing this public forum exploring new opportunities for advancing economic opportunity and\neconomic mobility. Based on every event I have attended at the Boston Fed over many years, I know that\nI will come away with new insights and I look forward to our conversation.\n\nFed governance is arcane and I’m not planning to talk about it today except to say that I chair the\ncommittee across the Reserve Banks that focuses on the Fed’s community development work. I have\nbeen asked to present some opening remarks on these efforts, why they are important to our mission of\nfostering a healthy economy, and what the Fed is doing to encourage more inclusive growth. My remarks\nwill reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Fed in the Community\nThe origin of the Fed’s community development work lies with the passage of the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA) in 1977. The CRA was intended to help ensure equitable access to credit for all\nindividuals and neighborhoods by reaffirming that insured depository institutions must serve the\ncommunities in which they are chartered to do business. To help these institutions comply with the CRA,\nthe Fed built a function to provide technical training and other support.\n\nOver time, the Fed’s interest and activities in community development have grown: today, community\ndevelopment is one of the Fed’s core business functions. The financial health and access to economic\nopportunity of consumers and communities is a key component of the country’s overall economic health\nand resiliency. The Fed recognizes that in order to perform our various duties, we need to have a good\nunderstanding of all of the interrelated challenges facing lower-income communities as well as more\naffluent areas. This understanding helps ensure that we are taking a consistent approach to advancing the\n\n\f2\nCRA and promoting access to credit, investment, and financial services across low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds, small businesses, and communities. Our relationships with community development\norganizations and philanthropies at the local level provide us with valuable sources of information about\nthe economic health of people across various segments of the population and across the communities in\nour Districts, and this helps us gauge the effectiveness of our monetary policy. Our community\ndevelopment work also helps us gather information on developing trends in financial services and markets\nthat could raise risks to bank safety and soundness or to financial stability more broadly.\n\nMany factors determine the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods, including access to\ncredit, capital, and financial services; affordable housing; workforce development; job training and\neducation; health and wellness services; and infrastructure, including transportation and broadband\nservices. Over the next several years, our Community Development staffs across the Federal Reserve\nSystem will be focusing their efforts on advancing the economic resiliency and mobility of low- and\nmoderate-income and underserved households and communities. What factors make certain individuals\nand communities better able to recover from economic setbacks, and how can those factors be promoted\nbroadly? Why are some places and households mired in persistent poverty, and what can be done to turn\naround those bad outcomes? What factors allow people to move up the economic ladder regardless of\nwhere they live or their racial or gender makeup? What policies can ensure broad access to economic\nopportunity for all people and places?\n\nThese are hard questions. The Fed is committed not only to increasing knowledge about the economic\nchallenges facing low- and moderate-income households and communities, but also to helping to identify\neffective policies and best practices to address these challenges. We aim to do that by gathering and\ndisseminating data; conducting applied, action-focused research; and holding forums such as this one.\nWe strive to conduct our data gathering and research with the utmost rigor and the highest standards of\nquality, looking objectively at all sides of an issue and potential solutions. Our engagement with\n\n\f3\ncommitted stakeholders like you is critical to ensuring that our research hits the mark, that it contributes\nto the public discourse, and that it informs public policy and yields concrete and positive outcomes. The\npeople in this room know very well that the issues facing lower-income households and communities in a\ndynamic economy such as ours are complex ones. Many of the solutions will be complex as well and will\ntake committed and collaborative actions from all of us.\n\nThe Fed’s Community Development Work in Action\nI’d like to conclude my opening remarks by highlighting just a few examples of the Federal Reserve’s\nefforts in community development.\n\nOn the access-to-credit front, the Kansas City Fed’s Investment Connection program allows community\nand economic development organizations in the District to have project proposals pre-screened by Kansas\nCity Fed staffers to determine whether the project is CRA-eligible. The organizations then get a chance\nto pitch their proposals to potential funders, including financial institutions and community foundations.\nSince 2011, Investment Connection has facilitated more than $30 million in loans, investments, grants,\nand services to community economic development organizations. And because the program has been\nsuch a success, other Federal Reserve Districts, including Minneapolis, St. Louis, New York, and\nCleveland, have either started or are considering piloting programs of their own.\n\nAn example of the Fed’s data gathering, dissemination, and analysis, our annual Small Business Credit\nSurvey, has become a trusted source of information on the conditions of firms with fewer than 500\nemployees. This survey and the associated analysis, which is a collaboration among all 12 Reserve\nBanks, are used by a wide range of stakeholders seeking to understand the financing needs of the small\nbusiness sector, an important driver of the economy.\n\n\f4\nIn terms of our collaborative efforts, workforce development is a key issue that affects economic vitality\nacross all regions. So, considerable efforts are underway across the Federal Reserve System and with our\ncommunity partners to find solutions to ensure that people have access to the education and skilldevelopment programs needed to ensure that they can be productive members of the modern workforce.\nThe Federal Reserve System is engaged with the Heldrich Center at Rutgers University, the Ray Marshall\nCenter at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Upjohn Institute in an effort called Investing in\nAmerica’s Workforce. This initiative seeks to align the skills of the workforce with employers’ needs by\nreframing the discussion of workforce development efforts as investments rather than costly social\nservices. Earlier this month, the initiative released a three-volume set presenting workforce development\nprograms and policies that are considered to be best-practice in terms of delivering positive returns to\nsociety, employers, workers, and job seekers. The volumes were a culmination of many listening sessions\nand engagement with a vast number of practitioners and academics from across the country.\n\nIn addition to these collaborative efforts across the Federal Reserve System, each Reserve Bank also does\nwork on the issues and needs of low- and moderate-income households and communities that are\nespecially relevant to their individual Districts. An excellent example of this is the Boston Fed’s Working\nCities Challenge, which began in 2013. Informed by the Boston Fed’s research and designed in\npartnership with its network of community development stakeholders, the Working Cities Challenge is a\ngrant competition aimed at strengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help low-income areas\nand households in the Northeast in an enduring way.\n\nAnother example is the Cleveland Fed’s work on the opioid crisis, an issue that disproportionately affects\nthe people in our District and their ability to productively engage in the economy. Cleveland Fed research\nhas documented the effects of opioids on different segments of the population, in terms of race and\ngender, and across geographic areas. In addition to research, the Cleveland staff has engaged our\ncommunity contacts and advisory councils to provide insights into this public-health problem, which is\n\n\f5\nhaving significant economic consequences in terms of workforce attachment.\n\nAs I said, this is just a taste of the type of work being undertaken by the Federal Reserve to better\nunderstand and help to provide workable solutions to these complex community development challenges.\nThese problems are not going to solve themselves. Determining viable solutions will take collaboration\namong all stakeholders, as underscored by the title of today’s program, Collaboration for Inclusive\nEconomic Development. As I am certain you are too, I am looking forward to today’s panel sessions\nfeaturing leaders from philanthropic foundations and some of my Fed colleagues. They will discuss the\nbarriers to inclusive economic progress, what responses are being brought to bear, and where the Federal\nReserve System, philanthropies, and others can collaborate to foster further innovative approaches and\nsolutions. Thank you all for being here today to participate in this important dialog.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nMoney Marketeers of New York University, Inc.\nNew York, NY\nOctober 25, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me back to speak tonight. When I\nwas here four years ago, I discussed the important role that Federal Reserve communications play in\nmaking effective monetary policy and the need for these communications to evolve as we moved from a\nperiod of extraordinary monetary policymaking to more normal policymaking. At this point, that\ntransition to more normal policymaking has been underway for some time, reflecting the health of the\nU.S. economy and the progress that’s been made on the FOMC’s monetary policy goals. Tonight, I’ll\ntalk about the economic outlook and monetary policy, FOMC communications, and upcoming\nconsiderations that will help determine what normal policymaking will look like in the future. My\nremarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Growth\nFrom the perspectives of the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, the U.S. economy\nis doing very well. Growth has been running above trend for the past couple of years, inflation has\nmoved up to the FOMC’s 2 percent target, and labor markets are very strong. The unemployment rate is\nat its lowest level since the late 1960s and job growth is well above trend.\n\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent, and it has been running around 3 percent over the\nfirst three quarters of this year. Early this month, longer-term interest rates moved up, and over the past\ncouple of weeks, volatility in equity markets has increased. While a deeper and more persistent drop in\nequity markets could dash confidence and lead to a significant pullback in risk-taking and spending, we\nare far from this scenario. The S&P 500 index remains higher than it was a year ago. Similar to the\nswings in the market we saw earlier this year, the movements of late do not seem to be signaling that\ninvestors are becoming overly pessimistic. While the market volatility poses a risk to the forecast and\nbears monitoring, it has not led me to change my modal medium-run outlook. I expect growth to come in\n\n\f2\na tad above 3 percent this year and to be in the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range next year, well above my 2\npercent estimate of the economy’s trend growth rate.\n\nBoth consumer and business spending are making solid contributions to growth and I expect that to\ncontinue. Household incomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market. In the\naggregate, households have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making\nfor sound balance sheets. The changes in tax policy that became effective earlier this year added a\npositive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending.\n\nBusiness activity and spending have also been healthy. Investment in equipment and intellectual property\nhas strengthened this year and strong order flows suggest that strength will continue. The changes in tax\npolicy, including lower corporate tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and\nintangibles, support further business spending. Increased federal government spending is also a positive\nfor growth over the next couple of years. Despite the uncertainty around trade and tariff policies,\nbusiness sentiment is high. Earlier, when the expansion was getting underway, businesses’ main concern\nwas weak demand; now it is the difficulty in finding workers to keep up with strong demand.\n\nThe housing market has slowed somewhat over the past year. Some softening is to be expected as interest\nrates have moved up; the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is about a percentage point higher than a year ago.\nIn some areas, a lack of housing supply may also be negatively weighing on housing activity. In addition,\nthe tax changes contain several provisions that affect homeownership, including the limit on the\ndeduction for state and local taxes, which includes property taxes, and the limit on the mortgage interest\ndeduction, both of which will affect those taxpayers who continue to itemize deductions. I am not\nanticipating a strong pullback in housing over the next year, but I also do not expect it to be a strong\nengine of growth for the overall economy.\n\n\f3\nGrowth abroad has improved in recent years, but forecasts have recently been revised down. The\ndivergence between economic growth prospects abroad and in the U.S. puts upward pressure on the dollar\nand suggests that net exports – the difference between exports and imports – will likely be a small drag on\nU.S. growth over the next couple of years. However, this assessment is complicated by the uncertainty\naround trade and tariff policies. The recent U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to replace NAFTA\nreduced some of this uncertainty, but rules under which the firms operate – for example, what constitutes\noff-shore content – still need to be worked out and the agreement needs Senate approval. The impact of\ntrade developments between the U.S. and China will depend on the actions ultimately taken and on\nwhether the uncertainty itself leads to a pullback in spending. The majority of business contacts from my\nDistrict report that they have not changed their plans or revenue outlook in response to concerns about\nescalating trade tensions. However, some manufacturing contacts have reported that the tariffs have been\nquite disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face increasing costs\nof production. These effects could last for some time because reorganizing supply chains cannot be done\nquickly. Thus, the tariffs will act as a tax on inputs to U.S. production and are a headwind to productivity\ngrowth, which has been low during the expansion.\n\nLabor Markets\nAbove-trend growth has led to continued strong job growth and declines in the unemployment rate.\nPayroll job gains have averaged over 200,000 jobs per month this year, up from about 180,000 per month\nlast year, and are well above most estimates of trend, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000.\nAnother sign of a strong labor market is the stability of the labor force participation rate, which\ndemographics suggest will be trending down over time. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4\npercent for the past six months. It fell to 3.7 percent in September, which is lower than the levels reached\nduring the past two expansions, and is well below my 4.5 percent estimate of the unemployment rate that\nis sustainable over the longer run. I expect that strong growth will support further tightening of the labor\nmarket, with the unemployment rate falling to slightly under 3-1/2 percent by the end of next year.\n\n\f4\n\nAs I mentioned, firms continue to report that it is very difficult to find workers. These reports are coming\nfrom a variety of industries, across skill levels and geographic regions. Firms are responding to labor\nshortages by offering higher wages and more flexible work schedules. In fact, some of my contacts tell\nme they are offering incentive payments to workers based solely on their attendance. Other firms tell me\nthey are automating faster, although they recognize that finding even the reduced number of workers\nneeded for automated plants is going to be a problem in the short run. Some manufacturers have told me\nthey would be investing more in plant and equipment if they thought they could find workers. So the\ntightness in labor markets may develop into a headwind on growth.\n\nThe official statistics on wages and compensation have been lagging the anecdotal reports, but recently,\nthe readings have caught up. Various year-over-year measures of wage growth are nearing 3 percent, up\nfrom 2 percent early in the expansion. Some people ask: if labor markets are so tight, why aren’t we\nseeing wage growth in the 3 to 4 percent range like we saw in the prior two expansions? This is a\nlegitimate question.\n\nFirst, it has to be acknowledged that it is difficult to know with any precision how tight labor markets are;\nmaybe they aren’t as tight as we once thought. In fact, the behavior of labor force participation and the\nfact that wage growth has remained moderate even as labor markets have strengthened have led many\npolicymakers to reassess the level of the unemployment rate they view as sustainable in the long run.\nFive years ago, the central tendency of projections of the longer-run unemployment rate among FOMC\npolicymakers ranged from 5.2 to 5.8 percent. 1 In projections this September, the central tendency was\n\n1\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections section of FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,”\nSeptember 17-18, 2013.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20130918.pdf)\n\n\f5\nabout a percentage point lower, at 4.3 to 4.6 percent, with a median projection of 4.5 percent. 2 Over time,\nI have also moved down my own estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate to my current estimate of\n4.5 percent.\n\nBut even relative to these lower longer-run estimates, labor markets are tight, and based on a broad set of\nlabor market indicators, my assessment is that we are beyond maximum employment, one part of the\nFed’s monetary policy mandate. So there is still some explaining to do regarding the relatively moderate\nwage growth we’ve seen so far. Much of the explanation lies with the low levels of inflation and\nproductivity growth over this expansion. 3 The recent increase in nominal wage growth reflects the recent\nfirming in both factors, but I wouldn’t expect to see a strong acceleration in wages unless we see a strong\npickup in productivity growth. Such a scenario would be welcome, since wage growth reflecting higher\nproductivity growth does not contribute to inflationary pressures in a competitive economy.\n\nInflation\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in\nthe price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The goal is symmetric,\nmeaning that the FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or persistently\nbelow this goal and such persistent deviations would warrant a policy response. 4 But month-to-month\nvariations in the inflation measures, due to idiosyncratic factors or in response to temporary economic and\n\n2\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections section of FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,”\nSeptember 25-26, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180926.pdf)\n\n3\n\nOver the longer run, wages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this\nexpansion, the annualized growth rate of labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector, has been about 1.1 percent, less than half the pace over the prior two expansions.\n\n4\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012;\nas amended effective January 30, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf).\n\n\f6\nfinancial disturbances, are to be expected. Policymakers look through temporary undershoots or\novershoots of our inflation goal and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis.\n\nAs the expansion has continued, inflation has gradually firmed, consistent with reports from business\ncontacts that they now have a greater ability to raise their own prices in response to higher input costs and\nstrong demand. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, have been\nrunning near 2 percent for several months. Inflation expectations have been stable, and this has helped\nanchor inflation despite the tightness in labor markets and the strength of the economy. In this\nenvironment, maintaining stable inflation expectations will be the key to maintaining inflation at target.\nWith appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, my outlook is that inflation will remain near 2 percent,\nsubject to the usual monthly variations in the measures.\n\nMonetary Policy and Communications\nAt its meeting in September, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints, to 2 to 2-1/4 percent, and continued on its pre-announced plan for gradually reducing the amount\nof assets held on its balance sheet.\n\nAs the economy has improved, the FOMC has been engaged in a strategy to gradually reduce the\nextraordinary accommodation that was put in place to address the Great Recession. This approach is one\nthat balances the upside and downside risks to achieving and maintaining our dual mandate goals so that\nthe expansion is sustained. We want to avoid a buildup in risks to macroeconomic stability that could\narise if the economy were allowed to overheat, but we also want to avoid choking off the expansion. In\naddition, gradually reducing accommodation helps mitigate the risks of financial imbalances that can arise\nin a low interest rate environment. Currently, I would characterize these risks as moderate. But growth in\nleveraged lending is strong, commercial real estate valuations are lofty, and I believe we are at a point in\nthe business cycle where increased attention to financial stability risk is warranted because the economy\n\n\f7\ncontinues to grow above trend and financial conditions remain accommodative, even taking into account\nthe recent increase in long-term interest rates.\n\nAs the funds rate target gets closer to the range of estimates of the neutral rate – the level of interest rates\nconsistent with stable prices and maximum employment in the long run – we are nearing the completion\nof the exit from the period of extraordinary monetary policymaking and moving close to a period of\nnormal policymaking. Our communications are appropriately changing. You may have noticed that in\nSeptember, we removed language indicating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\nThis wasn’t meant to signal any change in policy strategy or the likely path of policy. Indeed, we said\nthat given the economic outlook we expect further gradual increases in the funds rate will likely be\nwarranted. Instead, I view the change in language as an indication that we are getting back to a period of\nnormal policymaking.\n\nIn the period of extraordinary monetary policymaking, when the policy rate was at its effective lower\nbound, the FOMC used forward guidance about the expected future path of interest rates as a policy tool.\nWe conveyed that our future path was going to be very accommodative for a long time. But in normal\ntimes, there is no need to use guidance as a policy tool and there is less certainty around the future policy\npath. That path will depend on the evolution of economic conditions and their effect on the medium-run\noutlook and risks around the outlook. So instead of giving explicit guidance, normal policy\ncommunications should convey the rationale for policy decisions and the FOMC’s reaction function, that\nis, how policy is likely to systematically respond to changes in economic conditions – whether those\nchanges are anticipated or unanticipated.\n\nLet me underscore that just because the future policy path isn’t known with certainty and will depend on\neconomic developments doesn’t mean that policymakers will be nonsystematic in their approach to\npolicymaking. It just means that in normal times, it would be inappropriate to commit to a future path\n\n\f8\nbecause the path taken will depend on how economic conditions evolve. Let me also note that in addition\nto contributing to transparency and accountability, being systematic and communicating so that the public\nunderstands normal policymaking will make the forward guidance we use in extraordinary times more\neffective. They will understand that keeping interest rates lower for longer is not business as usual, and\nthis awareness can help put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.\n\nMight the return to normal policymaking be an argument for the FOMC’s dropping the so-called dot plot\nfrom the Summary of Economic Projections, as some have suggested we do? I think it would be a\nmistake to discontinue the dot plot. The dot plot provides information on the policy paths that individual\nFOMC participants view as appropriate to promoting the FOMC’s monetary policy goals. The dots can\nchange over time because of economic developments, but that’s a design feature, not a flaw. The FOMC\nalso provides a chart illustrating the uncertainty band around the median policy path across participants. 5\nIt clearly shows that the farther out in the projection horizon one goes, the wider the degree of uncertainty\n– this is a characteristic of normal policymaking. Omitting this information would not make the\ndivergence in views across FOMC participants or the uncertainty around their projections disappear, but it\nwould be a significant step back in transparency.\n\nLet me conclude by touching on two considerations that will help determine what normal policymaking\nlooks like in the future. The first is the operating framework the Fed uses to ensure that its policy rate is\n\n5\n\nThe FOMC began providing charts of the confidence bands around the median projections in the March 2017\nSummary of Economic Projections. For the latest charts, see the Summary of Economic Projections section of\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” September 25-26, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180926.pdf)\n\n\f9\nbeing maintained at the appropriate level, and the second is the monetary policy strategic framework that\nthe FOMC uses to determine what that appropriate level of the policy rate is. 6\n\nMonetary Policy Frameworks: Operations and Strategy\nSince last October, the FOMC has been in the process of gradually and predictably reducing the holdings\nof Treasury and agency securities that were purchased to address the financial crisis and Great\nRecession. 7 We plan to shrink the balance sheet until the Fed is holding no more securities than\nnecessary to implement policy efficiently and effectively, and as noted in the minutes of the July FOMC\nmeeting, the FOMC will likely soon be resuming a discussion of what that implementation framework\nwill be. 8\n\nOne option is to try to return to operating like we did before the financial crisis, when the FOMC kept the\nsupply of bank reserves scarce. In June 2007, banks were holding about $10 billion in reserve accounts at\nthe Fed. The FOMC could make small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries,\nand this allowed the FOMC to ensure that the fed funds rate was maintained at the FOMC’s target. But\nnow, as a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant. While reserve levels\nare down from their peaks, banks are still holding about $1.8 trillion in reserve accounts at the Fed, and\nalmost all of this is in excess of what is required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the\n6\n\nFor further discussion of monetary policy frameworks, see Mester, Loretta J., “Monetary Policy Frameworks,”\nNational Association for Business Economics and American Economic Association Session at the Allied Social\nScience Associations Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, January 5, 2018\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180105-monetary-policy-frameworks),\nand Mester, Loretta J., “Remarks on the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework,” panel remarks at the 2018 U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School\nof Business, New York, NY, February 23, 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180223-remarks-on-the-fomcs-monetarypolicy-framework)\n7\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf)\n\n8\n\nSee “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” July 31-August 1, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180801.pdf)\n\n\f10\nsupply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate. Instead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into\nits target range by adjusting the rate it pays on excess reserves, and by using overnight reverse repurchase\nagreements, which help put a floor on the fed funds rate. Reserves and currency are the main liabilities\non the Fed’s balance sheet, so the choice between these two frameworks will determine the volume of\nassets the Fed will hold on its balance sheet.\n\nBoth operating frameworks have proven to be effective during the periods in which they have been used.\nThere are several things to consider in determining which implementation framework will be most\neffective going forward. The fed funds market has changed considerably since the financial crisis, 9 and\nthe regulatory changes put in place since the crisis have likely affected the banking system’s demand for\nreserve balances. This may limit the feasibility of returning to a framework with scarce reserves, and it\nalso raises the question of whether the fed funds rate will remain the best indicator of the general level of\nshort-term interest rates, regardless of the operating framework. On the other hand, a relatively large\nbalance sheet, which would accompany an abundant reserves framework, might be viewed with some\nskepticism or generate requests for the Fed to aid other industries or use the balance sheet to fund\ngovernment initiatives, as occurred during and since the crisis.10,11 I believe this type of risk can be\neffectively handled by clear and timely communication by the FOMC on the rationale for its decision\n\n9\n\nFor a review of changes in the fed funds market since the financial crisis, see Craig, Ben R. and Sara Millington,\n“The Federal Funds Market since the Financial Crisis,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary,\nApril 5, 2017.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economiccommentaries/ec-201707-the-federal-funds-market-since-the-financial-crisis.aspx)\n\n10\n\nFor example, during December 2008, as Congress debated a bailout for American automakers, several members\nof Congress requested of then-Chair Ben Bernanke that the Fed lend directly to auto companies. Needless to say,\nthe Fed was reluctant to go down this path, which would have put it squarely in the midst of industrial policy, a\nresponsibility of Congress. See the discussion in Chapter 17 of Ben S. Bernanke, The Courage to Act: A Memoir of\na Crisis and its Aftermath, New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2015.\n11\n\nMore recently, Congress used funds from the Fed’s surplus account to pay for highways and other budget\ninitiatives, and put limits on the size of the surplus. See the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Act, or FAST Act, and\nthe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.\n\n\f11\nabout the implementation framework, as well as its other policy decisions in pursuit of our goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhich brings me to the other important issue that will determine what normal monetary policymaking is\nin the future, namely, the strategic framework used to determine appropriate monetary policy. Currently,\nwe use a flexible inflation-targeting framework, which has served the FOMC well in effectively\npromoting our policy goals. But based on demographics, higher demand for safe assets, and other factors,\nmany economists anticipate that the longer-term equilibrium real interest rate will remain lower than in\npast decades. This would mean there would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a\nnegative economic shock, the probability of the policy rate hitting the effective lower bound would be\nhigher, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that\nthese tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the\npotential would be for longer recessions and longer bouts of inflation well below target. 12\n\nSo we need to ask whether there are alternative policy strategies that could lower the probability of\ngetting into this situation, and at the July FOMC meeting, participants agreed to discuss this topic at\nfuture meetings. 13 Researchers have suggested several alternative frameworks, such as targeting an\ninflation rate higher than 2 percent, moving to an inflation-targeting range instead of a point goal, or\ntargeting a path for the price level or for nominal GDP rather than for inflation. None of these alternative\nframeworks are without challenges but all are worth thorough review. It might be useful to do something\nakin to simulated stress testing to see how each framework might fare when confronted with things like\ndata revisions; uncertainty about the levels of the equilibrium interest rate, potential growth, and longer12\n\nAlthough I don’t discuss them here, other government policies might also be brought to bear to increase the longterm growth rate and equilibrium interest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Such policies\nwould focus on increasing productivity growth and labor force participation.\n13\n\nSee “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” July 31-August 1, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180801.pdf)\n\n\f12\nrun unemployment rate; and the challenges of effective policy communications. My colleague Eric\nRosengren, president of the Boston Fed, recently put out a proposal for regular review of the Fed’s\nstrategic framework. 14 I support this idea; it makes sense to me that, as a matter of good governance, a\ncentral bank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models. I also believe that to\ninform our evaluation of the framework, we should seek a wide range of perspectives, including those\nfrom experts in academia, the private sector, and other central banks. I am confident in predicting that\nthere won’t be a consensus among this wide-ranging group, but I am equally confident in predicting that\nwe will ultimately get to a better decision – whether it be to stay with our current framework or adopt an\nalternative – if we listen to a diverse set of views on the subject.\n\n14\n\nSee Fuhrer, Jeffery C., Giovanni P.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, MO\nOctober 3, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank President Jim Bullard and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for inviting me to present the\nopening keynote address at the 2018 Conference on Community Banking in the 21st Century. This is the\nsixth conference in this important series sponsored by the Fed, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors,\nand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). As you look at the agenda, you’ll see that it is\nquite distinct from other conferences in mixing together researchers, practitioners, regulators, and\npolicymakers. I am a big proponent of the thesis that examining issues from diverse perspectives and\ndiscussing those perspectives yields better policy and regulatory decisions. So I am very much looking\nforward to the conversations we will have over the next two days about the future of community banking.\nToday, I will focus the bulk of my remarks on the efforts being undertaken to modernize the Community\nReinvestment Act. The views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nBanking is on a lot of people’s minds these days. Last month marked the 10-year anniversary of the\nfailure of Lehman Brothers, a watershed moment at the start of the global financial crisis. It’s hard to\nhave lived through the crisis and not been changed by it. Researchers had to rethink their well-established\ntheories of how financial markets and institutions actually operate; they had to identify the deficiencies in\ntheir models and poor inferences from empirical analyses. Policymakers and regulators had to rethink the\neffectiveness of banking regulation and supervision in ensuring the stability of the financial system as a\nwhole; their eyes were opened to the inter-connectedness and complexity of the global financial system\nand its regulations. Bankers had to take stock of how they monitored the risks they were taking and\nwhether they had sufficient capital and liquidity to weather what could be unexpectedly deep shocks.\n\nMuch has changed over the past 10 years. Credit is generally available to financially healthy borrowers;\nthe financial system is now holding higher levels of capital and liquidity; credit quality is higher;\ninstitutions and supervisors have improved their monitoring of risk within institutions; and policymakers\n\n\f2\nare now working to identify emerging risks across the financial sector as a whole. Some of these\nimprovements were mandated by regulation, but others were undertaken by bankers themselves, having\nseen the damage that can be caused by not fully understanding the risks being taken. I think it would be a\nmistake to turn back the clock and unwind many of the important steps taken since the financial crisis to\nimprove financial system resiliency. At the same time, I support the efforts that are now underway to\nbetter align regulation and supervisory oversight with where the potential systemic risks lie, including\nproposals to make regulation less burdensome on community banks in the U.S. Better aligning our\nregulation and supervision with the risks imposed should allow for simplifications without sacrificing\nsafety, soundness, and stability. As we strive to make our regulations and supervision more effective and\nefficient, we must not forget the important lesson that maintaining a resilient financial system is necessary\nfor a healthy economy.\n\nCommunity Banks Are Trusted\nSaying that a healthy economy depends on a resilient financial system may seem like an obvious\nstatement for those in this room. But during the financial crisis, many people lost faith that the U.S.\nbanking system could deliver any benefits. The reputation of the financial industry and its regulators was\ndecidedly tarnished, some say deservedly so. But remarkably, the public did not lose faith in their local\nbanks. According to a survey published by the business schools at the University of Chicago and\nNorthwestern University, the public has put and continues to put more trust in their local banks than in\nnationwide banks, the stock market, or mutual funds. 1 I believe this is because the public understands\nthat community banks are important to the economic vitality of households, small businesses, and\n\n1\n\nThe University of Chicago’s Booth School and Northwestern University’s Kellogg School publish the Financial\nTrust Index, which is based on an annual survey of a representative sample of about 1,000 American households.\nThe 2015 results (wave 24) give trust by bank category. I thank Professor Luigi Zingales at the University of\nChicago for providing the updated results for 2017. In the 2017 survey, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means “I do\nnot trust them at all” and 5 means “I trust them completely,” the average response was 3.6 for local banks, 3.0 for\nnational banks, 2.7 for the stock market, and 2.9 for mutual funds.\n\n\f3\nneighborhoods. 2 Before turning to the Community Reinvestment Act, let me say a few words about the\nbenefits conveyed by community banks.\n\nCommunity Banks Play an Important Role in the Economy but Face Challenges\nBanks provide funding to creditworthy businesses and households. They offer customers methods for\nsaving and making payments. They help people and firms manage their financial affairs. Community\nbanks, in particular, play a crucial role in their local economies. In many small towns and rural areas,\nfinancial service providers are very limited except for community banks. 3 By investing in households and\nneighborhoods, they help promote economic prosperity in local communities. Community banks have\nbeen and continue to be an important source of credit to small businesses, which play an important role in\nthe U.S. economy. In fact, three-quarters of U.S. businesses have fewer than 10 employees, and while\nlarger businesses employ the most people, over a quarter of U.S. private-sector jobs are at firms with\nfewer than 50 employees. 4 Because small businesses tend to have less available hard quantitative\ninformation, like audited financial statements, on which to make credit decisions, they have more limited\naccess to credit from large banks or capital markets. Community banks fill that void.\n\nResearch has documented that community banks have had some advantages over larger banks in\nextending loans to smaller firms for which public information is less available. Being local, community\nbanks can forge relationships with their customers. These relationships help community banks assess the\ncreditworthiness of smaller borrowers. According to the Federal Reserve Banks’ Small Business Credit\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve classifies banking organizations with $10 billion or less in assets as community banks. Other\nanalysts define community banks as banks with assets of $1 billion or less. The FDIC uses a larger set of criteria\n(see FDIC, 2012).\n3\n4\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (2003).\n\nThese data are from Supplemental Tables F and G of the National Business Employment Dynamics Data, U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics. See Mester (2016) for further discussion of the role of small businesses in the economy.\n\n\f4\nSurvey, banks remain the most common source of financing for small businesses. 5 Community banks\naccount for about half of small-business bank lending in the U.S., and the Fed’s survey indicates that\nsmall businesses are more satisfied with their credit experience at small banks than at large banks or\nonline lenders. 6 And because they tend to finance themselves with core deposits and are less reliant on\nvolatile short-term funding sources, community banks are better able to continue to lend to their\ncustomers through times of adverse financial conditions. 7 So small banks offer a service that allows\nborrowers to weather turbulent times.\n\nDespite the benefits provided by community banks, they are facing some challenges. First, the banking\nindustry has been consolidating. Over the past two decades, the number of banking organizations has\nfallen from nearly 9,000 institutions to about 5,000, and the number of community banks, especially small\ncommunity banks, has fallen as well. 8 There are now about 1,200 banking organizations with assets of\n$100 million or less, down from about 4,000 two decades ago. At the same time, banks are getting larger.\nThere are nearly 30 banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets, compared with fewer than\n20 two decades ago, and the share of total industry assets held by these large institutions has risen from\n43 percent to nearly 70 percent.\n\nThe community bankers I speak with regularly report that they are facing higher costs of technology and\nincreased regulatory compliance burdens. These reports accord with the data in the national survey\n5\n\nFederal Reserve Banks (2017), page 14.\n\n6\n\nFederal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors (2017), Table 5, and Federal Reserve Banks\n(2017), pages 14 and 17. Eighty percent of respondents reported being satisfied with their credit experience at small\nbanks, compared with 78 percent at credit unions, 77 percent at community development financial institutions, 61\npercent at large banks, and 46 percent at online lenders.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nSee Berlin and Mester (1999) and Berger, Bouwman, and Kim (2017).\n\nThese data are compiled from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Community Banking Study Reference\nData. A banking organization is defined as an independent bank or a top‐tier bank holding company, with assets\nconsolidated across all constituent subsidiaries. All dollar figures are adjusted for inflation and in 2017 dollars.\nMcCord and Prescott (2014) summarize the changes in the size distribution of banks and discuss some of the causes\nof the changes.\n\n\f5\nconducted in association with this conference. 9 In addition, large banks, fintech companies, and other\nnonbank providers of bank services have entered local markets. Developments suggest that the\nadvantages community banks have had in offering relationship lending may be shrinking over time. 10\nAutomated lending technologies, such as small-business credit scoring and data-modeling techniques,\nhave allowed larger banks to increase their share of small-business lending, and in recent years, small\nbusinesses have increasingly been turning to larger banks for funding. New technologies, including\nonline lending platforms, have also allowed nonbank alternative lenders to increase their share of smallbusiness lending. 11 The Federal Reserve Banks’ survey indicates that the smaller small businesses (those\nwith revenues of $1 million or less) frequently turn to online lenders or other nonbank sources for credit,\neven though they report less satisfaction with these lenders.\n\nSome of my own co-authored research has documented that cost considerations may be driving\ncommunity banks to increase their size. 12 First, the average cost per dollar of assets associated with\nregulatory compliance and technological change decreases with institutions’ asset size; in other words,\nthere are scale economies. Second, larger community banks, those with assets between $1 billion and\n$10 billion, appear to do a better job capitalizing on their investment opportunities than smaller\ncommunity banks, and they achieve better financial performance as a result. Given their current\nportfolios, these larger community banks also appear to have financial incentives to expand further into\nsmall-business lending. So we might expect the trend of larger banks providing a larger portion of smallbusiness lending to continue.\n\n9\n\nSee Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors (2017).\n\n10\n\nSee Hughes, Jagtiani, Mester, and Moon (2018) for a review of this literature.\n\n11\n\nSee the papers by Jagtiani and Lemieux (2016, 2018).\n\n12\n\nSee Hughes, Jagtiani, Mester, and Moon (2018).\n\n\f6\nFrom the borrowers’ and savers’ viewpoint, entry of new players, new technologies, and increased\ncompetition can be beneficial. But from community bankers’ perspective, these factors present\nchallenges and may spur banks to move into products and services with which they have less experience.\nThey also presents challenges to regulators who typically have less insight into nonbank financial\nproviders, making it more difficult to ensure that the institutions providing these services do so in a safe\nand sound manner.\n\nIn this challenging environment, the Federal Reserve has been working to ensure that our supervisory\noversight aligns with potential risks and that we are bringing a cost-benefit perspective to the rules we use\nto implement regulations. Recently, attention has turned to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and\nways we might make its implementation more effective and efficient given the technological and\ncompetitive changes affecting the banking environment.\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act Has Had a Positive Effect on Lending in Underserved Areas\nIn 1977, Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act to help address concerns about the\ndeterioration in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods throughout the U.S. At the time, many people\nblamed urban decline on limited credit availability and illegal practices such as redlining. The CRA\nreaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to\ndo business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods. 13\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the other federal bank supervisors – the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) – are charged with implementing the\nact. Regulators periodically review how well a bank is serving the needs in its geographic service area,\nidentified by the bank based on the location of its branches and ATMs and where a substantial portion of\n13\n\nFor more on the historical context of the CRA, see Braunstein (2008) and Federal Reserve System (2014).\n\n\f7\nits loans are. The CRA requires regulators to make public the ratings and written evaluation of the banks’\nperformance on the CRA.\n\nThe Fed is deeply committed to ensuring that the goal of the CRA is met: that banks serve their entire\ncommunity and, in particular, the credit needs in low- and moderate-income areas. The Fed’s community\ndevelopment function, which grew out of our responsibilities with respect to the CRA, has been helping\nto build relationships between financial institutions and community development professionals. One\nexample is the Investment Connection program, developed by the Kansas City Fed, which links\ncommunity and economic development organizations with CRA-eligible projects with banks seeking such\ninvestments. 14 Work is currently underway to expand the program to other regions.\n\nThe word “community” is central to the CRA. A body of research has shown that economic opportunity\nis tied not only to individual circumstances but also to place. Upward mobility – the probability that a\nchild will be better off economically than his or her parents – is dependent not only on the family’s\ncharacteristics but also on neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, racial integration,\nthe quality of schools, and access to social services. Lack of access to credit has been found to have longlasting negative effects on a neighborhood’s economic health, 15 and a body of evidence indicates that the\nCRA has provided some tangible benefits to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, although the\nmagnitude of the effects varies by study. 16\n\nBecause of the CRA, investment in low- and moderate-income areas is a fundamental part of bank\nportfolios. Evidence suggests that, on the margin, bank lending in these areas is higher than it otherwise\n14\n\nSee Mester (2017) for further discussion of the Fed’s community development function. Information about\nInvestment Connection is available on the Kansas City Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/community/investmentconnection.\n15\n\nSee Aaronson, Hartley, and Mazumder (2018).\n\n16\n\nThe Chakrabarti, et al. (2009) volume provides a selection of research articles on the effects of the CRA.\n\n\f8\nwould be without the CRA, and that this lending does not appear to be crowding out lending from\nnonbank lenders, which are not subject to the CRA. There is evidence that CRA assessment areas tend to\nattract more investment than other comparable areas in a bank’s market, 17 although there is some\nvariation across metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). For example, one study found a positive effect on\nlending in large MSAs but not in smaller ones. In particular, the study found that the CRA promotes\nmortgage credit supply to low- and moderate-income borrowers and neighborhoods in large metropolitan\nareas, particularly at times when merger activity is strong. This suggests that banks pay attention to the\nCRA’s incentives for compliance. 18\n\nIndeed, one way the CRA has encouraged investment in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods is\nthrough the formation of so-called public or community benefit agreements.19 These have primarily been\nused by larger banks during a merger application process and involve the banks committing to a\nsignificant increase in lending over a period of years after a merger is completed. Such agreements can\nqualify for CRA credit, and in the view of some advocacy groups, these agreements can meaningfully\nincrease bank branches and lending in the communities.\n\nAnother, less direct, way the CRA might increase lending is by creating a positive information externality\nfor other lenders. For example, the study I mentioned which found an increase in mortgage lending also\nfound that in markets with a low volume of home sales, higher levels of CRA lending by banks is\nassociated with higher, not lower, lending by nonbanks, the opposite of crowding-out. It is possible that\nthe higher volume of CRA lending allows other lenders to better judge the credit risk of neighborhoods in\n\n17\n\nDing and Nakamura (2017) examine lending patterns in the wake of 2004 revisions to the Philadelphia MSA and\nfind that banks supply more credit in low- and moderate-income census tracts where they receive CRA credit than in\nthose areas where they no longer receive CRA credit as a result of the boundary change. Ringo (2017) finds similar\nresults looking at all boundary changes to MSAs in 2014.\n\n18\n\nSee Bhutta (2011).\n\n19\n\nSee Silver (2018).\n\n\f9\nwhich the overall volume of home sales is low. Similarly, CRA lending may pay a future dividend to all\nlenders to the extent that CRA lending in low- and moderate-income communities allows people and\nbusinesses to develop their credit histories, which can then be used by all lenders to make more informed\nunderwriting decisions on loans to these borrowers in the future. 20\n\nFinally, one might ask whether the increased investment under the CRA is spurring banks to take on\nriskier loans, which, depending on the degree of risk, might not be a positive. One study did find higher\napproval rates on mortgage applications in the 1-1/2 year window around banks’ CRA exams and\nelevated delinquency rates on these mortgages, but the estimated effects were moderate.21 Another study\nfound that while the CRA causes a substantial increase in mortgage lending to low-income borrowers, it\ndoes not appear to increase the risk of default on those loans. 22\n\nSo, in my view, the body of evidence suggests that the CRA has had a positive effect on credit availability\nin low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, thereby supporting economic development in these areas. 23\nHowever, just as technological change, the entry of new types of lenders, industry consolidation, and new\ntechniques for delivering credit and other financial services are all affecting banking, they are also\naffecting the regulations and how the regulators should go about assessing compliance with the CRA.\n\nThe CRA Will Be Modernized to Enhance Its Effectiveness\nTo ensure that regulations continue to promote the goals for which they were intended, the federal\nregulatory agencies undertake periodic reviews and offer guidance to bankers in how they assess\n\n20\n\nSee Bhutta (2011).\n\n21\n\nSee Agarwal, et al. (2012).\n\n22\n\nSee Ringo (2017).\n\n23\n\nNot everyone shares this view. See, e.g., Yezer (2017).\n\n\f10\ncompliance. 24 While regulators have offered moderate updates and guidance on the CRA over time, the\nlast time there were substantial revisions to the framework for assessing CRA compliance was in 1995,\nover 20 years ago.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury completed a review of the CRA, engaging with a\nwide variety of stakeholders. The Treasury made some recommendations about how the CRA is\nadministered in order to help ensure that a bank’s CRA activities meet the needs of the communities it\nserves in a safe and sound manner. 25 The OCC, a part of Treasury, has put out an advance notice of\nproposed rule-making (ANPR) seeking comment on ways to modernize the CRA regulations. 26 The\nFederal Reserve is also undertaking efforts aimed at ensuring that the CRA regulations continue to meet\nthe goals of the legislation amid the evolving financial services environment. 27 The legislation is and will\nremain an important piece of the toolkit for ensuring that all communities have fair access to credit.\n\nAssessment areas\nAn important area of focus is the area over which a bank’s CRA compliance is assessed by the banking\nagencies. I say “important” because, as I’ve just discussed, CRA activity is higher in areas covered by\nCRA examinations. So getting the assessment area right will influence the CRA’s effectiveness in getting\nbanking services to low- and moderate-income areas.\n\nCurrently, the regulations largely use the location of branches and deposit-taking ATMs to determine\nassessment areas. This made sense when the CRA originally became law because these were the main\nways that banks delivered services to the markets in which they operated. Now, with interstate banking\n24\n\nFor an example of this with respect to the CRA, see Interagency (2016).\n\n25\n\nSee U.S. Department of the Treasury (2018).\n\n26\n\nSee Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2018).\n\n27\n\nSee Brainard (2018a and 2018b).\n\n\f11\npermitted and technological innovations like the internet, banks can serve communities in which they\ndon’t necessarily have a branch or ATM, and lending and investment officers can forge relationships at a\nlonger distance than they could before. Indeed, online banks offer services nationwide from one location.\nAssessing their CRA compliance based on this single location, as is currently done, seems inappropriate.\n\nBut for those banks using the traditional model, data and research suggest that branches remain very\nrelevant and the presence of a branch helps ensure that communities receive better banking services.\nDespite a drop in the number of bank branches during the Great Recession, the number of branches per\ncapita is higher now than it was two decades ago, even in the wake of significant technological advances\nover that time period. 28 This suggests that bankers themselves see value in their branch networks.\n\nWhile the recent branch closures have not occurred disproportionately in low- and moderate-income\nareas, 29 these and rural areas are particularly susceptible to becoming so-called “banking deserts,” defined\nas no banks within 10 miles of populated areas. 30,31 People in low-income tracts are more than twice as\nlikely to live in a banking desert than those in higher-income tracts. 32 And census tracts in which a\nmajority of the population comprises minorities appear to be the most affected. 33 Branch closures do\nappear to have a serious impact on service in low-income areas. One study found that bank branch\nclosings in the 2000s led to a persistent decline of about 10 percent in local small-business lending, that\n\n28\n\nBased on the FDIC’s Historical Statistics on Banking and U.S. Census Bureau data on resident population, the\nnumber of branches of commercial banks per 10,000 people was 2.24 in 1997 and 2.43 in 2017. It peaked at 2.73 in\n2008.\n29\n\nMorgan, Pinkovskiy, and Yang (2016).\n\n30\n\nSee Silver (2018) and National Community Reinvestment Coalition (2017).\n\n31\n\nYezer (2017) points out that the CRA may have inadvertently discouraged the establishment of branches,\nbecause physical offices tend to enlarge a bank’s assessment area and the requirement for more CRArelated activity.\n\n32\n\nMorgan, Pinkovskiy, and Yang (2016).\n\n33\n\nSee Nguyen (forthcoming) and National Community Reinvestment Coalition (2017).\n\n\f12\nis, lending within 6 miles of the closed branch. 34 And this negative effect on lending was found to last up\nto 6 years. The author estimates that the decline in lending led to a sizable 2 percentage point reduction in\nlocal employment growth rates. Another study found that when the proportion of local bank branches\nbelonging to small banks versus large banks increases, there is an economically and statistically\nsignificant decline in the proportion of small businesses that feel financially constrained. 35 Results like\nthese point to the importance of continuing to focus on the community aspect of the CRA, even as the\ndefinition of assessment area is updated.\n\nAllowing flexibility but being consistent\nThis discussion of assessment areas points to another way the CRA can be modernized: namely,\nrecognizing that banks come in different sizes, serve areas with different needs, and use different business\nmodels. The focus should remain on making the CRA effective. This means tailoring the assessment\napproach for different kinds of banks and allowing them to meet their CRA obligations in a way that\nplays to their strengths while best servicing their communities, which can differ in terms of credit needs\nand opportunities. Clarifying and perhaps expanding the types of lending and services that qualify for\nCRA credit should also be considered. Incorporating incentives to lend, invest, and provide financial\nservices in areas with the greatest need should be a consideration in modernizing the CRA because, as I\npreviously mentioned, banks appear to respond to incentives in the CRA.\n\nAt the same time that they are allowing more flexibility, the rules and the federal banking agencies also\nneed to take a consistent approach, making sure that they set the same expectations and the same\nexamination and rating criteria. Focusing on outcomes rather than process will allow for flexibility and\n\n34\n\nSee Nguyen (forthcoming).\n\n35\n\nBerger, Bouwman, and Kim (2017).\n\n\f13\nconsistency, and can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the CRA regulatory framework.\nProviding better clarity and consistency can yield better CRA outcomes.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, community banks have earned a high degree of public trust even as faith in other institutions\nhas fallen. But the banking environment is rapidly evolving. Changes in technology and business\ndelivery models, new entrants, and increased competition all present challenges for both community\nbanks and their regulators. But they also provide opportunities. Community banks are a vital source of\nfinancial services in local communities and will remain so as they adapt to the changing environment.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act has been an important piece of legislation, helping to ensure that all\ncommunities have access to credit, investment, and other banking services, which are so vital to economic\ndevelopment. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators are seizing the opportunity to\nupdate the CRA’s regulatory framework so that it remains effective in a changing banking environment.\nIn this effort, the Fed plans to continue its engagement with bankers and other external stakeholders to\ncollect their views. Modernization efforts will also need to be informed by research and practice. I am\nlooking forward to the discussions we’ll be having over the next two days as we discuss the future of\ncommunity banking and its regulation.\n\n\f14\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Daniel Hartley, and Bhashkar Mazumder, “The Effects of the 1930s HOLC ‘Redlining\nMaps’,” Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Working Paper No. 2017-12, revised August 2018.\n(https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12-pdf.pdf)\nAgarwal, Sumit, Efraim Benmelech, Nittai Bergman, and Amit Seru, “Did the Community Reinvestment\nAct (CRA) Lead to Risky Lending?” National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Working Paper No.\n18609, December 2012.\n(http://www.nber.org/papers/w18609)\nBerger, Allen N., Christa H.S.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThird Annual ECB Macroprudential Policy and Research Conference\nEuropean Central Bank\nFrankfurt, Germany\nMay 18, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the European Central Bank for inviting me to participate in this conference on macroprudential\npolicy and research. The work being undertaken at the ECB, other central banks, and universities has\nincreased our knowledge and understanding about the interlinkages between the macroeconomy and\nfinancial systems. It has been nine years since the financial crisis, and the global economy has improved\nsubstantially over that time. In the U.S., the economy is near both of our monetary policy goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability, and the outlook is one of the most favorable we have seen in a\nlong time. As we move further from the crisis, one lesson can never be lost: the importance of\nmaintaining a resilient financial system for a healthy economy. Today, I’ll spend my time discussing\nmonetary policy and macroprudential policy from the practical perspective of a U.S. monetary\npolicymaker. Research informs our policy decisions, but at the end of the day, decisions have to be made\nin a world that doesn’t match our models and without full information. Research can be elegant, practice\nrarely is, but when we are setting policy, effectiveness is what we strive for. Before I continue, I should\nnote that the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nU.S. Financial System Regulation and Macroprudential Tools\nIt is an understatement to say that the U.S. financial system’s regulatory structure is complex. A wide\nvariety of institutions offer financial services in the U.S. Banks, a category that includes commercial\nbanks, savings and loans, and credit unions, provide only about a third of the credit in the nation. Other\nproviders include insurance companies; mutual funds; pension funds; government-sponsored enterprises,\nincluding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which issue mortgage-backed securities; and other nonbanks,\nincluding broker-dealers, finance companies, and mortgage real estate investment trusts.1\n\n1\n\nSee Fischer (2014).\n\n\f2\nAt the federal level, there are multiple financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit\nUnion Association, the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance\nAgency. There are financial system regulators at the state level as well. In many cases, the regulatory\nauthority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by financial instrument.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which\ncontributed to a build-up in financial imbalances and systemic risk. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law\nin 2010, established provisions aimed at reducing the probability of another financial crisis and reducing\nthe costs on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. It directed the regulatory\nagencies to augment their traditional microprudential approach, which focused on the safety and\nsoundness of individual institutions, with a macroprudential approach, which encouraged assessing the\nrisk across institutions. Dodd-Frank also created a new body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council\n(FSOC), to promote coordination and information sharing across the financial system regulators. An\nimportant power of the FSOC is its ability to designate nonbanks as systemically important, bringing\nthem under more banking-type supervision and regulation. The Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System has the responsibility for supervising systemically important financial institutions,\nincluding these FSOC-designated nonbank financial companies, large bank holding companies, and the\nU.S. operations of certain foreign banking organizations.\n\nThis complex system of institutions and regulators complicates risk monitoring and the ability to tailor\nregulations and supervisory oversight to potential risks to the financial system. But there are ongoing\nefforts in the U.S. to do so, and the Federal Reserve has developed a framework for systematically\ntracking financial stability risks. Before I describe the framework, let me spend a few minutes on why the\n\n\f3\nFOMC regularly reviews financial stability, even though financial stability is not an explicit part of the\nFOMC’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nFinancial stability matters to the FOMC for several reasons. First, monetary policy affects the real\neconomy by affecting financial conditions. When financial markets are disrupted, as they were during the\nfinancial crisis, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can also be disrupted. Second, the\ngoals of monetary policy and financial stability are interconnected. Indeed, the FOMC’s statement on its\nmonetary policy strategy says that the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions “reflect its longer-run goals, its\nmedium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system\nthat could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”2 Financial stability is a necessary but not\nsufficient condition for macroeconomic stability. On the other side of the coin, macroeconomic stability\nis an important contributor to financial stability, and well-formulated and well-communicated monetary\npolicy supports financial stability.\n\nA third reason monetary policymakers need to consider financial stability is that the financial crisis\nchanged how monetary policy is implemented. From a practical standpoint, monetary policymakers have\nto be more attuned to developments in financial markets and institutions than they once were. The actions\ntaken to address the financial crisis and Great Recession increased the size and changed the composition\nof the Fed’s balance sheet. The Fed is now transacting with a broader set of financial institutions, so\npolicymakers have to have a more complete understanding of the plumbing in financial markets.\n\n2\n\nSee FOMC (2018).\n\n\f4\nThe Fed’s Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability\nThe basic framework used by Federal Reserve staff to monitor financial stability risks recognizes the\ncomplex nature of the financial system in the U.S., with its mix of bank-based and market-based finance\nand its multiplicity of regulatory and supervisory bodies.3 The framework tracks a standard set of\nfinancial system vulnerabilities that could amplify and propagate shocks. It monitors these vulnerabilities\nusing a set of indicators on various financial activities in four categories: asset valuation pressures\n(reflecting the price of risk and risk appetites among investors), leverage, maturity and liquidity\ntransformation, and interconnectedness and complexity.4 Some of these vulnerabilities, like leverage,\nvary over the business and financial cycles; others, like complexity, are more structural in nature,\nreflecting the design of markets and intermediaries. The vulnerabilities are assessed across four sectors of\nthe economy: the banking sector; the nonbank financial sector, including capital markets, nonbanks, and\nshadow banks; the nonfinancial business sector; and the household sector. Tools like heat maps and datavisualization techniques aid in tracking changes in vulnerabilities over time.5 Assessments of individual\nvulnerabilities are then combined to get an assessment of the overall vulnerability of the U.S. financial\nsystem. Recognizing the global interconnectedness of financial systems, the Fed staff has also developed\ntools to assess foreign financial stability.6\n\nFour times a year, the staff uses this framework to brief the FOMC, and an evaluation of developments\nrelated to financial stability is now a regular section in the Board of Governors’ monetary policy report to\nCongress.7\n\n3\n\nSee Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013, 2015).\n\n4\n\nImportant research on the propagation and amplification of shocks throughout the financial system includes\nKiyotaki and Moore (1997), Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014), and Gorton and Ordoñez (2014).\n5\n\nSee Aikman, et al. (2015a, 2015b).\n\n6\n\nFor example, see FOMC (2017), page 5.\n\n7\n\nSee Board of Governors (2018a).\n\n\f5\nMacroprudential Policy and Monetary Policy\nAlthough the FOMC regularly discusses financial system stability, the financial system regulators,\nincluding the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (a group that is distinct from the FOMC), have\nresponsibility for maintaining and enhancing the structural resilience of the financial system. In the U.S.,\nstructural resilience is promoted by requiring higher levels and quality of capital (including a minimum\nnon-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards); conducting stress tests; imposing\nliquidity standards; developing effective resolution methods for systemically important banks and\nnonbank financial institutions; requiring large banks to submit living will resolution plans; and\nimplementing reforms to improve the stability of certain nonbank markets.8 Financial regulators are also\nfocused on working with the industry to enhance strategies to improve the cyber resiliency of the financial\nsector, as cybersecurity risk is a continuing threat to financial stability.\n\nIn contrast to the structural tools, compared to other countries, the U.S. has fewer countercyclical tools\nthat can be varied with the perceived level of vulnerabilities in the financial system. However, the stress\ntests can be used as a countercyclical tool to the extent that the vulnerabilities of concern can be built into\nthe stress scenarios. For example, this year’s adverse stress scenario includes deep declines in corporate\nbond and real estate prices.9 Another cyclical tool available in the U.S. is the countercyclical capital\nbuffer (CCyB), which can be imposed on internationally active banks. The Federal Reserve Board has\nindicated that it will use this tool only when systemic vulnerabilities are “meaningfully above normal”\nand that, when using the tool, it intends to increase the buffer gradually.10 The Board anticipates giving\n\n8\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission implemented revisions to the regulations governing money market\nmutual funds in 2014 and 2016 to reduce the chance of investor runs on these funds. In 2009, the G20 countries\nagreed that standardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts should be cleared by central counterparties. There\nare limits to interday credit exposures in the tri-party repo market.\n9\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018b).\n\n10\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016). Other countries have used limits on loan-to-value\nratios and debt-to-income ratios that vary over the cycle and are targeted to particular sectors like housing or\nhousehold credit to control leverage. See Liang (2013) and Fischer (2014).\n\n\f6\nbanking organizations 12 months before an increase would become effective.11 The U.S. has not had\nmuch experience with this tool. It has yet to set a positive countercyclical capital buffer, even though\ncountercyclical policy calls for building up buffers during good times so that they are available during bad\ntimes. And the lead times needed to use this tool likely make it less effective at addressing vulnerabilities\nthat may rapidly develop or may be detected only after they have had time to develop. So focusing on\nincreasing the resiliency of the financial system’s structure across the business and financial cycles seems\nwell-founded. And from a practical viewpoint, even if, in theory, using countercyclical tools might be\npreferred, their limits suggest we need to at least contemplate using monetary policy to address financial\nstability in some cases.\n\nIndeed, the limits to the macroprudential tools were illuminated in a tabletop exercise in which I\nparticipated with some other Federal Reserve Bank presidents.12 The exercise involved a hypothetical\nscenario in which commercial real estate prices were rising sharply but the economy was at full\nemployment and inflation was somewhat below goal. The objective of the exercise was for policymakers\nto use available macroprudential tools and possibly monetary policy to reduce the risk posed to financial\nstability by the commercial real estate boom while fostering the Fed’s monetary policy goals.\nImplementation challenges included having to coordinate across multiple regulators or, in some cases, to\nfollow legally required administrative procedures like public comment periods, which delay application\nof the tools. Such delays could make the tools ineffective or even cause them to exacerbate the situation\nrather than shore up the financial system. Another limitation was that some tools applied only to\nregulated banking firms, which could result in risks shifting to other parts of the financial system. I came\naway from the exercise more convinced of the need to focus on the structural resilience of the financial\nsystem across the business and financial cycles.\n\n11\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017).\n\n12\n\nSee Adrian, et al. (2015).\n\n\f7\n\nWhether monetary policy should be used to address financial stability risks, such as sharply rising credit\ngrowth, is still an open question.13 The benefits depend on the extent to which monetary policy would be\neffective at stemming financial imbalances, thereby lowering the probability of a financial crisis or\nlimiting the effects of the crisis, and whether or not there are macroprudential tools that could be used\ninstead. Any benefits of attempting to use monetary policy to stem financial imbalances would need to be\nweighed against the cost of slowing the economy and increasing the volatility of output and of inflation.14\n\nLet me now turn to the practical question of how the decisions about financial stability policy and\nmonetary policy might effectively be organized, and then end with some conclusions.\n\nThe Governance of Financial Stability Policy\nI argued earlier that the goals of monetary policy and financial stability policy are complementary over\nthe longer run. But the policies do interact, and at times, there can be short-run trade-offs between\nmonetary policy actions taken to support macroeconomic stability and financial stability. For example, an\nextended period of very low interest rates aimed at returning the macroeconomy to health might also\ngenerate financial imbalances and pose potential risks to financial stability by spurring investors to search\nfor yield. Or a tightening of macroprudential policy to address financial stability risks could result in\ntighter financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that a monetary policy\nresponse would be needed to promote macroeconomic stability.\n13\n\nBorio, et al. (2018) argue that monetary policy should be more attentive to the financial cycle. Svensson (2017)\nargues against “leaning against the wind.” International Monetary Fund (2015) and Smets (2014) review the\nliterature on the use of monetary policy for financial stability.\n14\n\nAn interesting paper by Gourio, Kashyap, and Sim (2017) shows that the cost-benefit analysis depends on the\nnature of the shocks hitting the economy and the severity of the financial crisis. In the case of only demand and\nproductivity shocks, having monetary policy focus only on macroeconomic stability also limits the probability of a\nfinancial crisis. But when there are financial shocks and when a financial crisis would have a large negative impact\non the economy, using monetary policy to limit credit growth would increase welfare, even though it would mean\nhigher volatility of output and inflation.\n\n\f8\n\nIn many countries, responsibility for monetary policy and responsibility for financial stability policy are\nhandled by two different committees, which, in some cases, have some members in common.15 Canada’s\nfinancial sector regulator is not part of the central bank, but the Bank of Canada assesses financial system\nvulnerabilities and risks and publishes this assessment twice a year.16 In Sweden, the financial stability\nauthority is not part of the central bank, but the central bank publishes a financial stability report and its\ngovernor sits on the financial stability council, an advisory board. The ECB is somewhat different, with\nresponsibility for both monetary policy and macroprudential policy ultimately resting with the ECB\nGoverning Council.\n\nThe U.K. has a two-committee structure housed within the Bank of England. The monetary policy and\nfinancial policy committees are independent, but they also share members, which allows for good\ncommunication and information sharing between the two committees. One example of coordination came\nin August 2013 when the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee initiated forward guidance that\nit would hold interest rates low and consider additional asset purchases at least until the unemployment\nrate had fallen to 7 percent.17 But it also said that a condition that would vacate this guidance would be if\nthe Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee found that the stance of monetary policy was\nthreatening financial stability in a way that couldn’t be contained by the available macroprudential tools.\n\nIn the U.S., financial system complexity means that we don’t have a single authority that oversees\nfinancial stability. While the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has the ability to designate\nfirms as systemically important financial institutions and, therefore, subject to enhanced regulation by the\n\n15\n\nKohn (2015) discusses the benefits of what he calls this two-committee approach.\n\n16\n\nSee Bank of Canada (2017).\n\n17\n\nKohn (2014) discusses this example, and see Bank of England (2013).\n\n\f9\nFed, the FSOC does not have the authority to take actions to mitigate emerging risks. Instead, it can\nmake recommendations to the regulatory agencies and to Congress, which can then decide to act or not.18\n\nBut all is not lost. With its oversight of systemically important financial institutions, the Board of\nGovernors plays an important role in setting macroprudential policy in the U.S. The Board also\nconstitutes part of the FOMC, so that there is a potential for some coordination between macroprudential\npolicy and monetary policy or, at the very least, good communication and information sharing. In some\nsense, the U.S. has a two-committee set-up and one could imagine a relationship between the FOMC and\nthe Board of Governors similar to that between the two policy committees in the U.K.\n\nIn the U.S., housing both committees within the central bank has an important governance benefit. By\ndesign, the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions are independent from short-run political considerations,\nwith appropriate accountability to elected officials and the public. Similarly, it is also important that\npolicymakers have some independence in setting macroprudential policy.19 There will be times when\ntools have to be used well before there are clear signs of instability. This might be difficult to explain,\nand there may be various interests that would prefer the tools not be invoked in seemingly good times.\nThis means that macroprudential policymakers should be communicating with the public to improve the\npublic’s understanding of how financial stability risks are being monitored, what tools are available to\npromote financial resilience, and the rationale for macroprudential policy decisions. Systematic and\ntransparent application of financial stability policy would seem to be as important as it is in the conduct of\nmonetary policy. Still, we are a distance away from being able to articulate a clear strategy and a set of\nprinciples to guide decisions about the circumstances under which monetary policy should be used as a\ntool for financial stability and when we should rely upon macroprudential tools.\n18\n19\n\nKohn (2014) compares and contrasts the financial stability structure in the U.S. with that in the U.K.\n\nKohn (2014) discusses the importance of the financial stability authority being able to pursue its goals\nindependent of short-run political considerations even when the actions taken aren’t popular.\n\n\f10\n\nConclusions\nLet me conclude with three points I take away from this practical viewpoint on financial resilience and\nmonetary policy in the U.S.\n\nFirst, given some of the limitations on macroprudential tools and the complexity of financial system\nregulation, ensuring the structural resilience of the financial system throughout the cycle is the first line of\ndefense in promoting financial stability. Higher levels and quality of capital, liquidity standards, stress\ntests, living wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically important bank and nonbank financial\ninstitutions are all important tools for improving resilience. In my view, we should set standards for the\nstructural resilience tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more experience with and\nconfidence in the countercyclical tools. I support efforts to better align regulation and supervisory\noversight with where the potential system risks lie, including proposals to make regulation less\nburdensome on community banks in the U.S. However, I think it would be a mistake to unwind the steps\ntaken since the financial crisis that have led to a more resilient financial system. I would like to see how\nthe new settings perform throughout the cycle before making major changes.\n\nSecond, monetary policymakers need to monitor the resiliency of the financial system and be cognizant of\nthe interlinkages between monetary policy, financial imbalances, and financial stability risks. In a\nsituation of rising financial stability risks, while using macroprudential tools might be preferred, we have\nhad little experience with these tools. If they proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks\ncontinued to grow, monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. Note that, in this case,\nthe blurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the\nrisks to financial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals\nwould also be in jeopardy over the medium run.\n\n\f11\nThird, it will be important for the FOMC and Board of Governors to make progress toward a systematic\nstrategy for handling the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability, including the\nappropriate use of monetary policy to counteract financial imbalances, and to communicate this strategy\nto the public. There are two concrete steps the Federal Reserve can take now. The Fed can continue to\nhold tabletop exercises designed to illuminate the interactions between macroprudential policy and\nmonetary policy. These scenario exercises can help clarify policymakers’ views on the appropriate use of\neach type of policy and help the Federal Reserve develop a systematic strategy for dealing with the\ninteractions between the policies. In addition, similar to other central banks, the Fed can develop and\npublish a financial stability report, which discusses the Fed’s assessment of financial system\nvulnerabilities. This report could also provide more context for the Board’s decisions about the\ncountercyclical capital buffer and any regulatory guidance aimed at mitigating emerging risks.\n\nIn summary, I believe the steps taken since the financial crisis have made the financial system more\nresilient. Today, systemically important financial institutions have higher capital and liquidity buffers\nand better risk-management systems. However, we cannot take greater resiliency for granted. If, as many\neconomists predict, the new normal is a world with lower equilibrium interest rates, then the interactions\nbetween monetary policy and financial stability are likely to remain center stage.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nGlobal Interdependence Center Central Banking Series with Banque de France\nParis, France\nMay 14, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me begin by thanking the Global Interdependence Center and the Banque de France for inviting me\nback to this important conference series. I always learn a lot from the GIC’s Central Banking Series\nconferences, and I am proud of the association I have had with the GIC for many years.\n\nThree years ago when I spoke here, I reviewed the tools that monetary policymakers had put in place to\naddress the financial crisis and Great Recession. I discussed the Federal Reserve’s plans for normalizing\npolicy and some of the challenges we would face as we transitioned from extraordinary economic and\npolicy times back to ordinary times. Today, the environment has changed, but policymakers, as always,\ncontinue to face challenges in determining the most effective policies within the environment. So today,\nI’d like to carry on the theme and talk about current and future issues that Fed policymakers will face as\nwe set appropriate monetary policy. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary\npolicymaking body within the Fed.\n\nThe U.S. Economy\nThe U.S. economy is performing very well and I expect that to continue. Over this year and next, I expect\nabove-trend output growth, continued strength in labor markets, and firming inflation. I believe the U.S.\neconomy is slightly beyond maximum employment, from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions\nmonetary policy can address, and that inflation will reach our symmetric 2 percent goal on a sustainable\nbasis over the next one to two years. This outlook is based on favorable underlying fundamentals,\nincluding accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, healthy household balance sheets, rising personal\nincome, a global economy that is improving overall, and stable inflation expectations.\n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there are risks around the outlook. Financial market volatility has risen\nfrom the very low levels of recent years. But, so far, investors seem to be taking it in stride and firms tell\n\n\f2\nus the volatility has not thwarted their spending plans. The rise in oil prices and increase in the value of\nthe dollar are worth watching. Geopolitical risks have risen and there is uncertainty around trade, which\nmay not be resolved soon. Assessing the impact of trade developments on the U.S. macroeconomy will\nultimately depend on the actions actually taken by the U.S. and its trading partners. But in the meantime,\ncontinued uncertainty may also cause businesses and investors to reevaluate their outlook for the U.S.\neconomy and alter their spending in the near term. We will need to continue to monitor the trade\nsituation. On the upside, the tax package and increased federal spending in the U.S. are expected to add\nto an already healthy level of spending in the second half of this year and next year, but the magnitudes\nand exact timing are still somewhat uncertain.\n\nDespite the risks, this is one of the most favorable outlooks we have had in a long time, so one might ask:\nWhat are the challenges? The task before monetary policymakers is to calibrate policy to this healthy\noutlook to meet and maintain our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. At its\nmeeting earlier this month, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This was consistent with the strategy the FOMC has followed as progress has\nbeen made on our monetary policy goals, namely, to gradually remove the high level of accommodation\nthat was needed to address the Great Recession. Also, at the May meeting, the FOMC continued to\nimplement its plan, initiated last October, to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet in terms of the size and\ncomposition of assets.1 The balance sheet grew in size and lengthened in maturity during the Great\nRecession when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets in order to put further\ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates.2 We are now allowing maturing longer-term assets to\n\n1\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf).\n2\n\nAs a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6 percent\nof nominal GDP, to about $4.4 trillion today, or 22 percent of nominal GDP. The balance sheet’s composition\nchanged from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\n\n\f3\nroll off the balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way; this process will take several years to\ncomplete.\n\nThe economy is dynamic, so calibrating monetary policy to the medium-run outlook involves several\nmoving parts. Essentially, the challenge for policymakers is to assess current and future performance on\nour policy goals of maximum employment and price stability, and to assess the current and appropriate\nfuture stance of monetary policy. So let me discuss each of these.\n\nMaximum Employment\nThe U.S. labor market is strong. The unemployment rate, at 3.9 percent, is below its lowest point during\nthe last expansion and near its lowest point in the past 40 years. I expect the unemployment rate to fall\nfurther this year and to remain below 4 percent next year. This year, payroll job growth has strengthened\nto an average of 200,000 jobs per month. This is well above most economists’ estimates of trend job\ngrowth, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month. The trend estimate depends on what\none assumes about labor force participation, and this is a key factor in determining whether the economy\nis at or beyond the level of employment that is sustainable over the longer run.\n\nBased on demographic factors, including the aging of the U.S. population, the longer-run trend in\nparticipation is downward sloping. But the labor force participation rate has been fairly stable over the\npast two years, a sign of strength in the labor market. We are increasingly hearing from a wide variety of\nbusinesses and job placement firms that it is hard to find workers, for both higher-skill and lower-skill\noccupations, and firms are responding to labor shortages by raising wages. The acceleration in the\nemployment cost index over the past two years suggests that the anecdotal reports of firms raising wages\nto attract and retain workers are now filtering through to the official statistics.\n\n\f4\nAn issue for policymakers is that it is difficult to know with precision how tight labor markets are. The\nacceleration in compensation growth, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to about 2-3/4 percent\nmore recently, is not as strong as one might normally expect from tight labor markets. In my view, part\nof the reason for this is the low level of productivity growth over the expansion. Over the longer run,\nwages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this expansion,\nlabor productivity growth has been on the order of only 1 percent.3 This is less than half the pace over the\nprior two expansions. Research from the Cleveland Fed staff suggests that nominal wage growth over the\nexpansion is not a puzzle if you account for productivity growth, labor market conditions, and inflation.4\n\nNonetheless, economists and policymakers have to take on board all the data when assessing where the\neconomy is relative to goal. The movements in labor force participation, combined with the fact that\nwage and price inflation have remained moderate even as labor markets have strengthened, suggest that\nlabor market conditions may not be as tight as we originally assumed. As the expansion has played out,\nFOMC policymakers have lowered their estimates of the longer-run level of unemployment; these\nestimates come with a considerable amount of uncertainty. Five years ago, in the March 2013 Summary\nof Economic Projections, the central tendency of projections of the longer-run unemployment rate ranged\nfrom 5.2 to 6.0 percent.5 In projections this March, the central tendency was 4.3 to 4.7 percent, down a\n\n3\n\nLabor productivity as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 1 percent\nover this expansion.\n4\n\nSee Pinheiro, Roberto and Meifeng Yang, “Wage Growth after the Great Recession,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland Economic Commentary, March 21, 2017\n(https://clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economiccommentaries/ec-201704-wage-growth-after-great-recession.aspx).\n5\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections section of FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,”\nMarch 19-20, 2013\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20130320.pdf).\n\n\f5\npercentage point or more, with a median projection of 4.5 percent.6 I have also moved down my own\nestimate of the longer-run unemployment rate over time, to 4.5 percent.\n\nDespite lower estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate, in my view, if one combines all the\nindicators, labor markets do appear to be slightly beyond maximum employment, and the outlook\nsuggests that labor markets will continue to be tight over the next couple of years. In the past, when labor\nmarkets have moved too far beyond maximum employment, with the unemployment rate moving\nsubstantially below estimates of its longer-run level for some time, the economy overheated, inflation\nrose, and the economy ended up in a recession. Achieving a soft landing is difficult and recent research\nby Cleveland Fed staff suggests that a strategy to overheat the economy in an attempt to pull more people\nback into the workforce is unlikely to have a lasting effect on labor force participation.7 An interesting\npaper by economists at Stanford University and the University of Chicago suggests that overly tight labor\nmarkets can result in firms having to meet rising demand by hiring workers into jobs that are not the best\nmatch to their skill sets.8 The longer this need to hire lower-productivity workers continues, the larger the\ndecline in employment when the inevitable bad shock and downturn comes. All this suggests that\npolicymakers have to continue to assess labor market conditions, and to balance progress on this goal\nwith progress on our other objective, price stability.\n\n6\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections section of FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,”\nMarch 20-21, 2018\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180321.pdf).\n7\n\nFallick, Bruce, and Pawel Krolikowski, “Hysteresis in Employment among Disadvantaged Workers,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper 18-01, February 2018\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2018-working-papers/wp1801-hysteresis-in-employment-among-disadvantaged-workers.aspx).\n8\n\nJackson, Matthew O., and Pietro Tebaldi, “A Forest Fire Theory of the Duration of a Boom and the Size of a\nSubsequent Bust,” Working Paper, Stanford University and University of Chicago, June 2017\n(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2263501).\n\n\f6\nPrice Stability\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The FOMC aims\nfor inflation to be 2 percent because it believes that this rate is most consistent over the longer run with\nour statutory mandate. The goal is symmetric, meaning that the FOMC would be concerned if inflation\nwere running persistently above or persistently below this goal and such persistent deviations would\nwarrant a policy response.9\n\nInflation measures can vary from month to month due to idiosyncratic factors and in response to\ntemporary economic and financial disturbances. So when we assess where inflation is relative to our\ngoal, it is important to look through transitory movements and focus on where inflation is going on a\nsustained basis. Our goal is expressed in terms of total PCE inflation, but policymakers also look at a\nvariety of other measures of inflation to get a sense of the underlying inflation trend. These include CPI\nmeasures; core measures of PCE and CPI, which exclude food and energy prices because they tend to be\nvolatile; and the trimmed-mean and median measures, which drop those components with the largest and\nsmallest changes. We also use various models to forecast inflation. The models include components to\naccount for current and past inflation, utilization rates of labor and capital, and inflation expectations. As\ngood as our various models are, it’s important to remember that a significant portion of the variation in\ninflation rates comes from idiosyncratic factors that can’t be forecasted.10 So forecasts of inflation, like\nthose of longer-run unemployment, have wide error bands. For example, based on historical forecast\n\n9\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012;\nas amended effective January 30, 2018\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf).\n10\n\nSee Yellen, Janet, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial\nLecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/yellen20150924a.pdf).\n\n\f7\nerrors over the past 20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE inflation one to two\nyears ahead is around 1.0 percentage point.11\n\nInflation has been running under the 2 percent goal for much of the expansion, but it has been firming and\nis now near our goal. Measured year-over-year, in March, total PCE inflation rose to 2.0 percent and core\nPCE inflation rose to 1.9 percent. These are welcome developments, but it is too soon to say that we have\nmet our inflation goal on a sustained basis. Near-term monthly readings of inflation have risen, but some\nof the pickup reflects higher commodity prices and some of the strength is likely to be temporary, as low\nreadings from last March drop out of the calculations.\n\nI expect to see month-to-month variation in the numbers around an underlying upward trend in inflation,\nas inflation moves to our goal on a sustainable basis over the next year or so. One of the challenges for\nmonetary policymakers will be to keep the public and market participants focused on the medium-run\noutlook for inflation, even as higher monthly readings in the near term are followed by some softer\nreadings. We don’t want inflation expectations to react to these temporary movements, and policymakers\ncan best avoid that by continuing to convey through policy decisions and communications that we are\ncommitted to achieving our dual mandate goals. Consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run monetary policy\nstrategy, I am comfortable looking through transitory movements in inflation – those to the low side and\nthose to the high side – as we aim for inflation over the longer run to be at our symmetric 2 percent\nobjective, allowing for the normal variation in measured inflation.\n\n11\n\nSee Table 2: “Average Historical Projection Error Ranges,” in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of\nthe “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” March 20-21, 2018\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180321.pdf).\n\n\f8\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nAs the FOMC said in its May statement, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\nCurrently, one indicator that policy is accommodative is that the fed funds rate, adjusted for inflation, is\nnegative even though the economic outlook is strong. Another indicator is that many monetary policy\nrules are pointing to higher interest rates given the outlook. For example, the simple monetary policy\nrules across several forecasts that are available on the Cleveland Fed’s external website indicate that\npolicy rates should be rising given the forecasts, with the median path somewhat steeper in the near term\nthan the median funds rate path in the March Summary of Economic Projections.12\n\nIn its May statement, the FOMC also said it expects economic conditions will evolve in a manner that\nwill warrant further gradual increases in the fed funds rate. In my view, the medium-run outlook supports\nthe continued gradual removal of policy accommodation; it seems the best strategy for balancing the risks\nto both of our policy goals and avoiding a build-up of financial stability risks. We want to give inflation\ntime to move back to goal, and I don’t expect inflation to pick up sharply; this argues against a steep path.\nAt the same time, the economy is slightly beyond maximum employment, and financial conditions are\naccommodative. In my view, it is appropriate to continue to remove some of the monetary policy\naccommodation to ensure that we avoid a build-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if\nthe economy were allowed to overheat or a build-up of financial imbalances or risks to financial stability\nthat could arise from the extended period of very low interest rates. Of course, the path policy actually\ntakes will depend on how the economy actually evolves. If the upside risks to growth come to pass, we\nmay need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we may need to go a bit slower,\nbut the gradual upward path is consistent with the modal economic outlook at this time.\n\n12\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, “Simple Monetary Policy Rules”\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx).\n\n\f9\nAs we continue to move rates up, we will have to continue to assess whether monetary policy is\naccommodative, neutral, or restrictive. Essentially, it requires assessing where the policy rate is relative\nto the level of the short-term interest rate that represents neutral monetary policy, that is, the equilibrium\ninterest rate. This equilibrium interest rate will vary with economic conditions that affect the demand for\ninvestment and the supply of savings; there are wide error bands around estimates of this rate; and the rate\nover a short-run horizon can differ from that over a longer horizon. For example, as the economy\ndeteriorated during the financial crisis and Great Recession, the short-run equilibrium interest rate fell to a\nlevel below what would be expected to prevail over the longer run. Now, with fiscal policy turning from\nrestrictive to stimulative, the economy growing above trend, and investment rising, the short-term\nequilibrium interest rate is rising, too.\n\nAs the expansion continues, it could be that in order to maintain our policy goals, we may need to move\nthe fed funds rate, for a time, a bit above the level of the funds rate that is expected to prevail over the\nlonger run. Indeed, the March Summary of Economic Projections indicates that the median appropriate\npolicy path has the fed funds rate in 2020 moving a bit above the estimate of its longer-run level, which is\nabout 3 percent. Of course, 2020 is a long time away and the policy path actually followed will be\nresponsive to changes in the outlook.\n\nIn terms of that estimate of the longer-run fed funds rate, one needs to consider what policy rate is\nconsistent with maximum employment and stable inflation over the longer run. There is reason to believe\nthat this equilibrium rate is lower now than it used to be. In fact, FOMC participants have been lowering\ntheir estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate over time. For example, in March 2014, the median\nestimate was 4 percent. Now it is about 3 percent. The equilibrium rate is related to the longer-run\npotential growth rate of the economy, which itself depends on the growth of the labor force and the\ngrowth of productivity, a measure of how effectively the economy combines labor and capital to create\noutput.\n\n\f10\n\nBased on demographics, U.S. labor force growth is projected to be considerably slower than it has been in\nrecent decades.13 While some of the slow growth in labor productivity during this expansion has been\ncyclical, more persistent structural factors may also be at play.14 The combination of slow labor force\ngrowth and slow productivity growth suggests that the potential growth rate of the economy will be lower\nthan it was in the past. My own estimate of output growth over the longer run is 2 percent, which is a lot\nslower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s, and my own estimate of the longerrun nominal fed funds rate is 3 percent, or 1 percent in real terms.\n\nOf course, policy changes outside the realm of monetary policy could foster higher productivity growth\nand labor force growth and ultimately support higher potential output growth and equilibrium interest\nrates. But such policies need to be implemented as the country puts its longer-run fiscal situation on a\nsustainable path. Recently released projections by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that under\ncurrent policy, the U.S. federal deficit as a share of GDP will be considerably higher 10 years from now,\nwith rising government debt levels implying that a higher share of government spending will go to\n\n13\n\nIn the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered\nthe workforce. But since then, labor force growth has slowed, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over\n2010-2016, and it is expected to remain near that level over the next decade.

The FOMC could make\nsmall changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries, and this allowed the FOMC to\nensure that the fed funds rate was maintained at the FOMC’s target. But now, as a result of the Fed’s\nlarge-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks are holding a bit more than $2\ntrillion in reserves in accounts at the Fed, and almost all of this is in excess of what is required by\nregulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate.\nInstead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into its target range by adjusting the rate it pays on excess\nreserves, and by using overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which help put a floor on the fed funds\n\n15\n\nThe deficit as a percentage of GDP (adjusted to exclude the effects of shifting payments from one fiscal year into\nanother so that those payments are not made on a weekend) was 3.5 percent in 2017. Under the CBO’s baseline\nassumptions, the CBO projects that this ratio will rise to 4.2 percent this year and be 4.8 percent in 2028. See\nSummary Table 2 from CBO, “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028,” Congress of the United States,\nApril 2018\n(https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53651).\n16\n\nFor further discussion of monetary policy frameworks, see Mester, Loretta J., “Monetary Policy Frameworks,”\nNational Association for Business Economics and American Economic Association Session at the Allied Social\nScience Associations Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, January 5, 2018\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180105-monetary-policy-frameworks),\nand Mester, Loretta J., “Remarks on the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework,” panel remarks at the 2018 U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School\nof Business, New York, NY, February 23, 2018\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180223-remarks-on-the-fomcs-monetarypolicy-framework).\n\n\f12\nrate. As normalization of the balance sheet progresses, the FOMC will need to decide which operating\nframework it will use going forward. The fed funds market has changed considerably since the financial\ncrisis, and part of the consideration will be whether the fed funds rate will remain the best indicator of the\ngeneral level of short-run interest rates.17\n\nAnother issue for the FOMC is the strategic framework it uses to determine appropriate monetary policy.\nCurrently, we use a flexible inflation-targeting framework, which has served the FOMC well in\neffectively promoting our policy goals. But as the economy moves back to normal, it seems an opportune\ntime for the FOMC to undertake a study of its framework. As a matter of good governance, a central\nbank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models. Moreover, if the longer-term\nequilibrium real interest rate does remain lower than in past decades, there will be less room for monetary\npolicy to cushion against a negative economic shock, policy would likely hit the zero lower bound more\noften, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would have to be used more often. To the extent that\nthese tools are less effective or are constrained from being used, the potential is for longer recessions and\nlonger bouts of low inflation.\n\nGiven this potential scenario, now is the time to assess whether changes to our current framework could\nmake monetary policy more effective in achieving our goals. Researchers have suggested several\nalternative frameworks, such as targeting an inflation rate higher than 2 percent, moving to an inflationtargeting range instead of a point goal, or targeting a path for the price level or for nominal GDP rather\nthan for inflation. None of these alternative frameworks are without challenges, but the positives and\n\n17\n\nFor a review of changes in the fed funds market since the financial crisis, see Craig, Ben R. and Sara Millington,\n“The Federal Funds Market since the Financial Crisis,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary,\nApril 5, 2017\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economiccommentaries/ec-201707-the-federal-funds-market-since-the-financial-crisis.aspx).\n\n\f13\nnegatives should be thoroughly reviewed to evaluate whether the net benefits of any of the alternatives\nwould outweigh those of the flexible inflation-targeting framework currently in use.\n\nConclusion\nThree years ago at this conference, I discussed the challenges U.S. monetary policymakers faced in\npreparing for the start of monetary policy normalization. Today, the medium-run outlook for the U.S.\neconomy is very favorable and policy normalization is well underway. While the economic environment\nhas changed, monetary policy challenges remain. I appreciate the opportunity this conference has given\nme to explain how I’m approaching some of the policy issues the FOMC faces. I look forward to your\nquestions.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business and Deloitte LLP\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nApril 19, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me begin by thanking Dean Arjang Assad of the Katz Graduate School of Business and Dmitri Shiry\nof Deloitte for inviting me to speak with you this evening. Dmitri performs important public service as a\nmember of the board of directors of the Cleveland Fed’s Pittsburgh Branch, and it just so happens that\nthis building formerly housed our branch. In addition to including the western part of Pennsylvania, the\nCleveland Fed’s District comprises the state of Ohio and parts of Kentucky and West Virginia. The\nregional nature of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for more than 100 years. It allows\nmonetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people and\nhelps ensure that those decisions incorporate information from all parts of the country, not just\nWashington, D.C. or Wall Street.\n\nThis evening, I would like to give you my perspectives on the economy and monetary policy. My\nremarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nSome Context: The Medium-Run Outlook and Monetary Policy\nLet me start with some context. Monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. Some sectors are more\nsensitive to interest rates than others, so it takes some time for changes in monetary policy to be\ntransmitted through all parts of the economy. This means monetary policymakers have to formulate an\noutlook for the economy over the medium run and evaluate the risks around that outlook in order to set\nappropriate policy.\n\nAlthough we use state-of-the-art techniques and incorporate official data and anecdotal information from\nour contacts across the country, there is still a lot of uncertainty around any economic forecast. Indeed, in\nspeaking about FOMC projections, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said, “The only economic forecast in\n\n\f2\nwhich I have complete confidence is that the economy will not evolve along the precise path implied by\nour projections.” 1\n\nBut just because we cannot forecast the future with as much precision as we’d like does not mean that the\nexercise is without value. The discipline of forecasting and assessing risks over the medium run helps us\navoid focusing too much on short-run changes in the economic data or volatility in financial markets. It\nhelps us be systematic, yet responsive to changes in economic conditions to the extent that they change\nthe outlook. And the more that people understand this process, the more they’ll be able to anticipate\nwhere policy is likely to go even if the economy develops in unexpected ways.\n\nWith that as background, let me turn to the outlook.\n\nThe Economy\nI expect 2018 to be another good year for the economy, with above-trend growth, continued labor market\nstrength, and firming inflation. The economy will be supported by favorable fundamentals, including\naccommodative monetary and fiscal policy, healthy household balance sheets, rising personal income,\nand an improving global economy. Nonetheless, financial market volatility has risen from the very low\nlevels of recent years, the trade picture has created uncertainty, and geopolitical concerns have risen. I\nview these as risks to the outlook, but at this point, these factors have not caused me to change my\noutlook for the overall economy. The task before monetary policymakers is to calibrate policy to this\nhealthy economy to sustain the expansion. Monetary policy is still accommodative, and as the economy\nstrengthens, we don’t want to get behind the curve and find ourselves in a position of having to raise rates\n\n1\n\nSee Bernanke, Ben S., “Federal Reserve Communications,” Cato Institute 25th Annual Monetary Conference,\nWashington, D.C., November 14, 2007.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20071114a.htm)\n\n\f3\nmore aggressively than anticipated. But we also don’t want to overreact to the positive outlook by raising\nrates too aggressively and potentially curtail the expansion. This takes some careful balancing.\n\nEconomic growth\nLast year, economic growth picked up to around 2-1/2 percent, and I expect growth this year to be a bit\nstronger. Admittedly, incoming data suggest a moderation in consumer and business spending in the first\nquarter. But this moderation was from high levels, and I expect the first-quarter softness in output growth\nto be temporary, just as it was in the past couple of years.\n\nLast year, growth became more balanced across sectors and less dependent on only the consumer.\nNonresidential investment grew at a pace of about 6 percent in 2017, a significant pickup from the anemic\npace of less than 1 percent in the prior two years. That earlier weakness reflected the steep decline in oil\nprices between mid-2014 and early 2016, which caused a sharp pullback in drilling, mining, and their\nsuppliers. The oil price decline was accompanied by a sharp appreciation of the dollar, which hurt\nmanufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. But last year, oil prices rose, the dollar depreciated,\nand the economies of our trading partners began to strengthen, all of which supported increased business\nspending.\n\nIndeed, for the first time in many years, economic activity around the world is picking up. This should be\na positive for U.S. exports. However, the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, rhetoric suggesting an\nescalation of reciprocal tariffs on certain goods traded between the U.S. and China, and the ongoing\nrenegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have clouded the trade picture.\nThis cloud may not pass over quickly. Assessing the impact on the U.S. macroeconomy will ultimately\ndepend on the actions taken by the U.S. and its trading partners with respect to trade, and whether those\nactions or the continuing uncertainty causes businesses and investors to reevaluate their outlook for the\nU.S. economy.\n\n\f4\nWe have already seen a marked increase in volatility in the equity markets this year. However, it is\nhelpful to put this volatility into perspective. Last year, the S&P 500 index rose 19 percent, amid\nextremely low volatility. Equity prices are little changed, on net, this year. More notable is the rise in\nvolatility. We are less than four months into the year, but as of yesterday’s close, there have already been\n29 days on which the S&P 500 rose or fell by more than 1 percent. Through all of last year, there were\nonly eight such days – a very low number compared to the average of about 60 days per year from 2010\nthrough 2016.\n\nWhenever there are such big swings in the market, we need to assess their implications. The increased\nvolatility this year has not been associated with signs of financial market stress, such as disorderly\ntrading, a lack of liquidity, or contagion to other markets. And while a deeper and more persistent drop in\nequity markets could lead to a pullback in risk-taking and spending, the movements we have seen thus far\nare not close to this scenario. Contacts tell us higher volatility has not deterred planned spending. Equity\nprices remain considerably above their levels at the start of last year, and both business and consumer\nsentiment remain at high levels.\n\nThe changes in tax policy are expected to buoy both business and household spending this year. Lower\ntax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional business\nspending to meet higher near-term demand, some of which will be driven by higher federal spending. In\na recent Cleveland Fed staff survey of firms in the District, over a third of the firms expecting tax savings\nthis year said they planned to use some of the proceeds to increase investment.\n\nThe tax package adds a positive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending. Personal\nincomes are growing because labor market conditions are strong. Lower personal tax rates and higher\nstandard deductions should spur some additional household spending in the aggregate, although the\nimpact of tax changes on individual households will depend on the level and sources of their income.\n\n\f5\nHousehold balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of\ndeleveraging and increased savings.\n\nThe strength in the household sector is also supporting a moderately paced expansion of the housing\nsector, despite the increase in mortgage rates. In the aggregate, housing equity held by households is now\nabove its peak before the housing crash. While the new tax law contains several provisions that affect the\ntax treatment of homeownership, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a\nsustainable pace.\n\nLabor markets\nThe economy’s strength is well illustrated by the very strong conditions in labor markets. I expect that\nstrength to continue. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is below its lowest point during the last\nexpansion. It is under the 4-1/2 percent rate I gauge to be consistent with full employment over the longer\nrun. I expect the unemployment rate to move below 4 percent this year and to remain below 4 percent\nnext year.\n\nOver the first three months of the year, payroll jobs have grown by an average of about 200,000 per\nmonth. This is a pickup from last year’s average monthly gain of about 180,000 jobs and is well above\nmost economists’ estimates of trend monthly job growth, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000.\nBased on demographic factors, including the aging of the population, the longer-run trend in labor force\nparticipation is downward sloping, but participation has been fairly stable over the past two years, another\nsign of a strong labor market.\n\nRegional contacts continue to report that finding workers, both for higher-skill and lower-skill\noccupations, is very difficult, and that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages\nand benefits and more flexible work schedules. The official statistics indicate that compensation growth\n\n\f6\nhas moved up, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to over 2-1/2 percent more recently. That’s\nless of a pickup than what is typically seen given the tightness in labor markets, but it is consistent with\nthe low productivity growth we’ve seen over the expansion. 2 As investment continues to pick up, which\nshould help to promote productivity growth, and firms continue to move wages up to attract and retain\nworkers, I expect to see some strengthening in wage growth.\n\nCombining all the indicators, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions\nmonetary policy can address, we are slightly beyond maximum employment, one part of the Fed’s\nmonetary policy mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The FOMC aims for inflation to be 2 percent because it believes that\nthis rate is most consistent over the longer run with our statutory mandate. Inflation measures can vary\nfrom month to month due to idiosyncratic factors and in response to temporary economic and financial\ndisturbances. So to assess where we are relative to goal, it’s always a good idea to look through transitory\nmovements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is\ngoing on a sustained basis.\n\nGetting inflation back to 2 percent has been somewhat of a challenge, but since 2015, inflation has been\ngenerally moving up. At 1.8 percent, PCE inflation is near, but still slightly under, our goal. In the near\nterm, we will likely see some higher inflation readings as last March’s sharp decline in the prices of cell\n\n2\n\nOver the longer run, wages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this\nexpansion, growth in labor productivity, as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, has\nbeen on the order of only 1 percent, less than half the pace over the prior two expansions.\n\n\f7\nphone data plans drop out of the year-over-year measures, but we need to remain focused on the mediumrun outlook for inflation.\n\nWith growth above trend, strong labor demand, and inflation expectations relatively stable, my outlook is\nthat inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years. I\ndon’t expect inflation to move up sharply. But as inflation firms, it is important that monetary\npolicymakers continue to convey through policy decisions and communications that we are committed to\nachieving our dual mandate goals. Before I turn to monetary policy, let me discuss the Pittsburgh\neconomy.\n\nThe Pittsburgh economy\nThe path of the expansion in the Pittsburgh region reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks\nthat have hit the broader U.S. economy. Pittsburgh saw relatively strong employment growth early in the\nexpansion. But by mid-2012, payroll growth had begun to weaken. The pullback in mining, drilling, and\nmanufacturing in 2015 and 2016 had a significant effect on the Pittsburgh region. The region lost jobs in\n2015, barely saw any job growth in 2016, and the unemployment rate moved up. But last year saw a\nsignificant improvement in job growth, and the unemployment rate resumed its decline and now stands at\n4.8 percent.\n\nPayroll job growth picked up to a pace of nearly 2 percent last year, stronger than job growth in the state\nof Pennsylvania and in the nation. Reflecting the turnaround in energy prices, gains were especially\nstrong in mining and construction. The region’s growing reputation as an attractive tourist destination\nalso led to a rise in tourism-related jobs. The rise seen in education and healthcare jobs reflects a longerrun trend of economic diversification in the Pittsburgh region, which was discussed in a recent Cleveland\n\n\f8\nFed report in the Bank’s Industrial Heartland Series. 3 Such diversification allows regions to better adapt\nto changing economic forces.\n\nBut the region faces some challenges. Pittsburgh’s population has been declining over the past two\ndecades, the population is aging, and despite the presence of some of the best colleges and universities in\nthe country, many students leave the region after graduation. The Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment recently updated its report on regional labor supply and demand. 4 The report projects that\nhealthcare and information technology workers will remain in high demand, but there will also be a\nsizable demand for engineers and skilled technicians linked to emerging technologies, including\nautonomous vehicles, additive manufacturing, robotics, and ethane cracker and petrochemical\ndevelopment. The report documents a mismatch in the skill sets of residents in the region and the\nrequirements for workers who will be in highest demand. Reading the report gives you a sense of the\ncomplexity of the issues at hand. But you also learn of the positive steps being taken by business,\ncommunity, and civic leaders to address workforce development issues to ensure that Pittsburgh remains\neconomically competitive in the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. For some time now, the FOMC has been engaged in a strategy of\ngradually removing the high level of accommodation that was needed to address the Great Recession.\nThis strategy is a balanced approach, reflecting the improvement in the economy over time and the\nprogress that has been made on our longer-run monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price\n\n3\n\nVenkatu, Guhan, “Rust and Renewal: A Pittsburgh Retrospective,” Industrial Heartland Series, Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, February 2018.\n(https://clevelandfed.org/region/industrial-heartland/retrospectives.aspx#pittsburghreport)\n\n4\n\nThe Allegheny Conference on Community Development, “Inflection Point 2017-18: Supply, Demand and the\nFuture of Work in the Pittsburgh Region,” December 2017.\n(https://www.alleghenyconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/018_InflectionPoint.pdf)\n\n\f9\nstability. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. I\nsupported this increase, and if the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest\nrates will be appropriate this year and next year.\n\nIn my view, a gradual upward path of interest rates will help sustain the expansion and balance the risks\nso that our monetary policy goals are met and maintained. We want to give inflation time to move back\nto goal, and I don’t expect inflation to pick up sharply; this argues against a steep path. At the same time,\nthe economy is slightly beyond maximum employment, and despite an increase in market volatility and\nlonger-term interest rates since the start of the year, financial conditions are accommodative. It is\nappropriate to continue to remove some of the monetary policy accommodation to ensure we avoid a\nbuild-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy were allowed to overheat.\nRecent research from the Cleveland Fed suggests that a strategy to overheat the economy in an attempt to\npull more people back into the workforce is unlikely to have any lasting effect on labor force\nparticipation. 5 Yet, overheating would have costs – it would necessitate sharper rate increases that could\nin themselves be destabilizing.\n\nA gradual upward path of interest rates should also help to avoid financial imbalances and a potential\nbuild-up of financial stability risks that could arise from the extended period of very low interest rates.\nCurrently, in my assessment, financial stability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level. Leverage levels in\nthe household, nonfinancial, and financial sectors are low to moderate, and vulnerabilities arising from\nthe financial system’s role in transforming the maturity of assets or funding long-term assets with shortterm liabilities are moderate. But corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields are quite low, and\nprices in the commercial real estate market continue to rise while capitalization rates, which measure\n5\n\nFallick, Bruce, and Pawel Krolikowski, “Hysteresis in Employment among Disadvantaged Workers,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper 18-01, February 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2018-working-papers/wp1801-hysteresis-in-employment-among-disadvantaged-workers.aspx)\n\n\f10\noperating income relative to the sale price of commercial properties, are at or near historical lows. These\ndevelopments are worth watching.\n\nContinued gradual reduction in monetary policy accommodation, given the economic outlook, will put\nmonetary policy in a better position to address whatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside,\nare ultimately realized. The path policy actually takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves.\nIf the upside risks to growth come to pass, we may need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on\nthe downside, we may need to go a bit slower.\n\nSince last October, the FOMC has also been implementing its plan to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet in\nterms of the size and composition of assets. 6 To address the Great Recession, after the FOMC brought\nthe fed funds rate down to effectively zero, it undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets,\nincluding longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases were\nundertaken to put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. We are now allowing\nmaturing longer-term assets to roll off the balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way; this will take\nseveral years to complete.\n\nLonger-Run Issues\nI have been discussing the medium-run economic outlook and associated risks, but to conclude my talk,\nI’d like to address two interconnected longer-run issues facing the U.S. economy.\n\n6\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf)\n\n\f11\nA country’s standard of living over the longer run depends on its longer-run growth rate, which, in turn,\ndepends on the growth of the labor force and the growth of productivity, which measures how effectively\nthe economy combines labor and capital to create output.\n\nBased on demographics, labor force growth is projected to be considerably slower than it has been in\nrecent decades. In the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby\nboomers and women entered the workforce. But since then, labor force growth has slowed, rising at\nslightly more than 1/2 percent per year over 2010-2016, and it is expected to remain near that level over\nthe next decade. 7\n\nLabor productivity growth has also been slow during this expansion. Some of this is cyclical, but more\npersistent structural factors may also be at play. 8 For example, the American spirit of innovation,\nentrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility have contributed to\neconomic growth and well-being in the U.S. These factors of dynamism allow resources to be reallocated\nfrom less-productive to more-productive businesses and allow workers to move up the career ladder. But\nthe level of dynamism has been declining for some time.\n\nThe combination of slow labor force growth and slow productivity growth suggests that the potential\ngrowth rate of the economy will be lower than it was in the past. My own estimate of output growth over\n\n7\n\nFor further discussion of demographics and economic growth, see Mester, Loretta J., “Demographics and Their\nImplications for the Economy and Policy,” Cato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of\nMonetary Policy, Washington, D.C., November 16, 2017, and forthcoming in the Cato Journal.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20171116-demographics-and-their-implicationsfor-the-economy-and-policy.aspx)\n8\n\nFor example, on average, over the 1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3\npercent of total employment per year. Since then, this share has fallen to around 2 percent. For further discussion of\ndynamism, see Mester, Loretta J., “The National and Regional Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” The\nAfrican American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania Annual Business Luncheon, Pittsburgh, PA,\nNovember 30, 2016.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20161130-the-national-and-regional-economicoutlook-and-monetary-policy)\n\n\f12\nthe longer run is 2 percent, which is a lot slower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and\n1990s.\n\nOf course, this is not a fait accompli. Investment in human capital, in the form of education and training,\nand investment in physical capital and infrastructure can improve outcomes. The recently adopted\nchanges to the tax code may encourage such investment. Well-designed government policies can also\nhelp spur basic science, R&D, and innovation; make it easier for people to start up companies; and help to\nease the transition for households, industries, and communities being negatively affected by globalization\nand technological change. A well-thought-out immigration policy that attracts labor to the U.S. is also a\nnecessary ingredient to support longer-run growth.\n\nBut such policies need to be implemented as the country puts its longer-run fiscal situation on a\nsustainable path. Recently released projections by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that under\ncurrent policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will be quite a bit higher 10 years from now, with the\nrecent fiscal policy changes estimated to add $1.6 trillion to the cumulative deficit over the next 10 years. 9\nBecause of the accumulating deficits, the ratio of federal debt held by the public to GDP is projected to\nrise from 78 percent at the end of this year to nearly 100 percent in 2028, the highest it has been since\n1946. Note that the CBO estimates would be higher if the major provisions of the new tax and spending\npolicies are extended instead of expiring as they do under current law.\n\nEver-rising government debt levels would mean a higher share of government spending going to interest\npayments. This would tend to crowd out productive investments by the private sector and the\n\n9\n\nThe deficit as a percentage of GDP (adjusted to exclude the effects of shifting payments from one fiscal year into\nanother so that those payments are not made on a weekend) was 3.5 percent in 2017. Under the CBO’s baseline\nassumptions, the CBO projects this ratio to rise to 4.2 percent this year and to be 4.8 percent in 2028. See Summary\nTable 2 from CBO, “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028,” Congress of the United States, April 2018.\n(https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53651)\n\n\f13\ngovernment, thereby lowering productivity and longer-run growth. Investors would demand a higher risk\npremium in order to hold U.S. government debt. With over 40 percent of publicly held U.S. Treasury\ndebt held by foreigners, these interest payments need not be reinvested in the U.S. In addition, the\nsovereign debt crisis in Europe over 2009-2012 shows that high debt levels can pose severe problems if\ninvestors lose faith in the ability of governments to service their debts, generating spikes in what had\npreviously been viewed as risk-free rates. Longer-run fiscal sustainability in the U.S. will depend on\nwhat combination of tax increases and spending controls are put in place to ensure that debt-to-GDP is on\na downward path.\n\nAnd this brings me back to monetary policy. Unless the U.S. can get its longer-run fiscal situation in\norder, high debt levels will constrain using fiscal policy as a tool to buoy the economy in recessions. This\nwill put more of the burden on monetary policy to stimulate the economy during downturns. But in a\nworld with lower potential growth and lower equilibrium interest rates, monetary policy will also have\nless room to act. The zero lower bound on interest rates would be hit more often, and we would find\nourselves having to rely more often on nonconventional policy tools like asset purchases.\n\nToday’s healthy outlook for the U.S. economy over the medium run gives policymakers the opportunity\nto consider these longer-run issues, which the country will need to deal with in order to ensure a healthy\neconomy in the future.\n\nBefore I overstay my welcome, let me end here and thank you for your attention. I look forward to your\nquestions.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nLeaders, Executives, Entrepreneurs, and Directors (LEED) Program\nCentral State University College of Business\nWilberforce, OH\n\nApril 4, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers of this year’s LEED program and Professor Fidelis Ikem, the dean of the College of\nBusiness, for inviting me to speak today. I am proud of the relationship that the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland is building with Central State University. It’s great to be on campus today, where one feels a\nreal sense of history. At the Federal Reserve, we are proud of the fact that while the first two attempts at\ncentral banks in the U.S. lasted only 20 years each, the Fed is in its 105th year. But Central State is even\nolder. Founded in 1887, the university recently celebrated its 131st birthday. Central State’s designation\nas a historically black college and its focus on providing a high-quality academic experience to all\nstudents are things to be proud of. They make this university a very good place for me to speak about the\nbenefits of an education in economics and the importance of diversity in the field of economics. Before I\ncontinue, I should remind everyone that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWhy Study Economics\nI didn’t start out to be an economist. I majored in mathematics at Barnard College but also pursued a\nsecond major in economics because it seemed interesting and didn’t require much additional course work.\nI applied to graduate school in math but ended up in the economics Ph.D. program at Princeton because\ntwo professors there wrote me letters explaining that Princeton’s economics program was very\nmathematical and encouraging me to come there and study economics. I’ve always thought that I lucked\ninto economics. It has provided me with a fascinating career, and I hope that at least in a small way I’ve\nbeen able to provide some good in return through economic research and policymaking.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines economics as “a social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis\nof the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.” Well, that’s fine as far as it goes,\nbut it sounds kind of dry. Others think of economics as a path to running a business or working in\nfinance. That’s also fine as far as it goes, but it is too limited a view. Instead, I like to think of economics\nas a social science that helps us think about how people use scarce resources, interact in markets or in\n\n\f2\nother economic settings, respond to incentives, and make trade-offs. The fact that economics is a social\nscience, one that involves people and their choices, makes economics complicated but also very\ninteresting.\n\nBecause economics provides a rigorous way of thinking about trade-offs, incentives, and costs and\nbenefits, it has many real-world applications. It can help a company be more profitable but it can also\nhelp policymakers formulate better public policies that affect people’s lives. It can help us analyze the\ndistribution of income across individuals, regions, and countries, and the causes for those differences. It\ncan help us understand how a small financial shock might be propagated economy-wide or even globally,\nand what can be done to prevent such contagion. It can help us understand the issues facing people in or\nentering the workforce and provide evidence on which programs are most effective at helping them\nfinance their education, develop new skills, and manage the changing job landscape driven by\ntechnological innovation. Economics can help us understand how people make financial decisions and\nhow simple changes can result in better outcomes. For example, a simple change from making employees\nhave to opt out of a company’s savings plan, rather than opt in, can result in higher participation in the\nplan.1 One well-formulated study of a Fortune 500 company’s 401(k) savings plan found that switching\nto automatic enrollment increased employee participation from 49 percent to 86 percent. It also found\nthat employees’ savings decisions tend to be inert, so the default contribution rate and fund allocation are\nimportant features to consider in designing such a plan.\n\nA default rule like this is an example of what behavioral economists call a nudge – something that isn’t\nmandated but points people in the right direction and can change behavior.2 Richard Thaler, an\neconomics professor at the University of Chicago, won a Nobel Prize last year for his foundational work\nin behavioral economics, which combines aspects of psychology with economics. In his Nobel Prize\n1\n2\n\nSee Chetty, et al. (2017).\n\nFor accessible descriptions and examples of nudging, see Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in\nMemory of Alfred Nobel (2017), Thaler (2017a), and Sunstein (2017).\n\n\f3\nlunch lecture, he mentioned that good work is being done around the world to, and I quote: “design and\ntest scientifically informed policies that are working. People are being helped to save more for\nretirement, more poor kids – especially girls – are going to school, peasant farmers are retrieving more\nreliable harvests, and we are all being successfully nudged to use less energy.”3 That passage lists just a\nfew of the areas in which economics is having a real-world impact and doing some good. In the policy\nrealm, economics helps guide decisions about the country’s monetary and fiscal policies, but also policies\non health care, education, and trade. It helps in the design and evaluation of programs at the local\ncommunity level too, including workforce development and transportation policy. In a nutshell, I believe\nthat economics helps society.\n\nI hope this piques your interest in studying economics. But if you need more convincing, you might want\nto know that economics offers a very good return on your education dollar. The ability to think critically,\nanalyze a problem systematically, and deal with ambiguity are all skills developed through the study of\neconomics and they are all skills highly valued in the job market. One recent study found that those with\na bachelor’s degree in economics earn about 20 percent more than graduates with degrees in other fields.4\nSome of the salary differences reflect the fact that economics majors have access to a wide variety of\noccupations, many of which are higher-paying. You’ll find people with economics degrees employed in\nmany sectors, including education, accounting, law, business, finance, and government. The Federal\nReserve System – the 12 Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors – employs about 700 Ph.D.\neconomists and also many others with undergraduate and master’s degrees in economics, and I can tell\nyou from experience that the Fed is a very productive and fascinating place to work.\n\n3\n\nThaler (2017b).\n\n4\n\nCarroll, et al. (2014).\n\n\f4\nThe State of Diversity in Economics\nThe good news is that economics is a popular major in U.S. colleges and universities. In 2016, U.S.\npostsecondary schools awarded about 33,500 bachelor’s degrees in economics.5 While this represents\nless than 2 percent of all bachelor’s degrees awarded by these schools, at the top 100 universities and top\n100 liberal arts colleges without an undergraduate business major, about 10 to 20 percent of male\nundergraduates major in economics.6 That’s a high number when you consider how many different\nmajors there are. But despite its popularity, the field has had less success in attracting women or\nhistorically under-represented racial and ethnic minorities.7 While there has been some improvement\ncompared to the 1970s, this under-representation has been going on for many years.\n\nUsing U.S. Department of Education data on four-year, non-profit colleges and universities over 20112015, Bayer and Wilcox found that while women earned more than half of all bachelor’s degrees awarded\nacross all fields, they earned less than a third of the bachelor’s degrees in economics.8 And the numbers\nare lower for under-represented minorities, who earned slightly more than 20 percent of bachelor’s\ndegrees and about 11 percent of economics degrees awarded. If you think about this in terms of the share\nof female graduates who choose to major in economics and the share of male graduates who choose to\nmajor in economics, according to Bayer and Wilcox’s numbers, there is one female economics major for\nevery 100 female bachelor’s degrees compared to about three male economics majors for every 100 male\nbachelor’s degrees. That means women are choosing to major in economics at only a third of the rate of\n\n5\n\nThe data on the number and proportion of bachelor’s degrees in economics in U.S. postgraduate institutions are\nderived from Tables 325.92 and 322.10 from U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education\nStatistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n6\n\nGoldin (2013, 2015).\n\n7\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) classifies as\nhistorically under-represented minorities members of the following groups: Hispanic or Latino (non-Hispanic),\n(non-Hispanic) Black or African American, and American Indian or Native Alaskan. The IPEDS data are used by\nthe American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession\n(CSMGEP) to assess minority representation in the field.\n8\n\nBayer and Wilcox (2017).\n\n\f5\nmen.9 Similarly, minorities are choosing economics over other majors at only about half the rate of white\nstudents.\n\nWhile you don’t need to have majored in economics to enter a Ph.D. program in economics, it is a natural\npath. So given the under-representation of women and minorities at the undergraduate level, it is\nprobably not surprising they are also under-represented at the Ph.D. level and in academia. The good\nnews is that representation of women among the ranks of academia, from first-year graduate student\nthrough full professor, is higher now than in 1970.10 The bad news is that progress has slowed. In 2017,\nfemales made up 32 percent of first-year grad students in economics compared to 30 percent in 1997.\nAlmost a third of the new doctorates in 2017 were awarded to women, but gender diversity falls as one\nmoves up the academic ranks. Women make up less than 30 percent of assistant professors, about 23\npercent of tenured associates, and about 14 percent of full professors in economics. Unless there is a\npickup in entry into graduate school, it is hard to see how these numbers can increase.\n\nAnalysis of minority representation in graduate economics is complicated a bit by the fact that almost 60\npercent of doctorates awarded in economics are awarded to nonpermanent resident students. Some of\nthese graduates return to their own countries, while others stay in the U.S. Restricting attention to U.S.\ncitizens and permanent residents, of the 479 economics doctorates awarded in 2016, only 48, that is, 10\npercent, were awarded to under-represented minorities: 15 were earned by African Americans and 33 by\nHispanics or Latinos.11 In the academic professorial ranks, under-represented minorities make up less\nthan 10 percent of assistant professors and less than 5 percent of full professors.\n\n9\n\nAmong schools in the top 100 that offer both business and economics degrees, regardless of gender, students prefer\nthe business degree over economics, but women do so to a greater extent. See Goldin (2013, 2015).\n10\n\nThe statistics cited in this paragraph are the preliminary statistics for 2017 compiled by the American Economic\nAssociation’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. See Lundberg (2017).\n11\n\nThese statistics are from the U.S. Department of Education IPEDS data as reported in Committee on the Status of\nMinority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) (2017).\n\n\f6\nThere has been some progress: the percentages of undergraduate and graduate degrees awarded to\nminorities have increased over the past two decades. But the rate of change has been slower than the\ngrowth of the minority population in the U.S. and slower than the growth of minority representation\nacross all fields and in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. Indeed, minorities\nearn a greater share of the degrees awarded in the STEM fields than they do in economics.12 Similarly,\nthe representation of women in the STEM fields is also now higher than it is in economics.13\n\nWhy Isn’t Economics Diverse and Why Does It Matter?\nAn interesting question is why women and minorities are under-represented in economics. One potential\nexplanation is the lack of role models in the field. Seeing someone of the same race or gender being\nsuccessful in a field can be validating, and having someone like you to run ideas by or get advice from\ncan be very helpful. So, the relative lack of women and minorities in economics could be perpetuating\nunder-representation. This is a plausible explanation but it may be only one piece of the puzzle, as the\nempirical evidence on role models is somewhat mixed.14 One study of a selective liberal arts college that\nessentially involved random assignment of students to instructors found that having an instructor of the\nsame gender didn’t increase the probability of a student taking more classes or majoring in the field,\nregardless of the gender distribution in the department, but it was associated with the student earning a\nhigher grade in fields dominated by the opposite gender.15 That is, female students received higher\naverage grades from female instructors when taking courses in fields dominated by men (such as\neconomics) – the difference was on the order of moving from a B-minus to a B. And there was a similar\neffect for males, who received higher average grades from male instructors when taking courses in\nfemale-dominated fields (such as education). A separate study in a different setting found evidence that\n\n12\n\nCommittee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) (2017).\n\n13\n\nGoldin (2013, 2015).\n\n14\n\nGoldin (2013) and Griffith (2013).\n\n15\n\nGriffith (2014).\n\n\f7\nsuch grade differentials reflected achievement differentials and not just inflated grading.16 So the\navailability of role models appears to positively affect student achievement, but a lack of role models isn’t\nthe whole story about why some students choose not to continue in economics.\n\nWhat about different preferences at the time students enroll? It is true that males are more likely than\nfemales to list economics as their planned major when accepted at college. But this gender difference for\nincoming students is not the full story because research that looks at the progression of students through\nthe major has found that female students are relatively more likely to drop out of the major and switch to\nanother field compared to male students. For example, one study found that women need to do well in\ntheir principles of economics course in order to continue in the major, and that’s less true of men.17\n\nOther hypotheses have to do with the way economics is taught or with the content of the courses. Do\nlarge lecture classes, often found in introductory economics programs at large universities, turn off\nwomen and minorities more than men? Do the topics incorporated into the intro courses appeal to one\ngroup and not another? And, if so, how could the content be amended so that all students, regardless of\nrace, ethnicity, or gender, feel included and take up the opportunity to be an economics major? Could it\nbe that implicit biases come to play at each stage of the academic ladder, as has been shown in other types\nof settings?\n\nAs a college math major, I am happy to say that the theory that women may be more turned off by the\nheavy mathematical content in economics does not pan out. In fact, women earn over 40 percent of\nbachelor’s degrees in math and statistics, a higher share than in economics;18 women do well in math at\nthe high school level; women are selecting other fields that are very quantitative, like psychology; and\n16\n\nCarrell, et al. (2010).\n\n17\n\nGoldin (2013, 2015) and Avilova and Goldin (2018).\n\n18\n\nTable 325.65, U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary\nEducation Data System (IPEDS).\n\n\f8\nstudies indicate that math aptitude doesn’t explain gender differences in participation in upper-level\neconomics courses.19\n\nSo there are several different theories being explored, and I suspect that, at the end of the day, there are\nmultiple drivers of the under-representation of women and minorities in the field of economics. But you\nmight ask: why should we care? Shouldn’t students be able to choose their field of study and career path?\nThe low level of diversity in economics may just reflect people’s preferences. That’s a possibility, but if\nthat’s the case, then it is incumbent upon those of us in the field and upon educators to ensure that\nstudents can make informed choices and that they understand the value of an economics degree to the\nindividual and to society.\n\nMoreover, because economics is a field that influences policy, and policy affects all kinds of people, it’s\nimportant to have diverse views inform that policy. As a public servant and Fed policymaker, I believe\nthat policymakers need to consider the effects of our monetary, regulatory, and payments policies on all\nour constituents. In addition, I have seen firsthand how having a diversity of views expressed and\ndiscussed around the table can actually lead to better policy decisions, and there is actual research to back\nthis up. Group dynamics are different when teams are diverse. Participants don’t necessarily find it as\ncomfortable to serve on a diverse team, but the diversity helps to avoid group-think. Diverse teams tend\nto be more objective and focus on the facts when making decisions; they may process information more\ncarefully because they are forced to confront a different way of thinking and convince those with\nalternative views; and firms with more diversity tend to be more innovative.20 Research also shows that\nfirms with diverse management tend to have above-average earnings.21 Perhaps the better decisionmaking and innovation associated with diversity is showing up on the bottom line.\n\n19\n\nSee Goldin (2013), and Bayer and Rouse (2016).\n\n20\n\nSee Rock and Grant (2016).\n\n21\n\nRock and Grant (2016) cite a Credit Suisse analysis of 2,400 companies worldwide that found that organizations\nwith at least one female board member had higher return on equity and higher net income growth than firms with no\nfemale board members. In addition, Hunt, et al. (2015) report on a McKinsey & Company analysis of 366\n\n\f9\n\nBeyond current policy and business outcomes, another reason I’d like to see more diversity in the field of\neconomics is so the field itself doesn’t get stymied by group-think. To expand our knowledge, economics\nneeds to continually take on new research questions and develop innovative techniques and ways of\nanalysis to arrive at answers to these questions. Broader representation in economics means a broader set\nof issues will be tackled and a broader set of research disseminated, resulting in better policy outcomes\nthat will improve the economic well being of a greater share of the population.\n\nSome Things Are Being Done\nThe American Economic Association, through its Committees on the Status of Women and the Status of\nMinority Groups in the Economics Profession, is taking a close look at diversity in the economics\nprofession and is offering programs and resources aimed at increasing diversity at all levels. The\nassociation provides information to students who want to pursue careers or a graduate degree in\neconomics, and also provides lesson plans to teachers. It offers a summer training and scholarship\nprogram to help prepare students for graduate school and, with the National Science Foundation, offers a\nSummer Economics Fellows Program, which is designed to increase the participation and advancement of\nwomen and under-represented minorities in economics.\n\nI serve on the board of the Council for Economic Education. This nonprofit organization’s mission is to\neducate students in kindergarten through high school about economics and personal finance so they can\nmake better decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities. The council provides many\nmaterials to teachers and also runs the National Economics Challenge, a quiz bowl competition, which\nreaches a wide population of students in terms of gender, race, and income. Last year, over 11,000 high\nschool students participated in the challenge; of these, 42 percent were girls and 22 percent were undercompanies that found that those in the top quartile in terms of management’s ethnic and racial diversity were 35\npercent more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean, while those in the top quartile in terms of\nmanagement’s gender diversity were 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean.\n\n\f10\nrepresented minorities, and participation from these groups has been increasing over time. A recent\nsurvey found that participants’ performance on advanced placement exams exceeds the national average,\nwith especially strong gains shown by female and minority students, and that participants are more likely\nthan nonparticipants to choose to major in economics.\n\nAt the Cleveland Fed, we strive for excellence in all that we do. And that means we are taking actions to\nfoster a culture that champions diversity, inclusion, and opportunity throughout the organization. To\nincrease our ability to recruit high-quality talent in a variety of positions, including banking, computer\nprogramming, data science, accounting, as well as economics, we are developing relationships with\nschools in our District, including Central State. Last June, we hosted a number of Central State students\nand several faculty members as part of your school’s eight-week summer Banking Institute program, and\nwe will host another group of CSU students again next month. You may have attended one of the guest\nlectures that some of our economists have given in your economics and business classes, and\nrepresentatives are here today to tell you about paid internships and other employment opportunities at the\nCleveland Fed. As a contribution to strengthening the pipeline of future economists, the Cleveland Fed\nwill be hosting a workshop this summer for the research assistants across the Federal Reserve System to\nhelp them prepare for graduate school. The Cleveland Fed has also been promoting pre- and post-college\neducation. Our Learning Center distributes lesson plans on economics and financial literacy to teachers in\nkindergarten through high school, and our Money Museum, which is open to the public, offers interactive\nexhibits on the financial system and the economy. These may be small steps, but economics can help\nsolve many real-world problems while providing individuals with a rewarding career, and we want to\nensure that the widest group of people enter the field.\n\nConclusion\nFifty years ago today, this country lost a great leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The tragedy of his\ndeath must not overshadow his many accomplishments and the lessons conveyed by his words and deeds.\nAs I’ve discussed, there has been some progress over the past 50 years in increasing diversity,\n\n\f11\ninclusiveness, and opportunity within the economics profession, but that progress has been slow. It is\neasy to get discouraged and accept the status quo. But we all must remember a key lesson from Dr.\nKing’s legacy: changing institutions is hard work and takes time. It must be met by perseverance and\nendurance. As a member of the economics profession, I will continue to seek ways to increase diversity,\ninclusion, and opportunity because I believe it will strengthen economic research and policymaking, and\nthereby help promote a healthier economy for a wider group of people. I encourage the students of\nCentral State University to enter the field of economics and to join me in that mission.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nAvilova, Tatyana, and Claudia Goldin, “What Can UWE Do for Economics?” National Bureau of\nEconomic Research Working Paper 24189, January 2018.\n(http://www.nber.org/papers/w24189.pdf)\nBayer, Amanda, and Cecilia Elena Rouse, “Diversity in the Economics Profession: A New Attack on an\nOld Problem,” Journal of Economic Perspectives 30 (Fall 2016), pp. 221-242.\n(https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.30.4.221)\nBayer, Amanda, and David Wilcox, “The Unequal Distribution of Economic Education: A Report on the\nRace, Ethnicity, and Gender of Economics Majors at US Colleges and Universities,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2017-105, Divisions of Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs, Federal\nReserve Board, Washington, D.C.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017105pap.pdf)\nCarrell, Scott E., Marianne E.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nThe Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance\nPrinceton University\nPrinceton, NJ\n\nMarch 26, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers at the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for inviting me to speak today. It’s nice to be back\nat Princeton. Walking up from the Dinky station, I was impressed by the changes on campus, including\nseveral new buildings since my days here as a graduate student. But one thing hasn’t changed, and that’s\nthe sense of energy and inquisitiveness among the people on campus. Although it has been several years\nsince I graduated, I use the knowledge I gained at Princeton every day in my role at the Federal Reserve.\n\nToday, I’ll discuss my views on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy and make a few\nremarks on two future issues for the monetary policy agenda. I believe it’s important for Fed\npolicymakers to explain the rationale for their policy decisions to the public, so I am looking forward to\ntaking your questions after my remarks. Before I continue, I should remind everyone that the views I’ll\npresent today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nAt its meeting last week, the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within\nthe Fed, decided to raise the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4\npercent. This rate increase is consistent with the healthy outlook for the economy, and the achieved and\nexpected progress on our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be another good year for the economy, and the task before monetary\npolicymakers is to calibrate policy to this healthy economy so that the expansion is sustained. Given the\neconomy’s strength, we don’t want to get behind the curve, but we also don’t want to overreact to the\npositive outlook and potentially curtail the expansion. This takes some careful balancing, and in my\nview, last week’s decision on rates reflects this type of balanced approach to achieving and maintaining\nour policy goals.\n\n\f2\n\nEconomic growth\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent, and I expect growth to be a bit above that pace\nthis year and next. This is an improvement from the average 2 percent pace over prior years of the\nexpansion. In addition, growth is now more balanced across sectors. Business investment accelerated\nlast year. Nonresidential investment grew at a pace of about 6 percent last year, compared to an anemic\npace of less than 1 percent in 2015 and 2016. You may recall that oil prices fell sharply from mid-2014\nthrough early 2016, and this led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers.\nThe drop in oil prices was coupled with a greater than 20 percent appreciation in the value of the dollar,\nwhich hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Those conditions are now reversing.\nLast year, oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated as the economies of our trading partners began to\nstrengthen.\n\nIndeed, for the first time in many years, economic activity around the world is picking up and forecasts\nfor global growth are being revised up. This should have a positive feedback effect on the U.S. economy\nvia exports. However, the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and the recent announcement of planned\ntariffs on certain goods imported from China, as well as the ongoing renegotiations of the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), add uncertainty to the trade picture. This uncertainty may\nnot be resolved quickly. Assessing the impact on the U.S. macroeconomy will ultimately depend on how\nother countries react, including whether they impose their own tariffs or other trade barriers in response. I\nam monitoring trade developments, and while I see them as a risk to the forecast, at this point they have\nnot led me to change my outlook for the overall economy.\n\nBusiness sentiment remains high and firms will gain from the tax changes passed in December. The\nrecently passed federal budget and spending appropriation bills will add further fiscal stimulus in the form\nof increased federal spending. At this point, it is difficult to be precise about the magnitude and timing of\n\n\f3\nthe effect of these fiscal policy changes on output growth. I’m estimating they will add an additional 1/2\npercentage point of annual growth over the next couple of years, but there is some upside risk that the\neffect could be larger. I expect to have a better read on the timing of the federal spending and on how\nhouseholds and firms are actually responding to the tax changes over the next several months.\n\nLower tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional\nbusiness spending to meet higher near-term demand. In a staff survey of firms in the Cleveland Fed\nDistrict, over a third of the firms expecting tax savings this year said they planned to use some of the\nproceeds to increase investment. Smaller percentages of respondents said they planned to buy back\nshares of their stock, increase dividends, or pay down debt with their tax gains. About a third of the\nsurveyed firms in the District said they planned to share some of their tax savings with employees in the\nform of increased wages, bonuses, or additions to employee pension plans. And some firms in the\nDistrict and elsewhere in the nation have already done so.\n\nThis adds a positive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending, which makes up over\ntwo-thirds of output. Personal incomes are growing because labor market conditions are strong. Lower\npersonal tax rates and higher standard deductions should spur some additional household spending in the\naggregate, although the impact of tax changes on individual households will depend on the level and\nsources of their income. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession,\nreflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. While there has been a marked increase\nin market volatility since the start of the year, equity prices are higher than they were a year ago.\n\nA moderately paced recovery in the housing sector continues, despite the increase in mortgage rates.\nHousing equity held by households is now above its peak before the housing crash. Overall, I expect\nactivity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\n\f4\nLabor markets\nThe labor market is strong and I expect that strength to continue. Payroll jobs rose by more than 300,000\nin February, following an increase of more than 200,000 in January. These job numbers are a pickup\nfrom last year’s already strong pace of 180,000 jobs per month. Most economists put trend job growth\nsomewhere in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month. The variation depends on what one\nassumes about labor force participation. Based on demographic factors, including the aging of the\npopulation, the longer-run trend in participation is downward sloping. But the labor force participation\nrate has been fairly stable over the past two years, and last month we saw a rise in the participation rate,\nincluding that of prime-age males. Indeed, the participation rate of men aged 45 to 54 has shown a\nnotable increase of nearly 1.5 percentage points over the past year.\n\nIncreased participation helps ease some of the tightness we are seeing in the labor supply. As both\nnational and regional labor markets have tightened, our contacts have been reporting for some time that\nthey are having trouble finding qualified workers. These reports are now coming from a wide range of\nfirms across different sectors and cover both higher-skill and lower-skill occupations. The unemployment\nrate, at 4.1 percent, is low by historical standards. It’s below its lowest point during the last expansion\nand below the range most economists associate with full employment.\n\nOf course, it’s difficult to say with any precision how tight labor markets are. Usually we associate tight\nlabor markets with rising wages. The official statistics indicate that compensation growth has moved up,\nfrom under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to over 2-1/2 percent more recently. And increasingly,\nfirms are telling us that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages and benefits to\nattract and retain workers. But so far wage growth hasn’t been as strong as one might normally expect\nfrom tight labor markets. One partial explanation for this is the low level of productivity growth. Over\nthe longer run, wages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this\n\n\f5\nexpansion, labor productivity growth has been on the order of only 1 percent. 1 This is less than half the\npace over the prior two expansions. Last year we saw somewhat stronger growth in productivity than we\nsaw earlier in the expansion. It is too soon to tell whether this rise will be sustained; however, the\nwelcome pickup we are seeing in investment should help to promote productivity growth as the expansion\ncontinues, and this should help buoy wage growth.\n\nThe movements in labor force participation, combined with the fact that wage and price inflation have\nremained moderate even as labor markets continue to strengthen, suggest that labor market conditions\nmay not be as tight as I had been assuming. So I recently moved my own estimate of the longer-run\nunemployment rate down by 1/4 percentage point, to 4-1/2 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to\nmove below 4 percent this year and to remain below 4 percent next year. Overall, my assessment remains\nthat from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions monetary policy can address, we are slightly beyond\nthe maximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, that is, PCE inflation. “Symmetric” means that the 2 percent inflation goal isn’t a ceiling;\nthe FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or persistently below this goal\nand such persistent deviations warrant a policy response. 2 But inflation measures can vary from month to\nmonth because of idiosyncratic factors and in response to temporary economic and financial disturbances.\nSometimes inflation will be above and sometimes it will be below 2 percent. While monetary policy’s\n1\n\nLabor productivity as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 1 percent\nover this expansion.\n\n2\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012;\nas amended effective January 30, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\n\n\f6\ncontrol of inflation isn’t precise enough to keep inflation at 2 percent at each point in time, averaging\nthrough temporary fluctuations, we aim for inflation to be 2 percent because the FOMC believes that this\nrate is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.\n\nGetting inflation back to this goal has been somewhat of a challenge. PCE inflation fell to very low levels\nin 2015, when inflation was held down by falling oil and import prices. Since then it has moved back up,\neven temporarily exceeding 2 percent early last year, until it moved back below 2 percent in the middle of\nlast year partly due to special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone\nservice plans. Since then, inflation has picked up and several of our business contacts have reported that\nthey now have more pricing power and have been able to pass along some of their cost increases to\ncustomers.\n\nPCE inflation has risen to about 1.7 percent, not quite at our goal. In the near term, we will likely see\nsome higher inflation readings as the sharp price declines of last March drop out of the year-over-year\nmeasures. But just as we didn’t overreact to weaker inflation readings last summer or to stronger inflation\nreadings at the beginning of last year, we shouldn’t overreact to these increases either. Mild temporary\nover- or under-runs of inflation should not be cause for concern. Instead, we need to remain focused on\nthe medium-run outlook for inflation.\n\nMy outlook is that inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one\nto two years. This forecast reflects my expectation that the economy will continue to grow above trend\nand the demand for labor will continue to strengthen. Stable inflation expectations are another important\ncomponent of this forecast because inflation expectations help to anchor actual inflation rates. We\nalready saw how valuable stable inflation expectations were during the Great Recession. At that time, the\ndeep pullback in activity and collapse in demand could have led to deflation – not just low inflation rates\nbut a declining overall price level. This would have made the economy even worse by making demand\n\n\f7\neven weaker than it was and raising debt burdens in real terms. But deflationary conditions did not\ndevelop because policy responses helped to maintain people’s expectations that prices would remain\nstable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return to goal.\n\nOne of the risks of having inflation under-run the 2 percent goal for so long is that inflation expectations\ncould have become unanchored. That didn’t happen. Now, as inflation firms, it is equally important that\nmonetary policymakers continue to convey through policy communications and decisions our\ncommitment to achieving our dual mandate goals.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThe recent policy action to increase the target range for the fed funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent is\nconsistent with this commitment and continues the process to gradually increase interest rates as the\neconomy has continued to make progress on our monetary policy goals. I supported the increase in the fed\nfunds rate last week and, if the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further gradual increases in\ninterest rates will be appropriate this year and next year. In my view a gradual upward path of interest\nrates will help sustain the expansion and balance the risks so that our longer-run goals of price stability\nand maximum employment are met and maintained. We want to give inflation time to move back to goal;\nthis argues against a steep path. At the same time, the economy is slightly beyond maximum\nemployment, and despite an increase in market volatility and longer-term interest rates since the start of\nthe year, financial conditions are accommodative. It seems appropriate to remove some of the monetary\npolicy accommodation to ensure we avoid a build-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise\nif the economy were allowed to overheat. In addition, a gradual upward path of interest rates should help\navoid financial imbalances and a potential build-up of financial stability risks that could arise from the\nextended period of very low interest rates. And it puts monetary policy in a better position to address\nwhatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\n\f8\nThe gradual upward path of interest rates is consistent with the median path across the projections\nsubmitted by FOMC participants at last week’s meeting. The median path of appropriate policy in those\nprojections has the fed funds rate gradually rising to between 2 and 2-1/4 percent by the end of this year,\nwith further gradual increases over the next two years should the economy evolve as anticipated.\nCompared to the December projections, the FOMC’s median path over next year and the following year\nhas steepened a bit, reflecting the policymakers’ views that the medium-run outlook has strengthened,\nwith somewhat stronger output growth and a lower unemployment rate. The change in the median path is\nan excellent illustration of how our views of appropriate policy are related to the economic outlook.\nPolicymakers don’t react to any small change in the data, but if incoming information suggests a change\nin our medium-run forecast, our projected appropriate policy path can change. The FOMC projections\ngive a sense of the participants’ current views on appropriate policy given their current outlook. But the\npath policy actually takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves and the implications of\nincoming information for the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook. If the upside risks to\ngrowth come to pass, we may need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we\nmay need to go a bit slower.\n\nI’ve been discussing the fed funds rate because changing its target range is the main way to adjust the\nstance of policy during normal times. But during extraordinary times, other tools are needed. To address\nthe Great Recession, the FOMC brought the fed funds rate down to effectively zero, and then to put\nfurther downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, it undertook several programs to purchase\nlonger-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\nAs a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6\npercent of nominal GDP, to about $4.4 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. The balance sheet’s\ncomposition changed from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\n\n\f9\nLast October, the FOMC began implementing its plan to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet in terms of the\nsize and composition of assets. 3 Maturing Treasuries and principal payments of agency MBS and agency\ndebt are allowed to gradually roll off the balance sheet up to a monthly cap, with the caps rising over\ntime. The gradual, predictable decline in assets, which will take several years to complete, allows\nbalance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on setting the\nappropriate level of the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool.\n\nFuture Considerations for the Monetary Policy Agenda: Operating Framework and Monetary\nPolicy Framework\nI’d like to end my talk by briefly touching on two future monetary policy considerations: the operating\nframework that the FOMC uses to ensure that its policy rate is being maintained at the appropriate level,\nand the monetary policy framework that the FOMC uses to determine what that appropriate level of the\npolicy rate is to promote our longer-run monetary policy goals. 4\n\nYou may have noticed that I didn’t tell you how large the Fed’s balance sheet will be once we complete\nnormalization. We do know the balance sheet will be larger than it was prior to the financial crisis for the\nsimple reason that the public’s demand for currency is rising over time. But the balance sheet will also\nlikely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much smaller depends on how the FOMC\n\n3\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf)\n\n4\n\nFor further discussion of monetary policy frameworks, see Mester, Loretta J., “Monetary Policy Frameworks,”\nNational Association for Business Economics and American Economic Association Session at the Allied Social\nScience Associations Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, January 5, 2018,\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180105-monetary-policy-frameworks) and\nMester, Loretta J., “Remarks on the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework,” panel remarks at the 2018 U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School\nof Business, New York, NY, February 23, 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180223-remarks-on-the-fomcs-monetarypolicy-framework).\n\n\f10\nimplements monetary policy in the future. 5 Before the crisis, the FOMC kept the supply of bank reserves\nscarce. The FOMC could make small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries,\nand this allowed the FOMC to ensure that the market-clearing interest rate at which banks lend reserves to\neach other overnight, the fed funds rate, was maintained at the FOMC’s target.\n\nBut now, as a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks\nare holding around $2.2 trillion in reserves in accounts at the Fed, and about $2 trillion of this amount is\nin excess of what is required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have\nlittle effect on the fed funds rate. Instead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into its target range by\nadjusting the rate it pays on excess reserves.\n\nEach of these operating frameworks has its strengths, and as balance-sheet normalization progresses, the\nFOMC will need to decide which operating framework it will use going forward.\n\nAnother consideration for the FOMC is the framework it uses to determine appropriate monetary policy.\nCurrently, we use a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework recognizes that, over the\nlonger run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of\nthe economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary\npolicy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment from maximum employment. I\nbelieve this framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in promoting our policy goals.\nIt has been the choice of many central banks around the globe.\n5\n\nFor an accessible description of frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see Ihrig, Jane E., Meade, Ellen\nE., and Weinbach, Gretchen C., “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach\nto Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198\n(http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177).\nFor projections of the Fed’s asset holdings in its System Open Market Account (SOMA), see Bonis, Brian,\nIhrig, Jane, and Wei, Min, “Projected Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio and the 10-Year Treasury Term Premium\nEffect,” FEDS Notes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 22, 2017\n(https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2081).\n\n\f11\n\nNevertheless, it is legitimate to ask whether any changes in our monetary policy framework would be\nhelpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability. First, as a matter of good governance, a central bank\nshould periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models. 6 Second, based on demographics,\nhigher demand for safe assets, and other factors, many economists anticipate that the longer-term\nequilibrium real interest rate will remain lower than in past decades. If so, then compared to the past,\nthere would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative economic shock, the\nprobability of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound would be higher, and nontraditional monetary\npolicy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that these tools are less effective than the\ntraditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the potential would be for longer\nrecessions and longer bouts of low inflation. 7\n\nTo help mitigate this issue, researchers have suggested several alternative frameworks, such as targeting\nan inflation rate higher than 2 percent, or instead of targeting inflation, targeting a path for the price level\nor for nominal GDP. The positives and negatives of these and other frameworks would need to be\nthoroughly reviewed. Such reviews take considerable time and so it may be appropriate for the FOMC to\ncommence a framework assessment later this year.\n\nI am open-minded on the outcome, but at the same time, I think the bar should be high for adopting a new\nframework. The current framework has been largely successful, there is little experience with alternative\nframeworks here or abroad, and since we are not starting from scratch, transition costs would need to be\nconsidered. Even if the FOMC concludes it is best not to adopt a new framework, the review will help\n6\n\nFor example, the Bank of Canada renews its agreement with the government on its inflation target every five years.\nThe next renewal is in 2021.\n7\n\nAlthough I don’t discuss them here, other government policies might also be brought to bear to increase the longterm growth rate and equilibrium interest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Such policies\nwould focus on increasing productivity growth and labor force participation.\n\n\f12\ndetermine if improvements to the current framework could make it even more effective at achieving our\nmonetary policy goals, given the current and future economic environment.\n\nNow, paraphrasing French mathematician Blaise Pascal, if I had had more time, I would have written a\nshorter speech. Before we run out of time for questions, I’d like to end here and thank you for your\nattention.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks at the\n2018 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nSponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets\nat the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 23, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI will focus my brief remarks on the FOMC’s monetary policy framework for determining the appropriate\npolicy to promote our longer-run monetary policy goals. 1 The views I’ll present are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nRecently, some economists and policymakers have recommended that the FOMC evaluate its monetary\npolicy framework. Indeed, a careful reader of the January FOMC minutes, released earlier this week,\nmight have noticed that a few participants suggested such an examination. 2 The FOMC has not indicated\nwhether or not it will undertake such a review. But let me provide my own thoughts on the rationale for\nundertaking an assessment, what it might cover, and the timing, that is, the why, what, and when of a\nreview. I’ll also briefly discuss some alternative frameworks that should be part of the assessment. But\nfirst, some background.\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting\nThe Fed’s longer-run monetary policy goals are price stability and maximum employment. Congress\nspecified these goals but gave the Fed considerable independence in choosing the framework used to\nachieve these goals. The FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework\nrecognizes that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying\nreal structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum\nemployment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment\nfrom maximum employment.\n\n1\n\nI view the monetary policy framework as distinct from the operating framework, which is more tactical and is\nconcerned with the tools used to implement appropriate policy choices, e.g., whether to operate with a large amount\nof reserves as in a floor system or a smaller amount of reserves as in a corridor system to hit the policy interest rate.\n\n2\n\nFOMC (February 2018).\n\n\f2\n\nThe framework is briefly described in the FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy\nstrategy. 3 This statement was initially released in January 2012 when the FOMC adopted an explicit\nnumerical inflation goal. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured by the year-over-year\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. “Symmetric” means\nthat the 2 percent inflation goal is not a ceiling. The inflation measures will vary from month to month,\nsometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent, but we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on average\nover the longer run.\n\nWhy Review the Framework?\nThe flexible inflation-targeting framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in\npromoting our monetary policy goals. So why review the framework? There are a couple of reasons.\nFirst, as a matter of good governance, it behooves the Fed to conduct periodic reviews of its assumptions,\nmethods, and models. This is the way the FOMC has operated for some time. For example, as indicated\nin the minutes, the January FOMC meeting included staff briefings and a discussion of inflation analysis\nand forecasting models.4 It is a standard best practice for a central bank to assess its performance. 5\n\nAnother reason for the FOMC to review its framework derives from the experience of the Great\nRecession and its aftermath. To fight disinflationary pressures and economic contraction, the policy rate\nwas brought to effectively zero, where it remained for seven years, and unconventional tools, including\nforward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, were used. Although the recovery was slow in coming,\nthe economic expansion is now firmly in place, labor markets are strong, and inflation is expected to\n\n3\n\nSee FOMC (January 30, 2018).\n\n4\n\nSee FOMC (February 2018).\n\n5\n\nFor example, the Bank of Canada renews its agreement with the government on its inflation target every five years.\nThe next renewal is in 2021.\n\n\f3\nreturn to 2 percent on a sustained basis over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, the post-crisis\neconomic environment is expected to differ in some important ways from the pre-crisis world.\n\nThe expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation rates due to changes in\ndemographics will weigh on long-run economic growth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the\nlonger-term equilibrium interest rate. 6,7 Real interest rates may potentially remain lower than in past\ndecades. If so, then compared to the past, there would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion\nagainst a negative economic shock, the probability of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound would\nbe higher, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that\nthese tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the\npotential would be for longer recessions and longer bouts of low inflation. This raises the legitimate\nquestion of whether any changes in our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining\nmacroeconomic stability in this environment. 8\n\nWhat Should a Review Cover?\nWe cannot know whether the FOMC would have been even more successful had it used a different\nmonetary policy framework in the times leading up to and following the financial crisis. But that’s the\nwrong question. The review should focus on evaluating whether changing the framework could make\nmonetary policy even more effective given the current and future economic environment.\n\n6\n\nSee Mester (2017).\n\n7\n\nFOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the fed funds rate that will be consistent with maximum\nemployment and price stability over the longer run. The median estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March\n2014 to 2.8 percent today. (See FOMC (April 2014) and FOMC (January 2018).) Also, empirical estimates of the\nequilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are lower than in the past. For a review of\nthe literature on the equilibrium interest rate, see Hamilton, et al. (2015).\n\n8\n\nAlthough I don’t discuss them here, other government policies might also be brought to bear to increase the longterm growth rate and equilibrium interest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Such policies\nwould focus on increasing productivity growth and labor force participation.\n\n\f4\nI remain open-minded on this. At the same time, a change from flexible inflation targeting shouldn’t be\ndecided cavalierly. There is little experience with alternative frameworks because the central banks of\nmost advanced economies like the U.S. have used some form of inflation targeting. In my view, the\nsuccess of the current framework, coupled with the lack of empirical evidence on alternatives, means that\nthe bar should be high for changing to a new framework. It is important to recognize that any framework\nwill have positives and negatives and we are not starting from scratch, there is a framework in place, so\ntransition costs need to be considered.\n\nTwo important parts of any framework are communication and credibility. The FOMC has been on a\njourney over the past couple of decades to make our monetary policy more transparent to the public and\nChairman Powell has emphasized that the FOMC will continue on this journey. 9 When the public has a\nbetter understanding of the goals and rationale for monetary policy decisions, they are better able to hold\npolicymakers accountable for their actions. But effective communication also makes monetary policy\nitself more effective by providing the public with information about the economic outlook and aligning\nthe public’s expectations about future policy actions. Thus, an important aspect of any framework is how\nwell it communicates monetary policy to businesses and households that are making economic decisions.\nIf the framework is not well understood, its benefits cannot be captured.\n\nAnother important aspect of any monetary policy framework is its credibility. Is the framework credible\nto the public so that they will formulate expectations about future policy based on the framework? Is it a\nframework that future Committees will stick with? Of course, one determinant of a framework’s\ncredibility is its effectiveness in achieving monetary policy goals. So effectiveness, communication, and\ncredibility, and the interactions among these three need to be part of assessing the framework.\n\n9\n\nSee Powell (2018).\n\n\f5\nWhen Should a Review Commence?\nAfter coming through the financial crisis and Great Recession, the economy has returned to normal and\nmonetary policy, including the policy rate and the balance sheet, is normalizing. The smooth transition to\nnew Fed leadership is also underway. Nothing is broken and a return to a normal economy and normal\npolicymaking gives us an opportunity to look at some longer-run issues. This suggests to me that it may\nbe appropriate later this year to begin an assessment of our current monetary policy framework and\nalternatives. Such reviews take time and should be thorough. As I mentioned, the FOMC adopted its\nnumerical inflation goal in January 2012, but this came after years of study and discussion going back to\nat least May 1996, with subsequent discussions in 2005, 2009, and 2011. Even if the FOMC concludes\nthat it is best to stay with its current framework, the review will have served the Committee well and may\nindicate some ways we can further improve our monetary policy transparency and communication.\n\nSome Alternative Frameworks\nI will end my remarks by briefly noting some alternative frameworks that could be assessed as part of a\nreview. I will not have time to discuss their strengths and weaknesses at length, but I can give you a\nflavor. 10\n\nHigher Inflation Target\nOne alternative is to keep the flexible inflation-targeting framework but set a higher longer-run inflation\ntarget, say, 4 percent instead of 2 percent. 11 This would be a familiar arrangement but give the nominal\nrate more of a cushion from hitting the zero lower bound for any given negative shock. But does the gain\nfrom more likely avoiding the zero lower bound when a negative shock hits outweigh the costs of running\na higher level of inflation at all times? Will it be easy to raise inflation expectations after having\n\n10\n\nSee Mester (2018) for further discussion of monetary policy frameworks and their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n11\n\nSee Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro (2010) for discussion.\n\n\f6\nsuccessfully anchored them at 2 percent? Is 4 percent inflation seen as consistent with price stability?\nThese questions will need to be answered.\n\nPrice-Level Targeting and Nominal GDP Targeting\nPrice-level targeting and nominal GDP targeting involve targeting a path for the nominal level rather than\na growth rate. Unlike inflation targeting, which lets bygones-be-bygones, these level-targeting\nframeworks make up for past deviations from the path. 12 For example, when inflation has been running\nlow, price-level targeting builds in a form of forward commitment to higher inflation in the future and a\n“low for longer” interest rate strategy. In theory, this can move current inflation expectations up, buoying\ncurrent inflation and limiting the time the economy spends at the zero lower bound. 13 There is little\ninternational experience with these frameworks and there are measurement issues to contend with: the\nstarting point for the path matters, data revisions would be more serious because these frameworks do not\nlet bygones-be-bygones, and to know what inflation will be along the nominal GDP path, one needs a\nreliable estimate of potential real output growth. 14,15 There are also credibility issues. Is it credible that\npolicymakers will keep interest rates low to make up for past shortfalls even when demand is growing\nstrongly or that they will tighten policy when demand is weak after a supply shock has raised the price\nlevel?\n\n12\n\nThe academic literature suggests that a price-level-targeting framework may approximate optimal monetary policy\nwhen policymakers want to minimize fluctuations in the output gap and in inflation around a target, and it can be\nparticularly useful at the zero lower bound by putting upward pressure on inflation expectations and, thereby,\ndownward pressure on the real rate. See Kahn (2009) for an accessible discussion of price-level targeting.\n\n13\n\nSee Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n\n14\n\nSweden did price-level targeting for less than two years when it went off the gold standard in 1931. See Kahn\n(2009).\n15\n\nFigure 1 in Mester (2018) shows four different starting points for the price-level path: the first quarters of 1990,\n1995, 2001, and 2007. If the starting point is 1990Q1, the price level is essentially on its path, and if the starting\npoint is 2001Q1, it is near its path. The other two starting points show a larger gap.\n\n\f7\nTemporary Price-Level Targeting\nFormer Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has suggested a temporary price-level-targeting framework, which\ninvolves targeting inflation in normal times but switching to price-level targeting once the policy rate has\nfallen to the zero lower bound. 16 Policymakers would revert to inflation targeting and begin to raise\ninterest rates once the cumulative inflation rate from the time the zero lower bound was hit had risen\nsustainably back to target. This framework might be easy to communicate because it could be discussed\nsolely in terms of the inflation goal; however, determining and communicating the timing of when to\nswitch back to the inflation-targeting regime could be complex.\n\nSummary\nA review of monetary policy frameworks should consider these alternatives, as well as others. The goal\nwould be to assess which framework would make monetary policy the most effective at achieving its\ngoals, given the current and future economic environment, and whether any changes to the current\nframework could enhance monetary policy communications, credibility, and transparency.\n\n16\n\nBernanke (2017).\n\n\f8\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., “Temporary Price-Level Targeting: An Alternative Framework for Monetary Policy,”\nBen Bernanke’s Blog, The Brookings Institution, October 12, 2017.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2017/10/12/temporary-price-level-targeting-analternative-framework-for-monetary-policy/)\nBlanchard, Olivier, Giovanni Dell’Ariccia, and Paolo Mauro, “Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy,”\nJournal of Money, Credit and Banking 42(s1), 2010, pp. 199-215.\n(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2010.00334.x/full)\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary\nPolicy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1, 2003, pp. 139-233.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-zero-bound-on-interest-rates-and-optimal-monetary-policy/)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 18-19, 2014,” April 2014.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20140319.pdf)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 12-13, 2017,” January 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, January 30-31, 2018,” February 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180131.pdf)\nFOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24,\n2012; as amended effective January 30, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\nHamilton, James D., Ethan S.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGovernment Affairs Breakfast Series\nDayton Area Chamber of Commerce\nDayton, OH\n\nFebruary 13, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to speak at today’s breakfast. Yesterday\nI had the opportunity to meet with several community organizations and to tour several Dayton\nneighborhoods. As I’m sure you know, we analyze a lot of data at the Fed. But augmenting the\neconomic and financial statistics by getting out and about in the Fourth District gives me a better sense of\nwhat is happening in the economy in real time. Nothing provides a more powerful reminder that Federal\nReserve policy affects real people and local communities. They say that all politics is local. In a sense,\nmonetary policy is, too. Although we set a national monetary policy, the local information we gather\nfrom contacts around the country allows those policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the\nAmerican economy and its people. The Fed’s regional structure, with 12 Reserve Banks distributed\nacross the country, overseen by the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., supports us in this work.\nThe information we get in the field helps us evaluate economic developments, formulate an outlook, and\nultimately make better policy decisions.\n\nToday, I will provide my assessment of economic developments, and my outlook for the economy and\nmonetary policy. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nLet me start with an issue that is on everybody’s mind: what’s going on in financial markets? The past\nweek or so has been a roller coaster ride of ups and downs in the stock market, with a sudden increase in\nvolatility. Longer-term bond rates have also moved up. It’s helpful to put this into perspective. Equity\nmarkets had generally been on a sizable upswing over the past year, with the S&P 500 index up 19\npercent in 2017, amidst extremely low volatility. While some commentators thought that the low level of\ninterest rates and high earnings prospects supported high stock market valuations, others thought that\nequity prices had begun to outpace earnings, that bond yields were too low given the economic outlook,\n\n\f2\nand that a correction was waiting to happen, it was just a matter of time. Of course, it is investors, not\ncommentators, who determine prices and yields. Even with the recent movements, as of Friday, the\nS&P 500 index is still significantly higher than it was a year ago. Bond yields are at levels seen at the\nstart of 2014.\n\nWhenever there are such big swings in the market, we need to assess their implications. In the near term,\nwe look at whether the market swing is accompanied by disorderly trading, a lack of liquidity, or\ncontagion to other markets. We have not seen this: trading has been relatively orderly, markets have\nremained generally liquid, and there hasn’t been a pullback in credit. We also assess whether there are\nspillovers to the broader economy that could affect the medium-run economic outlook. While a deeper\nand more persistent drop in equity markets could dash confidence and lead to a pullback in risk-taking\nand spending, the movements we have seen are far away from this scenario. I’ll continue to monitor\nfinancial market developments closely, but for now, I expect the economy will work through this episode\nof market turbulence and I have not changed my outlook. In my view, the underlying fundamentals\nsupporting the economy are very sound.\n\nFinancial conditions remain accommodative. Household and business balance sheets are healthy and\nincomes are growing. We’ve also seen improvement in the economies of many of our trading partners,\nwhich helps U.S. export growth. Monetary policy is accommodative and the changes in tax policy will\nalso have a positive effect on growth this year and next.\n\nThe economic expansion is now in its ninth year, and I expect 2018 will be another good year for the\neconomy, with growth around 2-1/2 percent, which is stronger than my 2 percent estimate of trend\ngrowth. I anticipate that the tax package will add about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point to annual growth over\nthe next couple of years, but based on the positive reactions so far, there’s an upside risk that the effect\ncould be larger. Labor markets have been strong, and I expect that strength to continue, with above-trend\n\n\f3\nemployment growth continuing and the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent. Inflation has been\nrunning under 2 percent, but I expect it to gradually move up to our goal of 2 percent over the next one to\ntwo years.\n\nThe task before Fed policymakers is to calibrate monetary policy to this healthy economy so that our\ncongressionally mandated long-run goals of maximum employment and price stability are met. This\nmeans making sure we don’t get behind the curve given the economy’s strength but also making sure we\ndon’t overreact to the positive outlook. To my mind, that means if economic conditions evolve as\nexpected, we’ll need to make some further increases in interest rates this year and next year, at a pace\nsimilar to last year’s. I think this gradual approach is the best strategy for sustaining the expansion and\nbalancing the risks to our dual-mandate goals.\n\nThat’s a summary of my outlook, which is informed by economic information, so let’s review some of\nthat now.\n\nEconomic growth\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent from a moderate annual pace of about 2 percent\nover the prior years of the expansion. Consumer spending, which makes up over two-thirds of output,\nshowed strength last year and my outlook is that it will remain healthy. Personal incomes are growing\nbecause labor market conditions are strong. In addition, household balance sheets are in much better\nshape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. Even\nafter the recent downturn in stock prices, increases in stock prices and house prices over the past year\nhave contributed to a rise in household wealth in the aggregate. In fact, the housing equity held by\nhouseholds is now above its peak before the housing crash.\n\n\f4\nThe recovery in housing took some time to gain traction. Buyers, sellers, developers, and bankers were\nall wary about re-entering the market because of the fallout from the housing bust. But low interest rates\nand the improved financial condition of households and lenders have led to increased construction and\nsales. Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nThe pickup in business investment last year was a welcome development. Investment was weak in 2015\nand 2016, as the sharp drop in oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar weighed on the energy and\nmanufacturing sectors. Last year, conditions improved: oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated as the\neconomies of our trading partners began to strengthen. For the first time in many years, growth around\nthe world is picking up and forecasts for global growth are being revised up. This has a positive feedback\neffect on the U.S. economy via exports. In the U.S., business sentiment is high, our business contacts are\nreporting increasing demand, and national and regional surveys show rising levels of activity and orders\nin the manufacturing and service sectors.\n\nLabor markets\nThe labor market is strong and I expect that strength to continue. Last year, the economy added over 2\nmillion jobs, about 180 thousand per month. In January, payroll jobs rose by 200 thousand. This pace of\njob growth is well above trend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per\nmonth. The unemployment rate is now 4.1 percent. This is seven-tenths of a percentage point lower than\nit was a year ago and below its lowest point during the last expansion. It is well below the range most\neconomists associate with full employment, including my own estimate of 4-3/4 percent. Other\nindicators, including broader measures of unemployment, the job openings rate, and the job turnover rate,\nshow that the labor market is strong. I expect this strength to continue and that the unemployment rate\nwill move down below 4 percent this year.\n\n\f5\nDayton has also benefited from an improving job market. After peaking at just over 12 percent after the\nGreat Recession, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5 percent. Over the past year, payrolls have\ngrown at a brisk 2-3/4 percent pace. This is quite a reversal, as Dayton has had its challenges. Over the\n2001-2007 expansion, the Dayton region lost over 5 percent of its payroll jobs, while jobs grew more than\n5 percent in the nation. During the Great Recession, payroll jobs fell about 8 percent here compared to 5\npercent in the nation. But things have improved. In the Dayton region, payrolls are up 10 percent since\nthe start of the expansion, an increase of about 35 thousand jobs.\n\nSome of the regional differences reflect differences in industry mix. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base\nremains the largest employer in the area. It added jobs during the recession and helped to cushion some\nof the job losses in other sectors. On the other hand, manufacturing employment has been on a longerterm downward trend, at both the regional and the national level, and compared to the nation,\nmanufacturing represents a relatively larger share of payroll jobs in the Dayton region. Even so, that\ndifference has narrowed over time as Dayton’s economy has been transitioning from one that is largely\ndependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one that is diversifying into health care and education.\nIn the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 19 percent of Dayton’s jobs and “eds and meds”\nrepresented about 13 percent. Those shares have now reversed. In the past decade, the share of jobs in\neds and meds has been 19 percent, while the share in manufacturing has been 11 percent. Regions that\nhave diversified their industrial base have generally fared better over time, and effective leadership, like\nthat provided by the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, can help the region navigate this transition.\n\nAs both national and regional labor markets have tightened, our contacts throughout the Fourth District\nhave been reporting for a while that they’ve had trouble finding qualified workers. These reports are now\ncoming from a wide range of firms across different sectors and cover both higher-skill and lower-skill\noccupations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the tightness in the labor market is gradually showing up\nin higher compensation. Earlier in the expansion compensation growth was under 2 percent; more\n\n\f6\nrecently, it has increased to over 2-1/2 percent. The latest employment report showed another pickup in\nwage growth. These increases are consistent with the increasing number of reports from firm contacts\nwho tell us that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages and benefits to attract and\nretain workers.\n\nOverall, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions monetary policy can address,\nwe are slightly beyond the maximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, that is, PCE inflation. “Symmetric” means that the 2 percent inflation goal isn’t a ceiling.\nThe inflation measures will vary from month to month, sometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent,\nbut we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on average over the longer run.\n\nInflation has been running below this goal for some time, but the recent news on inflation has been\npositive. Inflation moved up from the very low levels seen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil\nand import prices. Inflation readings were above 2 percent early last year, but then fell below 2 percent\npartly due to special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans.\nSince the lows seen last summer, inflation has moved up. We will likely see higher inflation numbers\nonce the price declines of last March drop out of the year-over-year measures. But just as we didn’t\noverreact to last summer’s weaker inflation readings, we shouldn’t overreact to these increases either.\nInstead, I remain focused on the medium-run outlook for inflation, and I anticipate that with the economy\ngrowing above trend and the demand for labor resources continuing to strengthen, inflation will gradually\nmove up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years.\n\n\f7\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of this forecast. Inflation expectations help to\nanchor actual inflation rates, and this stability has already proved its value during this business cycle.\nDuring the dark days of the Great Recession, the deep pullback in activity and collapse in demand could\nhave led to deflation – not just low inflation rates but actually falling prices. But deflationary conditions\ndid not develop because policy responses helped to maintain people’s expectations that prices would\nremain stable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return to goal. The fact that\ninflation expectations remain reasonably stable gives me confidence that inflation will gradually move\nback to goal. But since inflation forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty, I’ll keep evaluating my\ninflation forecast as the year progresses.1,2 I’ll also need to continue to evaluate the effects of the recent\nchanges in tax policy. So let me discuss fiscal policy before I turn to monetary policy.\n\nFiscal Policy\nI expect that the tax changes will increase spending and raise economic growth over the next couple of\nyears. At this point, it is difficult to be precise about the magnitude of the effect of the fiscal stimulus\nfrom the tax changes; as I mentioned, I’m estimating an additional 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point of annual\ngrowth this year and next year, but there is some upside risk that the effects could be larger. The impact\non individual households will depend on the level and sources of their income, but in the aggregate, I\nexpect lower personal tax rates and higher standard deductions to spur some additional household\nspending. On the corporate side, lower tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and\nintangibles should spur additional business spending to meet higher near-term demand, but how much\nremains to be seen. Except for firms in the tax consulting business, the majority of our business contacts\n1\n\nBased on historical forecast errors over the past 20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE\ninflation one year ahead is plus or minus 1 percentage point. (See Table 2: “Average Historical Projection Error\nRanges,” in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nDecember 12-13, 2017 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf).\n2\n\nA significant portion of the variation in inflation rates comes from idiosyncratic factors that can’t be forecasted.\nSee Yellen, Janet, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial\nLecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/yellen20150924a.pdf).\n\n\f8\nhave told us that while they welcome lower tax rates, they aren’t planning to make significant changes to\ntheir capital or hiring plans as a result of the change in taxes. Instead, those firms planning to increase\nspending and hiring say those increases are driven by brighter sales prospects and stronger demand. At\nthe same time, some businesses attributed the firm-wide bonuses they paid to workers at the end of the\nyear to the tax cuts, and others have taken the occasion to implement wage increases they had\ncontemplated for some time. Firms might also be expected to spend some of their tax savings on\nincreased dividends and share buybacks. I expect to have a better read on how households and firms are\nactually responding to the tax changes over the next several months.\n\nA stronger outlook for business spending and hiring is a welcome development because investment and\nlabor force growth are key determinants of productivity growth and productivity growth is a key\ndeterminant of an economy’s longer-run output growth and of living standards. The U.S. economy has\nbeen struggling with very low productivity growth during this expansion, on the order of only 1 percent.3\nThis is less than half the pace over the prior two expansions, and partially explains why wage growth has\nbeen relatively sluggish despite the tightness in labor markets. In addition, as a result of lower population\ngrowth and labor force participation, the growth of the U.S. labor force has slowed considerably, from 2.5\npercent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to around 0.5 percent per year over 2010-2016. It is expected\nto remain near that level over the next decade.4\n\nI expect some increase in productivity growth as the expansion continues. It is possible that the tax\nchanges could spur higher labor force participation and investment in physical and human capital, thereby\nhaving a positive effect on the economy’s productive capacity, its productivity growth, and its trend\n3\n\nLabor productivity as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 1 percent\nover this expansion.\n4\n\nAccording to the latest available projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that annual growth in\nthe labor force over 2016-2026 will average 0.6 percent. See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Economic\nProjections – 2016-26,” October 24, 2017, p. 2 (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecopro.pdf).\n\n\f9\ngrowth rate. But these effects from the tax changes are even more difficult to estimate than the effects on\nnear-term spending, and they would play out over a longer period of time. So I have not incorporated\nthem into my own projection for longer-run growth, which I put at 2 percent.\n\nAnother aspect of fiscal policy that needs to be considered is its effect on the longer-run budget deficit.\nBefore the tax package and recently passed federal budget deal, projected longer-run fiscal imbalances\nwere unlikely to be sustainable.5 Were the trend growth rate not to pick up, lower tax revenues and\nhigher federal spending would add to the deficit relative to GDP, making it even more likely that the\ngovernment would eventually need to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced or\nrestructured benefits, and increased taxes, thereby reducing any long-run positive effects of the recent\nchanges in fiscal policy. We will need to continue to evaluate the responses to tax changes not only as the\nyear progresses but into the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThis brings me to monetary policy. At its January meeting, the FOMC maintained the target range for the\nfed funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. This range was set in December, which saw the fifth increase in\nrates since December 2015, when the FOMC began removing some of the extraordinary monetary policy\naccommodation that was necessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. In January,\nthe FOMC also continued to implement its plan to normalize its balance sheet in terms of the size and\ncomposition of assets.6 To address the Great Recession and put downward pressure on longer-term\ninterest rates once the fed funds rate had hit effectively zero, the Fed undertook several programs to\n\n5\n\nFor further discussion, see Mester, Loretta J., “Demographics and Their Implications for the Economy and Policy,”\nCato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of Monetary Policy, Washington, D.C., November\n16, 2017 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20171116-demographics-and-theirimplications-for-the-economy-and-policy.aspx).\n6\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf).\n\n\f10\npurchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS). As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in\n2007, or 6 percent of nominal GDP, to about $4.5 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. The\ncomposition changed from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\nThe normalization plan, which began last October and will take several years to complete, involves letting\nmaturing Treasuries and principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to gradually roll off the\nbalance sheet up to a monthly cap, with the caps rising over time. The gradual, predictable decline in\nassets allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on\nsetting the appropriate level of the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool. The ultimate\nsize of the balance sheet will depend on how the FOMC decides to implement monetary policy in the\nfuture, a decision that has not yet been made.7\n\nI supported implementing the balance-sheet normalization plan and the December and January decisions\non interest rates. If the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be\nappropriate this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year’s. I believe this gradual upward path of\ninterest rates will help balance the risks and prolong the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price\nstability and maximum employment are met and maintained. This policy path gives inflation time to\nmove back to goal while, at the same time, avoiding a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that\ncould arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, with the Fed then having to raise rates sharply in\nresponse. It helps avoid a build-up of risks to financial stability should overly low interest rates\nencourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield. And it puts monetary\npolicy in a better position to address whatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are\nultimately realized.\n7\n\nFor an accessible description of frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see Ihrig, Jane E., Meade, Ellen\nE., and Weinbach, Gretchen C., “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach\nto Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198\n(http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177).\n\n\f11\n\nOf course, this is my current view of monetary policy. We will need to calibrate our policy decisions to\nhow the economy actually evolves and the implications of incoming information for the medium-run\noutlook and risks around the outlook. If the upside risks to growth come to pass, we may need to steepen\nthe path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we may need to go a bit slower. But this is normal\nmonetary-policy-setting behavior – we will calibrate our policy based on the outlook and the realized and\nexpected progress on our dual-mandate monetary policy goals.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nVantage Point: Economists on the Economy Series\nThe Council for Economic Education\nNew York, NY\nJanuary 18, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Nan Morrison, president and CEO of the Council for Economic Education, for inviting me to\nspeak this evening, and I thank Nan and Barry Haimes, chairman of the board, for inviting me to join the\nboard of the CEE. The CEE’s vision is to teach every child in America about personal finance and\neconomics, and the Council offers abundant resources to help teachers do just that. The Federal Reserve\nSystem also supports economic education as part of our mission to engage in our communities. The\nCleveland Fed’s Learning Center and Money Museum offers various programs for teachers and students\nwith the goal of increasing financial and economic literacy. What we have learned over the years is that\nwhen people have a better understanding of the economy, they can make better financial decisions and be\npart of the national discourse on the important economic policy choices facing the country.\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers are also in the economic education business. One of our tasks is to explain\nour views on the economy and monetary policy to the public. When they understand the rationale for our\npolicy decisions, people can hold us accountable for those decisions. But in addition, our policy is more\neffective when people understand how policy is likely to react to changes in the economic outlook. So\nI’m very happy to have this opportunity to talk about the economy and monetary policy. Let me remind\nyou that the views I’ll provide today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion is 8-1/2 years long and counting. It is now the third longest on record. But\nlooking at it this way is a little misleading. Remember, the economy had to dig out of a very deep hole\nafter the financial crisis and Great Recession. So it took quite a long time for the labor market to heal and\nthe expansion to gain traction. Now labor markets are strong and economic growth picked up to around\n2-1/2 percent last year, compared to the 2 percent pace seen over much of the expansion. This is about a\nquarter of a percentage point stronger than I expected at the beginning of last year. So the economy is\n\n\f2\ncoming into 2018 with positive momentum, and for the first time in a while, there are some more salient\nupside risks to the forecast.\n\nThe underlying fundamentals supporting the economy are very sound. Monetary policy and financial\nconditions are accommodative. Household and business balance sheets continue to improve, and incomes\nare growing. In addition, conditions in the economies of many of our trading partners are improving.\nYou’ll notice that I haven’t said anything yet about the recently passed tax package. The reduction in\nbusiness and personal taxes will likely also have some positive effect on growth this year and next.\n\nOverall, I expect 2018 to be a good year for the economy. My own expectation is that output growth will\nbe around 2-1/2 percent, above my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. I anticipate that fiscal policy will\nadd about ¼ to ½ percentage points to growth over the next couple of years. There’s an upside risk that\nthe effect could be larger. I expect labor markets will remain strong this year, with above-trend\nemployment growth continuing and the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent. Inflation ended up\nlast year slightly lower than I thought it would at the start of the year, but I anticipate it will gradually\nmove up to 2 percent over the next one to two years.\n\nThe goals of monetary policy, given to us by Congress, are to promote maximum employment and price\nstability. The task before us is to calibrate monetary policy to this healthy economy, so that the economic\nexpansion is sustained. In my view, this means that if the economy evolves as I anticipate, we’ll need to\nmake some further increases in interest rates this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year’s.\nThat’s a summary of my outlook, but let me give you some context so you’ll see how I got there.\n\nEconomic growth\nOver the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on\naverage. But last year, after a weak first quarter, growth picked up to an average pace of around 3 percent\n\n\f3\nover the remainder of the year. This pickup came in the midst of a severe hurricane season that caused a\nlot of damage in parts of the country. Growth was relatively balanced across sectors. Earlier in the\nexpansion, while consumer spending was relatively good, business spending was weak, and net exports\nwere a drag on growth. Last year, all three sectors made positive contributions, as did residential housing.\nThis balance should help to sustain the expansion going forward.\n\nAs I mentioned, I expect real GDP will grow at an above-trend 2-1/2 percent pace this year. Consumer\nspending makes up over two-thirds of output and the outlook for consumers remains sound. Spending\nduring the fourth quarter, including the holiday season, was healthy. Readings on consumer sentiment\nand confidence remain high, but even more important for spending, personal incomes are growing\nbecause labor market conditions are strong. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the\nGreat Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. The increases in stock\nprices and house prices over the past year have contributed to a rise in wealth in the household sector in\nthe aggregate. Although not true for every homeowner, the equity that households as a group have in\nhousing has risen above its previous peak before the housing crash.\n\nThis housing recovery has taken some time, but activity has picked up in recent months. Buyers, sellers,\ndevelopers, and bankers were all wary about reentering the market, and rightfully so, given the fallout\nfrom the housing bust. But low interest rates and the improved financial condition of households and\nlenders have led to increased construction and sales. Rebuilding after the hurricanes and fires in\nCalifornia will also add to construction activity for a time. In some places, demand for housing is\noutpacing supply and house prices are accelerating. They are rising at between 6 and 7 percent, on\naverage, nationally. Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable\npace.\n\n\f4\nBusiness investment has also picked up and this is a welcome development. Investment was weak in\n2015 and 2016, as the sharp drop in oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar weighed on the energy\nand manufacturing sectors. But conditions improved last year. Oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated\nas the economies of our trading partners began to strengthen. In fact, for the first time in many years,\ngrowth around the world is picking up. Business sentiment remains at high levels, and our business\ncontacts in manufacturing and services report increasing demand, consistent with readings from national\nand regional business surveys.\n\nLabor markets\nThe labor market is strong. Last year, the economy added over 2 million jobs, about 170 thousand per\nmonth, and the unemployment rate fell by six-tenths of a percentage point, to 4.1 percent. The pace of\njob growth is well above trend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per\nmonth. The unemployment rate is below the lowest level reached during the last expansion; it is well\nbelow the range most economists associate with full employment; and it is below the 4.3-5.0 percent\nrange that FOMC participants project for the unemployment rate over the longer run.1 In addition, the\nbroader measure of the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those working parttime who would prefer full-time jobs is near its pre-Great Recession low, and other labor market\nindicators like job openings and turnover rates indicate a strong labor market. I expect this strength to\ncontinue and that the unemployment rate will move down further, ending the year at slightly under 4\npercent. This is low by historical standards and well below my current estimate of its longer-run rate,\nwhich I put at 4-3/4 percent.\n\n1\n\nSee Minutes of the FOMC Meeting of December 12-13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20171213.htm).\n\n\f5\nWe continue to hear from a wide range of firms that labor market conditions are tight and businesses are\nfinding it hard to find workers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. Wages have\naccelerated from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to about 2-1/2 percent more recently. That\nstrikes some people as a rather modest acceleration given the tightness in labor markets, but it is\nconsistent with the low level of productivity growth we’ve seen over this expansion.2 Our business\ncontacts are increasingly reporting that they are responding to labor shortages by increasing wages and\noffering other benefits to attract and retain workers. These increases should eventually find their way into\nthe aggregate compensation measures.\n\nOverall, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can\naddress, we are slightly beyond the maximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\nOne might ask, what’s wrong with low unemployment? An unemployment rate below what is sustainable\ncan be a positive in the short run by bringing in workers from the sidelines of the labor market, but over\ntime, it can be a negative by creating bottlenecks, lowering productivity growth, and putting upward\npressure on inflation, which might require a policy response.\n\nInflation\nConsistent with meeting the price stability part of its mandate, the FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2\npercent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The 2 percent inflation goal isn’t a ceiling. The inflation measures\nwill vary from month to month, sometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent, but we aim to keep\ninflation at 2 percent on average over the longer run.\n2\n\nAlthough actual wage setting is a complicated process, in economic models of competitive markets, real wages\nreflect the marginal product of workers. For a discussion of wages and their relationship to productivity growth over\nthe expansion, see Pinheiro, Roberto and Yang, Meifeng, “Wage Growth after the Great Recession,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, Economic Commentary, March 21, 2017 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economic-commentaries/ec-201704-wage-growth-after-greatrecession.aspx).\n\n\f6\n\nInflation has been running below this goal for some time. Inflation moved up from the very low levels\nseen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil and import prices. Inflation readings were above 2\npercent early last year, but then fell below 2 percent partly due to special factors, like the drop in the\nprices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans. Toward the end of the year, inflation readings\nshowed some stability, but inflation ended the year at 1-3/4 percent, below our goal.\n\nI anticipate that with the economy growing above trend and the demand for labor resources continuing to\nstrengthen, inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two\nyears. Stable inflation expectations are an important component of this forecast. Inflation expectations\nhelp to anchor actual inflation rates, and this stability has already proved its value during this business\ncycle. During the dark days of the Great Recession, the collapse in demand could have led to deflation –\nnot only low inflation rates but actually falling prices – because the pullback in activity was so deep. But\ndeflationary conditions did not develop because policy responses helped to maintain people’s\nexpectations that prices would remain stable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return\nto goal. The fact that inflation expectations remain reasonably stable gives me confidence that inflation\nwill gradually move back to goal. Of course, I also recognize that inflation forecasts – including my own\n– are subject to a lot of uncertainty.3,4 In determining appropriate monetary policy, we’ll need to keep\nevaluating the inflation forecast as the year moves on. We’ll also need to evaluate the effects of the\nrecent changes in tax policy, which are part of the economic environment. So let me discuss fiscal policy\nbefore I turn to monetary policy.\n3\n\nBased on historical forecast errors over the past 20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE\ninflation one year ahead is plus or minus 1 percentage point. (See Table 2: “Average Historical Projection Error\nRanges,” in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nDecember 12-13, 2017 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf).\n4\n\nA significant portion of the variation in inflation rates comes from idiosyncratic factors that can’t be forecasted.\nSee Yellen, Janet, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial\nLecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/yellen20150924a.pdf).\n\n\f7\nFiscal Policy\nI expect that the recently enacted tax changes will have a positive effect on economic growth over the\nnext couple of years. It is difficult to be precise about the magnitude of the effect of the fiscal stimulus;\nI’m estimating an additional ¼ to ½ percentage point of growth this year and next, but there is some\nupside risk that the effects could be larger. While the impact on individual households will depend on the\nlevel and sources of their income, in the aggregate, lower personal tax rates and higher standard\ndeductions are expected to spur some additional household spending. On the corporate side, lower tax\nrates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional business\nspending to meet higher near-term demand, but how much remains to be seen. The majority of our\nbusiness contacts have told us that while they welcome lower tax rates, they aren’t planning to make\nsignificant changes to their capital or hiring plans as a result of the change in taxes. Instead, those firms\nplanning to increase spending and hiring say the increases are being driven by brighter sales prospects and\nthe pickup in activity in the second half of last year. At the same time, some businesses attributed the\nfirm-wide bonuses they paid to workers at the end of the year to the tax cuts, and others have taken the\noccasion to implement wage increases they had contemplated for some time.\n\nA stronger outlook for business spending and hiring is a welcome development. In addition to having a\npositive effect on near-term demand, if lower taxes spur higher labor force participation, investment in\nphysical and human capital, research and development, and innovation, the tax package could also have a\npositive effect on the economy’s productive capacity, its productivity growth, and its trend growth rate.\nProductivity growth is a key determinant of an economy’s longer-run output growth and of living\nstandards. The U.S. economy has been struggling with very low productivity growth during this\nexpansion, on the order of only 1 percent.5 This is less than half the pace over the prior two expansions,\n\n5\n\nLabor productivity as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 1 percent\nover this expansion.\n\n\f8\nand partially explains why wage growth has been relatively sluggish despite the tightness in labor\nmarkets. In addition, as a result of lower population growth and labor force participation, the growth of\nthe U.S. labor force has slowed considerably, from 2.5 percent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to\naround 0.5 percent per year over 2010-2016. It is expected to remain near that level over the next\ndecade.6\n\nWhile I expect some increase in productivity growth as the expansion continues, the effects of changes in\ntax policy on productivity growth and labor force participation are even more difficult to estimate than\ntheir effects on near-term spending, and they would play out over a longer period of time. So I have not\nincorporated them into my own projection for longer-run growth, which I put at 2 percent.\n\nAnother aspect of the tax package that needs to be considered is its effect on the longer-run budget deficit.\nBefore the tax package, projected longer-run fiscal imbalances were unlikely to be sustainable.7 Were the\ntrend growth rate not to pick up, lower tax revenues would add to the deficit relative to GDP, making it\neven more likely that the government would need to respond with some combination of increased\nborrowing, reduced or restructured benefits, and increased taxes, thereby reducing any long-run benefits\nof the tax package. We will need to continue to evaluate the responses to tax changes as the year\nprogresses and into the future.\n\n6\n\nAccording to the latest available projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that annual growth in\nthe labor force over 2016-2026 will average 0.6 percent. See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Economic\nProjections – 2016-26,” October 24, 2017, p. 2 (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecopro.pdf).\n7\n\nFor further discussion, see Mester, Loretta J., “Demographics and Their Implications for the Economy and Policy,”\nCato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of Monetary Policy, Washington, D.C., November\n16, 2017 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20171116-demographics-and-theirimplications-for-the-economy-and-policy.aspx).\n\n\f9\nMonetary Policy\nAt its meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate by one-quarter\npercentage point to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. This was the fifth increase in rates since December 2015,\nwhen the FOMC began removing some of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that was\nnecessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nIn October, the Fed began implementing the plan to normalize its balance sheet in terms of the size and\ncomposition of assets.8 To address the Great Recession and put downward pressure on longer-term\ninterest rates once the fed funds rate had hit effectively zero, the Fed undertook several programs to\npurchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS). As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in\n2007, or 6 percent of nominal GDP, to about $4.5 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. The\ncomposition changed from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\nThe normalization plan, which will take several years to complete, involves letting maturing Treasuries\nand principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to gradually roll off the balance sheet up to a\nmonthly cap, with the caps rising over time. The gradual, predictable decline in assets allows balancesheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on setting the appropriate level\nof the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool. The ultimate size of the balance sheet will\ndepend on how the FOMC decides to implement monetary policy in the future, a decision that has not yet\nbeen made.9\n\n8\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf).\n9\n\nFor an accessible description of frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see Ihrig, Jane E., Meade, Ellen\nE., and Weinbach, Gretchen C., “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach\nto Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198\n(http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177).\n\n\f10\nI supported implementing the balance-sheet normalization plan and the December decision to raise rates.\nIf the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be appropriate this\nyear and next year, at a pace similar to last year’s.\n\nBased on my medium-run outlook, I believe this gradual upward path of interest rates will help balance\nthe risks and prolong the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment are met and maintained. This policy path gives inflation time to move back to goal while, at\nthe same time, avoiding a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is\nallowed to overheat, with the Fed then having to raise rates sharply in response. It helps avoid a build-up\nof risks to financial stability should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on excessively\nrisky investments in a search for yield. And it puts monetary policy in a better position to address\nwhatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nOf course, this is my current view of monetary policy. We will need to calibrate our policy decisions to\nhow the economy actually evolves and the implications of incoming information for the medium-run\noutlook and risks around the outlook. If you think this sounds like normal monetary policy-setting\nbehavior, you’re right – a positive sign that the economy is finally back to normal.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nThe Tangri Lecture\nRutgers University\nNew Brunswick, NJ\nJanuary 17, 2018\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\nI thank Tom Prusa, chair of the economics department, and Professor Joe Hughes for inviting me to\npresent the Tangri Lecture. It is an honor for me to be with you today. I’d also like to take the\nopportunity to thank Joe for our research collaboration, which has spanned many years – probably more\nthan we care to admit. Joe is a wonderful co-author, and he often tells me of the innovative techniques he\nis bringing to the classroom, so I would venture to say he is a dedicated and highly effective teacher as\nwell.\n\nThis afternoon I will speak about the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the value of clear\nmonetary policy communications. I’ll summarize some of the improvements the Fed has made to its\ncommunications, and then offer my recommendation for potential next steps. Of course, my remarks will\nreflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nFed Structure, Monetary Policy Independence, and Accountability\nBefore we can discuss monetary policy communications, it’s important to have a sense of the structure of\nthe Federal Reserve System.\n\nAfter a period of financial instability, Congress established the Fed in 1913 to promote the health of the\nU.S. economy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed to operate in the public interest as a\ndecentralized central bank: the Fed is independent within the government but not independent from the\ngovernment. At the time, there were concerns that the central bank would become dominated by financial\ninterests in New York or political interests in Washington. So the design includes representation from\nacross the country and balances public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street\nconcerns.\n\n\f2\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C. that oversees those Banks. The governors are appointed by the president of the United\nStates and confirmed by the Senate. Governors serve staggered terms of up to 14 years. These terms\nspan several terms of the president and members of Congress, which is intended to insulate the governors\nfrom short-term political influence and allows them to take a longer-run perspective when setting\nmonetary and financial regulatory policy. The chair and vice chair of the Board of Governors, and the\ngovernor who serves as vice chair of supervision, a position created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, are\nchosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate from among the sitting governors for four-year\nterms. The chair and vice chairs can be reappointed until their terms as governors expire.\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks are distributed around the country in locations that were the centers of economic\nactivity back when the Fed was established.1 Each Reserve Bank has a board of directors whose nine\nmembers are chosen in a nonpolitical process, with three representing banks and six representing\nbusiness, agricultural, industrial, and public interests in the Districts they serve. The nonbank directors\nare responsible for choosing a Reserve Bank’s president, who is subject to approval of the Fed’s Board of\nGovernors.\n\nThis regional structure has served the country well for more than 100 years. It allows monetary policy\ndecisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people, and also helps us to\ncarry out our other responsibilities. These include supervising and regulating banks and other important\nfinancial institutions, promoting the stability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing\nthe nation’s payments system, providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying\n\n1\n\nSome Reserve Banks also have Branches. For example, the Cleveland Fed has a Branch in Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, and a Branch in Cincinnati, Ohio. Each Branch of a Reserve Bank has a board of directors with five\nor seven members.\n\n\f3\neffective community development policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access\nto credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the body within the Fed that is responsible for setting\nmonetary policy. It holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year in Washington, D.C. The FOMC\nwas established by the Banking Act of 1935 and has 12 members: the seven members of the Board of\nGovernors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a\nrotating basis. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I vote every other year, rotating my vote with the\npresident of the Chicago Fed. Other than New York, Cleveland, and Chicago, the other presidents vote\nevery third year. I am a voting member this year, but it’s important to note that all presidents, whether\nvoting or nonvoting, participate in FOMC meetings.\n\nSo the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all\nparts of the country. And this regional information, along with economic and financial data and analysis,\nplays an important part in the FOMC’s setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our goals.\n\nThose monetary policy goals were given to the Fed by Congress. The Federal Reserve Act says that the\nFed should conduct monetary policy to “promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable\nprices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” When prices are stable and the economy is at maximum\nemployment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels, so it is often said that Congress has\ngiven the Fed a dual mandate.\n\nWhile Congress has set the Fed’s goals, it has also wisely given the Fed independence in making\nmonetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. This means monetary policy decisions do not have to\nbe approved by the president or Congress. This is wise because a substantial body of research and actual\n\n\f4\npractice indicate that when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run political\ninterference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nBut independence does not mean that the Fed should be unaccountable for its monetary policy decisions\nor that it shouldn’t be transparent about the rationale for those decisions. In fact, accountability must go\nhand in hand with independence or else independence from the political process won’t be sustainable.\nBecause it takes some time for monetary policy to affect the economy, the public won’t be able to\nimmediately see whether a policy action was a good one. So it is incumbent upon policymakers to\nexplain their decisions, their assessment of economic conditions, and their outlook for the economy. In\nother words, clear communications play a crucial role in monetary policymaking.\n\nThe Benefits of Clear Communications in Monetary Policymaking\nOne important benefit of clear communication is that it can actually make monetary policy more effective\nby helping households and businesses make better economic and financial decisions. The public will\nhave a better understanding of monetary policy when policymakers are clear about their policy goals,\nthose aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can’t influence, and the economic information that\ninfluences their forecasts and policy decisions. And when policymakers strive to be systematic in their\npolicy responses to changes in economic conditions that influence the outlook, the public will have a\nbetter idea of how monetary policy is likely to change as economic conditions evolve. They will have a\nbetter sense of how policy will react not only to anticipated changes in conditions but also to\nunanticipated economic developments. With such knowledge, households and firms can plan better; they\ncan make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions. In addition, when the public\nhas a clearer understanding of the strategy monetary policymakers follow in normal times, they will also\nunderstand when nonstandard monetary policy action is required in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\f5\nIndeed, in extraordinary times, like the financial crisis and deep recession we’ve lived through, policy\ncommunications not only provide transparency but they can also serve as a monetary policy tool. In\nparticular, once interest rates hit their effective zero lower bound, providing forward guidance about the\npath that policy will likely follow in the future has the potential to increase the current degree of monetary\npolicy accommodation. By reducing uncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance helps\nlower interest rates by reducing the premiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate\nuncertainty. In addition, in theory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest\nrates will be low for a long time – lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central\nbank’s past behavior – this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby adding\naccommodation and spurring current economic activity. In theory, if people believe that the central bank\nis committed to keeping interest rates very low, they will expect higher economic activity and higher\ninflation in the future and that will induce them to make investments in capital and labor today, thereby\nhelping the current economy.\n\nThe Fed and other central banks used forward guidance as a tool during the Great Recession. The Fed’s\nforward guidance took several forms. First, it was qualitative: the FOMC indicated in December 2008\nthat it anticipated that weak economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the\nfed funds rate for “some time.” In March 2009, “some time” became an “extended period.” In August\n2011, this qualitative forward guidance changed to calendar-date guidance when the FOMC said it\nanticipated an exceptionally low fed funds rate at least through mid-2013. That date was later extended to\nlate 2014, and then to mid-2015. In December 2012, calendar-date guidance was changed to statecontingent guidance when the FOMC said that it anticipated that the 0-to-¼ percent target range for the\nfed funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ percent,\ninflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point\nabove the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be\nwell anchored. Some form of this threshold guidance was used until March 2014. Since then, as the\n\n\f6\neconomy has returned to normal and policy is normalizing, the FOMC has been providing information\nabout the factors that will influence the future path of policy, but this is in the realm of regular policy\ncommunication conveying a sense of how the FOMC is likely to react to economic developments rather\nthan guidance as a policy tool.\n\nSteps the FOMC Has Taken to Enhance Monetary Policy Communications\nOver the past couple of decades, as the benefits of enhanced transparency have become better\nappreciated, the Federal Reserve has taken several steps to enhance its regular policy communications. I\nbelieve we’ve made substantial progress, although I also believe that achieving clearer monetary policy\ncommunications is better viewed as a journey rather than as a destination and we should always be\nworking to make our communications more effective.\n\nSome commentators have criticized the Fed for being, perhaps, a bit too transparent – with a cacophony\nof Fed voices speaking too many times. So it might surprise you to know that it wasn’t until 1994 that the\nFOMC began explicitly announcing changes in its targeted policy rate, the fed funds rate. Before 1994,\nthere was no post-meeting FOMC statement; the public had to infer what the FOMC decided by looking\nat how it implemented policy through its open market operations in financial markets. Now, the postmeeting statement describes the FOMC’s view of the state of the economy and the rationale for its\ndecisions. Since 2002, the statement has also included the votes of individual members and the preferred\npolicy choices of any dissenters. Further context for the decisions is provided in the meeting minutes.\nBefore 2005, these minutes weren’t released until after the subsequent FOMC meeting. Now they are\nreleased with only a three-week lag. Recently, the FOMC used the minutes to convey information about\nthe strategies it was considering for normalizing the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. 2 By\n\n2\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” as adopted effective June 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf), FOMC,\n“Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017,” April 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20170315.pdf), and FOMC, “Minutes of the\n\n\f7\nthe time it was announced in June 2017, the plan was well understood by market participants. In addition\nto minutes, the FOMC publishes a full transcript of each meeting with a five-year lag.\n\nAn important enhancement to monetary policy communications was the FOMC’s statement on longer-run\ngoals and monetary policy strategy, adopted in January 2012 and reviewed and reaffirmed each year\nsince. 3 This statement laid out for the first time the guiding principles the FOMC uses in setting\nmonetary policy. It recognizes that over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and\nnot the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or\nmaximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in\nemployment from maximum employment. Importantly, the statement also established an explicit\nnumerical goal for inflation over the longer run. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured by\nthe year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation.\nThe explicit target not only provides transparency to the public but it also underscores the FOMC’s\ncommitment to price stability, thereby helping to anchor expectations about inflation. Since inflation\nexpectations are an important determinant of actual inflation, having an explicit target helps promote\nprice stability.\n\nOutside of the blackout period around FOMC meetings, many of the FOMC participants present speeches\n– like this one – in which they share their perspectives on the economy and monetary policy with the\npublic. As I mentioned, sometimes this speaking is criticized, but as a public servant, I think it’s one of\nmy duties to explain my views. In addition to speeches, the chair testifies before subcommittees of both\nhouses of Congress at two regularly scheduled monetary policy hearings a year, and at additional hearings\nwhen asked. And since 2011, the chair has held press briefings after four FOMC meetings per year.\nFederal Open Market Committee, May 2-3, 2017,” May 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20170503.pdf).\n3\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” January 31, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf).\n\n\f8\nThese briefings allow the chair to expand on things that are too complex to discuss in the FOMC’s\nrelatively short post-meeting statement and to respond to questions from the media. The four meetings\nfollowed by press briefings are also ones at which the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic\nProjections, or SEP.\n\nThese projections, which are now quarterly, began in 2007. In ensuing years, the projections have been\nenhanced in various ways and I would expect us to consider further enhancements to the SEP over time,\nas part of our ongoing efforts to make our communications even more effective. The SEP now includes\nmore variables and a longer time horizon. The variables included are real output growth, the\nunemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation, that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices, which\ntend to be volatile. The projections also include participants’ anticipated path of appropriate policy given\ntheir outlook and their assessment of risks around the outlook. The projections are for the current year\nand for up to three additional years, and also provide participants’ longer-run estimates of key economic\nvariables. Most recently, the FOMC added confidence bands around the median projections across the\nparticipants.\n\nI view the addition of confidence bands as an important enhancement, because these bands illustrate in a\nsimple way the reasonable amount of variation to expect in forecasts and in outcomes relative to\nprojections. They remind us of the important message that the economy can evolve in unexpected ways.\nFor example, as shown in the latest SEP projections, 4 the 70 percent confidence interval around the\nmedian forecast of real GDP growth is about ±1.7 percentage points for this year and a little over ±2.0\npercentage points for each of the following two years; for inflation, it is about ±1.0 percentage point for\n\n4\n\nSee FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 12-13, 2017,” January 2018\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf).\n\n\f9\neach of the next three years, and for the fed funds rate, it is about 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percentage points over the\nnext three years.\n\nThe Communications Challenge\nAccording to Voltaire, “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.” In our\ncontext, this means it is important to remember that monetary policymakers have to deal with uncertainty,\nwhich takes several forms. The economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks that can lead economic\nconditions to evolve differently than anticipated. In addition, our view of current economic conditions\ncan be cloudy because many economic data are revised over time, and these data revisions complicate\nforecasting and setting monetary policy in real time. There is also model uncertainty: it isn’t clear which\nmodel will best predict the future path of the economy at any given time. One approach that I like is to\naverage across various models to develop a forecast, or to look at the forecasts from several different\nmodels and to analyze different scenarios. In speaking about FOMC projections, former Fed Chair Ben\nBernanke said, “The only economic forecast in which I have complete confidence is that the economy\nwill not evolve along the precise path implied by our projections.” 5\n\nThe FOMC is not prescient, nor should anyone expect it to be. Yet, because policy affects the economy\nwith a lag, policymakers need to make medium-run forecasts and acknowledge the uncertainty. But this\nposes a fundamental communications challenge – how can policymakers be transparent about their\ncurrent assessment of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and their anticipated appropriate policy\npath without being perceived as having made a promise they won’t necessarily keep should the economy\nevolve in an unanticipated way. Added to this is the tendency for market participants, among others, to\nprefer more explicit statements and less uncertainty, and the potential that they will interpret the forecasts\n\n5\n\nSee Bernanke, Ben S., “Federal Reserve Communications,” Cato Institute 25th Annual Monetary Conference,\nWashington, D.C., November 14, 2007\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20071114a.htm).\n\n\f10\nof the economy and the appropriate policy path as having more certitude than they actually do, which\ncreates communication issues when the forecasts and policy path change.\n\nI note that here I’m talking about normal times. In extraordinary times, for example, when interest rates\nhave reached the zero lower bound and policymakers want to run a policy of keeping interest rates very\nlow for longer than they otherwise would, the challenge is just the opposite – how can policymakers\ncredibly commit to such a policy path that differs from normal policy?\n\nPolicy Communications Recommendations\nI believe that to meet these challenges, we should focus our policy communications on conveying a better\nsense of the FOMC’s reaction function in normal times, that is, the relationship between changes in\nmonetary policy and changes in the economic outlook. This takes us away from having to predict the\nvarious shocks that may hit the economy, shocks that can arise from many different sources. Instead, we\nshould provide a better sense of how policy can be expected to react when there is a change in economic\nconditions and the medium-run outlook, whether those changes were anticipated or not. Of course,\npolicymakers do not necessarily agree on the precise form of the policy reaction function. Still, there is\nconsensus on some of the factors that should influence policy, including measures of the unemployment\nrate, employment growth, output growth, inflation, and longer-run inflation expectations.\n\nFrom a practical viewpoint, let me offer three suggestions of what the FOMC can do to create a better\nunderstanding of our policy reaction function.\n\nFirst, let’s ensure that our post-meeting FOMC statement focuses less on short-term changes in the data\nreleased between FOMC meetings and more on accumulated changes in economic and financial\nconditions and their effect on the medium-run outlook and progress toward our monetary policy goals.\nThe statement should help the public and financial market participants to better understand policymakers’\n\n\f11\nconsensus assessment of what is signal versus noise in the data. While the statement has been evolving in\nthis direction, I believe it could do more to dissuade people from thinking short term. The statement is a\nvery important part of FOMC communications. We could improve the public’s understanding of our\nmonetary policy reaction function if the statement provided more of a narrative of our assessment of how\nchanges in economic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks\naround that outlook, and therefore, the appropriate policy path. In addition to the narrative, the statement\nwould describe the current stance of policy and any policy actions taken, and some information on the\nfuture path of policy. In extraordinary economic circumstances, this might be explicit forward guidance\nthat serves as a policy tool, as it did during the Great Recession and early part of the recovery. But during\nnormal times, the statement would, instead, provide a rationale for future policy decisions. It would\narticulate the considerations the Committee would take into account when determining future changes in\npolicy. If we provided more consistency about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the\nstance of policy, I believe the public and market participants would get a better sense of the Committee’s\nreaction function over time and their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers,\nthereby making policy more effective and, at least to some extent, reducing market volatility. What I’m\nsuggesting would likely not result in a shorter statement but, I believe, a more informative one.\n\nSecond, let’s begin using simple monetary policy rules as benchmarks to explain our policy decisions.\nYou can find updates for a set of seven rules and their outcomes across several forecasts on the Cleveland\nFed’s website, and the Federal Reserve Board’s Monetary Policy Report now includes a section on policy\nrules. 6 These types of rules describe policy reaction functions that have been shown to yield good\neconomic outcomes in some models and in some economic circumstances. I am not advocating setting\npolicy mechanically according to a simple policy rule; no rule works well enough across a variety of\n6\n\nSee “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/ourresearch/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx) and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, “Monetary Policy Report,” July 7, 2017, pp. 24-28\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170707_mprfullreport.pdf).\n\n\f12\neconomic models and circumstances. However, using the rules as reference points and discussing why\nour policy may differ from these policy descriptions could go some way in helping to explain our own\npolicy reaction function to the public.\n\nThis doesn’t go as far as having the FOMC present a forecast that could serve as the benchmark for\nunderstanding the FOMC’s policy actions and post-meeting statements, a recommendation I’ve made in\nthe past. 7 The median paths in the SEP are somewhat of a step in that direction, but because the variables\nare not linked across participants, the median paths don’t really represent a coherent forecast. For\nexample, there is no guarantee that someone projecting the median inflation path would necessarily be\nprojecting the median output path. In 2012, the FOMC experimented with developing a forecast\nrepresenting the consensus of the Committee, but it proved difficult to achieve. 8 In lieu of that, the\nFOMC should consider publishing the Board staff’s forecast as a benchmark against which policymakers\ncould explain how and why their forecasts may differ.\n\nThird, let’s link the variables in the SEP. As I just mentioned, right now, each variable in our projections\nis reported independently, so, for example, there is no way to see whether a person low in the range of\nunemployment rate forecasts is high in the range of inflation projections. The SEP could be enhanced by\nlinking the variables for each participant’s projection so that the public could see what each policymaker\nis projecting for growth, unemployment, and inflation, and what policy path he or she believes is\nappropriate given those projections. This could be done without revealing the identities of the\nparticipants and would convey information on each individual policymaker’s reaction function. We\nmight also consider other enhancements to help the public understand that the policy paths in the SEP are\n\n7\n\nSee Mester, Loretta J., “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” Shadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting, New York,\nNY, October 7, 2016 (http://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20161007acknowledging-uncertainty.aspx).\n\n8\n\nSee the minutes and transcripts from the July, September, and October 2012 FOMC meetings\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2012.htm).\n\n\f13\nnot necessarily commitments but depend on how the economy evolves. Although this message may\nalready be understood because of the FOMC’s actions: last year, the economy evolved in a way that\nresulted in the FOMC raising the fed funds rate three times. This was consistent with the median\nprojection of FOMC participants in March 2017. However, in both 2015 and 2016, the FOMC raised the\nfunds rate fewer times than the median projection made in March of those years, clearly demonstrating\nthat when economic conditions evolve differently than anticipated, the FOMC will adjust policy\naccordingly.\n\nConclusion\nLet me end by noting that 14 years ago, Alan Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave an\neconomic outlook speech. The next day’s headline in The New York Times read: “Greenspan Hints at End\nto Low Rates,” while the headline in The Wall Street Journal read: “Greenspan Suggests Continued\nPatience on Rates.” 9 That one speech generated such contradictory messages illustrates the challenges\nmonetary policymakers face when communicating with the public. I suspect that monetary policy\ncommunication will likely always remain somewhat of a challenge, but over the past couple of decades,\nthe FOMC has been taking significant steps on its journey toward increased transparency and better\ncommunication. It is important for the FOMC to continue on this journey because when the public has a\nbetter understanding of how monetary policy decisions are made, not only will the public have the\ninformation it needs to hold us accountable for our decisions but monetary policy itself will be more\neffective. I have offered some concrete suggestions on how we might improve our communications by\nconveying a better sense of our policy reaction function. I expect the FOMC will continue to make\nprogress because the benefits of clearer communication are clearly worth the effort.\n\n9\n\nThese were the original headlines in the November 7, 2003 print editions.\n\n\f"

I will use my time to\ndiscuss four topics: the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy, the Federal\nReserve’s current framework for assessing and monitoring financial stability risks, an exercise aimed to\nassess possible policy responses to such risk, and some of the governance issues we face in addressing\nthese risks. The views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Stability and Central Banks\nThe global financial crisis and the deep recession that followed were a rude awakening that much more\nneeded to be done to assess and address vulnerabilities in the financial system. In the U.S., significant\nresources have been brought to bear to improve financial system resiliency, both to lower the probability\nthat financial instability will arise and to limit the damage when financial shocks occur. Financial\nstability matters to central banks. One reason is that monetary policy affects the real economy by\naffecting financial conditions. During the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not\nfunctioning well, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. Another reason\ncentral banks care about financial stability is that the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are\ninterconnected. Indeed, the definition of financial stability is often framed in terms of a financial system\nthat is able to provide its valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and\nhouseholds in the face of economic and financial shocks. Disruptions to the financial system that could\ninterfere with its ability to provide these services include fire sales of assets, runs on financial firms,\nshortages of liquid assets, and contraction of credit in the face of unknown counterparty risk. We saw all\nof these during the global financial crisis.\n\nBecause central banks care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of the real\neconomy, volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic\n\n\f2\neconomy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something monetary policy should\nrespond to. In most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are\ncomplementary. For example, price stability helps businesses, households, and financial institutions\nmake better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial system. And a stable financial\nsystem allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. But in the\nshort run, at times there may be trade-offs between monetary policy and financial stability, as\nmacroprudential actions may slow the economy for a while. If such actions are needed to maintain the\nstability of the financial system, then these actions would also foster the monetary policy goals of price\nstability and maximum employment over the medium run, and would be complementary to economic\ngrowth. 1\n\nThe first line of defense against financial instability should involve making the structure of the financial\nsystem more resilient. Structural resiliency is promoted by requiring higher levels and quality of capital\n(including a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards), liquidity\nstandards, stress tests, living wills, effective resolution methods for systemically important banks and\nnonbank financial institutions, and reforms to improve the stability of certain nonbank markets. The latter\ninclude changes to regulations governing money market mutual funds to reduce the chance of investor\nruns on these funds, rules requiring standardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts to be cleared\nthrough central counterparties, and limiting interday credit exposures in the tri-party repo market. 2 In\ncontrast to structural tools, which apply regardless of the level of vulnerability, the countercyclical capital\n1\n\nOf course, even with an optimally designed regime to foster financial stability, there could be a trade-off between\nthe average level of economic growth over the longer run and the desired degree of financial system resilience,\nbecause risk-taking and risk management are at the heart of the financial system. Indeed, in the U.K., the Financial\nServices Act recognizes this potential trade-off and indicates that the act does not authorize the Financial Policy\nCommittee to operate in a way that the committee feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity\nof the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long term.” See U.K.\nFinancial Services Act 2012, Section 9C(4).\n2\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission implemented revisions to the regulations governing money market\nmutual funds in 2014 and 2016. The G20 countries agreed in 2009 that standardized over-the-counter derivatives\ncontracts should be cleared by central counterparties.\n\n\f3\nbuffer is an example of a cyclical tool that can be varied with the perceived level of vulnerabilities in the\nfinancial system. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will use this tool only when systemic\nvulnerabilities are “meaningfully above normal” and that, when using the tool, it intends to increase the\nbuffer in a gradual way. 3 The U.S. has not had much experience with this tool, so the focus on increasing\nthe resiliency of the structure of the financial system seems well-founded.\n\nI believe monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and maximum employment\nand not be given a third objective of financial stability. But I also recognize that monetary policy and\nfinancial stability goals and actions are interrelated and that if we assessed the risks to financial stability\nto be sufficiently great, achieving our dual-mandate monetary policy goals would also be in jeopardy. In\nthis situation, the distinction between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be blurry,\nand to the extent that financial instability affects macroeconomic stability, those using a risk-management\napproach to monetary policy might be compelled to act, even though financial stability is not an explicit\npart of the FOMC’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nThe FOMC recognizes these linkages. It has acknowledged that nonconventional monetary policy,\nincluding large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of essentially zero interest rates, could pose\npotential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and spurring risk-taking in a search\nfor yield. 4 One study using Spanish data found that a lower overnight policy rate induced low-capitalized\nbanks to lend more to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized\n\n3\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016). Other countries have used limits on loan-to-value\nratios and debt-to-income ratios that vary over the cycle and are targeted to particular sectors like housing or\nhousehold credit to control leverage. See Liang (2013) and Fischer (2014).\n4\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), p. 25.\n\n\f4\nbanks, direct evidence of monetary policy’s effect on risk-taking. 5 The low-interest-rate environment has\nalso posed challenges for bank profitability. In addition, to the extent that asset valuations have been\nelevated relative to historical standards because of the low level of interest rates (which means a low\ndiscount rate), as interest rates rise, valuations might be expected to fall, which would pose some risks to\nfinancial stability. 6\n\nEffects also run in the reverse direction, from macroprudential policy to monetary policy: Tight\nmacroprudential policy can tighten financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood\nthat a monetary policy response will be needed.\n\nSo when we are making monetary policy decisions, we need to be cognizant of the linkages between our\nmonetary policy actions and financial stability and we need to monitor financial system conditions and\ndevelopments as part of the economic environment. Well before the financial crisis, the FOMC discussed\nfinancial stability considerations at its meetings when setting monetary policy. 7 But since the financial\ncrisis, the Federal Reserve has developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, and financial\nstability surveillance is receiving regular attention at FOMC meetings. This regular attention is important\nbecause, as we learned during the financial crisis, even in periods when conditions look benign,\nvulnerabilities may be building.\n\n5\n\nJiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) use data on 23 million bank loans from the Spanish credit registry\nand separately identify how a change in the monetary policy rate affects the demand for credit and the volume and\ncomposition of credit supplied, in particular, the supply to riskier borrowers.\n\n6\n7\n\nSee FSOC (2017) for further discussion.\n\nPeek, Rosengren, and Tootell’s (2015) textual analysis of the transcripts of FOMC meetings from 1982 through\n2009 suggests that the FOMC does consider financial stability when setting monetary policy.\n\n\f5\nThe Fed’s Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability\nThe basic framework used by Federal Reserve staff to monitor financial stability risks is described in\nAdrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013, 2015). The framework recognizes the complex nature of the financial\nsystem in the U.S., with its mix of bank-based finance and market-based finance and its multiplicity of\nregulatory and supervisory bodies. The framework is informed by experience during the financial crisis,\nas well as the theoretical and empirical literature on financial stability.\n\nThis literature demonstrates that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by the choices of financial\nmarket participants, and that it varies across the cycle. When the economy is performing well, collateral\nvalues increase, which supports further borrowing. Funding constraints fall, and with credit amply\navailable to borrowers, the volatility of output and the volatility of asset prices fall. This induces banks to\nincrease their leverage and lend even more. Leverage and maturity mismatch build up, the price of risk\nfalls, and asset values rise. But these developments mean the system is more vulnerable, so that when a\nnegative shock hits the economy and output declines, collateral values also fall, lenders become riskaverse, and credit contracts. This causes households and businesses to pull back on their spending, which\ndepresses output even further, thereby propagating the shock to the real economy.\n\nOn a conceptual level, the Fed’s framework is based on an understanding of these mechanisms through\nwhich shocks can be amplified and propagated throughout the financial system and to the real economy. 8\nThe framework tracks a standard set of financial system vulnerabilities that could amplify and propagate\nshocks using a set of indicators on various financial activities in four categories: asset valuation pressures\n(reflecting the price of risk and risk appetites among investors), leverage, maturity and liquidity\n\n8\n\nImportant research on the propagation and amplification of shocks throughout the financial system includes\nKiyotaki and Moore (1997), Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014), and Gorton and Ordoñez (2014).\n\n\f6\ntransformation, and interconnectedness and complexity. Tools like heat maps and data-visualization\ntechniques aid in the tracking over time. 9\n\nThe financial crisis underscored the importance of assessing and monitoring risks more broadly than just\nin individual regulated banks, so these vulnerabilities are assessed across four sectors of the economy: the\nbanking sector; the nonbank financial sector, including capital markets, nonbanks, and shadow banks; the\nnonfinancial business sector; and the household sector.\n\nThe framework makes a distinction between shocks and vulnerabilities.10 Shocks are difficult to predict\nand arise from various sources, whereas vulnerabilities are characteristics of the financial system and\ndepend on the behavior of providers of financial services, their customers, and their regulators. Some of\nthese vulnerabilities, like leverage, vary over the business and financial cycles; others, like complexity,\nare more structural in nature, reflecting the design of markets and intermediaries.\n\nTo see the distinction between shocks and vulnerabilities, consider the financial crisis. Developments in\nthe subprime mortgage market constituted a shock that precipitated the crisis. Recall that, at the time,\nmany thought that the subprime market was too small to pose major problems in the financial system.\nThat view turned out to be terribly wrong because it failed to recognize both the interconnectedness\nacross markets and institutions and the fact that, at the time, the financial system was highly vulnerable to\na shock due to high leverage and reliance on short-term funding. The easing of underwriting standards\nand the demand for securitized subprime mortgage assets led to a build-up in leverage before the crisis.\nWhen house prices fell, losses on subprime mortgages were amplified because the loans were funded by\nshort-term funding sources, such as asset-backed commercial paper. Banks that sponsored these funds\n\n9\n\nSee Aikman, et al. (2015a, 2015b).\n\n10\n\nSee Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013, 2015) and Bernanke (2012).\n\n\f7\nfelt compelled to support these vehicles, diverting funds from other types of lending; they pulled back on\nrisk because of the drop in the value of mortgages and other assets. The drop in the value of asset-backed\nsecurities caused problems in other markets, such as the repo market, where these assets were used as\ncollateral. Thus, leverage and reliance on short-term funding were vulnerabilities that allowed the\noriginal shock to propagate across the financial system, becoming amplified and wreaking much\ndestruction as it went. Another distinction between vulnerabilities and shocks is that, unlike with shocks,\nit is feasible that policies could be designed to limit the build-up of vulnerabilities, thereby promoting\nfinancial stability.\n\nUsing the framework helps the Fed be systematic in its analysis of the financial system’s vulnerability to\na range of possible shocks. Systematic analysis means we can better identify changes in vulnerabilities\nover time and compare the level of vulnerabilities to historical experience at similar stages of the business\ncycle. An assessment of individual vulnerabilities is then combined to get an assessment of the overall\nvulnerability of the financial system. For example, when asset valuations are high and leverage is high,\nthe financial system is likely more vulnerable to shocks because the combination can lead to rapid credit\ngrowth and excessive risk-taking that can reverse quickly when a negative shock hits.\n\nThe minutes of the FOMC meetings indicate the types of discussions of financial conditions that regularly\ntake place. At each meeting, the staff briefs the Committee on developments in financial markets over the\nintermeeting period. This discussion includes movements in equity prices; government and corporate\nbond yields; availability of credit to households and businesses; credit standards, loan growth, and\nfinancing conditions in various sectors, including the business, consumer, and residential and commercial\nreal estate sectors; conditions in short-run funding markets; foreign exchange movements; and financial\nconditions abroad. At every other meeting, the staff reports on its assessment of the vulnerabilities in the\nU.S. financial system, discussing how the vulnerabilities have changed since the last report and over time.\n\n\f8\nRecognizing the global interconnectedness of financial systems, the staff has developed tools to assess\nforeign financial stability as well. 11\n\nAn evaluation of developments related to financial stability and the assessment of the financial system’s\nvulnerabilities have also become a regular section in the Board of Governors’ monetary policy report.\nThe report occasionally includes additional in-depth information on particular sectors. For example, the\nlatest report included a section discussing liquidity in the corporate bond market. 12 Although market\nparticipants had been expressing concerns about reduced liquidity in the market, the Board’s analysis\nsuggested that liquidity strains in the market were minimal. And as a member of the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (FSOC), the Federal Reserve contributes to the FSOC’s annual report that identifies\npotential risks to financial stability and makes recommendations about what can be done to mitigate those\nrisks. 13\n\nThe Fed has made a lot of progress on building a system to monitor and assess changes in the financial\nsystem’s vulnerabilities. Analysis suggests that the vulnerabilities now being tracked had, indeed, been\nbuilding up for several years before the onset of the financial crisis.14 As discussed in the minutes of the\nOctober FOMC meeting, the Fed staff assessed that overall vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system\nremained moderate. Valuation pressures were elevated but vulnerabilities stemming from leverage in the\nnonfinancial sector were moderate; those stemming from leverage in the financial sector and from\nmaturity and liquidity mismatch remained low. The staff also assessed that overall vulnerabilities to\nforeign financial stability were moderate.\n\n11\n\nFor example, see FOMC (November 2017).\n\n12\n\nSee Board of Governors (July 2017).\n\n13\n\nSee FSOC (2017).\n\n14\n\nSee Aikman, et al. (2015a, 2015b).\n\n\f9\nOngoing work at the Fed continues to evaluate what changes in vulnerabilities may signal about financial\nstability and how policy should respond to signs of emerging financial stability risks and, in particular,\nhow financial stability concerns should be incorporated into monetary policymaking.\n\nA Financial Stability Tabletop Exercise\nIncluded in these efforts is the tabletop exercise that was undertaken by the Financial Stability\nSubcommittee of the Conference of Presidents of the Federal Reserve System in June 2015. 15 This\nexercise involved working through a plausible scenario of loose financial conditions, reflected by falling\nterm and risk premia, leading to pressures on valuations in the commercial property market and increasing\nleverage in the form of higher corporate debt issuance and leveraged lending that was funded by shortterm wholesale funding. The context included monetary policy that was gradually removing\naccommodation, as in 2015-2016, with inflation below the FOMC’s 2 percent goal but the economy at\nfull employment. The scenario reflected some historical episodes of financial market instability,\nincluding the real estate boom and bust in New England in the mid-1980s and in Sweden in 1989-1990,\nbut with the incorporation of increased leverage in the nonfinancial sector, as well as in banking, and a\nfocus on commercial real estate as opposed to residential real estate.\n\nWithin this scenario, financial conditions were judged to be too loose given macroeconomic conditions\nand despite the gradual withdrawal of monetary accommodation. A sharp reversal in the pricing of risk\nwould have adverse effects on the corporate bond market and a sharp drop in commercial real estate\nprices could adversely affect the banking sector. Either would have implications for the real economy.\nThe reliance on short-term wholesale funding could exacerbate the problems, and with many of the\n\n15\n\nThe participating presidents were Eric Rosengren (FRB Boston and chair of the subcommittee at the time of the\nexercise), William Dudley (FRB New York), Esther George (FRB Kansas City), Narayana Kocherlakota (FRB\nMinneapolis), and Loretta Mester (FRB Cleveland). See Adrian, et al. (2015).\n\n\f10\nproviders of this funding outside of the supervisory purview of the Federal Reserve, it would be difficult\nto directly address this issue.\n\nThe objective of the exercise was for the policymaker participants to use available macroprudential tools\nand/or monetary policy to reduce the probability of and the severity of financial disruptions associated\nwith the scenario. The macroprudential tools considered included leverage ratios; countercyclical capital\nbuffers, which could vary across sectors; liquidity requirements; limits on loan-to-value and debt-toincome ratios; capital and liquidity stress testing; supervisory guidance; and moral suasion.\n\nAs the scenario played out, the limits to the macroprudential tools were illuminated. The macroprudential\ntools that ended up being favored were stress testing, margins on repo funding, and supervisory guidance.\nCapital-based, liquidity-based, and loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits, while good in theory, were\ndeemed to have implementation challenges, such as having to coordinate across multiple regulators or, in\nsome cases, to follow administrative procedures like public comment periods, which would slow down\nthe process. Another limitation to some tools is that they applied to regulated banking firms but not\nnecessarily to shadow banks or other types of institutions.\n\nWhile my preference going into the exercise was, and continues to be, to start with the macroprudential\ntools that can be implemented more promptly, the limits on these tools suggest that, in some\ncircumstances, monetary policy might have to be used to address financial stability concerns. This is all\nthe more reason to take steps to ensure that the financial system is structurally resilient, as increased\nresiliency would lessen the need to shift some of monetary policy’s focus away from its macroeconomic\ngoals of price stability and maximum employment. In addition, we must continue to hone our methods of\nassessing financial system vulnerabilities – in both the regulated and unregulated sectors and between the\ntwo. We don’t want to over-identify such risks. Finding risks around every corner where none exist\nwould stifle productivity and innovation in the financial services sector and markets, and thereby\n\n\f11\nundermine longer-run economic growth. 16 This leads me to my final topic: the governance of financial\nstability policy.\n\nThe Governance of Financial Stability Policy\nThe complexity of the U.S. financial system, with multiple types of financial services providers and\nmultiple regulators, complicates the application of macroprudential policy. The multiple financial\nregulators in the U.S. include the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, the U.S. Treasury, the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In addition, there are regulatory\nagencies at the state level. In many cases, the regulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of\ninstitution rather than by instrument. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created by\nthe Dodd-Frank Act to promote coordination and information sharing across these financial system\nregulators. Its membership includes the heads of the regulatory agencies, with the Secretary of the\nTreasury as chair. The Office of Financial Research (OFR), also established by the Dodd-Frank Act,\nsupports the FSOC and has been working to improve the data resources available to assess financial\nstability risks. This is particularly important as some segments of the financial system are less regulated\nthan others, e.g., hedge funds, and without data, it is difficult to ascertain emerging risks in these sectors.\nMoreover, even when data are collected, it is harder to track emerging risks to the extent that data aren’t\nstandardized across segments. 17\n\n16\n\nUsing a large group of countries, Rancière, Tornell, and Westermann (2008) find that average growth over 19602000 was higher in countries that have experienced occasional financial crises, as measured by the negative\nskewness of credit growth. They provide a model in which the enforceability of contracts plays an important role in\nengendering risk-taking and investment, which leads to higher growth.\n17\n\nOne of the FSOC’s priorities is to broaden the adoption by financial market participants of the Legal Entity\nIdentifier, which is a unique identifier for any entity participating in a financial transaction. See FSOC (2017).\n\n\f12\nEstablishing the FSOC and the OFR, and the regulatory changes to increase the structural resiliency of the\nfinancial system, including higher capital requirements and liquidity requirements, were important steps.\nStill, it has to be recognized that other than the ability to designate firms as systemically important\nfinancial institutions and, therefore, subject to enhanced regulation by the Fed, the FSOC does not have\nthe authority to take actions to mitigate emerging risks. Instead, it can make recommendations to the\nagencies and to Congress, who can then decide to act or not. 18\n\nAs the tabletop exercise I just spoke of illuminated, regulatory and financial system complexity and the\nneed for coordination impose some limits on the efficacy of countercyclical macroprudential policy to\nmitigate financial stability risks that build up over time. If implementation is delayed so much that the\npolicies take effect after the risks are realized, at best, they would be ineffective and, at worst, they would\nexacerbate the situation rather than shore up the financial system. Moreover, unless the policies are\ncoordinated across the entire financial services landscape, they could result in regulatory arbitrage\nwhereby activities move to the sector with less stringent rules.\n\nThe need to be preemptive when wielding countercyclical macroprudential tools poses another challenge:\nthat of communication. The tools will have to be used well before there are clear signs of instability.\nThis might be difficult to explain, and there may be various interests that would prefer the tools not be\ninvoked in seemingly good times. Thus, it’s important that policymakers have some independence in\nsetting macroprudential policy, with appropriate accountability to elected officials and the public. 19 This\nargues for transparency and regular testimony before Congress to explain the rationale behind policies.\n\n18\n19\n\nKohn (2014) compares and contrasts the financial stability structure in the U.S. with that in the U.K.\n\nKohn (2014) discusses the importance of the financial stability authority being able to pursue its goals\nindependent of short-run political considerations even when the actions taken aren’t popular.\n\n\f13\nThe FSOC and OFR annual reports, as well the materials included in the minutes of FOMC meetings and\nthe Board’s monetary policy report, all contribute to needed transparency. 20\n\nFinally, it is important to have a clearer understanding of how monetary policy and financial stability\npolicy should interact. Loose monetary policy, to the extent that it allows financial vulnerabilities to build\nup, can pose risks to financial stability when the monetary policy is reversed. And tightening\nmacroprudential rules to counteract growing imbalances can impede the flow of credit, thereby\ndampening economic growth.\n\nTabletop exercises like the one I described can be helpful in clarifying strategies for both monetary policy\nand financial stability policy. We are still some distance away from being able to articulate a clear\nstrategy about the circumstances under which monetary policy should be used as a tool for financial\nstability. But progress on this will be important to provide clarity not only to the public but also to\nourselves as policymakers. As Kohn (2014) describes, the institutional structure in the U.K. has allowed\nit to be further along in this respect. In August 2013, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee\ninitiated forward guidance that it would hold interest rates low and consider additional asset purchases at\nleast until the unemployment rate had fallen to 7 percent. 21 But it also said that one of the conditions that\nwould vacate this guidance would be if the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee found that the\nstance of monetary policy was threatening financial stability in a way that couldn’t be contained by the\navailable macroprudential tools. Note that both policy committees are within the Bank of England. The\ncommittees are independent but they also share members, which allows for good communication and\ninformation sharing between the two committees.\n\n20\n\nFor examples, see FOMC (2017), Board of Governors (2017), FSOC (2017) and OFR (2017a, 2017b).\n\n21\n\nSee Bank of England (2013).\n\n\f14\nIn the U.S., the FSOC should not play a similar role, as this would compromise the independence of\nmonetary policy decisions. This independence must be preserved because, as shown by a substantial\nbody of research and actual practice, when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run\npolitical interference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result. Instead,\nthe Federal Reserve, itself, should work to make further progress on clarifying the strategies for the\ninteractions between monetary policy and financial stability policy. With the continued focus throughout\nthe Federal Reserve System on improving our ability to monitor emerging financial stability risks and on\ndeveloping tools and policies to address those risks, I am confident that such progress will be made.\n\n\f15\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “Macroprudential Policy: Case\nStudy from a Tabletop Exercise,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper RPA 15-1, September\n30, 2015, revised December 2015.\n(https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/risk-and-policy-analysis/2015/macroprudential-policy-casestudy-from-a-tabletop-exercise.aspx)\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series (FEDS) paper 2013-21, Divisions of Research and Statistics and\nMonetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board, March 2013.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201321/201321pap.pdf)\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Annual Review of\nFinancial Economics, 7, December 2015, pp. 357-395.\n(http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-financial-111914-042008)\nAikman, David, Michael T.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks for the National Association for Business Economics and\nAmerican Economic Association Session,\n“Coordinating Conventional and Unconventional Monetary Policies for Macroeconomic Stability”\nAllied Social Science Associations Annual Meeting\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJanuary 5, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank George Kahn for inviting me to speak in this session. I will use my time to discuss the framework\nthe FOMC uses for setting monetary policy and some alternative frameworks. Let me emphasize that this\nis a longer-run issue and not one that is of immediate concern. It lies in the realm of what economists and\npolicymakers should have on their agendas for study given the economic developments we’ve seen over\nthe past decade and what is expected over the coming decade. The views I’ll present are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework to set monetary policy. It is briefly\ndescribed in the FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy. 1 The U.S. adopted\nan explicit numerical inflation goal in January 2012. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured\nby the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation.\nIn establishing this numerical goal, the U.S. joined many other countries, including Australia, Canada,\nNew Zealand, Sweden, and the U.K., as well as the European Central Bank, that conduct monetary policy\nwith a goal of achieving an explicit inflation target. An explicit target provides transparency to the public\nand helps anchor expectations about inflation. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate of price\nstability and maximum employment. The flexible inflation-targeting framework recognizes that, over the\nlonger run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of\nthe economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary\npolicy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment from maximum employment.\n\nThe financial crisis and Great Recession imposed large economic costs on people and businesses. To\nfight disinflationary pressures and economic contraction, Fed policymakers brought the policy rate to\n1\n\nSee FOMC (2017).\n\n\f2\neffectively zero, where it remained for seven years, and augmented their usual policy tools with\nunconventional tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases. This was not business\nas usual. But now the economic expansion is firmly in place, labor markets are strong, and I expect that\ninflation, which has been running under our goal for quite some time, will return to our 2 percent goal on\na sustained basis over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, the post-crisis economic environment is\nexpected to differ in some important ways from the pre-crisis world.\n\nAs I’ve discussed elsewhere, the expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation\nrates due to changes in demographics will weigh on long-run economic growth, the natural rate of\nunemployment, and the longer-term equilibrium interest rate. 2 In fact, FOMC participants have been\nlowering their estimates of the fed funds rate that will be consistent with maximum employment and price\nstability over the longer run. The median estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March 2014 to 2.8\npercent today. Empirical estimates of the equilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly\nuncertain, are lower than in the past. 3 So real interest rates may potentially remain lower than in past\ndecades. If so, then there will be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative\neconomic shock than in the past. Said differently, the policy rate will have a higher chance of hitting the\nzero lower bound, necessitating the use of nontraditional monetary policy tools more often. To the extent\nthat these tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained, the potential is\nfor longer recessions and longer bouts of low inflation. This raises the legitimate question of whether any\nchanges in our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability in\nthis environment. I’m not going to answer that question today. Nor am I going to discuss other\ngovernment policies that could be brought to bear to increase the long-term growth rate and equilibrium\ninterest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Instead, I’m going to outline four\n2\n3\n\nSee Mester (2017).\n\nFor FOMC projections, see FOMC (2014) and FOMC (2018). For a review of the literature on the equilibrium\ninterest rate, see Hamilton, et al. (2015).\n\n\f3\nalternative monetary policy frameworks that have received some attention and discuss some of their pros\nand cons.\n\nHigher Inflation Target\nOne alternative would be to set a higher inflation target, say, 4 percent instead of 2 percent.4 Since the\nequilibrium nominal fed funds rate is the sum of the inflation target and the equilibrium real rate, a higher\ninflation target would offset a lower equilibrium real rate and so the nominal rate would be less likely to\nhit the zero lower bound for any given negative shock. One advantage of this framework is that it is very\nfamiliar because it is similar to the current framework. But there are also several challenges. First, the\ntransition could be difficult. The benefits of the higher target come only if the public views the increase\nas permanent so that inflation expectations rise to the new higher target. But inflation expectations are\nreasonably well anchored at 2 percent, so raising expectations would not necessarily be easy to do.\nSecond, a higher level of inflation may be associated with higher inflation volatility and with higher\ninflation risk premia, neither of which is desirable. Third, it isn’t clear whether an inflation rate at 4\npercent should be viewed as consistent with the Fed’s mandate of price stability. If, for this reason, one\nthen opted to raise the target to 3 percent instead, this would add only modest room for keeping the policy\nrate from the zero lower bound. And finally, one would need to evaluate whether the gain from avoiding\nthe zero lower bound when a negative shock hits the economy outweighs the costs of running a higher\nlevel of inflation at all times, remembering that much of the economy is not indexed to inflation.\n\nPrice-Level Targeting\nA second alternative framework involves targeting a path for the nominal level of prices rather than\ninflation, which is the growth rate of prices. Inflation targeting lets bygones-be-bygones: it does not\nmake up for past deviations of inflation from target. Instead, the inflation-targeting policymaker just tries\n4\n\nSee Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro (2010) for discussion.\n\n\f4\nto bring inflation back to target. For example, if inflation has run low for a time (so that the price level\nfalls below its targeted price path), the inflation-targeting policymaker would aim to move the inflation\nrate back up to its target rate and allow the price level to remain at a level permanently below its targeted\npath. In contrast, price-level targeting makes up for past deviations of the price level from its path. 5 If\ninflation has run low so that the price level has fallen below its targeted path, the price-level targeter\nwould try to move the price level back up to path, and this would entail inflation running high for a while.\nSimilarly, if inflation had been running high, the inflation targeter would aim to bring it down to target,\nwhile a price-level targeter would aim to bring the price level back down to its targeted path, which would\nmean inflation would be low for a while.\n\nThus, the price-level-targeting framework builds in a form of forward commitment, thereby affecting\ncurrent economic conditions. When inflation has been running low, the framework builds in a “low for\nlonger” interest-rate strategy, as the policymaker would keep rates low for longer until the price level\nmoved back to its targeted path. The anticipation of higher inflation in the future should move inflation\nexpectations up, and this would tend to buoy the current level of inflation and shorten the amount of time\nthe economy spends at the zero lower bound, therefore yielding better outcomes than inflation targeting.\nIn fact, the academic literature suggests that a price-level-targeting framework may approximate optimal\nmonetary policy when policymakers want to minimize fluctuations in the output gap and in inflation\naround a target, and it can be particularly useful at the zero lower bound by putting upward pressure on\ninflation expectations and, thereby, downward pressure on the real rate. 6 Before I talk about some\nchallenges, let me discuss a third related framework: nominal GDP targeting.\n\n5\n\nSee Kahn (2009) for a discussion of price-level targeting.\n\n6\n\nSee Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n\n\f5\nNominal GDP Targeting\nThis framework is similar to price-level targeting in that it targets the level of nominal GDP rather than\nthe growth rate. Of course, nominal GDP comprises real GDP and inflation, so this framework explicitly\nincorporates both parts of the Fed’s mandate. For example, targeting the level of nominal GDP to be on a\npath rising by 4 percent per year would be consistent with 2 percent inflation and 2 percent potential\ngrowth. This strategy, like price-level targeting, makes up for past deviations. But it may perform better\nthan price-level targeting when there are supply shocks to which the policymaker would not want to\nrespond because such supply shocks tend to push prices and real output in opposite directions, leaving\nnominal income stable.\n\nWhile both price-level and nominal GDP targeting have the benefit of building in some forward\ncommitment, which is useful at the zero lower bound, there would be some challenges in implementing\neither framework. First, there is little international experience with such frameworks to assess how they\nwould work in practice. 7 Second, for frameworks targeting levels instead of growth rates, the starting\npoint matters, and these frameworks are complicated by other measurement issues as well. For example,\nFigure 1 shows the price-level path using four different starting points: the first quarters of 1990, 1995,\n2001, and 2007. As you can see on the left-hand side of the chart, if the starting point is 1990Q1, the\nprice level is essentially on its path, and if the starting point is 2001Q1, it is near its path. The other two\nstarting points, on the right-hand side of the chart, show a larger gap.\n\nMoreover, because the level-targeting frameworks do not let bygones-be-bygones, data revisions pose a\nmore serious issue than they do with inflation targeting (see Figure 2), and are perhaps greater for\nnominal GDP targeting than price-level targeting because revisions to nominal GDP tend to be larger than\n\n7\n\nSweden did price-level targeting for less than two years when it went off the gold standard in 1931. See Kahn\n(2009).\n\n\f6\nrevisions to prices. Also, the path of the nominal GDP target depends on estimates of potential real\noutput growth. If the nominal income target incorporates an unrealistically high estimate of potential\ngrowth, then inflation will need to be higher in order to hit the target.\n\nA third complication, and perhaps the largest, for frameworks targeting nominal levels is that the benefits\ndepend on the public’s not only understanding the framework but believing that future Committees will\nfollow through. Explaining this unfamiliar framework to the public could be difficult. One also has to\nask whether it is a credible commitment on the part of policymakers to keep interest rates low to make up\nfor past shortfalls even when demand is growing strongly or to act to bring inflation down in the face of a\nsupply shock by tightening policy even in the face of weak demand. If it is not credible that policymakers\nwill do so, then the benefits of nominal level targeting will not be realized.\n\nThe final framework I’ll discuss was suggested by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and is a hybrid\nbetween inflation targeting and price-level targeting, which tries to capture the advantages of each while\nminimizing the challenges. 8\n\nTemporary Price-Level Targeting\nUnder the temporary price-level-targeting framework, monetary policymakers would target inflation in\nnormal times, but when the policy rate fell to the zero lower bound, they would begin targeting the price\nlevel from that starting point. Under this framework, consistent with optimal monetary policy,\npolicymakers would have a more powerful commitment at the zero lower bound than would be the case\nunder inflation targeting. Switching to price-level targeting at the zero lower bound means that policy\nwould be kept at zero at least until the cumulative inflation rate from the time the zero lower bound had\n\n8\n\nBernanke (2017).\n\n\f7\nbeen reached had risen back to target. Once policymakers were satisfied that this goal had been met, the\npolicy rate could begin to rise and policymakers would revert to targeting inflation.\n\nThis framework has benefits similar to those of price-level targeting in that when monetary policy is not\nable to provide more stimulus because it is constrained by the zero lower bound, the framework builds in\na forward commitment of easier monetary policy in the future. But this hybrid framework could be easier\nto communicate because it could be discussed solely in terms of the inflation goal (see Figure 3). It\nwould also mean that some of the commitment problems of nominal level targeting, including having to\nmake up for supply shocks that would temporarily raise inflation even if aggregate demand were low,\ncould be avoided when away from the zero lower bound because policymakers would be targeting\ninflation and not the price level there. However, a drawback of the hybrid approach is that determining\nand communicating the timing of when to switch back to the inflation-targeting regime could be complex.\nPolicymakers would not want to switch back prematurely, so they would need to be sure that inflation had\nsustainably made up for the cumulative shortfall. This would seem to involve a considerable amount of\ndiscretion, which would undermine some of the benefits of the framework.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, there are several alternative monetary policy frameworks that potentially offer some benefits\nin a low interest rate environment. None of these alternative frameworks are without challenges and we\nwill need to evaluate whether the net benefits of any of the alternatives would outweigh those of the\nflexible inflation-targeting framework currently in use in the U.S. and in many other countries. Each\nframework is worthy of further study, and now may be an appropriate time to undertake such study\nbecause the economy is growing, labor markets are strong, and inflation is projected to move back to our\ngoal.\n\n\f8\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., “Temporary Price-Level Targeting: An Alternative Framework for Monetary Policy,”\nBen Bernanke’s Blog, The Brookings Institution, October 12, 2017.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2017/10/12/temporary-price-level-targeting-analternative-framework-for-monetary-policy/)\nBlanchard, Olivier, Giovanni Dell’Ariccia, and Paolo Mauro, “Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy,”\nJournal of Money, Credit, and Banking 42(s1), 2010, pp. 199-215.\n(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2010.00334.x/full)\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary\nPolicy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1, 2003, pp. 139-233.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-zero-bound-on-interest-rates-and-optimal-monetary-policy/)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 18-19, 2014,” April 2014.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20140319.pdf)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 12-13, 2017,” January 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf)\nFOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” January 31, 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\nHamilton, James D., Ethan S.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of Monetary Policy\nWashington, DC\nNovember 16, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to speak at the Cato Institute’s 35th annual monetary conference.\nTo some of us, 35 seems relatively young, but for a conference series, it is a ripe old age. The series’\nlongevity underscores the important contributions it has made over the years to the public discourse on\nmonetary economics and policy. Whether you interpret 35 as young or old depends on the context, which\nbrings me to my topic today: demographics and their implications for the economy and policy. This\nmight seem like an unusual topic for a Cato conference, but demographics have been on my mind, and not\njust because I had a birthday last month.\n\nThe word “demographics” comes from the Ancient Greek: “demo” meaning people and “graphics”\nmeaning measurement. There is a strong tradition of studying demography as part of economics.\nMalthus’s writings on population growth are a part of many history-of-thought courses in economics.\nMore recently, as the economy has moved from financial crisis and the Great Recession to sustainable\nexpansion, attention has shifted from cyclical aspects of the economy to structural factors. In addition, as\npolicy has begun to normalize, the question has been raised: “what is normal?” To answer such a\nquestion, we need to understand how the underlying fundamentals of the economy are evolving. A\ncritical factor is demographics. Demographic change can influence the underlying growth rate of the\neconomy, structural productivity growth, living standards, savings rates, consumption, and investment; it\ncan influence the long-run unemployment rate and equilibrium interest rate, housing market trends, and\nthe demand for financial assets. Moreover, differences in demographic trends across countries can be\nexpected to influence current account balances and exchange rates. So to understand the global economy,\nit helps to understand changing demographics and the challenges they pose for monetary and fiscal\npolicymakers.\n\nToday I will talk about some of these demographic trends and their policy implications. Of course, the\nviews I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f2\nDemographic Trends\nUntil the early 18th century, world population grew little because high mortality rates offset high fertility\nrates.1 But increased knowledge and technological change in the form of advances in medicine, public\nhealth, and nutrition began to lower mortality rates. Fertility rates also began to decline. In the U.S. there\nwere shifting preferences for smaller families because of the rising opportunity costs of having children\nand the higher costs of raising and educating them. The shift in population from rural to urban areas\nreduced the need for large families to run farms. There were changes in social norms regarding the use\nand availability of birth control. The baby boom in the U.S. after World War II, and the subsequent echo\nwhen the baby boom generation began having their own children, were exceptions to a generally\ndownward trend in the birth rate. Today, the fertility rate in the U.S. is 1.88 births per woman.2 This is\nless than the United Nations’ estimated 2.1 replacement rate needed to keep the population stable, and it\nis considerably less than the fertility rate in 1900, which was over 3.3\n\nAs these demographic changes have played out, the average life expectancy in the U.S. has risen and the\npopulation has aged. Average life expectancy at birth is now nearly 80 years old, 30 years higher than it\nwas in 1900.4 The median age of the U.S. population is approaching 38 years old, nearly 10 years older\nthan in 1970.5 By 2050, the U.N. projects that the median age in the U.S. will be 42 years old and that the\nnumber of people age 65 or older per 100 of working-age people, those age 15 to 64, will be more than\ndouble what it was in 1970.6\n\n1\n\nTwo useful survey articles on the demographic change are Lee (2003) and Bloom and Canning (2004).\n\n2\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 807).\n\n3\n\nFor the replacement rate, see United Nations (2017), p. xxvii. Note, however, that Espenshade, et al. (2003) point\nout that there is considerable variation in replacement rates across countries. Haines (1998, Table 7-2) reports that,\nin 1900, the fertility rate was 3.56 for whites and 5.61 for black and other populations.\n4\n\nLife expectancy at birth in the U.S. over 2010-2015 was 78.9 (United Nations (2017, p. 805)). The life expectancy\nat birth in the U.S. in 1900 was 47.3 (National Research Council (2012, p. 32)).\n5\n\nAccording to the United Nations (2017, p. 807), the median age in the U.S. was 28.4 in 1970, 37.6 in 2015, and it\nis estimated to be 38.3 in 2020.\n6\n\nAccording to the United Nations (2017, p. 807), this old-age dependency ratio was 16.3 in 1970, 22.1 in 2015, and\nis expected to rise to 36.4 by 2050.\n\n\f3\nReflecting projections of relatively stable fertility rates and continued aging of the population, world\npopulation growth is expected to slow.7 It averaged around 2 percent per year in the latter half of the\n1960s and slowed to 1.2 percent per year over 2010-2015.8 U.S. population growth, including net\ninternational migration, is expected to slow from about 0.8 percent in recent years to under 0.5 percent in\n2050, with nearly two-thirds of that growth coming from net migration.9\n\nA number of advanced economies are further along in this demographic transition than the U.S. is, and\nthe process of population aging is accelerating worldwide.10 In Japan, the population has been shrinking\nover the past five years, the ratio of older people to working-age people is the highest in the world, and\nthe median age is almost 47 years old.11 Across Europe, fertility rates have been below the replacement\nlevel for some time.12 In China, the growth rate of the working-age population has slowed since the late\n1980s, and partly because of its previous one-child policy, China’s population is also rapidly aging.13 The\nmedian age in China has increased from around 19 years in 1970 to 37 years in 2015.\n\nOn the other hand, many low- and middle-income countries are at a considerably earlier phase in the\ndemographic transition, with young and faster growing populations, and rising labor force participation\nrates. In India, the median age is around 27 years and the annualized growth rate of the population from\n2010 to 2015 has been 1.2 percent.14 The U.N. projects that, in seven years, the population of India will\nsurpass that of China, currently, the most populous country, and that India’s population will continue to\n\n7\n\nThe United Nations (2017, p. 807) projects that the U.S. fertility rate will vary between 1.88 and 1.92 between\n2015 and 2100. The CBO (March 2017, p. 30) projects that the U.S. fertility rate will be 1.9 children per woman\nover 2017-2047.\n8\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 3).\n\n9\n\nFor population growth projections, including projections for natural increases and net international migration, see\nU.S. Census Bureau (2014). Also see population growth projections in United Nations (2017, p. 807) and CBO\n(March 2017, p. 30).\n10\n\nSee Bloom and Canning (2004, p. 18).\n\n11\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 415). The United Nations defines this potential support ratio as the number of\npersons age 20 to 64 divided by the number age 65 or over (see United Nations (2017, p. xxxiii)).\n12\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. xxvii).\n\n13\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 191) and Peng (2011).\n\n14\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 383).\n\n\f4\ngrow through 2050. Much of the increase in world population between now and 2050 is projected to be\nin Africa, where fertility rates remain high.\n\nThe implications of these global demographic patterns for the future of the U.S. economy are worth\nconsidering because they pose some challenges for policymakers. Indeed, the magnitude of the effects\nwill depend on policy responses. The remainder of my talk will discuss some of the ways these changing\ndemographics could influence the U.S. economy, in particular, labor markets and economic growth. Then\nI will turn to considerations for monetary, fiscal, and other government policies.\n\nDemographic Implications for Labor Markets\nDemographics influence the supply of labor. Typically, as mortality rates decline and people live longer,\nthe supply of labor increases. We saw this pattern begin in the U.S. in the late 1960s and the 1970s,\nespecially as women and the baby boomers began entering the workforce. The result was an increase in\nthe available supply of prime-age workers, both females and males, and potential growth rates in the 3 to\n4 percent range.15\n\nEven though increased life expectancy means individuals will need to work longer in order to save more\nfor retirement, usually, population aging eventually leads to a downward trend in labor force participation\nin the aggregate.16 This is already happening in the U.S. Labor force participation peaked at 67.3 percent\nin early 2000 and fell to 66.0 percent in December 2007, as the Great Recession was beginning. Since\nthen, it has fallen further, to 62.7 percent as of October. While some of the decline represents cyclical\n\n15\n16\n\nSee CBO (June 2017).\n\nNote that, so far, we have not seen much shift in the retirement age in the U.S. In fact, since the 1970s, the\naverage retirement age has been little changed even as life expectancies have continued to rise. This means people\nare spending more time in retirement and a smaller share of their lives working, which will put pressure on pension\nplans and savings. (According to OECD estimates, the average retirement age for men in the U.S. was 66.1 between\n1980 and 1984 and 65.4 between 2010 and 2015. Life expectancy at age 65 has increased from 14.8 years in 1970\nto 19.4 years in 2015 (United Nations (2017, p. 807)). Data from Social Security (2016) indicate that the average\nage of claims for retired workers has been little changed since 1970.)\n\n\f5\nfactors, research suggests that most of the fall in the overall participation rate can be attributed to\ndemographics: the combination of an aging population and reduced participation rates at older ages.17\n\nAs a result of lower population growth and labor force participation, the growth of the U.S. labor force\nhas slowed considerably, from 2.5 percent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to around 0.5 percent per\nyear over 2010-2016. It is expected to remain near that level over the next decade.18\n\nThe changing age distribution of workers can affect not only labor force growth and participation but also\nthe longer-run natural rate of unemployment. Older workers typically have lower unemployment rates\nthan other age groups, and they tend to change jobs less frequently.19 Young people now make up a\nsmaller share of the labor force. All else equal, the combination of lower quit rates for older workers and\nlower numbers of younger workers should imply a lower natural rate of unemployment compared to the\n1990s.20 Of course, the timing and magnitude of this demographic effect are not certain because there are\nsome counterbalancing factors, including the fact that, so far, contrary to expectations, the retirement age\nfor older workers hasn’t changed much, the productivity of a worker varies with age, and policies such as\nunemployment and retirement benefits can affect labor market choices.\n\nDemographic Implications for Economic Growth\nThe expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation rates will have implications\nfor long-run economic growth and the composition of growth. The key determinants of the economy’s\nlonger-run growth rate are labor force growth and structural productivity growth – how effectively the\neconomy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output. Demographics suggest that labor force\n17\n\nSee Aaronson, et al. (2006) and Aaronson, et al. (2014).\n\n18\n\nAccording to the latest available projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that annual growth in\nthe labor force over 2016-2026 will average 0.6 percent (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017, p 2.).\n19\n\nSee Bean (2004) and Cairó and Cajner (forthcoming). Tasci (2012) documents that the job separation rate was\nrising through the early 1980s and then declining thereafter, likely due to demographic changes.\n20\n\nEstimates of the natural rate of unemployment vary depending on what one assumes about the labor force\nparticipation rate. The FOMC participants’ projections of the longer-run unemployment rate range from 4.4 to 5.0\npercent (see FOMC, September 2017). Aaronson, et al. (2015) estimate that changes in the age and gender\ncomposition of the labor force will mean that the natural rate of unemployment will be two-tenths of a percentage\npoint lower by 2020, with a similar-size decline attributed to higher educational attainment.\n\n\f6\ngrowth will be considerably slower than it has been in recent decades, and this will weigh on long-run\neconomic growth.\n\nIn addition, in theory, the aging of the population may also have a negative effect on structural\nproductivity growth. Over the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in\nthe nonfarm business sector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire\nexpansion, it has averaged 1 percent. While some part of the slowdown is likely cyclical, reflecting\npersistent effects of the Great Recession on investment spending, structural factors are also weighing on\nproductivity growth. Older workers tend to stay longer in their jobs than younger workers, who are more\nlikely to change jobs and employers. This allows older workers to gain deeper experience, which can be\npositive for productivity growth. At the same time, lower labor mobility means workers may remain in\njobs that are not the best match to their skill sets. This would be a negative for productivity growth.\nIndeed, one study finds that both short tenures and long tenures adversely affect productivity growth.21\nAnd historical evidence suggests a hump-shaped relationship between age and productivity, with\nproductivity increasing when a person enters the workforce, stabilizing, and then declining toward the end\nof a person’s work life. 22 Research also indicates that an individual’s innovative activity and scientific\noutput peaks between the ages of 30 and 40, although that age profile has been shifting older over time.23\n\nLabor mobility and business dynamism, including the number of start-ups in key innovative sectors like\nhigh-tech, have been declining for some time.24 Whether dynamism will remain low is an open question,\nbut the aging of the population is here to stay. So far, the magnitude of the negative effect of the aging\nworkforce on productivity growth appears to be quite small.25 Even so, the demographics-induced slower\n\n21\n\nSee Auer, et al. (2005).\n\n22\n\nSee Skirbekk (2008) and National Research Council (2012, Chapter 6).\n\n23\n\nOne study showed that the median age of Nobel prize winners in physics, chemistry, and medicine has increased\nabout two years per century and the mean age has risen by eight years (see National Research Council (2012,\nChapter 6)).\n24\n25\n\nSee Haltiwanger (2015).\n\nFor example, the National Research Council’s (2012, Chapter 6) review of the literature showed that a changing\nage distribution had little effect on the distribution of earnings, a proxy for productivity. Their estimation of the\neffect for OECD countries indicates that productivity increases and then decreases with age, with a maximum\n\n\f7\ngrowth of the labor force and the possible dampening effect on productivity growth suggest that longerrun output growth will likely remain below the 3 to 3.5 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s, unless\nthere is some effective countervailing policy response.26\n\nIn addition to affecting the economy’s trend growth rate, demographics will likely affect the composition\nof growth by shaping aggregate consumption, saving, and investment decisions. Increased longevity\nmeans that people will need to save more over their working life to fund a longer retirement period. This\nis especially true given the degree of underfunding of public pension plans at the state and federal levels.\nDemand for healthcare will continue to rise, and an aging population will place different demands on the\nhousing sector than a younger population, affecting the demand for single- versus multi-family properties,\nfor owning versus renting, and for residential improvements that allow older adults to age in place.27 By\naffecting the composition of output, changes in the age distribution have the potential to affect the\nbusiness cycle. Because of its cyclical and structural implications, demographic change also has\nimplications for monetary policy. Let me talk about three.\n\nDemographic Implications for Monetary Policy\nFirst, although monetary policy cannot affect the growth rate of potential output or the long-run natural\nrate of unemployment, it needs to take these into account as part of the economic environment, and to\nconsider the downward pressure demographics put on both relative to their historical levels.\n\nSecond, changes in demographics could also affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the\neconomy, in particular, the strength of wealth effects versus income effects. Older people tend to hold\nreached at about 40 years. Based on projections of the age distribution and their preferred quadratic specification,\nthey estimate that changes in the age distribution will subtract only about 0.1 percentage point per year from\naggregate productivity growth over the next 20 years (see National Research Council (2012, Chapter 6, Table 6-2,\np. 119)). Note that Feyrer (2007) finds that differences in demographics could explain as much as a quarter of the\ngap in productivity between OECD countries and low-income countries. However, the National Research Council\nsuggests that sampling error may explain the large magnitude of that finding.\n26\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office currently estimates that potential GDP growth averaged 3.4 percent per year\nover 1982-1990 and 3.3 percent per year over 1991-2001; it projects that potential growth will average 1.8 percent\nper year over 2017-2027. See CBO (June 2017).\n27\n\nSee Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University (2014).\n\n\f8\nmore assets than the young and tend to be creditors while drawing down their assets to fund their\nconsumption during retirement. Younger people tend to be borrowers but face tighter credit constraints\nthan the old because they hold fewer assets. As the share of the population shifts from young to old, the\npropagation of an interest rate change through the economy is likely to change. There will be a smaller\nshare of young borrowers able to take advantage of a decrease in interest rates but a larger share of older\npeople who benefit from higher asset prices; similar reasoning applies for an increase in interest rates.\nDemographic change may mean that wealth effects become a more important channel through which\nmonetary policy affects the economy.28\n\nA third important implication of demographic change for monetary policy is through its effect on the\nequilibrium long-term interest rate. FOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the fed\nfunds rate that will be consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run. The\nmedian estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March 2014 to 2.8 percent today. And empirical\nestimates of the equilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are lower than in\nthe past.29\n\nDemographic change may be a factor in this decline to the extent that it results in a lower long-run growth\nrate of consumption and, therefore, of output, which is a key determinant of the longer-run equilibrium\ninterest rate. The magnitude of any effect is difficult to determine because complicated dynamics are at\nwork. Static analysis might suggest that as longevity increases, people will want to accumulate more\nassets to fund their retirements and this would put upward pressure on asset prices and, therefore,\ndownward pressure on returns. Moreover, because people prefer to reduce their exposure to risk as they\nage, we might expect to see a shift toward assets with fixed returns, putting upward pressure on risk\npremia and downward pressure on risk-free rates.30 However, older people also tend to save less because\nonce people reach retirement age, they need to draw down their savings and perhaps sell assets to fund\n28\n\nSee Bean (2004) and Imam (2013).\n\n29\n\nFor FOMC projections, see FOMC (March 2014) and FOMC (September 2017). For a review of the literature on\nthe equilibrium interest rate, see Hamilton, et al. (2015).\n30\n\nBernanke (2005) discusses how a global savings glut could push down longer-term interest rates.\n\n\f9\ntheir retirement. This countervailing effect from dissaving, as well as public spending on retiree benefits,\nwould tend to put upward pressure on interest rates.31 Thus, the magnitude and even the sign of the effect\nof demographic change on interest rates are empirical questions.\n\nSo far, there is little evidence that demographic trends are driving large-scale shifts into fixed-income\ninvestments that would depress returns; indeed, the evidence suggests that people are under-saving for\nretirement.32 Historically, there appears to be only a weak correlation between age structure in the U.S.\nand asset returns.33\n\nUltimately, how demographics affect economic outcomes will also depend on how governments respond,\nso in the remainder of my time, let me discuss the implications of demographic change for fiscal and\nother government policies.\n\nDemographic Implications for Fiscal and Other Government Policies\nThe rising share of older people will put significant pressure on Social Security and Medicare in the U.S.,\nwhich are structured as pay-as-you-go programs, with current workers providing support for current\nretirees. Other developed countries’ government pension and healthcare funds will also be stressed.\nProjected longer-run fiscal imbalances are unlikely to be sustainable, and it seems likely that governments\nwill need to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced benefits, increased taxes,\nprogram restructuring, and policies intended to stem the growth rate of healthcare costs.34 Longer-run\nfiscal sustainability will depend on what combination is used, and how effective the actions are.\n\n31\n\nThe simulation results in Fehr, et al. (2008) show an increase in interest rates along the baseline path of\ndemographic change projected for the U.S., the European Union, and Japan. Goodhart and Pradhan (2017) argue\nthat demographic change will lead to increases in the equilibrium interest rate.\n32\n\nSee National Research Council (2012, chapter 7).\n\n33\n\nPoterba (2004) finds only a weak correlation between the age structure in the U.S. over the past 70 years and asset\nreturns on stocks, bonds, and Treasury bills.\n34\n\nAuerbach (2016) points out that rising healthcare costs, and not aging alone, explain some of the difference in\nprojected fiscal gaps across countries.\n\n\f10\nAccording to CBO projections, under current policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will more than\ntriple over the next 30 years, from 2.9 percent in 2017 to 9.8 percent in 2047.35 During this time period,\noutlays for Social Security and Medicare are projected to rise from 8 percent to 12.4 percent of GDP. As\na result, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio rises dramatically, from 77 percent in 2017 to 150 percent in 2047.\nThis increase dwarfs the run-up in debt to fund World War II. The extent to which such an increase, per\nse, will crowd-out productive investments and lower economic growth is debatable.36 But the sovereign\ndebt crisis in Europe over 2009-2012 shows that high debt levels can pose severe problems if investors\nlose faith in the ability of governments to service their debts, generating spikes in what had previously\nbeen viewed as risk-free rates.\n\nIf financing the funding shortfall through increased government borrowing is undesirable, raising taxes\nand reducing benefits or other expenditures are not very appealing either. Depending on how such\npolicies are implemented, they could ultimately hurt the economy’s longer-run growth prospects, leaving\nthe fiscal outlook even worse. Moreover, in a world where countercyclical fiscal policy is constrained,\nbusiness cycle volatility could rise, and monetary policy could find itself near the zero lower bound more\noften, potentially requiring the use of nontraditional policy tools such as asset purchases and forward\nguidance in order to meet monetary policymakers’ economic objectives.37\n\nMore effective policies to overcome the effects of the aging population on fiscal imbalances would focus\non reducing the rising costs of healthcare, not just on health insurance. In addition, policies that increase\nthe growth and productivity of the workforce would address not only fiscal imbalances but the downward\npressure on longer-run growth from demographics or other sources. Policies that increase immigration,\nnot reduce it, that support continuing education, that encourage R&D and innovation, and that provide\nincentives so people work longer should receive attention.\n\n35\n\nSee CBO (March 2017).\n\n36\n\nFor discussions, see Cecchetti, et al. (2011), Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2017), and Reinhart and Rogoff\n(2010).\n37\n\nSee Kiley and Roberts (2017).\n\n\f11\nSummary\nIn summary, demographic change will result in a slower-growing and older population. This transition\nwill likely put downward pressure on the growth rate of potential output, the natural rate of\nunemployment, and the long-term equilibrium interest rate. The magnitude of these effects and the\ntiming are uncertain because they depend on complicated dynamics and the behavior of consumers and\nbusinesses. Demographic change may also affect the business cycle and the monetary policy\ntransmission mechanism. Monetary policymakers will need to continually evaluate these structural and\ncyclical effects in determining appropriate policy. Demographic trends present challenges for fiscal\npolicymakers as well. Rising fiscal imbalances are projected to lead to higher government debt-to-GDP\nlevels, potentially putting upward pressure on interest rates, and crowding out productive investment. But\nsteps can be taken to offset some of the negative consequences of demographic change for the economy.\nThese include policies that focus on increasing productivity and labor force growth and that address\ngrowing fiscal imbalances.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks at “The Future of Global Finance: Populism, Technology, and Regulation” Conference\nColumbia University\nNew York, NY\nOctober 20, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis at Imperial College London and the Initiative on\nCentral Banking and Financial Policy at Columbia University, and in particular Franklin Allen and Trish\nMosser, for inviting me to speak on this panel. The views I’ll provide today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nSome of you may be too young to remember the original Star Trek – the one with William Shatner\nplaying Captain Kirk. But in a famous episode, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy find themselves on a planet\nwhose society is modeled on gangsters from Prohibition-era Chicago. 1 At one point, Kirk creates a\ndiversion by engaging the gangsters in a card game called “fizzbin,” making up the rules as he goes along.\nEach player gets six cards, except for the dealer and the player to his right, who each get a seventh card.\nThe second card is turned up, except on Tuesday. If you get two Jacks, you have a half fizzbin, which is\ngood, but if you get a third Jack, you have a shronk, which is bad. A King and a two are good, except at\nnight, when you want to get a Queen and a four instead. The aim of the game is to get a royal fizzbin, but\nthe odds are astronomically against that. I think you get the idea.\n\nAt times, the regulatory framework that has arisen since the global financial crisis can seem like the game\nof fizzbin – very complicated, seemingly without rationale, and constantly changing. In such an\nenvironment, sometimes it helps to take a step back and focus on some underlying principles that should\nserve as a foundation for any financial regulatory framework, and that can help guide any potential\nchanges to strengthen the framework and promote cross-country harmonization. 2\n\n1\n2\n\nThe Star Trek episode was “A Piece of the Action,” season 2, episode 17, January 12, 1968.\n\nA similar tack was taken in the U.S. Treasury’s recent report outlining proposed changes to financial regulations\nto promote the Administration’s core principles for the financial system. However, the principles I discuss are\nsomewhat different. (See U.S. Department of Treasury, “A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities:\n\n\f2\n\nMy first principle, similar to Star Trek’s prime directive, is that financial system regulation should be\ntailored to the risks imposed on the system, thereby fostering systemic resiliency. By resiliency I mean a\nsystem in which financial institutions remain strong enough to continue to lend and offer other valuable\nfinancial services throughout the ups and downs of the business cycle. The corollary is that if current\nregulations are not furthering this principle, they should be rethought. Similarly, if a portion of the\nfinancial system is prone to systemic problems but doesn’t have adequate oversight, this situation should\nbe rethought, too.\n\nThis principle recognizes that financial services firms provide value. Indeed, the fact that the crisis and\nits aftermath were very dark times for households, businesses, banks, and policymakers and that the\nfinancial system was at the heart of the crisis attests to the vital role a sound financial system plays in\nsupporting a vibrant economy. This principle also recognizes that bank regulation and supervision should\nconcern itself not only with the safety and soundness of individual institutions but also with the risk of the\nsystem overall. The absence of such a focus prior to the financial crisis contributed to a buildup in\nfinancial imbalances and systemic risk. The post-crisis changes made to the regulatory framework aim to\nstrengthen resiliency by lowering the probability of another financial crisis, and by reducing the costs\nimposed on the rest of the economy when a large shock hits the financial system. Important components\ninclude capital requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, living will resolution plans, and\nresolution methods that allow systemically important institutions to fail without causing problems for the\nentire financial system. As a result of the financial crisis and these regulatory changes, banks themselves\nhave also altered how they monitor risks and run their businesses.\n\nBanks and Credit Unions,” June 2017 (https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/pressreleases/Documents/A%20Financial%20System.pdf).)\n\n\f3\nFocusing on risk management makes it clear that institutions posing the most systemic risk should face\nenhanced prudential standards and supervisory attention, while institutions not imposing costs on the rest\nof the financial system or creating the kinds of contagion that can put the entire financial system at risk\nshould face a different type of oversight. Institutions should not be burdened by rules that make it more\ncostly for them to serve their customers but do little to further the goal of a healthy and resilient financial\nsystem. For large banks, the combination of risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio requirement\nas a backstop, liquidity requirements, and annual stress testing is appropriate. But there is now some\nrecognition that there may be opportunities to reduce regulatory burden without increasing systemic risk.\nIn the U.S., some increase in the thresholds at which some of the enhanced requirements kick in would be\nreasonable, as would a reduction in the regulatory burden that has been placed on community banks. 3\nSome steps are already being taken. For example, in late September, the federal banking agencies issued\nfor public comment proposed changes to the capital rules for community banks intended to simplify and\nreduce the burden of rules imposed by Dodd-Frank. 4\n\nAt the same time, it’s important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We learned during the\nfinancial crisis that bank capital standards were too low, that some forms of capital considered to be Tier\n1 by the regulators did not protect the banks when there was a severe shock, and that neither the market\nnor central bank lender-of-last-resort functions were adequate to address severe liquidity problems when\ncollateral values could not be determined. Any changes to the regulatory framework will need to heed the\n\n3\n\nDodd-Frank requires that banks with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion be subject to company-run stress\ntests and that banks with assets of $50 billion or more be subject to annual supervisor-administered stress tests,\ncapital planning, living will, and other enhanced prudential requirements. The Fed has already exempted\nnonsystemic banks with less than $250 billion in assets and less than $75 billion in nonbank activities from the\nqualitative capital planning part of the stress-testing process. See “Federal Reserve Board Announces Finalized\nStress Testing Rules Removing Noncomplex Firms from Qualitative Aspect of CCAR Effective for 2017,” Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System press release, January 30, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170130a.htm).\n4\n\nSee “Agencies Propose Simplifying Regulatory Capital Rules,” joint press release of the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, September 27, 2017 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170927a.htm).\n\n\f4\nfirst principle and preserve the strength and resiliency of the financial system, which benefit the economy.\nIt will be an ongoing challenge to strike the right balance between enhanced financial system resiliency\nand maintaining the system’s ability to deliver economic value by innovating and taking on risk.\n\nMy second principle is that the regulatory framework must recognize that it creates incentives for\nfinancial institutions, their customers, and the regulators themselves and that market forces are always at\nwork. A corollary is that regulations that align incentives with financial stability and that work with\nmarket forces rather than against them will likely be more effective than those that don’t.\n\nUnless the incentive effects are taken into account, even well-intentioned regulations can create\nunintended consequences. For example, before the crisis, some part of the strong growth in financial\nintermediation that occurred outside of the regulated banking system was driven by the desire to avoid\nregulation. Regulatory requirements that differ across sectors can create distortions and undesirable\noutcomes, especially when activity can easily be shifted from a sector that is monitored to a sector that is\ndifficult to monitor. Even within a regulated sector, distortions can creep in. The asset thresholds that\ntrigger increased regulatory requirements create incentives to remain below the thresholds. To the extent\nthat these thresholds are a good measure of systemic risk, creating such incentives can be productive. For\nexample, some banks have taken steps to decrease the complexity of their organizations. However, if the\nthresholds are only loosely connected to risk, efforts to remain slightly below the thresholds and\nregulatory attention on these triggers are not useful.\n\nRegulatory requirements that differ across countries are perhaps even more problematic, as they can result\nin cross-country regulatory arbitrage and put institutions in some countries at a competitive disadvantage.\nFor example, a growing body of research has documented that there are significant scale economies in\n\n\f5\nbanking that are driven by technological advantages and not by safety-net subsidies. 5 Suppose\npolicymakers in one country decide to put a limit on firm size because they believe that the potential costs\nof systemic risk posed by large institutions outweigh the efficiency gains. This would put the country’s\nlarge banks at a competitive disadvantage in global markets unless other countries implemented similar\nconstraints. Because the restrictions would be working against market forces given the scale economies,\nit is unlikely that size restrictions would be effective in the country imposing them. They would create\ngreat incentives for firms to try to evade them by moving activities outside of the more regulated sector\nbut they would not necessarily reduce systemic risk. Risk would migrate but not be eliminated. There\nwould need to be more intensive monitoring of both the regulated and the less-regulated sectors.\n\nThis example suggests that it is desirable to have international agreements on capital and liquidity\nrequirements for systemically important institutions, and coordination when a cross-border institution gets\ninto trouble. The Basel III rules have taken some aspects of capital regimes that were used only in a\nsubset of countries and have applied them more broadly. For example, the rules include a leverage\nrequirement, which was used in the U.S. but not in Europe prior to the crisis, and they include a liquidity\nrequirement, which was used in a few but not many countries prior to the crisis. The hope is that\ninternational coordination leads to more effective regulatory regimes rather than forces movement to the\nlowest common denominator.\n\nThe example also suggests that if regulation could benefit from understanding market forces, there may\nalso be benefits from harnessing market discipline to promote financial stability. A prerequisite for this\nwould be increased disclosure from financial firms so that their creditors and other market participants are\nin a position to exert such discipline.\n5\n\nFor a discussion of this research and the policy implications, see Joseph P. Hughes and Loretta J. Mester, “The\nFuture of Large, Internationally Active Banks: Does Scale Define the Winners?” Chapter 6 in The Future of Large,\nInternationally Active Banks, World Scientific, Hackensack, NJ, Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, Douglas D. Evanoff, and\nGeorge G., Kaufman, eds., 2017, pp. 77-96.\n\n\f6\n\nPerhaps most important to remember is that regulators also face incentives. During the financial crisis,\nregulators and policymakers faced significant time-inconsistency problems when confronting\nsystemically important financial institutions on the brink of failure. They faced a classic dilemma: either\nrescue the insolvent firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and risk causing a\ncascade of other failures. As Ben Bernanke reportedly said: “There are no atheists in foxholes or\nideologues in financial crises.” 6 Without a credible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that\nwell-intentioned policymakers will be biased toward bailouts. Said simply, policymakers and regulators\nare people, too. Recognizing regulatory incentives should guide the design of the regulatory regime.\nThis underscores the need for credible methods of resolving insolvent firms and of well-designed lenderof-last-resort functions that reduce perceived stigma.\n\nMy final principle is that the regulatory framework needs to be designed so that institutions, regulators,\nand policymakers can be held accountable for the responsibilities assigned to them. There has been a rise\nin skepticism about institutions since the financial crisis. This is understandable given the depth and\nbreadth of the crisis and its aftermath, but it also suggests there is some urgency to considering how to\nincrease accountability in productive ways. A framework that encourages regulators to be more\nsystematic and less discretionary in how they implement regulations can help, as it sets up appropriate\nexpectations.\n\nIn addition, while the regulatory framework needs to acknowledge that the financial structure is complex,\nthe framework itself should only be as complex as necessary to be effective. 7 The notion that\n\n6\n\nSee Peter Baker, “A Professor and a Banker Bury Old Dogma on Markets,” New York Times, September 20, 2008\n(http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21paulson.html).\n\n7\n\nHaldane and Madouros (2012) discuss the benefits of a less complex financial regulatory structure and argue that\nthe complexity of the financial landscape does not call for a complex financial regulatory structure, but just the\nopposite (see Andrew G. Haldane and Vasileios Madouros, “The Dog and the Frisbee,” speech at the Federal\n\n\f7\n“everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler” is often (perhaps erroneously)\nattributed to Albert Einstein. But it applies to regulatory regimes. A sometimes overlooked lesson from\nthe crisis is that regulatory complexity can complicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and\nenforcement. Too much complexity can make it harder for regulators to assess compliance and identify\nrisk-shifting behavior, which means it is difficult to impose consequences for firms that fail to meet the\nstandards.\n\nEqually important, complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the regulators and align their incentives\nto carry out effective supervision and regulation. We should always be assessing whether we would be\nbetter off with a simpler regulatory structure that is easier to implement and govern, and that is\napproximately right across various states of the world, even if it is never optimal in any particular state or\nin any particular model of the economy.\n\nIf the system is too complex to evaluate, it will be difficult for the public and their representatives to hold\nregulators accountable. Either there will be no accountability or the regulators and policymakers will be\nheld accountable for every bad outcome, regardless of whether the outcome stems from poor performance\non their part or not. A simpler system allows for more effective accountability.\n\nReserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Policy Symposium, “The Changing Policy Landscape,” Jackson Hole,\nWY, August 31, 2012 (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/Haldane_final.pdf).\n\n\f8\nAt the same time, we should not be seduced by regulations that appear to be simple but would, in fact, be\nineffective and result in unintended consequences. Because the financial system is complex and everchanging, there will need to be some complexity in the regulatory framework. As I mentioned earlier,\nproposals to break up the banks or set a size limit might seem appealing as a solution to the too-big-to-fail\nproblem, but I think this would cause unintended and counterproductive consequences.\n\nSpeaking of simplicity, the three guiding principles I have discussed – aligning regulations with systemic\nrisk, paying attention to incentives and market forces, and increasing accountability – sound simple but\nare, in fact, difficult to pull off. Still, I think they deserve attention as we strive for a regulatory\nframework that is more effective and better able to deliver the benefits of a well-functioning financial\nsystem to the public.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Economic Club of Pittsburgh, the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh,\nCFA Society Pittsburgh, and the Pittsburgh Association for Financial Professionals\nPittsburgh, PA\nSeptember 7, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to share my views on the economy and monetary policy. This is a\nvery opportune time for me to be here. The Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking\nbody within the Fed, meets in less than two weeks. Traveling to Pittsburgh allows me to hear first-hand\nfrom people in this part of the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which comprises western Pennsylvania,\nOhio, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Of course, as an economist, I look\nat data and economic models to help formulate my views, but the information on emerging issues that the\nCleveland Fed staff and I gather directly from contacts throughout the District is also very important in\nassessing how the economy is doing. The FOMC spends considerable time discussing regional economic\nconditions at our meetings, and this information from all across the country helps us set national monetary\npolicy.\n\nIn addition to providing an opportunity to hear from you, my talk today also lets me explain my views on\nmonetary policy. Congress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability. At the same time, Congress has also wisely granted the Fed independence in setting\nmonetary policy in pursuit of those goals, meaning that policy decisions are insulated from short-run\npolitical considerations. But accountability must go hand in hand with that independence. I call this\n“accountable independence.” In order for the public and Congress to have the information they need to\nhold the Fed accountable for monetary policy decisions, it is important for Fed policymakers to regularly\ncommunicate their views. So I value this time with you today.\n\nAt this point, it is probably a good idea to remind people that the views I’ll provide today are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\n\f2\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion is now in its ninth year, one of the longest on record. But as everyone knows,\nage does not always indicate maturity. It’s good to remember that the economy had to climb out of a very\ndeep hole after the financial crisis and Great Recession, and it took some time for the expansion to gain\ntraction. Of course, there have been some ups and downs along the journey. Our thoughts are with the\npeople in Texas and along the Gulf Coast, and all those coping with the destruction in the wake of\nHurricane Harvey. We are gathering information from our contacts, but it is still too early to assess the\nfull economic impact of the storm. Experience suggests that soon after the storm passes, clean-up and\nrebuilding begin, oil refineries are assessed and brought back on-line, and shipping channels reopen.\nThese are huge undertakings and I expect we will see fortitude and resilience as this hard work proceeds.\nOne help is that the underlying fundamentals supporting the economy remain sound. These fundamentals\ninclude accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, a stronger U.S. banking system,\nimproved household balance sheets and income growth, continued strength in the U.S. labor market, and\nimproving conditions in the economies of our trading partners.\n\nEconomic growth\nOver the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on\naverage, and I anticipate that GDP will expand over the next year or so at a pace somewhat above trend,\nwhich I estimate at 2 percent. The hurricane in the Gulf will likely dampen economic activity in the\ncurrent quarter, with subsequent rebuilding efforts adding to growth in subsequent quarters. Although\nstorms like Harvey and Irma are atypical – thank goodness – quarterly variation in the data is not unusual.\nConsumer spending, which makes up over two-thirds of output, slowed in the first quarter but picked up\nin the second quarter. The outlook for household spending remains sound. Readings on consumer\nsentiment and confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing\nbecause labor markets continue to improve. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the\nGreat Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings, coupled with\n\n\f3\ncumulative increases in stock and house prices. Although not true for every homeowner, in the aggregate,\nthe equity households have in housing is now back to what it was at the peak.\n\nThe recovery in the housing market has taken some time. Buyers, sellers, developers, and bankers were\nall wary about reentering the market, and rightfully so, given the fallout from the housing bust. But with\nsupport from low interest rates and the improved financial condition of households and lenders, we’ve\nseen a gradual increase in housing construction and sales over the expansion. In some places, demand for\nhousing is outpacing supply, putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at about a 6\npercent pace, on average, nationally. 1 Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to\nexpand at a sustainable pace.\n\nAn encouraging sign in the economy is the strengthening in business activity and investment this year,\nafter subdued readings in 2015 and 2016. In recent years, oil prices and the value of the dollar have been\nimportant influences on business spending. You’ll recall that there was a sharp drop in oil prices from\nover $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $30 in early 2016. This led to a sharp pullback in activity in\nthe mining and drilling sector and its suppliers, including the steel industry. At the same time, a sharp 20\npercent appreciation of the dollar hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Since then,\nconditions supporting business spending have improved. The rebound in oil prices to around $50 per\nbarrel and the rise in natural gas prices have spurred a strong recovery in mining and drilling activity.\nThe modest appreciation in the dollar over the second half of 2016 and depreciation since the start of this\nyear reflect improved conditions in the economies in our trading partners. This has led to a pickup in U.S.\nmanufacturing activity and in our exports to other countries.\n\n1\n\nAs has been typically the case, house prices in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area are growing less rapidly than the\nnational average, in the 3 to 4 percent range.\n\n\f4\nCurrently, business sentiment remains at high levels and supportive of continued spending, but some of\nmy business contacts report that mounting political and fiscal policy uncertainty has begun to temper\nsome of that optimism. There are scattered reports from a few firms that they are delaying some of their\nplanned investment until the picture becomes clearer. We’ll need to keep a watch on whether this waitand-see attitude spreads and begins to weigh more broadly on spending and investment decisions.\n\nA pullback on investments in physical and human capital or in research and development leading to\ninnovations would be particularly troubling because these investments can have a positive effect on\nproductivity growth, which measures how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs\nto make output. Productivity growth is a key determinant of an economy’s longer-run output growth and\nof living standards. But the U.S. economy has been struggling with very low productivity growth. Over\nthe expansion, annual growth in labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector, has averaged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen\nover the prior two expansions. Low productivity growth, coupled with slower growth of the labor force,\nhelps to explain why the trend economic growth rate, which I estimate at 2 percent, is lower than the 3 to\n3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s. It also helps to explain why the acceleration in wages\nsince 2013 has been relatively subdued despite the strength we’ve seen in labor markets and reports of\nshortages of qualified workers in many occupations.\n\nLabor markets\nAs the economic expansion has progressed, firms have been adding people to their payrolls. So far this\nyear, job increases have averaged 176,000 per month, a bit under last year’s pace. This rate exceeds most\nestimates of trend employment growth, which fall in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The\nunemployment rate peaked at 10 percent after the Great Recession, but as the economy has added jobs at\nan above-trend pace, the unemployment rate moved down. For the past five months, the unemployment\nrate has stabilized, with monthly readings bouncing between 4.3 and 4.4 percent; the rate is now\n\n\f5\nessentially at the lowest level reached during the last expansion. Of course, to gauge labor market\nconditions, we look at more than payroll employment growth and this headline measure of the\nunemployment rate. We examine a broad set of indicators, including job opening and turnover rates, and\nbroader measures of the unemployment rate, such as those that include the number of part-time workers\nwho would rather work full time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a\njob. These measures also indicate that substantial progress has been made in the labor market. Although\nwe may see a weaker payroll employment number for September due to the hurricane, I expect that labor\nmarket conditions will remain healthy and that over the next year the unemployment rate will stay below\n4-3/4 percent, my current estimate of its longer-run rate.\n\nGranted, there is considerable uncertainty around estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate. The\nrelatively modest acceleration in wages, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2\npercent in recent quarters, suggests to some that there is still considerable slack in labor markets and that\nthe longer-run unemployment rate is lower than the current rate. For me, a more salient factor in the\nrelatively slow growth in wages is the low level of productivity growth. 2 Firms have indicated that there\nisn’t much slack in the labor market, and we are hearing more frequent reports from our labor and\nbusiness contacts across a broad set of industries that businesses are having trouble finding qualified\nworkers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. Some of these firms report they are\nresponding by raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain workers. These increases\nshould eventually find their way into the aggregate compensation measures, but unless productivity\ngrowth picks up, I wouldn’t expect to see a strong acceleration in wages.\n\n2\n\nAlthough actual wage setting is a complicated process, in economic models of competitive markets, real wages\nreflect the marginal product of workers. For a discussion of wages and their relationship to productivity growth over\nthe expansion, see Roberto Pinheiro and Meifeng Yang, “Wage Growth after the Great Recession,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, Economic Commentary, March 21, 2017 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economic-commentaries/ec-201704-wage-growth-after-greatrecession.aspx).\n\n\f6\nSo my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address,\nwe have achieved the maximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate. At the same\ntime, there are some longer-run structural issues in the labor market that cannot be addressed by monetary\npolicy but that the country must tackle. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature\nof available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. While the overall economy will\neventually benefit from these forces, many individuals and some regions are adversely affected by these\nstructural trends. Government policies and programs and public-private partnerships can and should be\nbrought to bear to help people gain the skills needed for jobs in the modern economy and to help\ncommunities make the transition. This is already happening in Pittsburgh. The Allegheny Conference on\nCommunity Development has published an in-depth analysis of the expected supply and demand for labor\nin the Pittsburgh region over the next decade and has made a number of recommendations to help the\nregion prepare for the coming changes. 3 The study drew on some of the work being conducted by the\nFederal Reserve System’s community development function. In October, the Fed will hold a capstone\nconference on a collaborative initiative that has focused on reframing workforce development efforts as\ninvestments, allowing for larger-scale solutions with increased accountability for outcomes. 4\n\nInflation\nPrice stability is the other part of the Fed’s mandate. Inflation has had its ups and downs over the\nexpansion. It has moved up from the very low levels seen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil\nand import prices. But the last couple of readings were on the weak side and inflation continues to run\n3\n\n“Inflection Point: Supply, Demand and the Future of Work in the Pittsburgh Region,” report prepared by Burning\nGlass Technologies and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning with Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment, May 2016 (http://www.alleghenyconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/InflectionPoint.pdf).\n\n4\n\nThe initiative, “Investing in America’s Workforce: Improving Outcomes for Workers and Employers,” is a Federal\nReserve System initiative in collaboration with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers\nUniversity, the Ray Marshall Center of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of\nTexas, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. The capstone conference will be held on October\n4-6, 2017 in Austin, Texas. More information on the initiative and the conference is available at\nhttps://www.investinwork.org/.\n\n\f7\nbelow the Fed’s goal of 2 percent. The year-over-year increase in PCE inflation stood at 1.4 percent in\nJuly, up from about 1 percent a year ago. Most people understand why high inflation is a problem: it\nerodes the purchasing power of their money. But inflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead\nconsumers and businesses to delay purchases and it increases debt burdens, either of which could slow the\neconomy.\n\nIn assessing where we are relative to the inflation goal, it’s always a good idea to look through temporary\nmovements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is\ngoing on a sustained basis. For example, when assessing the underlying trend in inflation, we should look\nthrough a temporary increase in gasoline prices stemming from disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey.\nSimilarly, some of the weakness in recent inflation reports reflects special factors, like the drop in the\nprices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans earlier in the year. It may take a couple more\nmonths for these factors to work themselves through, but these types of price declines aren’t signaling a\ngeneral downward trend in consumer prices from weak demand. Instead, they reflect supply-side factors\nand relative price changes. At the same time, we need to recognize that weak inflation numbers, no\nmatter what the source, can become a problem if they start to undermine the public’s expectations about\nfuture inflation. If inflation expectations were to become unanchored and began steadily declining, it\nwould be much more difficult to raise inflation back to the Fed’s goal.\n\nI don’t expect the economy to get to that point, and my current assessment is that inflation will remain\nbelow our goal for somewhat longer but that the conditions remain in place for inflation to gradually\nreturn over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent on a sustained basis. These conditions\ninclude growth that’s expected to be at or slightly above trend, continued strength in the labor market, and\nreasonably stable inflation expectations.\n\n\f8\nWe need to recognize that there are risks around any inflation projection – both upside risks, considering\nthe current and future expected strength in labor markets, and downside risks, given the softness in recent\ninflation readings. In fact, inflation is difficult to forecast: based on historical forecast errors over the past\n20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE inflation one year ahead is plus or minus 1\npercentage point, 5 and a significant portion of the variation in inflation rates comes from idiosyncratic\nfactors that can’t be forecasted. 6 Indeed, since the 1990s, assuming that inflation will return to 2 percent\nover the next one to two years has been one of the most accurate forecasts. In the recent period, this is\nperhaps a testament to the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations and of the FOMC’s\ncommitment to its 2 percent symmetric inflation goal. In any case, I will be scrutinizing incoming data on\ninflation and inflation expectations and the reports from my business contacts to help me assess the\ninflation outlook.\n\nEconomic developments in Pittsburgh\nAs I mentioned at the start of my talk, evaluating regional economic conditions plays an important role in\nsetting national monetary policy, so let me spend a few minutes discussing the Pittsburgh-area economy.\nFor some time, this region’s economy has been transitioning from one that is largely dependent on steel,\ncoal mining, and heavy industry, to one that is diversifying into health care, education, financial services,\nand technology. 7 This is a promising development because regions that remain dependent on one\n5\n\nSee “Table 2. Average Historical Projection Error Ranges,” in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of\nthe Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 13-14, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20170614.pdf).\n\n6\n\nSee Janet Yellen, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial\nLecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/yellen20150924a.pdf).\n\n7\n\nPittsburgh has a higher share of employment in the service-producing sector than does the U.S., and this share has\nrisen over time, from about 71 percent of employment in the 1990s to about 77 percent today. The comparable\nshares in the U.S. are 64 percent and 71 percent, respectively. The share of employment in the education and health\nservices component of the service sector in Pittsburgh is higher than in the U.S., and it has shown considerable\ngrowth over time. In Pittsburgh, this share rose from 17 percent in the 1990s to 21 percent today. The comparable\nshares in the U.S. are 11 percent and 16 percent, respectively. (Author’s calculations using payroll employment data\nfrom the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\n\n\f9\nparticular industry have fared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their\nindustrial bases and adapt to changing economic forces. Nonetheless, Pittsburgh’s industrial mix and the\ntypes of shocks that hit the economy played a role in how the area has fared over the expansion.\n\nThe Great Recession took its toll on the region but Pittsburgh was an early achiever in the expansion. In\n2012, Pittsburgh was one of the first major U.S. metropolitan areas to see payroll jobs move back up to\npre-Great Recession levels. The U.S. as a whole didn’t achieve that milestone until mid-2014, and\nPennsylvania, not until 2015. The unemployment rate in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area peaked at\naround 8-1/2 percent in 2010 and had fallen to about 5-1/4 percent by the end of 2014.\n\nBut the decline in energy prices and the appreciation of the dollar in 2014 to 2016 took a toll on the\nregion, causing a contraction in energy exploration and production, and steel production. Though job\nlosses in these sectors were offset by continued increases in service-sector jobs, the unemployment rate\nbegan to rise.\n\nThe good news is that once energy prices and the dollar stabilized, the unemployment rate began falling\nagain to its current level of just over 5 percent, and overall employment began growing again. Certain\nsectors are still losing jobs, but the pace of job cuts in mining and drilling has slowed and job cuts in\nmanufacturing have stabilized. Losses in these sectors are being more than offset by gains in the service\nsector, where we see relatively strong growth in scientific R&D jobs in the metro area.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAs I mentioned earlier, the FOMC will be meeting later this month to discuss the economy and decide on\nmonetary policy. We will also be releasing a new round of economic projections, something we do four\ntimes a year. Based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook, the FOMC has begun to\nnormalize the stance of monetary policy by removing some of the extraordinary accommodation that was\n\n\f10\nnecessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Appropriate adjustments in monetary\npolicy are those that will sustain the expansion, not curtail it, so that our longer-run goals of price stability\nand maximum employment are met and maintained.\n\nBecause we know that it takes some time for monetary policy to work itself through the economy, we\ncan’t wait until these policy goals are fully met to act. We need to assess what incoming information is\ntelling us about where the economy is going over the medium run, and the risks around that medium-run\noutlook, and set policy appropriately.\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via\ngradual increases in the fed funds rate will be needed and will help sustain the expansion. A gradual\nremoval of accommodation helps avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if\nthe economy is allowed to overheat, as well as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low,\nencouraging investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield or engendering other\nfinancial imbalances. The gradual approach to normalization allows for the kind of fluctuations we’ve\nseen in the data on the economy and inflation without having to change our strategy. I see this\nconsistency as a positive in that it underscores our systematic approach to promoting our policy goals and\nit removes policy ambiguity at a time when uncertainty seems to be rising on other fronts.\n\nIt’s important to notice that the gradual path I anticipate does not entail an increase at each FOMC\nmeeting. At its July meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n1 to 1-1/4 percent. It also announced that economic conditions are expected to evolve in a way that will\nwarrant further gradual increases; the pace of those increases will depend on what incoming information\nimplies about the medium-run outlook.\n\n\f11\nNormalizing the stance of monetary policy also means taking steps to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet\nin terms of the size and composition of assets. To address the Great Recession, the Fed undertook several\nprograms to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgagebacked securities (MBS). These purchases aimed to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates\nonce the FOMC’s traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As a\nresult of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6\npercent of nominal GDP, to about $4.5 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. 8 In addition, the\ncomposition of the Fed’s assets has changed from mainly short-term Treasury securities to mainly longermaturity Treasuries and agency MBS. In tandem with the increase in Fed assets, there was a sizable\nincrease in Fed liabilities, namely, depository institution deposits, or reserves, held at the Fed. Reserves\nhave increased from about $11 billion in 2007 to over $2 trillion today. In October 2014, the Fed stopped\nthe program to increase the size of its balance sheet, but since then, we’ve been reinvesting the returns\nfrom maturing securities, thereby maintaining the balance sheet’s large size.\n\nThe FOMC’s intention is to reduce the size of the balance sheet over time to the smallest size needed to\nimplement monetary policy efficiently and effectively and, in the longer run, to hold primarily Treasury\nsecurities. 9 In June, the FOMC described its program for normalizing the balance sheet by gradually\nreducing the amount of reinvestments it is making in a predictable way. 10 The gradual, predictable\ndecline allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on\n\n8\n\nThe comparable figures for the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, which are also using asset\npurchases to increase accommodation, are 38 percent and 91 percent, respectively. (Balance-sheet data for the\nEuropean Central Bank from the Eurosystem are available at\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/wfs/2017/html/ecb.fs170808.en.html.

The FOMC\nexpects to begin implementing the program relatively soon, 11 and I favor doing this in the near future.\nFirst, by design, it will be a very gradual process of decreasing the amount of assets reinvested each\nmonth, with balance sheet normalization taking several years. 12 Second, the plan has been well\ntelegraphed in advance. Both of these aspects make it less likely that we will see a sudden or sizable\nincrease in long-term yields as a result of the announcement of the start of implementation. Indeed, in my\nview, other factors, including the ongoing discussions about the debt ceiling, rising geopolitical tensions,\nand political uncertainty, would be more likely to influence Treasury yields in the near term.\n\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, we know the balance sheet will be larger than it was\nprior to the financial crisis for the simple reason that the public’s demand for currency is rising over\ntime. 13 But it will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. How much smaller depends on\nhow the FOMC decides to implement monetary policy in the future. 14 But because it will take several\nyears to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, there is no reason to delay the start of\nnormalization until this decision is made.\n\n11\n\nSee the FOMC post-meeting statement of July 26, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170726a.htm).\n12\n\nOnce started, the plan is to allow up to $6 billion a month of maturing Treasuries and $4 billion a month of\nprincipal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to run off the balance sheet. These caps would be increased by\n$6 billion and $4 billion per month, respectively, every three months, until they reach $30 billion per month for\nTreasuries and $20 billion per month for agency MBS and agency debt. Thereafter, those caps would be maintained\nand the balance sheet would gradually decline. (See “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization\nPrinciples and Plans,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System press release, June 14, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm) ).\nFor projections of the Fed’s balance sheet under various scenarios, see “Projections for the SOMA Portfolio and\nNet Income,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, July 2017\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/omo/SOMAPortfolioandIncomeProjections_July2017Up\ndate.pdf).\n13\n\nSince the financial crisis, currency has doubled in quantity, from about $770 billion in 2007 to about $1.5 trillion\ntoday.\n14\n\nFor an accessible description of frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see Jane E. Ihrig, Ellen E. Meade,\nand Gretchen C. Weinbach, “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach to\nRaising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198\n(http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177).\n\n\f13\n\nAs a final remark, it’s important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and\nbecause of that, monetary policy is not pre-set. The confidence bands the FOMC is now providing\naround its economic and policy path projections are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers\nthat there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in\nhow it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook\nindeed materially change. That said, I view the steps the FOMC is taking to gradually normalize\nmonetary policy – both the fed funds rate and the balance sheet – as a welcome acknowledgment that the\neconomy itself has normalized.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Community Bankers Association of Ohio Annual Convention\nCincinnati, OH\nAugust 2, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Community Bankers Association of Ohio for the opportunity to speak at your annual\nconvention and for your ongoing engagement with the Federal Reserve. That engagement actually goes\nback to the very beginnings of the Federal Reserve System. It might surprise some of you to know that in\n1913, Elvadore Fancher, a vice president with Union National Bank of Cleveland, wrote to Congress\nsuggesting how the regional Reserve Banks might be structured. A year later, Fancher was chosen to be\nthe first head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, a position in which he served for two decades. 1\nToday, I enjoy the fruits of the strong relationship that has developed between Ohio bankers and the\nCleveland Fed. The bankers who serve on our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council\n(CDIAC) and on our board of directors generously provide me with their valuable insights into regional\neconomic and banking conditions. As you all know, community banks play a vital role in the economic\nhealth of their communities, providing creditworthy businesses the wherewithal to prosper and\nhouseholds the ability to improve their financial standing and quality of life. Because of their important\nwork, community bankers are among the most knowledgeable about changes in conditions on the ground\nin local areas. Such information often takes much longer to show up in official statistical reports. So I\nfind the insights gained from speaking with bankers to be especially valuable as part of the mosaic of\ninformation I use in formulating my views on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nOf course, from time to time, I also hear from community bankers about matters pertaining to banking\nregulation and supervision. Recently, these conversations have highlighted the burden of the regulatory\nchanges put in place since the financial crisis. I am grateful to the bankers who willingly discuss both the\neconomy and regulation with me, and today I would like to return the favor and provide you with some of\n\n1\n\nFor further information about Elvadore Fancher, see\nhttps://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/elvadore_r_fancher.\n\n\f2\nmy perspectives on both. Of course, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nThe economic expansion turned eight years old this summer. It got off to a slow start from a very weak\nplace, but now this expansion is one of the longest on record. The sustainability of the expansion through\nvarious economic shocks is a testament to the U.S. economy’s resiliency, and I believe the underlying\nfundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. While the quarterly pattern has had its\nshare of ups and downs, it is usually a good idea to smooth through this volatility when trying to assess\nunderlying conditions. Over the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more\nthan 2 percent, on average. This year, growth in the first quarter was a bit soft, but it picked up in the\nsecond quarter. Favorable fundamentals should support GDP growth over the next year at somewhat\nabove trend, which I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy\nand financial conditions, a sound U.S. banking system, improved household balance sheets and income\ngrowth, continued strength in the U.S. labor market, and improving conditions in the economies of our\ntrading partners.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. So far this year,\nthat strength has been sustained, with an average increase of 180,000 jobs per month. The pace is well\nabove estimates of trend employment growth, which range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month,\ndepending on what one assumes about labor force participation. The trend pace of employment growth is\nlower than it was a few decades ago because there has been a downward trend in participation, reflecting\ndemographic factors, including the aging of our population. The fact that the participation rate has been\nbasically stable for the past three years in the face of a declining trend is another sign of strength in the\nlabor market.\n\n\f3\nOver the expansion, as the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has been moving down. The\nunemployment rate peaked at 10 percent after the Great Recession. In June, it stood at 4.4 percent,\nmatching the lowest level reached in the previous expansion. In addition, broader measures of the\nunemployment rate, which track the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time and\nthe number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, have also fallen significantly\nsince their business cycle peaks. Given the progress that has already been made, payroll job growth is\nlikely to slow a bit from its current pace, but I expect that over the next year the unemployment rate will\nstay below my estimate of its longer-run rate, which I now estimate at 4-3/4 percent. I recently lowered\nmy estimate from 5 percent, and even though this change is not statistically significant, I thought it was\ntime to acknowledge that even as labor markets continue to tighten, inflation has remained moderate.\n\nInflation has had its ups and downs over the expansion. It has moved up from the very low levels seen in\n2015 when it was held down by falling oil and import prices. But the last couple of readings were on the\nweak side and inflation continues to run below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent. In assessing where we are\nrelative to the goal, it’s always a good idea to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both\nthose above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis. Some\nof the weakness in recent inflation reports reflects special factors, like the drop in the prices of\nprescription drugs and cell phone service plans. It may take a couple of months for these factors to work\nthemselves through, but these types of price declines aren’t signaling a general downward trend in\nconsumer prices. I’ll be scrutinizing incoming inflation data and reports from my business contacts, but\nat this point, my assessment is that the conditions remain in place for inflation to gradually return over the\nnext year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent on a sustained basis. These conditions include growth\nthat’s expected to be at or slightly above trend, continued strength in the labor market, and reasonably\nstable inflation expectations.\n\n\f4\nBased on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook, the Fed has begun to normalize the stance\nof monetary policy by removing some of the extraordinary accommodation that was necessary in the\nwake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those\nthat will sustain the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment\nare met and maintained. We can’t wait until the goals are fully met because monetary policy affects the\neconomy with a lag. We need to remain focused on the medium-run outlook, and risks around the\noutlook, assessing what incoming economic reconnaissance implies about the outlook and risks. If\neconomic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via gradual\nincreases in the fed funds rate will be needed.\n\nThe gradual path that the FOMC has communicated for some time is appropriate given the outlook will\nhelp prolong the expansion, not curtail it. A gradual removal of accommodation helps avoid a build-up of\nrisks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as well as risks to\nfinancial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on excessively risky\ninvestments in a search for yield. The gradualism has allowed us to follow a consistent strategy even as\nthe data on the economy and inflation have shown some fluctuations. I see benefits to this consistency: it\nremoves some ambiguity and it underscores the fact that we set monetary policy systematically, with a\nfocus on the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook and their implications for our policy goals.\n\nIt’s important to notice that the gradual path I anticipate does not entail an increase at each FOMC\nmeeting, and last week, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1\nto 1-1/4 percent; it also announced that economic conditions are expected to evolve in a way that will\nwarrant further gradual increases.\n\nNormalizing the stance of monetary policy also means taking steps to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet\nin terms of the size and composition of assets. The balance sheet grew when, to address the Great\n\n\f5\nRecession, the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity\nTreasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These purchases aimed to put downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates once the FOMC’s traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had\nbeen reduced to effectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet has grown from\nnearly $900 billion in assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from\nmainly short-term Treasury securities to mainly longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\n\nFrom the very start of using the nontraditional tools, the FOMC recognized it would need to eventually\nreturn to a more normal balance sheet. In June, the FOMC described its program for normalizing the\nbalance sheet by gradually reducing the amount of reinvestments it is making in a predictable way. 2 Last\nweek, the FOMC said it expected to begin implementing the program relatively soon. 3\n\nOnce started, the plan is to allow up to $6 billion a month of maturing Treasuries and $4 billion a month\nof principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to run off the balance sheet. These caps would be\nincreased by $6 billion and $4 billion per month, respectively, every three months, until they reach $30\nbillion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency MBS and agency debt. Thereafter,\nthose caps would be maintained and the balance sheet would gradually decline. The gradual, predictable\ndecline allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on\nsetting the appropriate level of the funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool.\n\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, the intention is to reduce it over time to the smallest size\nneeded to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. We know the balance sheet will be\n2\n\nSee “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System press release, June 14, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm).\n\n3\n\nSee the FOMC post-meeting statement of July 26, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170726a.htm).\n\n\f6\nlarger than it was prior to the financial crisis for the simple reason that the public’s demand for currency\nis rising over time. 4 But it will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much\nsmaller depends on how the FOMC implements monetary policy in the future. The FOMC has not yet\ndecided whether its long-run framework will be one in which bank reserves are scarce, as was the case\nbefore the financial crisis, or one in which reserves are abundant. 5 However, because it will take several\nyears to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, the FOMC can begin normalizing the\nbalance sheet before we have decided on the balance sheet’s ultimate size.\n\nIt’s important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and because of that,\nmonetary policy is not pre-set. In March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its\neconomic and policy path projections. 6 These are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers\nthat there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in\nhow it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook\nindeed materially change. That said, I view the steps the FOMC is taking to normalize monetary policy –\n\n4\n\nSince the financial crisis, currency has doubled in quantity, from about $770 billion in 2007 to about $1.5 trillion\ntoday.

That the financial system was at the heart of the crisis attests to the\nfact that a sound financial system is a vital part of a vibrant economy. The 2008 financial crisis exposed\ngaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which contributed to a buildup in financial\nimbalances and systemic risk. In response to the crisis, changes were made to how banks are regulated\nand supervised, and banks themselves have made changes in how they monitor risks and run their\nbusinesses. As a result, the U.S. financial system is considerably stronger and more resilient than it was\nleading up to the financial crisis. This strength and resiliency benefit the economy and must be preserved.\n\nHowever, just as the improved economy affords us the opportunity to begin to normalize monetary\npolicy, the improved health of the banking industry makes this an opportune time to consider whether any\nadjustments to the regulatory and supervisory framework could make it even more effective. I won’t\nkeep you in too much suspense: the Federal Reserve and the other financial regulatory agencies are\nalready taking steps to improve the effectiveness of their supervision. Before I discuss some of the steps\nthat are particularly relevant for community banks, it might be helpful to review why banks are regulated\nand the basic approach to effective regulation.\n\nA risk-based approach to bank regulation and supervision\nBanks play an important role in the economy by providing funding to creditworthy borrowers, both\nbusinesses and households, by offering customers methods to save and make payments, and by helping\npeople and firms manage their financial affairs. Community banks play a crucial role in their local\neconomies, and particularly so in many small towns and rural areas where the choices of financial\n\n\f8\nservices are limited. 7 Small businesses rely heavily on community banks for credit, and given the\nimportant role that small businesses play in the economy, it isn’t hard to see that serving these types of\nfirms helps to promote growth. 8 In addition, community banks tend to have close ties to the communities\nand customers they serve, and this allows them to offer products and services tailored to their customers’\nneeds. 9\n\nBut banks of all sizes are able to provide these valuable credit, payment, and financial management\nservices because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial\nbusinesses. This risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic problems that could threaten\nthe functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and impose significant economic\ncosts. The bank regulatory and supervisory framework is meant to address the potential problem of\nsystemic risk, as well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions. The framework aims to foster\na financial system that’s resilient: one in which financial institutions remain strong enough to continue to\nlend and offer other valuable services through the ups and downs of the business cycle.\n\n7\n\nSee, for example, “The Role of Community Banks in the U.S. Economy,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nEconomic Review, Second Quarter 2003, pp. 15-43\n(https://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/econrev/Pdf/2q03keet.pdf).\n\n8\n\nThree-quarters of U.S. businesses have fewer than 10 employees. Over a quarter of U.S. private-sector jobs are at\nfirms with fewer than 50 employees, and over half are at firms with fewer than 500 employees (based on data from\nsupplemental tables F and G of the National Business Employment Dynamics Data, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,\navailable at http://www.bls.gov/bdm/bdmfirmsize.htm).

Udell, “Small Business Credit Availability and Relationship Lending: The\nImportance of Bank Organisational Structure,” Economic Journal 112, February 2002, pp. 32-53 (working paper\nversion available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2001/200136/200136pap.pdf), and Allen N.

Important components of the regulatory-supervisory\nframework include capital requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, living will resolution plans,\nand resolution methods that allow systemically important institutions to fail without causing problems for\nthe entire financial system.\n\nThe focus on risk management means that institutions that pose the most systemic risk should face\nenhanced prudential standards and supervisory attention. The Dodd-Frank Act took a step in this\ndirection and the Federal Reserve takes a tiered approach to banking supervision. Aligning oversight with\nrisk helps to ensure that institutions aren’t burdened by rules that make it more costly for them to serve\ntheir customers but that do little to further the goal of a healthy and resilient financial system.\nCommunity banks generally don’t impose costs on the rest of the financial system or create the kinds of\ncontagion that can put the entire financial system at risk, so their oversight should differ from that of\nsystemically important institutions. At the same time, as the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and the\ncommercial real estate crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s remind us, when many smaller institutions\nget in trouble at the same time, this can also harm the economy. So maintaining the safety and soundness\nof smaller institutions cannot be neglected. It’s a matter of aligning oversight with potential risk.\n\nSteps to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks without sacrificing financial resiliency,\nsafety, and soundness\nThis tiering of oversight by risk adds some complexity to the financial system’s regulatory framework.\nBut the U.S. financial system is quite complex and ever-changing, with various types of banks and\nnonbank providers of financial services. So some complexity is to be expected. To paraphrase H.L.\nMencken: “For every complex problem there is a solution that is clear, simple, and wrong.” That said,\nit’s important that the regulatory framework avoid excessive complexity, which can complicate\n\n\f10\nsupervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Too much complexity can make it harder for\nbanks to understand the standards they are being asked to meet, and harder for regulators to assess\ncompliance and overall risk. Better aligning our regulation and supervision with the risks imposed could\nallow simplifications without sacrificing safety, soundness, and resiliency.\n\nThe Volcker rule is perhaps an obvious example of this. Dodd-Frank generally limits banks from\nengaging in proprietary trading of financial instruments and investing in hedge funds and private equity\nfunds. But the rule is quite complex. Given that community banks are not likely to participate in such\nactivities, there doesn’t appear to be much to gain from having them maintain a compliance program. So\nI support exempting community banks from the Volcker rule.\n\nOther simplifications are already taking place. Earlier this year, the federal banking agencies completed\ntheir decennial review of banking regulations to identify provisions that are outdated or unnecessary. 10\nAs a result of the review, 78 guidance letters were deemed out-of-date and were eliminated, and the datareporting requirements for small community banks were reduced and simplified, resulting in a shorter\nCall Report.\n\nIn addition, exam frequency has been reduced for a large set of institutions. Now, 83 percent of all\ninsured depository institutions qualify to be examined every 18 months rather than every 12 months, as a\nresult of a provision in the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act that raised the asset\nthreshold from $500 million to $1 billion.\n\n10\n\nThis review is required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act. See the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council’s Joint Report to Congress on Economic Growth and Regulatory\nPaperwork Reduction Act, March 2017 for additional details\n(https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf).\n\n\f11\nThe agencies are also working to develop a simplified capital framework for community bank\norganizations. 11 For large banks, the combination of risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio\nrequirement as a back stop, liquidity requirements, and annual stress testing is appropriate. But one has to\nask whether the compliance costs faced by small community banks in adhering to a complicated riskbased capital regime outweigh the benefits in terms of safety, soundness, and financial system resiliency,\ncompared to an alternative regime comprising a leverage ratio requirement based on high-quality capital,\ncombined perhaps with a simplified risk-weighted capital requirement.\n\nThe guiding principle of aligning the degree of prudential oversight with risk applies not only to\ncommunity banks but also to larger banks. Dodd-Frank requires that banks with assets between $10\nbillion and $50 billion be subject to company-run stress tests and that banks with assets of $50 billion or\nmore be subject to annual supervisor-administered stress tests, capital planning, living will, and other\nenhanced prudential requirements. I support some increase in the thresholds but also believe that the\ncombination of these requirements at systemically important banks has led to a stronger and more\nresilient financial system and should be maintained. 12\n\nSome of the amendments I’ve mentioned would require legislation; others would require coordinated\naction across the bank regulatory agencies. But the Fed is also working to improve its own supervisory\nprocesses to make them better aligned with risk and more efficient so that speedier decisions can be made.\nSince 2014, the Fed has used a risk-focused consumer compliance examination framework for community\n\n11\n\nSee a summary of some of the steps being considered in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s\nJoint Report to Congress on Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, March 2017\n(https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf).\n\n12\n\nThe Fed has already exempted nonsystemic banks with less than $250 billion in assets and less than $75 billion in\nnonbank activities from the qualitative, capital planning part of the stress-testing process. See “Federal Reserve\nBoard Announces Finalized Stress Testing Rules Removing Noncomplex Firms from Qualitative Aspect of CCAR\nEffective for 2017,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System press release, January 30, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170130a.htm).\n\n\f12\nbanks that helps examiners focus their attention on more serious compliance issues. 13 While this has been\nhelpful, I have heard from several community bankers that it is still taking too long to close compliance\nexamination findings. In looking at the timelines, even though some of the cases are complex, I have to\nagree that we can and should do a better job of reaching decisions in a reasonable period of time.\nClarifying supervisors’ expectations with respect to consumer compliance and community development\nrules would also be a good step.\n\nThe Fed is also undertaking a comprehensive review of its safety and soundness examination framework\nfor community banks, and developing analytical tools so that we can better focus our supervisory efforts\non the highest risks while reducing the regulatory burden on low-risk community banks.\n\nI hope this brief review illustrates that the Federal Reserve is committed to following the guiding\nprinciple of aligning regulatory and supervisory oversight with the level of potential risk. This will allow\nus to reduce undue regulatory burden without compromising the health and resiliency of the financial\nsystem, an approach that will benefit banks of all sizes and the overall economy.\n\nConclusion\nThe financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession took a toll on all of us. Now, the economy and financial\nsystem have returned to health, and the goal is to keep both of them there. Monetary policymakers need\nto set policy appropriately to ensure that the expansion continues and our policy goals of maximum\n\n13\n\nJeffrey Drum, “Risk-Focused Consumer Compliance Supervision Program for Community Banks,” Consumer\nCompliance Outlook, Second Quarter 2014 (https://consumercomplianceoutlook.org/2014/second-quarter/riskfocused-consumer-compliance-supervision-program-for-community-banks/), and “Community Bank Risk-Focused\nConsumer Compliance Supervision Program,” June 2014 Update to the Consumer Compliance Handbook, Federal\nReserve Board of Governors Division of Consumer and Community Affairs\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SupManual/cch/announce/201406cch_update.htm).\n\n\f13\nemployment and 2 percent inflation are met and sustained. In my view, that means continuing on the path\nof gradually normalizing interest rates and the balance sheet. With respect to financial regulation and\nsupervision, it means ensuring that the financial system remains resilient, with an appropriate focus on\nlimiting systemic risk and the costs such risks impose on the economy when they are realized, helping to\nensure that banks remain sound and able to extend financial services to their communities through the ups\nand downs of the business cycle, and avoiding regulations that impose burdens but do not further these\ngoals. Getting the right balance entails a tiered approach to banking supervision and regulation. This\ntiered approach recognizes that the risk a banking organization poses to the financial system is likely to\nvary according to its size, range of activities, and complexity, and so supervision and regulation should\nvary along these dimensions as well. The rules and oversight that apply to community banks should not\nbe the same as those that apply to systemically important institutions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been taking steps to right-size its oversight of banking institutions consistent\nwith the risks they pose to the financial system because a sound financial system conveys benefits on\nhouseholds and businesses. Bankers have also taken important steps to better monitor their risks so that\nthey can better deliver services to their customers.\n\nAt the end of the day, the public will be the judge of whether we have successfully met the challenges.\nAccording to the Financial Trust Index, published by the business schools at the University of Chicago\nand Northwestern University, there is still a ways to go. 14 While there has been some improvement since\n2008, still only about 27 percent of those polled for the index said they trusted their financial institutions,\nbroadly defined to include banks, the stock market, mutual funds, and large corporations. Lest I leave\nyou on that disappointing note, I want to mention that the survey results differ significantly by type of\n\n14\n\nThe Financial Trust Index is based on an annual survey of a representative sample of about 1,000 American\nhouseholds. For further information, see the website: http://www.financialtrustindex.org/index.htm.\n\n\f14\ninstitution. Nearly 60 percent of the people polled said they trusted their local bank. 15 This is an\nencouraging sign that by focusing on safety, soundness, resiliency, and customer service, we can create a\nfinancial system that the public views as beneficial, and one that truly is.\n\n15\n\nThe 2015 results by bank category are available on the Financial Trust Index website at\nhttp://www.financialtrustindex.org/resultswave24.htm. I thank Professor Luigi Zingales at the University of\nChicago for providing the updated results for 2016. In the 2016 survey, while 38 percent of respondents reported\ntrusting their banks, 57 percent indicated that they trust their local bank.\n\n\f"

As is\nclear from the many conversations we’ve had over the past two days – and over the past 14 years of this\nsummit – there are no easy answers. But there are some answers, and I have confidence that your\ndedication, expertise, and collaboration will result in effective solutions being implemented more widely\nand even better solutions being devised. I hope that the discussions over the past two days have inspired\nyou to continue the important work you are doing.\n\nToday, I want to talk about the Federal Reserve’s role in the community development arena. I will touch\non “the why, the how, and the what” of this work: why we at the Fed see our community development\nefforts as important to our mission of fostering a healthy economy, how we go about doing this work, and\nsome of what we are focusing on. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Structure of the Fed\nTo begin, it helps to know a little bit about the structure of the Federal Reserve System. To say that the\nFed is an “interesting” institution is an understatement. I’ve spent my career at the Fed, and I am still\nlearning arcane things about the Fed’s structure and history. The Federal Reserve System was established\nby an act of Congress that was signed into law in 1913. We like to say that the Federal Reserve is a\n\n\f2\ndecentralized central bank, which is independent within the government but not independent from the\ngovernment. The structure is one of balance. Congress designed the Fed to alleviate concerns that it\nwould become dominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington or by\nany particular individual group. The design includes representation from the entire nation, balancing\npublic-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks that are distributed across the country and a\nseven-member Board of Governors in Washington that oversees those Banks. The governors, who serve\nthe public, are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The Reserve\nBanks also operate in the public interest. Each has a nine-member board of directors whose members are\nchosen in a nonpolitical process to represent business, agricultural, industrial, bank, and public interests in\nthe Districts they serve. The nonbank directors are responsible for choosing the Bank’s president, who is\nsubject to approval by the Fed’s Board of Governors. Some of the Reserve Banks also have Branches\nwith boards, and each Reserve Bank has a number of advisory councils drawing membership from\nvarious sectors and geographies in their Districts.\n\nThis regional and balanced structure has served the country well for more than 100 years. The U.S. is\nvery diverse, encompassing large cities, small towns, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries\nand occupations. The Fed’s structure allows decisions on monetary policy, financial system regulation\nand supervision, and payments to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people.\nWe recognize that our policy decisions affect Main Streets and communities all across the country.\n\nAs a participant at Federal Open Market Committee meetings, I can attest to the fact that the members of\nthe Board of Governors and Reserve Bank presidents do bring different perspectives to the table. My\nown perspectives are informed not only by economic and financial data and models but also by the\ninformation gleaned from a diverse set of business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the Fourth\n\n\f3\nDistrict, which includes the state of Ohio, the western part of Pennsylvania, the eastern part of Kentucky,\nand the northern panhandle of West Virginia. By design, the discussions at our meetings contain a\nmosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. The FOMC does not suffer\nfrom group think. We come together, share our different perspectives, and work to develop a consensus\nto set national monetary policy in pursuit of our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment, goals that Congress gave us.\n\nCongress has also given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions. Neither Congress\nnor the U.S. president has to approve monetary policy decisions, so the decisions are insulated from shortrun political considerations. At the same time, the Fed is held accountable for its decisions when it\nregularly communicates the rationale for its policy decisions in testimony before Congress, and in policy\nstatements, meeting minutes, reports, and speeches. This system of accountable independence has been\nshown to yield better policy decisions and better economic outcomes for the country. The regional,\nprivate-public structure of the Federal Reserve System helps to reinforce this system of independence and\naccountability by ensuring that diverse information from all sectors of the economy and all parts of the\ncountry is brought into monetary policy discussions, with the policymakers themselves distributed across\nthe nation and not concentrated in one location.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The Why\nIn addition to aiding monetary policymaking, the Fed’s structure allows us to perform our other functions\nmore effectively, too. Of course, one of those is near and dear to everyone in this room: the Federal\nReserve System’s role in identifying effective community development policies and best practices for\npromoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe origin of the Fed’s community development work lies with the passage of the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA) in 1977. At the time, many people thought that limited access to credit and\n\n\f4\nillegal practices such as redlining contributed to the deterioration in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods throughout the U.S. The CRA was meant to help ensure equitable access to credit for all\nindividuals and neighborhoods by reaffirming that insured depository institutions must serve the\ncommunities in which they are chartered to do business. 1 In 1981, the Board of Governors asked each\nReserve Bank to appoint a Community Affairs Officer, and from there, the Fed built a function to provide\ntechnical training and support to depository institutions to help bolster compliance with the CRA.\n\nOver time, the Fed’s interest and activities in community development have grown. Partly this reflects\nthe desire to promote consistent implementation of the CRA across the nation, recognizing that, to do this,\nwe need a good understanding of all of the interrelated challenges facing lower-income communities. But\nanother motivation is the fact that our community development activities at the local level, facilitated by\nthe Fed’s regional structure, have allowed us to gain valuable reconnaissance on the economic health of\npeople and communities across our Districts. Even if the Federal Reserve, along with other federal\nregulators, were not charged with implementing the CRA, our community development activities would\nremain an important component of the Fed’s work because they help us monitor the health of the\neconomy across various segments of the population and geographies, which is an important component of\nsetting appropriate monetary policy.\n\nThe financial crisis and ensuing recession provide a vivid illustration of this interconnectedness and the\nimportance of local engagement. As the housing market slowed and the number of subprime mortgage\ndelinquencies and foreclosures began to rise, the Federal Reserve began monitoring these developments\nmore intensively. No doubt, at the beginning, we underestimated the negative effects that problems\ninitially centered in the subprime mortgage market would ultimately have on the broader economy.\n\n1\n\nFor more on the historical context of the CRA, see Sandra F. Braunstein, “The Community Reinvestment Act,”\ntestimony before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, February 13, 2008.\n\n\f5\nHowever, members of the Fed’s community development staff were already engaged with industry and\nconsumer advocates who were focused on helping troubled borrowers. These staff members were able to\nprovide first-hand knowledge and objective information to Fed policymakers, raising their awareness that\nthe problems were not insignificant. Fed staff with expertise in mortgage markets and housing in the\ncommunity development, economic research, and bank supervision functions were mobilized. Our\nregular contact with local organizations across the country indicated that a lack of data on delinquencies\nand foreclosures was impeding progress. So Federal Reserve staffs across the country began collecting\ndata; they analyzed delinquency and foreclosure trends and helped to evaluate policies and programs\naimed at aiding troubled borrowers and addressing the growing problem of foreclosures. Ohio had one of\nthe highest foreclosure rates in the country, coupled with high numbers of vacant and abandoned\nproperties, so the Cleveland Fed was particularly active in this analysis, working with government\nagencies, financial institutions, and community-based organizations – perhaps with many of you in this\nroom. 2\n\nWhile our community development work gives us insights into the economic health of communities,\nwhich helps inform our monetary policy, monetary policy is not the right tool to address the many\nchallenges facing lower-income households and neighborhoods. What monetary policy can do is promote\ngreater economic stability overall by focusing on price stability and maximum employment, and thereby\nlower the risk of recessions, which disproportionately harm the more vulnerable parts of our society. But\nan interconnected set of factors determines the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods,\nincluding access to credit, capital, and financial services, affordable housing, workforce development, job\ntraining and education, health and wellness services, and infrastructure, including transportation and\nbroadband services. While monetary policy cannot address issues such as income inequality, the longer-\n\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s 2008 annual report essay, “Breaking the Housing Crisis Cycle,” focused on the magnitude of\nthe housing crisis in the region and the nation and discussed potential policy responses.\n\n\f6\nrun issues of workforce development, or the distributional effects of globalization and technological\nchange, other government policies and private-public programs, if they are well-designed, can. This is\nwhere the Federal Reserve’s community development work comes in.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The How\nThe Fed is not the entity that can set these policies or implement these programs, but the Fed is\ncommitted to increasing knowledge about the economic challenges facing low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds and communities and helping to identify effective policies and best practices to address these\nchallenges. I believe the structure of the Federal Reserve System gives us some advantages in doing this\nwork. In particular, our regional structure insulates us from political influence, so we are viewed as a\ntrusted and objective party. We hold that public trust very dearly, and always strive to maintain our\ncredibility. That is why we aim to conduct our research with the utmost rigor and the highest quality\nstandards, looking objectively at all sides of an issue and potential solutions. Our reputation for\nobjectivity helps us play an important role as a “convener” and, I would add, as a “catalyst.” We all know\nthat the issues facing lower-income regions in a dynamic economy such as ours are complex ones. Many\nof the solutions will be complex as well. At the very least, they will take committed and collaborative\nactions from various stakeholders, and probably some compromises, too.\n\nThe Fed plays a useful role here by convening forums and workshops with the groups needed to effect\nchange. Such forums foster a common understanding of the magnitude and breadth of the issues, allow\nbest practices to be shared, spur quicker dissemination of insights, and can catalyze action that ultimately\nleads to more effective economic policies and programs. The Fed values the relationships we have built\nwith key organizations working to improve the economic outcomes of people in communities across the\ncountry. I have had the privilege of meeting with many dedicated community development practitioners\nand engaging with people who live and work in lower-income areas in our region. I have seen first-hand\nthat the information my Fed colleagues and I glean from such interactions has informed our research and\n\n\f7\nhas helped us learn about the promising programs many of you lead throughout the country. For\nexample, the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Reserve Banks’ project to identify “opportunity\noccupations,” those occupations that pay higher than the median wage but don’t require a bachelor’s\ndegree, grew out of our hearing repeatedly from various parties of the need for these types of jobs. 3 We\nhave also seen that practitioners and policymakers have used Federal Reserve research, so there are\nimportant synergies to be gained by actionable research coupled with convening meetings and workshops.\n\nJust as getting all stakeholders together can help yield more effective solutions, the Federal Reserve\nSystem recognizes that Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors can achieve more by working together\non community development issues without sacrificing the focus each Reserve Bank has on particular\nissues affecting its individual District. The System-wide approach allows us to deploy resources more\nefficiently, to develop more in-depth expertise that can be shared, to identify those issues that loom large\nin many parts of the country, and to track emerging economic developments in a way that we couldn’t if\nwe weren’t regionally distributed and didn’t work together.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The What\nI would like to spend the remainder of my time discussing some of the Fed’s community development\nwork. As I mentioned earlier, many factors influence the economic vitality of households and\nneighborhoods, including access to credit and capital workforce development, affordable housing,\ninfrastructure, and health services. There is ongoing research and engagement across the Federal Reserve\nSystem in each of these topic areas – far too much work to summarize in my remaining time. One focus\nhas been on areas of concentrated poverty, which exist in both urban and rural settings. The Minneapolis\nFed’s Center for Indian Country Development; the Dallas Fed’s Colonias project on neighborhoods along\n\n3\n\n“Identifying Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies,” Federal Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta, September 2015.\n\n\f8\nthe U.S.-Mexico border; the St. Louis Fed’s Delta Communities Initiative, which is working with\ndistressed communities across the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta regions; the efforts of the Atlanta,\nCleveland, and Richmond Feds in Appalachia; and the joint efforts among several Reserve Banks in the\nindustrial heartland and older cities have pointed to some key issues affecting the economic vitality of the\npeople and communities in these areas. Workforce development is one of those issues that span regions,\nand so considerable efforts are underway across the Federal Reserve System and with our community\npartners to find solutions to ensure that people have access to the education and skill-development\nprograms needed to ensure that they can be productive members of the modern workforce. 4 Our activities\nfocused on workforce development have improved our understanding of the labor market outcomes of\ndifferent groups and communities and of labor markets more broadly; this work has obvious spillovers to\nthe Fed’s need to understand labor market conditions when setting monetary policy.\n\nOf course, to make progress on any of the issues facing distressed communities you need to be able to\nmeasure the scale of the problems. In addition, you need to ensure that those with funds and an interest in\neffecting solutions are brought together with those with effective programs in need of financing. Let me\ndiscuss some of the contributions the Fed is making in these two areas.\n\nProviding data and data tools\nAs was clear during the foreclosure crisis, inadequate data can be a sizable impediment to understanding\nchallenges and finding solutions. So the Fed’s community development function is providing data and\nanalytical tools to the public. These disaggregated data help us understand emerging issues that can be\nmasked by looking only at aggregate statistics. The Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey is a good\n4\n\nFor a description of some of the community development efforts underway in the Federal Reserve System, see\nJanet L. Yellen, “Addressing Workforce Development Challenges in Low-Income Communities,” remarks at\nCreating a Just Economy, the 2017 annual conference of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition,\nWashington, D.C., March 28, 2017, and Lael Brainard, “Why Opportunity and Inclusion Matter to America’s\nEconomic Strength,” remarks at the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute Conference, sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN, May 22, 2017.\n\n\f9\nexample. 5 This survey started as individual surveys conducted by a few Reserve Banks, but under the\nNew York Fed’s leadership, it became a common national survey in 2016, with more than 15,000 small\nbusiness respondents. This survey could not have been carried out without the 400 organizations,\nincluding chambers of commerce and economic development agencies, that partnered with the Fed to\ngather responses. The results allow us to track access to credit from several individual segments of the\nsmall business population, including minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, startups,\nmicroenterprises, and the self-employed.\n\nAnother example of data gathering is the Board of Governors’ Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking, which has been conducted since 2013 and provides data to help track the economic\nwell-being of households. 6 The survey contains information on access to credit, retirement savings,\nstudent loans, and other evidence on how households are faring financially.\n\nA third example is the data provided by the Dallas Fed and Cleveland Fed on broadband access.\nBroadband internet access has become a necessity in our connected world, allowing for higher income\ngrowth rates and lower unemployment rates in areas with higher adoption rates. 7 But both access and\nadoption rates vary with household income levels, with a considerably smaller proportion of lower-\n\n5\n\nFor the 2016 results and further information on the survey, see the Federal Reserve Small Business Credit Survey.\n\n6\n\nFor further information about the survey and the 2016 results, see the Board of Governors’ Survey of Household\nEconomics and Decisionmaking.\n7\n\nA recent report issued by Cornell University found that nonmetropolitan counties that have had a high rate of\nbroadband adoption have also experienced higher growth in median household income and lower rates of job loss\nthan similarly situated counties that have had low broadband adoption. (See Brian Whitacre, Roberto Gallardo, and\nSharon Strover, “Broadband’s Contribution to Economic Health in Rural Areas,” Issue Number 64, Research and\nPolicy Brief Series, Community and Regional Development Institute, Department of Development Sociology,\nCornell University, February 2015.)\n\n\f10\nincome households using broadband at home compared to higher-income households. 8 There is also wide\ndisparity in broadband access, especially access to higher-speed broadband, between rural and urban\nareas, putting the growth prospects of rural areas at a disadvantage. Recent revisions to the CRA rules\nrecognize that a reliable communications infrastructure, such as broadband internet service, can help to\nrevitalize or stabilize underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income areas. So depository institutions now\nreceive credit for investing in this infrastructure for the purposes of meeting the CRA requirement of\nserving the needs of low- and moderate-income communities. 9 The Dallas Fed produced a\ncomprehensive guide for financial institutions to help them understand how broadband can benefit the\ncommunities they serve and how their planned investments could qualify for CRA credit. The guide\nincludes several tables and maps, based on U.S. Census bureau data, measuring broadband access at the\nnational level and in the Dallas Fed’s District. 10 The Cleveland Fed has provided similar data from the\nFederal Communications Commission for the Fourth District. 11\n\nIn addition to data, the Federal Reserve is providing tools to help the public use the data. Let me mention\nthree of these. Last month, the Philadelphia and Cleveland Feds released the Home Mortgage Explorer\ntool. 12 Based on Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, this tool allows users to track trends in mortgage\nlending at the national, state, metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan levels, by purpose and type of loan.\n\n8\n\nA 2013 federal government report indicated that fewer than half of households with incomes below $25,000 a year\nuse broadband at home, compared with over 90 percent of households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000.\n(See “Four Years of Broadband Growth,” Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Economic\nCouncil, The White House, Washington, D.C., June 2013.)\n9\n\nSee page 48510 of the Federal Register notice, “Community Reinvestment Act; Interagency Questions and\nAnswers Regarding Community Reinvestment; Guidance,” Federal Register, vol. 81, no. 142, Monday, July 25,\n2016, Rules and Regulations.\n10\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, “Closing the Digital Divide: A Framework for Meeting CRA Obligations,”\nJuly 2016, Revised December 2016.\n11\n\nSee Shruthi Arvind and Kyle Fee, “Broadband and High-speed Internet Access in the Fourth District,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, December 8, 2016.\n12\n\nFor further information, see the Home Mortgage Explorer.\n\n\f11\nInformation is provided on the reasons a loan application was denied and on applicant and neighborhood\nincome.\n\nRecently, the Chicago Fed launched the Peer City Identification Tool. This tool allows a user to easily\ndetermine which cities, among the 300 included in the data set, are experiencing similar trends or\nchallenges along four key themes: racial and socioeconomic composition; economic change and labor\nmarket conditions; demographic and economic outlook; and housing affordability, tenure, and housingstock age. 13 The themes were determined based on areas of concern cited by city leaders in more than\n200 interviews across 10 cities. Users of the tool can determine which cities among the 300 are\nconsidered peers with respect to the particular theme, and the values of the theme’s indicators for each of\nthe peer cities. The underlying data on the 28 indicators for all 300 cities are downloadable so people can\nuse the data in other analyses as well.\n\nA third data tool, Following the Money, was created by the Atlanta and Philadelphia Feds, based on data\nfrom the Foundation Center. 14 Foundation grants are becoming a more important source of funding for\ncommunity development, and this tool allows the user to see the distribution of foundation grants across\n366 metropolitan areas across the U.S., or for a user-defined selection from among these metro areas.\nData on the grant volume per capita, on the types of activities the grants are funding, and on the number\nof community and economic development nonprofits in the metro areas are provided.\n\n13\n\nThe 300 cities included in the tool’s data set are those that had a population of at least 50,000 in 1960. City peer\ngroups are determined using cluster analysis based on a set of indicators for each theme. For example, according to\nthe tool, Trenton, New Jersey, and East St. Louis, Illinois, among other cities, are housing peers of Cleveland. The\nthree cities are similar in that a large share of their housing stock was built pre-1980, and they share similar vacancy\nrates, home value to income ratios, homeownership rates, and share of renter households that spend more than 30\npercent of their gross monthly income on rent each month. For further information on the tool and its construction,\nsee the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s Peer City Identification Tool.\n14\n\nFor more information on this tool, see Following the Money.\n\n\f12\nImproving access to funding\nAs the Following the Money tool reminds us, once potential solutions for challenges affecting lowerincome communities are found, those solutions need to secure funding. While the Federal Reserve cannot\nmake those investments, the Fed’s community development function has been working to improve access\nto credit and capital by helping to match funders to those programs and projects that research has shown\nto be effective in helping low- and moderate-income households and communities. The Dallas Fed’s\nwork on broadband and the CRA fits this theme by giving banks guidance in determining which\nbroadband projects are CRA-eligible.\n\nAnother very good example is the Boston Fed’s Working Cities Challenge, which began in 2013. 15\nBoston Fed research on small and mid-sized cities that lost manufacturing employment found that\n“resurgent cities,” meaning those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree\nof leadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private\ncitizens, corporations, and government. 16 Informed by this research and designed in partnership with the\nBoston Fed’s network of community development stakeholders, the Working Cities Challenge is a grant\ncompetition aimed at strengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help low-income areas.\nEligible cities can make one proposal for an idea or program that will unite the public, private, and\nnonprofit sectors, and community members in improving the lives of low- and moderate-income people in\nan enduring way. There are four rounds underway – two in Massachusetts, one in Rhode Island, and one\nin Connecticut – with $10 million in funding to be awarded. In a related effort, the San Francisco Fed is\nnow engaged with the Strong, Prosperous, and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC), which is\nmodeled on the Working Cities Challenge.\n\n15\n16\n\nFurther information on the Boston Fed’s Working Cities Challenge is available on its website.\n\n“Reinvigorating Springfield’s Economy: Lessons from Resurgent Cities,” Public Policy Discussion Paper No. 096, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 1, 2009.\n\n\f13\nMy last example of a successful Federal Reserve effort enabling better access to funding is the Kansas\nCity Fed’s Investment Connection program. 17 In their discussions with the Kansas City Fed, banks had\nindicated they were having trouble identifying CRA-eligible investment opportunities in their service\nareas, and community leaders were saying they were having trouble getting funding. Seeing a potential\nopportunity to improve the situation, the Kansas City Fed created the Investment Connection program.\nUnder the program, community and economic development organizations in the District can have project\nproposals pre-screened by Kansas City Fed staffers to determine whether they are CRA-eligible, and then\nget a chance to pitch their proposals to potential funders, including banks and foundations. So far, the\nKansas City Fed has facilitated connections between nearly 60 community organizations and almost 100\nfunders. Given the regional structure of the Federal Reserve System, a successful program like this one\ncan now potentially be expanded into other regions.\n\nConclusion\nI hope that this review of “the why, the how, and the what” of the Federal Reserve System’s community\ndevelopment efforts has been helpful. I have the privilege of chairing the committee that oversees the\ncommunity development efforts at the Federal Reserve Banks. I can assure you that the professionals in\nthe community development function at the Fed are dedicated to this work and realize that little could be\naccomplished without the productive relationships and partnerships they have with the many groups\nrepresented in this room, including government agencies, financial institutions, foundations, academia,\nresearch centers, and community-based organizations. Going forward, the Fed will continue to leverage\nthe benefits from its regional structure. This structure allows the Reserve Banks and the Board of\nGovernors to uncover common issues and find solutions for the challenges facing low- and moderateincome communities and individuals across the country while allowing each Reserve Bank to remain\n\n17\n\nFurther information on the Kansas City Fed’s Investment Connection program is available on its website.\n\n\f14\nfocused on the particular needs in its specific region.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nEconomic Club of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, MN\nMay 18, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Economic Club of Minnesota for the opportunity to speak today. In looking at your website, I\nnoticed a long list of distinguished speakers, including many from the Federal Reserve and other central\nbanks around the world. I also discovered that John Surma, former chairman and CEO of U.S. Steel and\ncurrent chair of the Cleveland Fed’s Board of Directors, has addressed your group. And with my current\ncolleague Neel Kashkari and former colleague, friend, and fellow opera lover Chris Cumming here, I feel\na connection and I am honored to participate. Today, I will discuss my current outlook for the economy\nand my views on monetary policy. I will also talk about some longer-run issues facing the economy. Of\ncourse, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion will celebrate its eighth birthday next month – that’s 56 in dog years – which is\nlong by historical standards. Of course, expansions don’t die from old age and there is no reason to think\nthat this one cannot continue. In fact, one of my focuses as a monetary policymaker is to set policy to\nmeet and maintain our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. Doing so will\nhelp promote continued expansion.\n\nThe expansion got off to a slow start from a very weak place in the aftermath of the Great Recession. But\nthe fact that the expansion has endured through a variety of economic shocks is a testament to the U.S.\neconomy’s resiliency. First quarter readings on real activity were soft, but it is not unusual to see\nvariability in the monthly and even the quarterly data. To get a reading on where the economy is headed,\nit is important to smooth through the volatility and focus on underlying fundamentals. I believe the\nfundamentals supporting continued expansion are sound. These fundamentals include accommodative\nmonetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets, and increases in personal\n\n\f2\nincome that have come from the continued strength in labor markets. In addition, although geopolitical\nrisks remain, economic conditions in our global trading partners have improved.\n\nOf course, we always need to view things with humility: economics is not an exact science, nothing is\ncertain, and there are upside and downside risks to my forecast. With that in mind, my modal outlook is\nthat over the next year, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longer-run trend,\nwhich I estimate to be about 2 percent, and the unemployment rate will remain below its longer-run level,\nwhich I estimate to be about 5 percent. With appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the\nconditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation. Let me expand a bit on growth, employment, and inflation, before turning to monetary policy.\n\nEconomic growth\nDespite the strong fundamentals, output growth in the first quarter was weak. I am not taking much of a\nsignal about future growth from that reading. Some of the weakness reflects transitory factors like\nreduced spending on energy because of unseasonably warm weather early in the year. There is also likely\nwhat economists call residual seasonality in the data, meaning that even though the data are adjusted for\nseasonal effects, we’ve seen a pattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter\nfollowed by stronger growth in subsequent quarters.1 I anticipate we’ll see stronger consumer spending,\nwhich makes up about two-thirds of output, over the rest of the year. Readings on consumer sentiment\nand confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing. Moreover,\nhousehold balance sheets have improved over time. As a result of the Great Recession, households in the\naggregate lost $13 trillion in net worth, made up of financial and housing equity. The deleveraging that\nhouseholds undertook and their increased savings, coupled with the cumulative increase in stock and\n1\n\nSee Kurt G. Lunsford, “Lingering Residual Seasonality in GDP Growth,” Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, Number 2017-06, March 28, 2017, and Glenn D. Rudebusch, Daniel Wilson, and Tim Mahedy,\n“The Puzzle of Weak First-Quarter GDP Growth,” Economic Letter, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 201516, May 18, 2015.\n\n\f3\nhouse prices over the expansion, mean that households as a group have recovered that loss and have\nadded another $25 trillion in net worth to their balance sheets. In the aggregate, households’ housing\nequity is now back to what it was at the peak, as the housing sector continues to gradually improve.\n\nDemand for housing is rising and is outpacing supply in some places. This mismatch between supply and\ndemand is putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at about a 6 percent pace, on\naverage, nationally, and are driving the increase in homeowners’ housing equity. It shouldn’t be too\nsurprising that the housing recovery has been a moderate one. The housing boom and crash are not\nsomething anyone wants repeated. Households have been careful not to take on more mortgage debt than\nthey can handle, and lenders are extending credit, but to those with good credit quality. Overall, I expect\nactivity in the sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nBusiness activity and investment are starting to strengthen after being quite subdued last year and through\nmuch of the expansion. Part of the weakness reflected the sizable drop in oil prices from mid-2014\nthrough early 2016, which led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers.\nAt the same time, the 20 percent appreciation of the dollar hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent\non exports. Since then, conditions supporting business spending have improved. Over the past year, oil\nprices have been roughly stable near $50 a barrel and the dollar has appreciated only modestly. In\naddition, the firming in global economic growth has increased demand for U.S. exports. We’ve seen a\npickup in the mining sector and in manufacturing, and the data on new orders suggest investment in\nequipment will expand further. Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District tell us that even if some of the\nproposals for tax reform, health insurance, infrastructure spending, and regulatory changes are delayed,\nthey expect the business environment to remain positive and that this will translate into further increases\nin business spending and hiring.\n\n\f4\nLabor markets\nIn fact, labor markets have been strengthening for some time and I expect that to continue. In 2016, the\neconomy added over 2.2 million jobs, an average of about 187,000 jobs per month. Over the first four\nmonths of this year, firms sustained that pace, with an average monthly gain of 185,000 jobs. This is a\nslower pace than in the two expansions in the 1980s and 1990s.2 But it’s important to remember that\nbecause trend labor force participation is lower, trend employment growth is also lower. Indeed,\nestimates of trend employment growth range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on the\nprecise assumptions one makes about the participation rate. So the recent employment growth numbers\nare well above trend.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has moved down. It stood at 4.4 percent in April,\nless than half its peak of 10 percent in late 2009 and at the lowest reading achieved in the previous\nexpansion. Given the progress that has been made in the labor market, payroll job growth is likely to\nslow from its current pace, but I expect it will be sufficient to keep the unemployment rate below my\nestimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nOther gauges of the under-utilization of labor have also improved significantly. For example, the broader\nU6 measure of unemployment, which includes the number of part-time workers who would rather work\nfull time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, has fallen to 8.6\npercent, its lowest level since late 2007. The labor force participation rate has been essentially stable for\nthe past three years. This is another sign of labor market strength because, based on demographics, the\ntrend in the participation rate is downward.\n\n2\n\nPayroll job gains averaged nearly 230,000 per month over the December 1982-July 1990 expansion and about\n200,000 per month over the April 1991-March 2001 expansion.\n\n\f5\nThe strengthening in the labor market has led to a gradual acceleration in wages from earlier in the\nrecovery. For some time we have heard from our labor and business contacts across a broad set of\nindustries that firms are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skill occupations and in\nlower-skill jobs. More and more of these firms report they are responding by raising wages and offering\nother benefits to attract and retain workers. Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District expect wage increases\nto average about 3 percent this year, with significantly higher increases expected for highly skilled\nworkers.\n\nOn balance, there has been a sustained cyclical recovery in labor markets since the Great Recession.\nThere are some longer-run structural issues that the country must tackle, such as making sure people have\naccess to the training and development needed for the jobs in the modern economy. But from the\nstandpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address, I believe we have achieved the\nmaximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Consistent with meeting this part of the\nmandate over the longer run, the FOMC has set a goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the yearover-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Most\npeople understand why high inflation is a problem: it erodes the purchasing power of their money. But\ninflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead consumers and businesses to delay purchases,\nthereby slowing the economy, and it increases debt burdens.\n\nFor some time, inflation has been running below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, but over the past two years,\ninflation has been moving up. Measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation stood at 1.8 percent in\nMarch, up from under 1 percent a year ago.\n\n\f6\nI expect there will be some variability in the monthly data, but in determining where inflation is relative\nto our goal, we need to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both those below and those\nabove our goal, and focus on where inflation is headed and where it will be maintained on a sustained\nbasis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, but we know\nthat we can’t keep actual inflation at 2 percent at each point in time; inevitably shocks hit the economy\nand the inflation numbers move, sometimes below our goal and sometimes above. Still, we want to take\nactions to keep inflation from running either persistently below or persistently above 2 percent. In other\nwords, our goal is symmetric – it isn’t a ceiling – and we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on a\nsustainable basis.\n\nWith appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained\nreturn over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. These conditions include the\nfirming in inflation that we’ve seen over time, reasonably stable inflation expectations, continued strength\nin the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nMonetary Policy\nWhen I say “appropriate adjustments in monetary policy” I mean those that will sustain the expansion so\nthat our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. As I\nmentioned, in my view, we have met the maximum employment part of our mandate and inflation is\nnearing our 2 percent goal.\n\nIf economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in\nthe federal funds rate will be needed. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate\nby one-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent, and two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to maintain\nthis range. Both decisions are consistent with the gradual upward path of interest rates that the\nCommittee has indicated for some time is likely to be appropriate. This upward policy path will help\n\n\f7\nprolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that\ncould arise if the economy is allowed to overheat. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to financial\nstability should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a\nsearch for yield. It will put monetary policy in a better position to address whichever risks, whether to the\nupside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nGiven my outlook, I don’t believe that removing accommodation calls for an increase in the fed funds rate\nat each meeting, but I do anticipate more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past two years. In\naddition, as we continue to make progress on our goals, I think that it’s important for the FOMC to\nremain very vigilant against falling behind, especially given the low level of interest rates and the large\nsize of our balance sheet. We know that monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable\nlags, so policy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. If we delay taking further\nnormalization steps for too long and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor market becomes\nunsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up steeply, we could\nrisk a recession. This is a bad outcome that disproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our\nsociety.\n\nIn addition to removing accommodation by raising interest rates, we also have to consider the Fed’s\nbalance sheet. To address the financial crisis and Great Recession, the FOMC undertook several\nprograms to purchase longer-maturity assets. These purchases aimed at putting downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates once the FOMC’s traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to\neffectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet has grown from nearly $900 billion\nin assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from mainly short-term\nTreasury securities to agency mortgage-backed securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\n\f8\nCurrently, the FOMC is continuing to reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and principal\npayments from agency securities, essentially maintaining the balance sheet at its very large size. But\nnormalizing the stance of policy also means taking steps to normalize the balance sheet. As indicated in\nthe minutes of our March meeting, the FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, including when and\nhow best to implement a change in reinvestments.3 Such a change should be done in a way that allows\nfor a gradual and predictable reduction in the Fed’s asset holdings so that over time the balance sheet is\nreduced to the smallest size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.4\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our\nreinvestment policy this year, with clear communication in advance about how we plan to implement the\nchange. My preference is that once we decide on a plan, we stay with it; the fed funds rate should be our\nmain tool for responding to changes in the outlook during normal times, with purchases of\nlonger-term assets reserved for nontraditional times, times when we have lowered our policy rate to near\nzero and we need to add more monetary policy stimulus because of a deterioration in economic and\nfinancial conditions. Ending reinvestments and beginning the journey toward a smaller balance sheet\ncomposed mainly of Treasury securities will be a welcome acknowledgment that the economy has entered\nnormal times and policy is transitioning back to normal, too.\n\nIt’s important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and because of that,\nmonetary policy is not pre-set. In March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its\neconomic and policy path projections.5 These are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers\nthat there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in\n\n3\n\nThe Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017, pp. 2-3.\n\n4\n\nSee “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014.\n\n5\n\nSee the confidence band charts in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of the Minutes of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017.\n\n\f9\nhow it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook\nindeed materially change.\n\nLonger-Run Issues\nAstute listeners will have noticed that I didn’t tell you how large the balance sheet will be or how high the\nfed funds rate will be once we complete normalization. That is, I haven’t told you the end points. To\nanswer those questions, we need to consider some longer-run issues.\n\nMonetary policy implementation framework\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, we do know it will be larger than it was prior to the\nfinancial crisis for the simple reason that the public’s demand for currency is rising over time. But the\nbalance sheet will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much smaller depends on\nhow the FOMC implements monetary policy in the future.6 Before the crisis, the FOMC kept the supply\nof bank reserves scarce. Making small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries,\nallowed the FOMC to ensure that the market-clearing interest rate at which banks lend reserves to each\nother overnight, the fed funds rate, was maintained at the FOMC’s target.\n\nBut now, as a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks\nare holding around $2.3 trillion in reserves, and more than $2.1 trillion of this amount is in excess of what\nis required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the\nfed funds rate, and the FOMC brings the fed funds rate into its target range by adjusting the rate it pays on\nexcess reserves.\n\n6\n\nFor an accessible description of monetary policy implementation frameworks, see Jane E. Ihrig, Ellen E. Meade,\nand Gretchen C. Weinbach, “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach to\nRaising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198.\n\n\f10\nEach of these systems has its strengths, and the FOMC has not yet decided which framework it will use in\nthe long run and, therefore, what the size of the balance sheet will be at the end of the normalization\nprocess.7 However, because it will take several years to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset\nrun-off, the FOMC can end reinvestments before we have decided on the balance sheet’s ultimate size.\n\nEquilibrium fed funds rate\nIn terms of where the fed funds rate will be in the longer run, one needs to consider what policy rate is\nconsistent with maximum employment and stable inflation over the longer run. There is reason to believe\nthat this equilibrium rate is lower now than it used to be. In fact, FOMC participants have been lowering\ntheir estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate over time. For example, in March 2014, the median\nestimate was 4 percent. Now it is 3 percent. The equilibrium rate is determined by the long-run rate of\nthe growth of consumption and, therefore, of output. So where the fed funds rate will be after\nnormalization depends on the longer-run potential growth rate of the economy.\n\nPotential growth and productivity growth\nThe key determinants of the economy’s longer-run growth rate are structural productivity growth – how\neffectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output – and labor force growth.\nOver the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business\nsector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire expansion it has\naveraged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen over the prior two\nexpansions. Some of the slowdown in productivity growth likely reflects the difficulty in measuring\nproductivity in the service sector. Some of the slowdown is likely cyclical, reflecting persistent effects of\n\n7\n\nFor discussions of the pros and cons of different monetary policy implementation frameworks, see George A.\nKahn, “Monetary Policy Under a Corridor Operating Framework,” Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, Fourth Quarter 2010; Todd Keister, “Corridors and Floors in Monetary Policy,” Liberty Street\nEconomics, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, April 4, 2012; and Ben S. Bernanke, “Should the Fed Keep its\nBalance Sheet Large?” Brookings Institution Blog, September 2, 2016.\n\n\f11\nthe Great Recession, which has retarded investment spending. As the expansion continues and\ninvestment expands, it is reasonable to assume that the cyclical impediments will abate and we’ll see\nsomewhat stronger productivity growth. But structural factors are likely weighing on productivity\ngrowth, as well.\n\nOne such factor is a reduced level of economic dynamism. An enviable aspect of the U.S. economy\naround the globe is our spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor\nmarket flexibility. This dynamism has contributed to economic growth and well-being in the U.S. by\nallowing resources to be reallocated from less-productive to more-productive businesses and allowing\nworkers to move up the career ladder.\n\nBut the degree of dynamism in the U.S. economy has been declining for some time. On average, over the\n1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3 percent of total employment\nper year.8 Since then, this share has fallen to around 2 percent.9 Since 2000, key innovative sectors like\nhigh-tech have seen a sharp slowing in the rate of start-ups.10 The decline in business and labor market\ndynamism is a structural factor that may be contributing to the slowdown we’ve seen in productivity\ngrowth.11\n\nLabor force growth, the other key determinant of long-run economic growth, is projected to be\nconsiderably slower than it has been in recent decades. In the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2-1/2\n\n8\n\nSee John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Who Creates Jobs? Small Versus Large Versus\nYoung,” Review of Economics and Statistics 95 (May 2013), pp. 347-361.\n9\n\nMy calculations are based on the firm age table from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics, Firm\nCharacteristics Data Tables (http://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data_firm.html).\n10\n\nSee John Haltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” paper\nwritten for the Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth conference, August 2015.\n11\n\nHaltiwanger (2015), p. 9.\n\n\f12\npercent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered the work force. Labor force growth\nhas slowed since then, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over 2010-2016. Demographic\nfactors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, suggest slow growth at about that\npace will continue.12 So, longer-run output growth will likely remain below the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate\nseen over the 1980s and 1990s.13\n\nMy own estimate is that longer-run growth will be about 2 percent, but I acknowledge that such estimates\nhave wide confidence bands around them and economists hold different views about the future growth\nprospects of the U.S. economy.14,15 The difference in views largely stems from different assessments of\nthe prospects for investments in technology and human capital.\n\nNew technologies\nThose pessimistic about the future don’t expect to get large productivity gains from today’s innovations\nsuch as robotics, artificial intelligence, and computers, and believe that technological advances have been\nslowing since the 1970s. Other observers note that it is very difficult to predict where future technology\nis going, and they are much more optimistic that computerization, nanotechnology, genome mapping, and\n\n12\n\nAccording to the latest available projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that, as baby boomers\nretire, annual growth in the labor force over 2014-2024 will average 1/2 percent. See U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, Economic Projections – 2014-24, December 8, 2015, Table 1.\n13\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office currently estimates that potential GDP growth averaged 3.4 percent per year\nover 1982-1990 and 3.3 percent per year over 1991-2001; it projects that potential growth will average 1.8 percent\nper year over 2017-2027. See Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027,\nJanuary 2017, Table 2.3.\n14\n\nThose pessimistic about the future growth prospects of the U.S. economy include Robert Gordon. (See Robert J.\nGordon, “Secular Stagnation: A Supply-Side View,” American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings 5, May\n2015, pp. 54-59, and Robert J. Gordon, “The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth: Restatement, Rebuttal, and\nReflections,” National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 19895, February 2014.)\n15\n\nOptimists include Joel Mokyr, Barry Eichengreen, Erik Brynjolfsson, and Andrew McAfee. (See Joel Mokyr,\n“The Next Age of Invention,” City Journal, Winter 2014; Barry Eichengreen, “Secular Stagnation: The Long\nView,” American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings 5, May 2015, pp. 66-70; and Erik Brynjolfsson and\nAndrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies,\nNew York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2014.)\n\n\f13\nother advances in biology will have impacts not yet fully harnessed.16 For example, a recent article in The\nNew Yorker describes how machine learning is being used to accurately diagnose malignancies, with the\npotential to displace the doctor as diagnostician – a fundamental change in the practice of medicine.17\n\nChanges in technology with widespread applicability can lead to higher levels of productivity growth and\noutput growth, but because adapting to the changes takes time, it will take longer to see those positive\neffects.18 In fact, the disruption caused by technology can have negative effects at first. Workers need to\nretrain and some industries may be pushed out by the new technology. As the economy adapts,\neventually there are gains, but not all people, industries, and communities will automatically share in the\nbenefits.\n\nHuman capital\nHuman capital and technology are intricately linked. For technology to enhance productivity, workers\nneed to have the abilities and knowledge to apply it. So, technological change can induce higher\ninvestments in human capital. But the reverse is true, too. Investment in human capital may spur\ninvestment in innovation because firms are more likely to develop and adopt a new technology if they are\nmore certain they will be able to hire workers with the requisite skills to use it. Many studies have\ndocumented the importance of investment in human capital to a nation’s economic growth and wellbeing.19 And at the individual level, better education is correlated with higher wages and lower levels of\n\n16\n\nSee Mokyr (2014), and Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014).\n\n17\n\nSee Siddhartha Mukherjee, “A.I. Versus M.D.,” The New Yorker, April 3, 2017.\n\n18\n\nBarry Eichengreen distinguishes between two dimensions of technology: the range of applicability and the range\nof adaptation. A technology that has only a limited range of applicability won’t have a large effect on productivity\nand growth because it is used only in a narrow range of sectors or activities. A technology that requires a large\nrange of adaptation of other processes in the economy will take longer to have a positive effect on productivity and\ngrowth. See Eichengreen (2015).\n19\n\nFor a discussion of educational attainment and its contributions to economic growth, see J. Bradford DeLong,\nClaudia Goldin, and Lawrence F. Katz, “Sustaining U.S. Economic Growth,” in Henry J. Aaron, James M. Lindsay,\nand Pietro S. Nivola, eds., Agenda for the Nation (Washington: Brookings Institution Press, 2003). The importance\n\n\f14\nunemployment. Moreover, research suggests that technological change is driving the rising skill premium\nand is affecting how work is organized. Medium-skill jobs that are more likely to involve routine, nonphysical work are being handled by computers.20 This shift in the distribution of jobs helps to explain the\nwider gap in wages for highly skilled vs. lower skilled workers, and the increasing return to gaining the\neducation required to obtain those skills.\n\nGlobalization\nGlobalization in the form of lower barriers to trade is another phenomenon that influences productivity\ngrowth. Free trade enhances productivity growth by allowing countries to focus resources on their\ncomparative advantage and by spurring competition. Globalization and technological change are linked:\nglobalization allows new technologies to be deployed more broadly and quickly and, by increasing\ncompetition, can drive firms to create and develop new and more productive technologies.\n\nWhile globalization leads to long-run improvements in the standard of living in the aggregate, similar to\ntechnological change, it can be disruptive in the short run as production shifts to the industries in which\nthe country has a comparative advantage and workers in the contracting sectors need to retrain or relocate\nto find jobs.\n\nof education to economic well-being can even be found at the state level. For example, Cleveland Fed researchers\nfound that over a 75-year period, education levels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each\nstate’s per capita income growth. See Paul W. Bauer, Mark E. Schweitzer, and Scott A. Shane, “Knowledge\nMatters: The Long-Run Determinants of State Income Growth,” Journal of Regional Science 52, 2011, pp. 240-255,\nand “Altered States: A Perspective on 75 Years of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005\nAnnual Report.\n20\n\nThe data suggest that since 2000, jobs have become “polarized,” meaning that while high-skill and low-skill\noccupations have seen job growth, medium-skill occupations have experienced job losses. See Daron Acemoglu\nand David Autor, “Skills, Tasks, and Technologies: Implications for Employment and Earnings,” in Handbook of\nLabor Economics, vol. 4B, Orley Ashenfelter and David Card, eds., Amsterdam: Elsevier-North Holland, 2011, pp.\n1043-1171. For an accessible explanation of the polarization hypothesis, see Rob Valletta, “Higher Education,\nWages, and Polarization,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter, 2015-02, January 12, 2015.\nAlso see Valletta (2015) and Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz, “Job Polarization and Rising Inequality in the\nNation and the New York-Northern New Jersey Region,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Current Issues in\nEconomics and Finance 18, 2012.\n\n\f15\nEconomic policy\nMonetary policy cannot affect the economy’s long-term growth rate. But other government policies, if\nthey are well-designed and focused on spurring productive investments in human and physical capital,\nR&D, and innovation, would be helpful, and could, with sufficient time, lead to a somewhat higher\nlonger-run growth rate.21 Policies can also help to ensure that the aggregate longer-term gains from\ntechnological change and globalization are better distributed, and that households, industries, and\ncommunities that are negatively affected are provided with some cushion to help ease the transition.\nPolicies and programs that enable people to gain the skills needed to be productive members of the\nmodern workforce are part of such a cushion.\n\nOn the technology side, in addition to public-private ventures for developing technological innovations, a\ngood case can be made for expanded government support of basic science and R&D, a building block for\nhigher productivity growth. Basic R&D has a public good aspect to it because its benefits can be widely\napplied throughout various parts of the economy, while an individual firm might be deterred from such\ninvestment as it cannot fully capture the returns.\n\nFinally, we should recognize that immigrants make up over 16 percent of the U.S. workforce today.22\nGiven U.S. demographics, immigrants will become an increasingly important source of labor supply for\nthe U.S. This suggests that a well-thought-out immigration policy that attracts labor to the U.S. is also a\nnecessary ingredient to support longer-run growth.\n\nIt is important for the country to tackle these longer-run issues in order to improve the economic health of\nindividuals and communities and to maintain and enhance our future standard of living.\n21\n\nSee the discussion in Loretta J. Mester, “A Serenity Prayer for Monetary Policymakers,” remarks at the Global\nInterdependence Center Central Banking Series, Singapore, February 20, 2017.\n22\n\nSee U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Foreign-Born Workers: Labor Force Characteristics – 2015,” May 19, 2016.\n\n\f16\n\nOne of my favorite composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was known for writing beautiful music but\nhe was also an avid letter writer.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Chicago Council on Global Affairs\nChicago, IL\nMay 8, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Chicago Council on Global Affairs for this opportunity to speak about the economy and\nmonetary policy. I was very pleased to receive this invitation from Michael Moskow. I have known\nMichael for quite a while now, having seen him in action around the FOMC table when he was president\nof the Chicago Fed and I was the director of research at the Philadelphia Fed. Michael personified what’s\nbest about the FOMC’s collegial atmosphere. He was able to explain his thinking, listen to alternative\nviews, and then persuade others about the appropriate path forward. Michael’s last FOMC meeting was\non August 16, 2007. It was the second unscheduled conference call that month and the FOMC discussed\nthe profound deterioration in credit market conditions. Of course, we all know what happened to the\neconomy after that. It is common knowledge that Michael stepped down as Chicago Fed president\nbecause he had reached the official term limit, but I’m now wondering if the timing might also reflect his\nvery keen ability to forecast the future.\n\nAs everyone in this room knows, economic forecasting is both science and art. Today, I will discuss my\noutlook for the economy and my views on monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion turns eight years old next month. It got off to a slow start from a very weak\nplace, but now this expansion is one of the longest on record. While the quarterly pattern has had its\nshare of ups and downs, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on\naverage, over the expansion. The sustainability of the expansion through various economic shocks is a\ntestament to the U.S. economy’s resiliency. While some of the recent readings on real activity have been\nsoft, it is normal to see variability in the monthly and quarterly data.\n\n\f2\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting continued expansion remain sound. These\nfundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household\nbalance sheets, and strength in the labor market that has led to increases in personal income. In addition,\nalthough geopolitical risks remain, global economic conditions have improved. Supported by\naccommodative monetary policy, the recovery in Europe has gained traction, with unemployment rates\ndown and inflation moving up, and the slowdown in the Chinese economy has been more orderly and\nmoderate than what some had feared early last year.\n\nWhile there are upside and downside risks around my forecast, my modal outlook is that over the next\nyear, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longer-run trend, which I estimate to\nbe about 2 percent, and the unemployment rate will move further below its longer-run level, which I\nestimate to be about 5 percent. With appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions\nare in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation.\nLet me put this outlook into context.\n\nEconomic growth\nDespite the strong fundamentals, GDP growth in the first quarter was weak. At this point, I’m not taking\nmuch of a signal about future growth from that reading; there are reasons to think this was a transitory\nslowdown. We’ve seen a pattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter followed\nby stronger growth in subsequent quarters. So even though the data are adjusted for seasonal effects,\nthere appears to be some residual seasonality in the GDP data.1\n\nThe unseasonably warm weather early in the year appears to have weighed on growth, shifting spending\nfrom one quarter to another. For example, after growing strongly in the fourth quarter of last year,\n1\n\nSee Kurt G. Lunsford, “Lingering Residual Seasonality in GDP Growth,” Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, Number 2017-06, March 28, 2017, and Glenn D. Rudebusch, Daniel Wilson, and Tim Mahedy,\n“The Puzzle of Weak First-Quarter GDP Growth,” Economic Letter, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 201516, May 18, 2015.\n\n\f3\nconsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, decelerated in the first quarter in\npart because the warm weather led to lower spending on utilities. It is usually a good idea to average\nthrough some of these ups and down when trying to detect the underlying trend. Readings on consumer\nsentiment and confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing.\nSo the softness in the first quarter hasn’t changed my medium-run outlook, and I expect a rebound in\nconsumer spending over the rest of the year.\n\nThe housing sector continues to gradually improve. Despite a rise in mortgage rates, demand for housing\nis increasing, and in some places, supply has not kept pace with demand. The months’ supply of existing\nhomes on the market has fallen to under four months, its lowest level since early 2005. Business contacts\nreport that, in some cases, it has been difficult to find construction workers to build new supply. The\nmismatch between supply and demand is putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at\nabout a 6 percent pace, on average, nationally.\n\nIt shouldn’t be too surprising that the housing recovery has been a moderate one. The housing boom and\ncrash are not something anyone wants to repeat. It took some time for household balance sheets and the\nlabor market to recover to a point where households were confident enough to take on mortgage debt\nagain. Borrowers are being careful not to take on more debt than they can handle, and lenders are\nextending credit, but to those with good credit quality. Multifamily housing activity has picked up more\nthan single-family housing. Going forward, the mix between multifamily and single-family housing may\ndiffer from what it has been in the past, as both younger people and empty-nesters are drawn to urban\nenvironments, and some prefer to rent rather than buy. Overall, I expect activity in the sector to continue\nto expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nBusiness activity and investment are starting to strengthen after being quite subdued last year and through\nmuch of the expansion. The sizable drop in oil prices from over $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to around\n$30 in early 2016 led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers. The 20\n\n\f4\npercent appreciation of the dollar from mid-2014 to the end of 2015 hurt manufacturers and other firms\ndependent on exports. But since then, conditions supporting business spending have improved. Oil\nprices began to firm in early 2016 and have been roughly stable near $50 per barrel since then, and the\ndollar has appreciated only modestly, on net, over the past year. In addition, the firming in global\neconomic growth has increased demand for U.S. exports.\n\nU.S. business sentiment is at a very high level, but it has not translated into a surge in activity.\nNonetheless, we are starting to see a pickup in business spending, driven by the improvement in\nunderlying economic conditions. This gives me some confidence in positive momentum even if there is\nsome downward adjustment in expectations going forward. Mining activity has increased: the number of\nactive oil drilling rigs remains well below the level seen before the oil price drop, but has roughly doubled\nover the past year. National and regional manufacturing surveys suggest an improvement in activity and\ncapital spending plans even if overall sentiment has been tempered. Even though motor vehicle\nproduction softened in March, manufacturing production was higher in the first quarter compared to the\nfourth quarter and compared to a year ago. This is particularly good news for the Cleveland Fed and\nChicago Fed Districts, which have a higher share of employment in manufacturing compared to the\nnation. Both regions felt the brunt of the cyclical pullback in manufacturing, as well as the longer-run\nshift from manufacturing to services.2 Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District tell us that even if some of\nthe proposals for tax reform, health insurance, infrastructure spending, and regulatory changes are\ndelayed, they expect the business environment to remain positive and that this will translate into further\nincreases in business spending and hiring.\n\nI would welcome a pickup in business investment in plant, equipment, and research and development\nbecause investment is an important factor influencing underlying productivity growth. Structural\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed District includes Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of\nWest Virginia. The Chicago Fed District includes all of Iowa and most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and\nWisconsin. Manufacturing employment is 8.5 percent of total payroll employment in the U.S. and 12 percent of\ntotal payroll employment in these nine states; these states account for 32 percent of U.S. manufacturing\nemployment.\n\n\f5\nproductivity growth – how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output\n– is a key determinant of an economy’s longer-run growth rate, the standard of living of its people, and\nwage growth. And productivity growth depends on factors like investment in human and physical capital\nand R&D that yields innovative products and processes.\n\nOver the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business\nsector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire expansion it has\naveraged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen over the prior two\nexpansions. Some of the slowdown in productivity growth likely reflects the difficulty in measuring\nproductivity in the service sector, including health care, intellectual property, and information technology,\nwhich is becoming a larger share of the U.S. economy. Some of the slowdown is likely cyclical,\nreflecting persistent effects of the Great Recession. Indeed, it took a long time for investment in physical\nand human capital, key determinants of productivity growth, to emerge during this expansion.\n\nAs the expansion continues and investment expands, it is reasonable to assume that the cyclical\nimpediments will abate and we’ll see somewhat stronger productivity growth. This assumption underlies\nmy expectation that longer-run growth will be 2 percent. But, in addition to measurement and cyclical\nissues, structural factors are likely weighing on productivity growth, as well. Monetary policy cannot\naddress these structural issues, but other government policies, if they are well-designed and focused on\nspurring productive investments in human and physical capital, R&D, and innovation, would be helpful,\nand could, with sufficient time, lead to a somewhat higher longer-run growth rate.3\n\nAnother important determinant of long-run growth is growth in the labor force. U.S. demographic\nfactors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, especially if coupled with restrictions\non immigration, suggest that labor force growth will be considerably slower than it has been in recent\n3\n\nSee the discussion in Loretta J. Mester, “A Serenity Prayer for Monetary Policymakers,” remarks at the Global\nInterdependence Center Central Banking Series, Singapore, February 20, 2017.\n\n\f6\ndecades. This means longer-run growth will likely remain lower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over\nthe 1980s and 1990s.4\n\nIndeed, the downward trend in the labor force participation rate is one of the factors we consider when\nassessing the condition of the labor market. So let me discuss labor market developments now.\n\nLabor markets\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 jobs per month on average. Over the\nfirst four months of this year, firms sustained that pace, with a monthly average gain of 185,000 jobs.\nThis is a slower pace than in the two expansions in the 1980s and 1990s.5 But it’s important to remember\nthat because trend labor force participation is lower, trend employment growth is also lower. Indeed,\nestimates of trend employment growth range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on the\nprecise assumptions one makes about labor force participation. So the recent employment growth\nnumbers are well above trend.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has moved down. It stood at 4.4 percent in April,\nless than half its peak of 10 percent in late 2009 and at the lowest reading achieved in the previous\nexpansion. Although payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace given the progress\nthat has already been made in the labor market, I expect the pace will be sufficient to keep the\nunemployment rate below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nOther gauges of the under-utilization of labor have also improved significantly. For example, the broader\nU6 measure of unemployment, which includes the number of part-time workers who would rather work\n4\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office currently estimates that potential GDP growth averaged 3.4 percent per year over\n1982-1990 and 3.3 percent per year over 1991-2001; it projects that potential growth will average 1.8 percent per\nyear over 2017-2027. See Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027, January\n2017.\n5\n\nPayroll job gains averaged nearly 230,000 per month over the December 1982-July 1990 expansion and about\n200,000 per month over the April 1991-March 2001 expansion.\n\n\f7\nfull time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, has fallen to its\nlowest level since late 2007. In addition, the labor force participation rate has been essentially stable for\nthe past three years. So relative to the downward trend, the stability we’ve seen in participation is\nactually another sign of strength in the labor market.\n\nFor much of the expansion, wage growth has been subdued compared to what we’ve experienced in other\nexpansions. Partly this reflects slow productivity growth.6 Still, we have seen a gradual acceleration in\nwages over time as labor market conditions have strengthened. For some time we have heard from our\nlabor and business contacts across a broad set of industries that firms are having trouble finding qualified\nworkers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. More and more of these firms are\nresponding by raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain workers. Contacts in the\nCleveland Fed District expect wage increases to average about 3 percent this year, with significantly\nhigher increases expected for highly skilled workers. These anecdotal reports are showing through to the\nwage data, where measures such as the employment cost index and average hourly earnings have\naccelerated from earlier in the recovery. This is a welcome state of affairs. As one of the characters in\nBeethoven’s opera “Fidelio” sings: “If you haven’t money by you, happiness is hard to find...But when it\njingles round your pockets fate is at your mercy.”\n\nOn balance, we’ve seen a sustained cyclical recovery in labor markets since the Great Recession. There\nare some longer-run structural issues that the country must tackle, such as making sure people have access\nto the training and development needed for the jobs in the modern economy. But from the standpoint of\nthe cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address, I believe we have achieved the maximum\nemployment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\n\n6\n\nAlthough actual wage setting is a complicated process, in economic models of competitive markets, real wages\nreflect the marginal product of workers. For a discussion of wages and their relationship to productivity growth over\nthe expansion, see Roberto Pinheiro and Meifeng Yang, “Wage Growth after the Great Recession,” Economic\nCommentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, March 21, 2017.\n\n\f8\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Consistent with meeting this part of the\nmandate over the longer run, the FOMC has set a goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the yearover-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Most\npeople understand why high inflation is a problem: it erodes the purchasing power of their money. But\ninflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead consumers and businesses to delay purchases,\nthereby slowing the economy, and it increases debt burdens.\n\nFor some time, inflation has been running below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, but over the past two years,\ninflation has been moving up. In March, we saw a decline in readings on consumer price inflation. But\nI’m taking little signal about the future path of inflation from those numbers. They partly reflected some\none-off changes, such as the decline in prices for cell phone service plans, and they came after strong\nreadings in January and February. Measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation stood at 1.8 percent\nin March, up from under 1 percent a year ago.\n\nIn determining where inflation is relative to our goal, we need to look through transitory movements in\nthe numbers, both those below and those above our goal, and focus on where inflation is headed and\nwhere it will be maintained on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily\ndetermined by monetary policy, but we know that we can’t keep actual inflation at 2 percent at each point\nin time; inevitably shocks hit the economy and the inflation numbers move, sometimes below our goal\nand sometimes above. Still, we want to take actions to keep inflation from running either persistently\nbelow or persistently above 2 percent. In other words, our goal is symmetric – it isn’t a ceiling – and we\naim to keep inflation at 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\n\nWith appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained\nreturn over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. These conditions include the\n\n\f9\nfirming in inflation that we’ve seen over time, reasonably stable inflation expectations, continued strength\nin the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAppropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our longerrun goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. In my view, we have met\nthe maximum employment part of our mandate and inflation is nearing our 2 percent goal. Although we\nlive in a high-frequency world, we cannot overreact to transitory movements in incoming data; our\npolicymaking has to focus on what changes in economic and financial conditions imply for the mediumrun outlook and risks around the outlook.7\n\nIf economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in\nthe federal funds rate will be needed. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate\nby one-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent, and last week, the FOMC decided to maintain this\nrange. Both decisions are consistent with the gradual upward path of interest rates that the Committee has\nindicated for some time is likely to be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives, should the\neconomy evolve as anticipated. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It\nwill help avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed\nto overheat and risks to financial stability, should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on\nexcessively risky investments in a search for yield. It will put monetary policy in a better position to\naddress whichever risks, whether to the upside or downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nGiven my outlook, I don’t believe that removing accommodation calls for an increase in the fed funds rate\nat each meeting, but I do anticipate more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past two years. In\n7\n\nSee the discussion in Loretta J. Mester, “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy: Low-Frequency\nPolicymaking in a High-Frequency World,” remarks to the New York Association for Business Economics, New\nYork, NY, April 1, 2016.\n\n\f10\naddition, I think that it’s important for the FOMC to remain very vigilant against falling behind as we\ncontinue to make progress on our goals, especially given the low level of interest rates and the large size\nof our balance sheet. We know that monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags, so\npolicy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. If we delay too long in taking the\nnext normalization step and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor market becomes\nunsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up steeply, we could\nrisk a recession. This is a bad outcome that disproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our\nsociety.\n\nIn addition to removing accommodation by raising interest rates, we also have to consider the Fed’s\nbalance sheet. To address the financial crisis and Great Recession, the FOMC undertook several\nprograms to purchase longer-maturity assets. These purchases aimed at putting downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates once the FOMC’s traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to\neffectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet has grown from nearly $900 billion\nin assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from mainly short-term\nTreasury securities to mortgage-backed securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\nNormalizing the stance of policy also means taking steps to normalize the balance sheet, and the FOMC\nrecognized this need from the very start of using nontraditional tools. Currently, the FOMC is continuing\nto reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and principal payments from agency debt and mortgagebacked securities, essentially maintaining the balance sheet at its very large size. But, as indicated in the\nminutes of our March meeting, the FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, including when and how\nbest to implement a change in reinvestments.8 Such a change should be done in a way that allows for a\n\n8\n\nThe Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017, pp. 2-3.\n\n\f11\ngradual and predictable reduction in the Fed’s asset holdings so that over time the balance sheet is\nreduced to the smallest size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.9\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our\nreinvestment policy this year, with clear communication in advance about how we plan to implement the\nchange. My preference is that once we decide on a plan, we stay with it; the fed funds rate should be our\nmain tool for responding to changes in the outlook during normal times. Because it will take several\nyears to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, we can end reinvestments before we\nhave decided on the ultimate size of the balance sheet. This decision is essentially one about our longerrun monetary policy implementation framework: do we want to operate with scarce banking reserves (the\nso-called corridor system) or abundant reserves (the so-called floor system)?10 Regardless of which\nframework is chosen, the Fed’s balance sheet will be considerably smaller than it is today.\n\nI view the purchase of longer-term assets as a nontraditional tool that should be reserved for\nnontraditional times, times when we have lowered our policy rate to near zero and we need to add more\nmonetary policy stimulus because of a deterioration in economic and financial conditions. Ending\nreinvestments and beginning the journey toward a smaller balance sheet composed mainly of Treasury\nsecurities will be a welcome acknowledgment that the economy has entered normal times and policy is\ntransitioning back to normal, too.\n\nAcknowledging Risks\nIn concluding, it’s important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and\nbecause of that, policy is not pre-set. Policy needs to remain systematic in how it reacts to incoming\ninformation relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook indeed materially change.\n9\n\nSee “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014.\n\n10\n\nThe FOMC has undertaken an extended effort to evaluate different frameworks for implementing monetary policy\nin the long run. See the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, July 28-29, 2015, July 26-27, 2016, and\nNovember 1-2, 2016.\n\n\f12\n\nIn March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its economic and policy path\nprojections.11 These are very good reminders to both the public and to policymakers that there is always a\nlot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. There’s forecast uncertainty because the economy is\nconstantly being buffeted by shocks, data are revised over time, and it isn’t clear which model will best\npredict the future path of the economy.\n\nToday, I view the risks to the real economy and to inflation over the medium run – the time horizon\nrelevant for monetary policy – as roughly balanced and see a gradual reduction in monetary policy\naccommodation as appropriate. I acknowledge that there are geopolitical risks out there, including\ntensions in North Korea and the Middle East, but these aren’t the kinds of risk that preemptive monetary\npolicy action can mitigate. Still, these types of risk need to be recognized when assessing changes in\neconomic and financial conditions. Indeed, some of the recent downward pressure on long-term interest\nrates likely reflects some flight-to-quality flows in the face of rising geopolitical tensions, rather than a\nmaterial re-evaluation of the modal outlook.\n\nIn addition, there remains uncertainty around what fiscal and other economic policies might be\nforthcoming. These include changes to infrastructure spending, regulation, and policies pertaining to\ntaxes, immigration, and trade. When one gauges the effects – both positive and negative – of any\nforthcoming policy changes on the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation over the short,\nmedium, and longer runs, the devil will be in the details in terms of the size, composition, timing, and\nfinancing of such initiatives.\n\nMy view that it is appropriate to continue on our gradual path of monetary policy normalization is not\ndependent on fiscal policy but, instead, is based on my reading of the resiliency in the U.S. economy’s\n11\n\nSee the confidence band charts in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of the Minutes of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017.\n\n\f13\nunderlying momentum and the progress we have made on reaching our monetary policy goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nTenth Annual Risk Conference:\n“Promise and Peril: Managing the Uncertainty of Rapid Innovation and a Changing\nEconomy”\nCo-hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and\nDePaul University’s Center for Financial Services\nChicago, IL\nMarch 30, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and DePaul University’s Center for Financial Services for\ninviting me to participate in this Tenth Annual Risk Conference. A conference series that has lasted a\ndecade has something going for it, and this series is no exception. The first risk conference was held in\n2008, in the midst of an emerging financial crisis, when the deficiencies in risk management and\nmeasurement became all too apparent. I think we have learned a thing or two since then – at least I hope\nwe have. One of those things is that the world is constantly moving and innovating. Financial services is\nno exception. Given the important role that financial services plays in the economy, it behooves all of us –\nproviders, supervisors, regulators, and consumers – to understand the risks that are inherent in the financial\nsystem and to manage those risks effectively so that the benefits of a sound and stable financial system can\nbe realized for all. Although the technological changes affecting the industry are accelerating, we\nshouldn’t let that distract us from the fundamental matter of risk management. While technological change\nmay increase some risks, it also has the potential to improve our methods of assessing risks, and we should\nharness its power.\n\nTechnological change is very apparent in the payments system. This morning, I will focus a large portion\nof my remarks on an initiative that the Federal Reserve is leading to address the rapidly changing\nlandscape in the payments industry in the U.S. This initiative is a collaborative effort between the Fed and\na broad array of private-sector participants, and aims to improve the speed, efficiency, security, and\nubiquity of the U.S. payments system. I am happy to say that the effort has made significant progress and\nthat several important milestones will be reached this year.\n\nBut before I turn to payments, it behooves me to say a little bit about the economy in which the payments\nsystem plays such an important role. I should add that what I say today about payments and about the\neconomy are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f2\nThe Underlying Fundamentals Supporting the Economic Expansion Are Sound\nAt its mid-March meeting, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by one-quarter\npercentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent. This decision was based on the Committee’s view of actual and\nexpected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward our goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. I fully supported this further step on the path of increases in\nthe federal funds rate that the Committee has indicated for some time is likely to be appropriate to achieve\nand maintain our objectives, should the economy evolve as anticipated.\n\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion are sound. Looking\nthrough the quarterly pattern of ups and downs, we find that output has sustained a moderate pace of\nabout 2 percent growth, on average, over the past three years. While growth in the first quarter may come\nin on the weak side, I think this largely reflects transitory factors and residual seasonality in the data, and\nI see favorable fundamentals as supportive of GDP growth over the next year at somewhat above trend,\nwhich I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial\nconditions, improved household balance sheets and income growth, and continued strength in the labor\nmarket.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. This year, that\nstrength has been sustained, with an average increase of 237,000 jobs per month in January and February,\nwell above estimates of trend employment growth.\n\nIn a further sign of strength, as the economy has added jobs, labor force participation has been basically\nstable for the past three years rather than declining like its trend, and the unemployment rate has been\nmoving down. In February, the unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent, less than half of its peak after the\nGreat Recession. Although payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace, given the\nprogress that’s already been made, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the\n\n\f3\nunemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5\npercent over the next two years.\n\nFor a while, inflation has been running below the Fed’s target of 2 percent. But inflation has picked up\nover the past year and is moving in the right direction. There are likely to be monthly variations in the\ninflation numbers as previous changes in energy and import prices roll out of our year-over-year\nmeasures, and current fluctuations roll in. In determining where we are relative to goal, we need to look\nthrough transitory movements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on\nwhere inflation is going on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily\ndetermined by monetary policy, and with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the\nconditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation. Conditions supporting the return to goal include the firmer data on inflation, reasonably stable\ninflation expectations, continued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly\nabove trend.\n\nThe appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our\nlonger-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. If economic\nconditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in the fed\nfunds rate will be needed. My current assessment is that the pace of removal won’t call for an increase in\nthe fed funds rate at each meeting, but it does mean more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past\ntwo years. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a\nbuild-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as\nwell as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on\nexcessively risky investments in a search for yield.\n\n\f4\nAlong with its rate increase, in mid-March the FOMC also announced that it was maintaining its policy of\nreinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and\nagency mortgage-backed securities, essentially maintaining the Fed’s balance sheet at its very large size.\nThe balance sheet grew when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets. The\nFOMC used this nontraditional policy tool to address the Great Recession, once its traditional policy tool,\nthe fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As Chair Yellen mentioned in her press briefing,\nthe FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, but no decisions have been made. If economic\nconditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our reinvestment policy this year. I\nview this as consistent with our principles of policy normalization and our statement that we anticipate\ncontinuing reinvestments “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.”1\nEnding reinvestments is a first step toward reducing the size of the balance sheet and returning its\ncomposition to primarily Treasury securities over time – a welcome acknowledgment that the economy\nand policy are transitioning back to normal.\n\nThe Payments System Is Vital to a Sound Economy\nI don’t think anyone would disagree with the statement that a well-functioning and secure payments\nsystem is vital to a sound economy. Like highways, bridges, railroads, and water treatment plants, the\npayments system is a critical part of the infrastructure of our country. As the nation’s central bank, the\nFederal Reserve has an interest in promoting the macroeconomic and financial stability of our nearly\n$19 trillion economy, and our oversight of the payments system has this in mind. Indeed, everyone in the\ncountry has a stake in a sound payments system. According to the Fed’s latest payments study, in 2015\nconsumers, businesses, and government agencies executed 144 billion noncash, nonwire-transfer\npayments with a value of almost $178 trillion; that’s an average of 550 million payments worth $680\nbillion per working day.2 Because the current system works well, most people have spent little time\n1\n\nSee, “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014, and the FOMC post-meeting\nstatement of March 15, 2017.\n\n\f5\nthinking about the backbone that makes these payments possible and ensures that the payments system is\nreliable and secure.\n\nBut with the changes brought by new technology, more people are seeking new ways to execute\ntransactions, whether it be online or via cell phone, and they want to execute them faster. For example,\nthe U.S. Census Bureau reports that e-commerce sales accounted for about 8 percent of total U.S. retail\nsales in 2016, more than double their share of 10 years ago.3 According to analysis commissioned by the\nFederal Reserve, about a third of consumers and three-quarters of businesses are willing to pay a fee for\npayments that offer faster availability to the payee.4 Demand is also rising for a more efficient way to\nexecute payments across international borders, and to make person-to-person payments. On the supply\nside, we have seen an expanded set of providers, beyond traditional commercial banks, seeking to satisfy\nthis demand for new and faster payments.\n\nOf course, innovation is nothing new. The U.S. has experienced a long history of payments system\ninnovation, including the introduction of ATMs and debit cards, the move from paper checks to check\nimaging and electronic presentment, the introduction of online bill payment with the advent of the\nInternet, and expanded offerings of mobile banking. Some of the enhancements, like check imaging,\nmade the system more efficient, while others, like chip credit and debit cards, made the system more\nsecure. Yet, we have seen an increasingly rapid pace of technological change over the past several years,\nand this is again driving change in the industry. While the current system is working, we have to\n\n2\n\nThese include debit card, credit card, ACH, and check payments. See “The Federal Reserve Payments Study\n2016,” December 28, 2016.\n3\n\nSee U.S. Census Bureau, “Quarterly Retail E-Commerce Sales: 4th Quarter 2016,” February 17, 2017, and the\nadjusted time-series data, “Estimated Quarterly U.S. Retail Sales (Adjusted): Total and E-Commerce.” In this\nreport, e-commerce sales are “sales of goods and services where the buyer places an order, or the price and terms of\nthe sale are negotiated over an Internet, mobile device (M-commerce), extranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)\nnetwork, electronic mail, or other comparable online system. Payment may or may not be made online.”\n4\n\nSee Federal Reserve Financial Services, “Key Themes from Consultation Paper Feedback and End-User\nResearch,” April 2014.\n\n\f6\nrecognize that the evolution of the payments landscape has led to a fragmented patchwork of payment\nvehicles and providers, often lacking interoperability with one another or the ability to combine invoice\ninformation with a payment. The complexity of the payments system, involving incumbent providers,\nnew entrants, and end users, makes it harder to coordinate payments innovations. Platforms for making\npayments, including ACH, check, and credit and debit card systems, are lagging behind the technological\nadvances. The current U.S. payments system has not kept up with the evolving expectations and demands\nof end-user consumers and businesses. Nor has it kept up with developments in other countries that have\ntaken steps to modernize their payments systems. According to the Bank for International Settlements\n(BIS), nearly 20 countries have either implemented or are building systems that offer real-time or nearly\nreal-time payments, available as near as possible to 24 hours, 7 days a week. The role the central bank\nplayed in fostering these systems differs across countries; the roles include catalyst, overseer, and/or\noperator.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Is Taking a Collaborative Approach to Fostering Payments Modernization\nThe role that the Federal Reserve is playing in our payments system initiative is broadly a\nleadership/catalyst role. Assessing the trends in the payments landscape, the Federal Reserve and a\ndiverse set of industry stakeholders have come to agree that the U.S. payments system needs to evolve\nfurther and faster to support the changing nature of commerce, keep pace with the global economy, meet\nthe changing needs of end users, and address new and ongoing threats to security. An improved\npayments system – one that is more efficient and also secure – has several benefits. It will contribute to\npublic confidence, economic growth, and global competitiveness. In addition to meeting customer\ndemand, a modernized payments system could have an added societal benefit by helping the unbanked\nand underbanked join the financial mainstream, thereby receiving its benefits. It could also help lowincome households, small businesses, and others who need to closely manage their finances to gain faster\naccess to their funds.\n\n\f7\nIn 2015, the Federal Reserve Board and Reserve Banks published a paper laying out the strategies and\ntactics that the Federal Reserve is pursuing in collaboration with a broad array of payments system\nstakeholders to facilitate the move to a faster, more efficient, ubiquitous, and secure payments system.5 Of\ncourse, a lot of work was done before the 2015 paper was published. In 2002 and in 2012, the Fed\nundertook gap and opportunity assessments of the payments environment. It sought and received\nconsiderable input from the public on possible improvements to the payments system.6 That work helped\nframe the current initiative that seeks to achieve five outcomes: (1) a payments system that offers a safe\nand faster electronic solution for making a variety of personal and business payments, and one that is\nubiquitous and available on demand; (2) one that is secure and resilient, so the public can have high\nconfidence in it; (3) an efficient payments system that offers better value to consumers and businesses;\n(4) one that allows for cross-border payments in a more convenient, cost-effective, and timely way; and\n(5) a payments system that has been improved via a collaborative process involving a broad array of\npayment participants.7\n\nTo further this work, the Fed has taken a leadership role to spur a private-sector solution that will align\nprivate-sector interests with those of the public. We view this as consistent with our responsibility to\nfoster a well-functioning payments system for the benefit of the public. The Fed believes that\ncomprehensive improvement of the system for making payments end-to-end will require a comprehensive\napproach. It will need collaboration among and actions from a diverse set of payment stakeholders,\nincluding traditional and nontraditional payment providers, technology companies, the government, and\nend-user businesses and consumers. We think this collaboration will encourage ubiquitous access and\nwidespread adoption of new payment-system capabilities, which are keys to success.\n5\n\nSee “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System,” Federal Reserve System, January 26, 2015. This paper\nand other information on the Federal Reserve payments improvement initiative can be found on the website\nFedPaymentsImprovement.org.\n6\n\nSee “Payment System Improvement – Public Consultation Paper,” The Federal Reserve Banks, September 10,\n2013; and “The Future of Retail Electronic Payments Systems: Industry Interviews and Analysis,” Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Staff Study 175, December 2002.\n7\n\nSee “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.”\n\n\f8\n\nNote that the Fed’s initiative is not preempting or competing with other efforts already being undertaken\nby the industry; nor is it halting our efforts to improve the efficiency of the payment services the Fed\nitself provides. For example, late last year, Early Warning announced its Zelle network, a faster payments\nnetwork available to mobile banking customers, and The Clearing House, a large-bank association and\npayments company, is working on a real-time payments system that will be available to all U.S. financial\ninstitutions and is expected to be operable this year.8 Also, last September the Federal Reserve enhanced\nits same-day ACH service, consistent with NACHA’s (formerly, the National Automated Clearinghouse\nAssociation) new rules, which will result in wider usage of this service.9 And the Fed has also adopted\nnew global messaging standards (ISO 20022) for wire and cross-border ACH payments to ensure better\ninteroperability across platforms.\n\nI should note that the Fed’s approach to supporting and guiding the various parties working on improving\nthe payments system differs somewhat from approaches taken in other countries. Perhaps this is not too\nsurprising. For one thing, the number of entities involved in the U.S. payments system is quite large.\nAccording to BIS statistics, in 2015, over 12,000 entities offered payments services to non-banks in the\nU.S., compared to around 160 in Australia and around 360 in the United Kingdom.10 Even if we\nnormalize this by population, the U.S. has many more service providers: 39 per million inhabitants in the\nU.S., compared to under 7 in Australia and under 6 in the U.K. In addition, the Fed does not have the\n8\n\nSee “Early Warning Announces Zelle Network, October 24, 2016, and “The Clearing House to Undertake a MultiYear Effort to Design and Develop a Secure, Real-Time Payment System,” The Clearing House press release,\nOctober 22, 2014; and “Innovative Real-Time Payment System for the U.S. – VocaLink,” The Clearing House press\nrelease, October 26, 2015.\n9\n\nSee “Federal Reserve Board Approves Enhancements to Reserve Banks' Same-day ACH Service,” press release,\nSeptember 23, 2015, “Enhancements to Federal Reserve Bank Same-Day ACH Service,” Federal Register, 80(187),\nSeptember 28, 2015, pp. 58248-58253, and Same-Day ACH Resource Center on the Federal Reserve Bank Services\nwebsite.

Of course, even countries\nthat have officially mandated changes to speed the adoption of more efficient payments systems recognize\nthe important role the industry must play. For example, the Faster Payments Service launched in the U.K.\nin 2008 was implemented by the private sector at the request of the government.11 The New Payments\nPlatform for immediate low-value payments, currently being built in Australia and expected to be\noperational in the second half of this year, was an industry-based solution proposed after the Reserve\nBank of Australia, that country’s central bank, undertook a review of payments innovation and published\nstrategic objectives it expected the payments system to meet.12\n\nConsiderable Progress Has Been Made on the Fed’s Payments System Improvement Initiative\nStakeholder engagement has been better than we might have hoped for. Our Payments Strategy Director,\nGordon Werkema, who oversees the initiative, hails from right here, the Chicago Fed, and has done a\nremarkable job. Two task forces were initiated in 2015 to work toward proposed solutions to our goals.\nIn setting up the task forces, we knew it was important to have the perspectives of the diverse set of\nrepresentatives with an interest in the payments system. The Faster Payments Task Force has over 300\nmembers from eight segments, including small, medium, and large financial institutions; nonbank\nproviders like technology companies; consumer interest organizations; government end users; business\nend users; and other industry segments, including regulators, rules and standards organizations,\nconsultants, and academic institutions.13 The Payments Security Task Force has over 175 members, and\nit, too, includes wide stakeholder representation. These task forces are operating under the direction of\n\n11\n\nSee Fumiko Hayashi, “Faster Payments in the United States: How Can Private Sector Systems Achieve Public\nPolicy Goals?” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Research Working Paper no. 15-03, June 2015.\n12\n\nSee “Strategic Review of Innovation in the Payments System: Conclusions,” Reserve Bank of Australia, June\n2012; and “RBA Core Criteria for a ‘Fast Payments’ Solution,” Reserve Bank of Australia, November 2012.\n13\n\nFor more information, see the Fed’s payments improvement initiative’s website at\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org.\n\n\f10\nsteering committees and have set up a framework for ensuring that task-force decisions and work\nproducts have broad support across members. Several work streams are now underway.\n\nThe Faster Payments Task Force reached an important milestone in February 2016 when the Faster\nPayments Effectiveness Criteria were published.14 This set of criteria is being used to evaluate whether\nproposed alternative approaches would be effective in delivering a safe and ubiquitous faster payments\ncapability. The 36 criteria fall into six categories: ubiquity, efficiency, safety, speed, legal considerations,\nand governance. The criteria were not intended to be a set of minimum requirements, but rather to\ndifferentiate the effectiveness of proposals across many dimensions, recognizing that many times there\nmay be tradeoffs. For example, higher speed might entail lower security unless coupled with a mitigant.\n\nIn the next stage, participants submitted proposed solutions for faster payments. Nineteen proposals have\nprogressed through the review process, with reviews by an independent assessment team and the members\nof the two task forces.\n\nIn an effort to be transparent about the process and the progress being made, in January, the Faster\nPayments Task Force published the first part of its final report, providing an overview of the task force’s\nmission and process, and the motivation for the work given the payments landscape. The second part of\nthe final report will be published this summer. It will provide details of the proposed solutions for faster\npayments that have been evaluated against the effectiveness criteria, as well as a discussion of challenges,\nopportunities, and recommendations to the industry for implementing faster payments solutions.\n\nIt is very important not to think about faster payments separately from secure payments. Indeed, each\nproposed faster payments solution is being assessed in terms of its security, including identity\n14\n\nInformation on the effectiveness criteria is available on the Fed’s payments improvement initiative’s website at\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/faster-payments/effectiveness-criteria/.\n\n\f11\nmanagement, authentication, the security of sensitive information as the payment travels through the\nsystem, the handling of fraudulent or erroneous payments, and the robustness of the system. While the\ntypes of risks need not change with faster payments, some risks might be exacerbated. For example,\nwhile a faster payments system makes funds available to the payee much faster, settlement may still take\nsome time. Deferred settlement means that the payee’s payments system is taking on credit risk until it\ngets the funds from the payer’s payments system. To reduce this risk, some, but not all, of the faster\npayments systems around the world couple real-time or near real-time settlement with faster payments.15\n\nIn addition to considering the security of the future faster payments system, the Secure Payments Task\nForce is also focusing on the security of the current payments system. The task force has mapped existing\nidentity management practices in end-to-end payment flows to help discover ways to improve current\npractices; it has defined guiding principles for protecting sensitive data associated with payments, which\ncould serve as the foundation for building a more comprehensive data-protection framework for the\nindustry; and it has completed an inventory of current industry efforts to share information for fraud and\nrisk prevention. As indicated in the January progress report, the Secure Payments Task Force plans to\nrelease further information on these initiatives later this year.16\n\nThere Is More Work to Be Done\nAs I mentioned, the Faster Payments Task Force will publish the second part of its final report this\nsummer, providing evaluations of the proposed solutions in terms of their effectiveness in providing the\nU.S. with a faster, more efficient, ubiquitous, and secure payments system. But that’s just the start of what\n\n15\n\nSee Committee on Payments and Markets, Bank for International Settlements, “Fast Payments – Enhancing the\nSpeed and Availability of Retail Payments,” November 2016. Also, for a discussion of some of the risks involved in\nfaster payments, see Julius Weyman, “Risks in Faster Payments,” Retail Payments Risk Forum Working Paper,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, May 2016. Weyman studies 15 faster payment schemes and finds that one-third\ninvolved real-time or near real-time settlement.\n16\n\nSee Federal Reserve System, “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System: Progress Report,” January\n2017.\n\n\f12\nneeds to be accomplished to modernize the U.S. payments system. A lot of further work will be needed to\nimplement solutions, and I believe it will require the same high level of collaboration across the many\npayments system stakeholders that has proved to be so important to the progress made to date.\n\nAt the same time, the Federal Reserve System, which has served as a catalyst for this effort, will need to\nconsider what further steps we should take to support payments system modernization. As I mentioned\nearlier, central banks across the globe have played different roles in fostering their countries’ efforts\nregarding faster and secure payments. Some have served as catalysts, others have overseen industry\nefforts, and others have been providers. Today, the Federal Reserve plays all three roles with respect to\npayments. We have been a leader and catalyst for the current initiative, we provide retail and wholesale\npayment services, and we have some supervisory and regulatory oversight responsibility for the payments\nsystem deriving from the fact that a well-functioning and secure payments system plays an important role\nin fostering macroeconomic and financial stability in the public interest.\n\nThe technological change we’ve experienced in recent years isn’t likely to stop, so it seems prudent that we\nshould be working to ensure that our payments system evolves in a productive way. Innovation,\ncompetition, collaboration, broad accessibility, common standards, risk management, and appropriate\nsupervision and regulation – all are important facets of a well-functioning payments system. Indeed, as the\npayments system evolves, I anticipate that how we go about effectively supervising the payments system\nwill need to evolve as well to ensure that the system remains secure, effective, and broadly accessible. As\nnew providers enter the field, we’ll need to focus on the risks rather than on the type of entity providing the\nservice.\n\nOne way in which central banks in several countries are supporting innovation in payments systems is by\nproviding a “regulatory sandbox.” Such a sandbox allows private-sector firms to test out innovative\nproducts, services, business models, or methods of delivery in a real-life environment, with some reduction\n\n\f13\nin full regulatory requirements but with appropriate safeguards for consumers and the financial system in\nplace during the experiments. The U.K. was the first country to provide such a sandbox in 2016, and\nseveral other countries, including Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore, also offer sandboxes.17\nRegulatory sandboxes have the potential to encourage more competition and faster, more effective\ninnovation in the payments system, by allowing new ideas to be tried out, to be made more effective\nthrough experimentation, and to be designed to better comply with consumer protections and other\nregulatory requirements. Even if the tested ideas aren’t brought to market, finding out early on that an idea\nwon’t work would seem to be very valuable information. The industry seems to have viewed the\nintroduction of the sandboxes favorably. For example, the regulatory sandbox in the U.K. received 69\napplications for its first cohort from a wide variety of firm-types, including start-ups and incumbents, with\n24 applications meeting the eligibility requirements to move on to development toward testing. Although\nthey are in their early stages, I find the regulatory sandboxes to be an intriguing idea and will be following\nthe results closely. They provide but one example of the type of productive collaboration that central\nbanks and regulators can have with the payments industry.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s payments modernization efforts, which I discussed today, are another important\nexample of the value of collaboration. As the work moves forward, the Federal Reserve is committed to\nfacilitating collaborative efforts with payment stakeholders to foster the move to a faster, secure, efficient,\nand ubiquitous payments system in the U.S. on behalf of the public.\n\n17\n\nSee the remarks by Christopher Woolard, U.K. Financial Conduct Authority Director of Strategy and\nCompetition, at the Innovate Finance Global Summit, April 11, 2016; U.K. Financial Conduct Authority,\n“Regulatory Sandbox,” November 2015; the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s regulatory sandbox web page; the\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission’s regulatory sandbox web page; Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFintech Supervisory Sandbox, circular B1/15C, B9/29C to all authorized institutions, September 6, 2016; Bank\nNegara Malaysia (Central Bank of Malaysia) Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox Framework and press\nrelease; Monetary Authority of Singapore FinTech regulatory sandbox web page and FinTech Regulatory Sandbox\nGuidelines, November 2016.\n\n\f"

Watts Lecture\nThe Robins School of Business, University of Richmond\nRichmond, VA\nMarch 21, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Dean Nancy Bagranoff, Professor Dean Croushore, and the University of Richmond’s Robins\nSchool of Business for the opportunity to deliver this year’s Stanley S. Watts lecture. I feel honored to\njoin the list of distinguished speakers who have previously presented the Watts lecture. I have had the\npleasure of knowing and working with Professor Croushore for many years. Through his research and\nanalysis, Dean has made important contributions to the Federal Reserve System and to the economics\nprofession. As a professor, he is passing on his knowledge by training the next generation of economists\nand business people, an important public service.\n\nThis evening, I will speak about monetary policy and the role of communications in Federal Reserve\npolicymaking. I serve on the Federal Open Market Committee’s subcommittee on communications, so it\nmay not be surprising that I believe communications play an essential role in monetary policy\nimplementation. Of course, my remarks this evening will reflect my own views and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLast Week’s FOMC Monetary Policy Decision and the Economic Outlook\nThis is an opportune time to talk about policy communications because, as I’m sure many of you know,\nthe FOMC announced last week that it had decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by\none-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent. This decision was based on the Committee’s view of\nactual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward our\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability. I fully supported this further step on the path of\nincreases in the federal funds rate that the Committee has indicated for some time is likely to be\nappropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives, should the economy evolve as anticipated.\n\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion are sound. Looking\nthrough the quarterly pattern of ups and downs, we find that output has sustained a moderate pace of\n\n\f2\nabout 2 percent growth, on average, over the past three years. So far, based on the limited data available,\ntracking estimates suggest that growth in the current quarter may come in on the weak side. I am not\ntaking much of a signal from this, as it likely reflects some transitory factors like reduced energy demand\ndue to unseasonably warm weather early in the year and residual seasonality in the data – we’ve seen a\npattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter followed by stronger growth in\nsubsequent quarters. I see favorable fundamentals as supportive of GDP growth over the next year at\nsomewhat above trend, which I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative\nmonetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets and income growth, and\ncontinued strength in the labor market.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. This year, that\nstrength has been sustained, with an average increase of 237,000 jobs per month in January and February.\nThe pace is well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from around 75,000 to\n120,000 per month, depending on what one assumes about labor force participation. Demographic\nfactors, including the aging of our population, have resulted in a downward trend in participation, which\nis one of the reasons trend employment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago. But rather than\ndeclining like its trend, the participation rate has been basically stable for the past three years. This is a\nfurther sign of strength in the labor market.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has been moving down. In February, it stood at\n4.7 percent, less than half of its peak after the Great Recession. Although payroll job growth is likely to\nslow a bit from its current pace, given the progress that’s already been made, it will be sufficient to put\nfurther downward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below my\nestimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\n\f3\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. For a while, inflation has been running below\nthe Fed’s target of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, that is, total PCE inflation. But inflation has picked up over the past year and\nis moving in the right direction. There are likely to be monthly variations in the inflation numbers as\nprevious changes in energy and import prices roll out of our year-over-year measures, and current\nfluctuations roll in. In determining where we are relative to goal, we need to look through transitory\nmovements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is\ngoing on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary\npolicy, and with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a\nsustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. Conditions\nsupporting the return to goal include the firmer data on inflation, reasonably stable inflation expectations,\ncontinued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nThe appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our\nlonger-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. If economic\nconditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in the fed\nfunds rate will be needed. My current assessment is that the pace of removal won’t call for an increase in\nthe fed funds rate at each meeting, but it does mean more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past\ntwo years. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a\nbuild-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as\nwell as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on\nexcessively risky investments in a search for yield.\n\nAlong with its rate increase, last week the FOMC also announced that it was maintaining its policy of\nreinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and\nagency mortgage-backed securities, essentially maintaining the Fed’s balance sheet at its very large size.\n\n\f4\nThe balance sheet grew when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets. The\nFOMC used this nontraditional policy tool to address the Great Recession, once its traditional policy tool,\nthe fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As Chair Yellen mentioned in her press briefing,\nthe FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, but no decisions have been made. In my view, if\neconomic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our reinvestment policy this\nyear. I view this as consistent with our principles of policy normalization and our statement that we\nanticipate continuing reinvestments “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under\nway.” 1 Ending reinvestments is a first step toward reducing the size of the balance sheet and returning its\ncomposition to primarily Treasury securities over time – a welcome acknowledgment that the economy\nand policy are transitioning back to normal.\n\nFed Structure, Monetary Policy Independence, and Accountability\nI have already mentioned two important pieces of monetary policy communication, namely, the FOMC’s\npost-meeting statement and the Chair’s press briefing. But before I go any further, it will help if I provide\na little information about the structure of the institution responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy.\n\nCongress established the Fed in 1913 to operate in the public interest to promote the health of the U.S.\neconomy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed as a decentralized central bank, independent\nwithin the government but not independent from the government. The Fed’s design balances publicsector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country – including\none right here in Richmond. The Reserve Banks are overseen by a seven-member Board of Governors in\n\n1\n\nSee, “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014, and the FOMC post-meeting\nstatement of March 15, 2017.\n\n\f5\nWashington, D.C. 2 I believe the regional structure of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for\nmore than 100 years. This design allows monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of\nthe American economy and its people. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe\nthe history of the Fed has shown that better policy decisions are made when diverse information and\nviews are considered. The Fed’s structure also helps us to carry out our other responsibilities. These\ninclude supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions, promoting the\nstability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the nation’s payments system,\nproviding certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying effective community\ndevelopment policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe FOMC comprises the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed,\nand four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. As president of the Cleveland\nFed, I vote every other year, as does the Chicago Fed’s president. The other presidents vote every third\nyear. I note, though, that all Reserve Bank presidents, whether voting members at the moment or not,\nparticipate in FOMC meetings. Thus, by design, the discussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of\neconomic information and analysis from all parts of the country. When I attend FOMC meetings, I make\nit a point to bring the economic information the Cleveland Fed staff and I have garnered from business,\nconsumer, and labor contacts throughout the Fourth District, which comprises the state of Ohio, western\nPennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. This regional information,\nalong with economic and financial data and analysis, plays an important part in the FOMC’s setting of\nnational monetary policy in pursuit of our goals of maximum employment and price stability, which were\ngiven to us by Congress.\n\n2\n\nCurrently, there are two openings on the Board of Governors and there will be another when Governor Daniel\nTarullo steps down in early April.\n\n\f6\nWhile Congress has set the Fed’s goals, it has also wisely given the Fed independence in making\nmonetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. That is, monetary policy decisions do not have to be\napproved by the president or Congress. This is wise because a substantial body of research and actual\npractice indicate that when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run political\ninterference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nIndependence in setting monetary policy is worth preserving because it yields more effective policy. But\naccountability must go hand in hand with independence. A central bank cannot expect to remain\nindependent from the political process unless it is transparent about the rationale for its policy decisions.\nIt takes some time for monetary policy to affect the economy, so the public won’t be able to immediately\nsee whether a policy action was a good one. So it is incumbent upon policymakers to explain their\ndecisions, including their assessment of economic conditions, as well as their outlook for the economy.\nIn other words, clear communications play a crucial role in monetary policymaking.\n\nThe Benefits of Clear Communications in Monetary Policymaking\nClear communications can make monetary policy more effective by helping households and businesses\nmake better economic and financial decisions. When policymakers are clear about the goals of monetary\npolicy and the economic information that is important in their forecasts and policy decisions, and set\npolicy in a systematic way, the public will have a better idea of how monetary policy is likely to change\nas economic conditions evolve. They will have a better sense of how policy will react not only to\nanticipated changes in conditions but also to unanticipated economic developments. Such knowledge\nhelps households and firms make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions.\n\nAchieving clearer monetary policy communications is better viewed as a journey rather than as a\ndestination. Indeed, over the past two decades, the Fed has taken several steps on this journey to become\nmore transparent, as the benefits of transparency have become better appreciated. It might surprise you to\n\n\f7\nknow that it wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to explicitly announce changes in its fed funds rate\ntarget and later added more description about the state of the economy and the rationale for its decisions.\nBefore 1994, there was no post-meeting FOMC statement; the public had to infer what the FOMC\ndecided by looking at how it implemented policy through its open market operations in financial markets.\nNow, the post-meeting statement describes the FOMC’s view of the state of the economy and the\nrationale for its decisions, as well as the votes of individual members and the preferred policy choices of\nany dissenters. Further context for the decisions is provided in the meeting minutes, which are released\nby the FOMC three weeks after the meeting, and a full transcript is released with a five-year lag. Outside\nof the blackout period around FOMC meetings, many of the FOMC participants present speeches – like\nthis one – in which they share their perspectives on the economy and monetary policy with the public. In\nfact, as a Reserve Bank president, I view myself as a public servant and believe one of my duties is to\nexplain the rationale for my decisions to the public.\n\nIn addition to speeches, the Chair testifies before subcommittees of both houses of Congress at two\nregularly scheduled monetary policy hearings a year, and at additional hearings when asked. And the\nChair holds press briefings after four FOMC meetings per year. These briefings, which started in 2011,\nallow the Chair to expand on things that are too complex to discuss in the FOMC’s relatively short postmeeting statement. The four meetings followed by press briefings are also ones at which the FOMC\nreleases its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP. I would like to spend the balance of my talk\ndiscussing the role of these projections in monetary policy communications and a recent enhancement the\nFOMC made to the SEP.\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections\nThe Summary of Economic Projections, released four times a year, provides information on individual\nparticipants’ economic projections, conditional on the path of policy that each participant sees as\nappropriate to promoting the FOMC’s goals of price stability and maximum employment. It is worth\n\n\f8\nnoting that unlike private-sector forecasts, the SEP policy path projections are not policy forecasts, but\nrather the individual participants’ view of what constitutes appropriate policy. The projected economic\nvariables included in the SEP are real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation,\nthat is, inflation excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, with appropriate policy\ngiven by the federal funds rate. The projections are for the current year and for up to three additional\nyears, and also include the participants’ estimates of the longer-run values for these variables.\n\nI believe the SEP is an important part of monetary policy communications. Because monetary policy\naffects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking, and the SEP provides the public\nwith a sense of where FOMC participants see the economy evolving and the associated policy path\nconsistent with that outlook.\n\nOf course, it is important to put the FOMC’s projections into proper context. The economy can evolve in\nunexpected ways. The FOMC is not prescient, nor should we expect it to be. At the end of the year, the\nmedia often writes a story on how the economy actually fared compared to what the FOMC was\nprojecting at the start of the year, and when the misses are large, more than one story is written. For\nexample, according to the central tendency of the projections, at the start of 2012, FOMC participants\nexpected real GDP growth for the year to be 2.2 to 2.7 percent. It turns out that the economy grew at only\na 1.3 percent pace that year, a forecast miss of around 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points. On the other hand,\nparticipants underestimated the improvement seen in the unemployment rate in 2012. At the start of the\nyear, they projected an unemployment rate of 8.2 to 8.5 percent by the fourth quarter, but the\nunemployment rate ended up lower, at 7.8 percent. The FOMC also was more optimistic about growth at\nthe start of 2015 than what came to pass, and inflation ran below projections over 2013-2015.\n\nThe public has to hold the FOMC accountable for its performance, but it should not hold monetary\npolicymakers to an unrealistic standard. To evaluate the performance of FOMC projections, it is\n\n\f9\nimportant to put these forecast misses into context by remembering that even though forecast errors of\nthis magnitude, both above and below actual outcomes, may seem large, they are the norm among\neconomic forecasters, not the exception. 3 Forecasting is a difficult task. The economy is constantly\nbeing buffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated.\nMoreover, our view of current economic conditions can be cloudy because many economic data are\nrevised over time. Data revisions complicate forecasting and setting monetary policy in real time.\nUniversity of Richmond’s Dean Croushore is at the forefront of economic research into how forecasters\nand policymakers should incorporate data revisions into their work. Another reason forecasting is\ndifficult is what economists call “model uncertainty”: it isn’t clear which model will best predict the\nfuture path of the economy at any given time. One way to approach this model uncertainty is to average\nacross various models to develop a forecast. From a practical policymaking standpoint, I find that\nlooking at forecasts from several models gives me a better sense not only of the most likely forecast but\nalso the risks around the forecast. It is important to keep in mind that around any economic forecast there\nis typically quite a lot of uncertainty.\n\nTo illustrate the level of uncertainty around its projections, the FOMC will now be providing charts\nshowing confidence bands, so-called fan charts, around the median projections, something I have\nadvocated for quite some time. 4 The future is inherently uncertain, and the confidence bands will give the\n\n3\n\nIt is also worth remembering that the FOMC projections are conditional on what each participant views as the\nappropriate policy path and not necessarily what the participant views as the most likely policy path. For a clear and\nvery useful explanation of what the FOMC projections are and are not, see Ben S. Bernanke, “Federal Reserve\nEconomic Projections: What Are They Good For?” Brookings Institution blog post, November 28, 2016.\n4\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Forward Guidance in Extraordinary Times, in Normal Times, and Betwixt the Two,”\nremarks at the Money Marketeers of New York University, Inc., New York, NY, November 6, 2014; Loretta J.\nMester, “Forward Guidance and Communications in U.S. Monetary Policy,” Imperial College, London, U.K.,\nNovember 20, 2014; Loretta J.

The confidence bands are also a helpful reminder to policymakers to remain humble about\nour ability to know the future with much certainty.\n\nFigures 1 to 4 show 70 percent confidence intervals (in light blue and teal) around the median projections\nfrom the FOMC’s March SEP. If the level of uncertainty is similar to that experienced in the past and the\nupside and downside risks around the forecast are broadly balanced, then there’s a 70 percent probability\nthat the actual outcomes will lie within the band. For example, for real GDP growth, a 70 percent\nconfidence interval around the forecast is about ±1.6 percentage points for this year and a little over ±2.0\npercentage points for each of the following two years. The intervals tend to fan out over time because\nthere is increasingly more opportunity for unforeseen shocks to occur. The miss of the FOMC’s early\n2012 forecast that I referred to earlier was within the interval. The confidence bands around forecasts of\nunemployment and inflation are also pretty wide. So the FOMC’s forecast performance has been quite\nreasonable by this metric.\n\nThe policy path in the SEP receives considerable scrutiny. In March, there was essentially no change in\nthe median policy path compared to December because there was little change in the economic outlook.\nThe median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the\nend of next year, and 3 percent at the end of 2019, which is its median longer-run value. The SEP\nindicates that most participants expect that an upward path of policy will be appropriate based on their\ncurrent assessment of the outlook.\n\nThe federal funds rate path differs from the other variables in the SEP because policymakers choose the\npath. But because there is uncertainty around the economic outlook, there is also uncertainty around the\nappropriate policy path. The confidence band is a reminder that the median policy path in the SEP is not\nmeant to be a firm commitment on the part of the FOMC. Instead, policy should be expected to respond\n\n\f11\nto changes in economic and financial conditions that materially affect the medium-run outlook. As you\ncan see, the range of reasonable outcomes for the policy path is actually quite wide, and considerably\nwider than some of the variation we’ve seen in the SEP policy path over time, even though those small\nshifts have often drawn considerable media attention. The dispersion in forecasts across participants also\nreceives attention, but as you can see in the figures, that dispersion – shown in dark blue for the economic\nvariables and in the famous dot plot for the fed funds rate – is quite a bit narrower than the degree of\nuncertainty around the forecasts.\n\nConclusion\nThe addition of fan charts to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections is the most recent step the\nCommittee has taken on its journey of increased transparency and better communication. The FOMC will\ncontinue to strive for further improvements because when the public has a better understanding of how\nmonetary policy decisions are made, the policy itself is more effective, and the public will have the\ninformation it needs to hold us accountable for our decisions. This accountability provides a crucial\nfoundation for allowing monetary policymakers to pursue the congressionally mandated goals of price\nstability and maximum employment free from short-run political considerations. This independence of\nmonetary policy decisions results in better economic outcomes. Because our policy decisions depend on\nthe economic outlook, it is important for the FOMC to provide as much information as we can on our\ncurrent assessment of the outlook, at the same time explaining that the forecast can change because\neconomic conditions can evolve differently than expected.\n\nLet me conclude with something former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan once said about monetary policy:\n“Because monetary policy works with a lag, we need to be forward looking, taking actions to forestall\nimbalances that may not be visible for many months. There is no alternative to basing actions on\nforecasts, at least implicitly. It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is\nevident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the\n\n\f12\nunderlying forces acting on the economy shift. This process is not easy to get right at all times, and it is\noften difficult to convey to the American people, whose support is essential to our mission.” 5 Alan\nGreenspan made these remarks more than 20 years ago, yet they strike me as just as relevant today as they\nwere then.\n\n5\n\nAlan Greenspan, “The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society,” remarks at the Annual Dinner and\nFrancis Boyer Lecture of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, Washington D.C., December\n5, 1996.\n\n\f13\n\n\f14\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nSingapore\nFebruary 20, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Michael Drury and the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak in their Central\nBanking Series. I have had the opportunity to attend many GIC programs over the years and I have\nalways walked away with new insights into the global economy and financial markets. I have also been\nhonored to speak at two earlier GIC events. I’m hoping that when the organizers invited me to be on\ntoday’s program they weren’t thinking, “the third time’s the charm”! For my part, I feel privileged to\nshare some of my views and I thank our local hosts in Singapore for providing such a beautiful setting in\nwhich to do it.\n\nRather than provide a standard economic outlook talk, I’d like to speak about a challenge that monetary\npolicymakers face in the aftermath of the financial crisis and Great Recession. That challenge is\nmanaging expectations. When we think about expectations in the context of monetary policy, we usually\nmean expectations about inflation or expectations about the future path of policy. But today, what I mean\nis managing expectations about the role monetary policy can play in promoting a healthy economy.\nWhile I’ll focus on the Federal Reserve, I believe a similar challenge applies to central bankers around the\nworld. Of course, the remarks I’ll provide are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nA decade has passed since the onset of the global financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession. The\nU.S. economy has emerged from those dark days; it is now on sound footing. But it took a set of\nextraordinary actions outside the realm of normal monetary policy to get us back to this point. Because of\nthe pain they caused, the global financial crisis and Great Recession rightly shined a bright light on the\nrole of central banks. People who had never heard of the Federal Reserve before the crisis now hold\nstrong opinions. There has been a healthy debate about the role monetary policy might have played in the\nrun-up to the crisis, the effect of near-zero interest rates on the economy and financial markets, and the\nefficacy of the nontraditional tools used to address the Great Recession, including purchases of mortgagebacked securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\n\f2\n\nSome critics of the Fed believe that monetary policy was excessively accommodative and a key driver of\nconditions that led to the crisis, while other critics believe that the economy could have emerged much\nmore quickly from the deep recession had monetary policy reacted differently. On the other side, there\nare fans of the Fed who believe that the nontraditional actions taken by central banks were very successful\n– so successful that policymakers should consider expanding the use of monetary policy beyond its\ntypical purview.\n\nIn my view, both sides represent exaggerated expectations of what monetary policy can achieve. And this\ndistorted view is troubling because it makes it harder for the public to understand the rationale for\npolicymakers’ decisions and to evaluate their performance. It is no secret that there are several legislative\nproposals to change the way the Fed pursues its congressionally mandated monetary policy goals. Some\nproposals seek to restrict the Fed’s ability to pursue these goals in a way that is insulated from short-run\npolitical influence. This restriction on monetary policy’s independence would be a significant loss for the\nnation because, as a substantial body of research and actual practice indicate, when a central bank\nformulates monetary policy free from short-run political interference and is held accountable for its\ndecisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nAccountability must go hand in hand with independence. That’s why I believe it is time to recalibrate\nexpectations of what monetary policy can achieve. The public needs to know what it can reasonably hold\nmonetary policymakers accountable for. Indeed, even those who set policy would benefit if we kept in\nmind the serenity prayer: give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change\nthe things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nFor the rest of my talk, I’ll elaborate on what this serenity prayer means for four aspects of monetary\npolicy: how monetary policy should address business cycle fluctuations; monetary policy and long-run\n\n\f3\ngrowth; monetary policy vis-à-vis fiscal policy; and monetary policymakers’ projections of the economy\nand future path of policy.\n\nMonetary Policy and Business Cycle Fluctuations\nAt times during the recovery, the public discussion seemed to suggest that by setting interest rates\nappropriately, monetary policymakers could offset the deep shock that afflicted the economy and speed\nup the recovery. But this view ignores lessons from modern economic theory and historical experience.\nWhen a shock hits the economy, it takes some time for businesses to adjust their prices and for\nhouseholds to adjust their behavior. This delay allows monetary policy to affect the real side of the\neconomy – output growth and employment – providing a bit of a cushion against the shock. However, it\nis a temporary effect that lasts only until prices adjust and the shock dissipates. We don’t know the exact\ntiming and magnitude of that impact; moreover, we can’t predict with much precision the future shocks\nthat will hit the economy. So attempting to fine-tune monetary policy to counteract the effects of a\nvariety of temporary current and future shocks, some negative and some positive, is likely to lead to less\neconomic stability rather than more.\n\nIn addition, not all shocks are transitory. Well-known research by Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart\ndocuments that recessions associated with financial crises tend to be deeper and more prolonged than\nother types of recessions. 1 The loss in output after financial crises is usually not fully recovered. 2 In the\ncase of the Great Recession, the housing crash required a large shift of resources out of that sector, and\nsome Cleveland Fed research indicates that it typically takes the economy a long time to recover after a\nhousing bust. 3 In other words, some part of the shock that caused the Great Recession was likely\n\n1\n\nSee Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,\nPrinceton: Princeton University Press, 2009.\n2\n\nSee Valerie Cerra and Sweta Chaman Saxena, “Growth Dynamics: The Myth of Economic Recovery,” American\nEconomic Review 98, March 2008, pp. 439–457.\n\n3\n\nSee Michael D. Bordo and Joseph G. Haubrich, “Deep Recessions, Fast Recoveries, and Financial Crises: Evidence from\nthe American Record,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper 12-14, June 2012, and Greg Howard, Robert\n\n\f4\npermanent or very persistent rather than the type of transitory shock monetary policy might temporarily\ncushion. Given the size of the shock, it took a long time for the economy to adjust. Monetary policy\ncould not be expected to make up for that permanent loss.\n\nThat said, this doesn’t mean that monetary policy should be unresponsive to changes in economic\nconditions. Monetary policy can ease the transitions the economy has to make after shocks hit by\nresponding in a way that fosters monetary policy’s longer-run goals, which for the Fed are price stability\nand maximum employment. 4 This means policy will vary over the business cycle as economic conditions\nchange. For example, suppose there is a negative shock to aggregate demand. Firms will begin to cut\ntheir supply and reduce investment and employment. As output and employment fall, and demand and\nsupply rebalance, the market level of interest rates will also fall. So long as inflation is near target,\nmonetary policymakers would want to accommodate that fall in the market rate by reducing the shortterm policy rate, supporting the economy’s return to equilibrium. If policymakers didn’t reduce the\npolicy rate, prices would have to fall further and this would lead to disinflationary pressures, which is\ncounter to promoting price stability.\n\nOr consider a positive shock to productivity growth. In this case, firms would respond by increasing\noutput and investment, and this would lead to a higher equilibrium interest rate in the economy. So long\nas inflation was near target, the central bank would want to raise its policy rate as the market interest rate\nrose. A failure to do so would allow inflationary pressures to build. In both of these cases, monetary\npolicy isn’t attempting to totally offset the shock. Instead, to foster price stability and maximum\nemployment over the longer run, policymakers are moving the short-run policy rate consistent with\nchanges in the equilibrium interest rate as the economy adjusts to shocks. Notice that in this view, the\n\nMartin, and Beth Anne Wilson, “Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises Really So Different?” Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers 1037, November 2011.\n4\n\nIn the remainder of my talk, when referring to monetary policy’s longer-run goals, I will use the Fed’s goals of\nprice stability and maximum employment. But my points apply to other central banks whose goals may be price\nstability alone, or are hierarchical, putting price stability before other goals.\n\n\f5\nmaximum employment benchmark for evaluating the performance of monetary policy isn’t static; it\ndepends on the types of shocks that hit the economy and the time it will take for the economy to adjust.\nIn terms of our serenity prayer, it’s important to have the serenity to know there will be shocks to the\neconomy that monetary policy should not attempt to offset, and the courage, instead, to set policy to\npromote the longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nMonetary Policy and Long-Run Growth\nMy second topic is long-run growth. The recent discussion among economists and others about long-run\ngrowth has led some people to overestimate what monetary policy can achieve. A long-standing\neconomic tenet is that while monetary policy can affect real growth in the short run, it cannot affect the\neconomy’s long-run growth rate. Unfortunately, this distinction between short-run and long-run effects\nhas become somewhat muddled.\n\nSo let’s take a step back and consider the drivers of long-run growth. The amount of goods and services\nan economy can produce depends on the amount of capital and labor it has – its inputs – and on how\nproductively it can combine those inputs to create output. For the economy to grow, there needs to be an\nincrease in labor or capital or an increase in productivity, or both. Labor force growth is largely\ndetermined by demographic factors like the birth rate, age distribution, and immigration. Labor force\ngrowth, along with labor force skills and the economy’s infrastructure and institutional arrangements,\nsuch as the rule of law and well-developed financial markets, can all affect the quantity and quality of\ninputs and therefore the level of output a country can produce over the longer run. But sustained\nincreases in output, that is, long-run economic growth, and increasing standards of living are determined\nby productivity growth. And productivity growth depends on factors like investment in human and\nphysical capital and R&D that yields innovative products and processes. 5\n5\n\nIn the elegant and seminal neoclassical growth model developed by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan, a higher\nsavings rate will lead to higher investment and higher income per capita in the long run, but this can’t happen\nindefinitely; eventually the economy reaches a new steady state. Only productivity growth can lead to an economy\nthat continues to grow. (See Robert M. Solow, “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth,” Quarterly\n\n\f6\n\nIt is these underlying fundamentals, and not monetary policy, that determine the economy’s long-run\ngrowth rate and sustainable unemployment rate. In economists’ terminology, in the long run, monetary\npolicy is said to be neutral with respect to the real side of the economy and to affect only the price level\nand inflation rate.\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which was adopted in 2012\nand reaffirmed each year since, recognizes this distinction. 6 It clearly says that “the inflation rate over the\nlonger run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify\na longer-run goal for inflation.” In contrast, “the maximum level of employment is largely determined by\nnonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may\nchange over time and may not be directly measurable.” It’s true that poor monetary policy can inhibit the\nability of the economy to achieve its long-run growth potential, but by promoting the longer-run goals of\nprice stability and maximum employment, monetary policy can contribute to the economy’s ability to\nreach its long-run growth rate, even though it cannot affect what that long-run rate is.\n\nWhile monetary policy can’t affect the economy’s long-run growth rate, it cannot ignore it either, because\nthe economy’s long-run equilibrium real rate of interest, that is, the rate consistent with stable prices and\nmaximum employment over the long run, is determined by the long-run growth of consumption and,\ntherefore, of output. A sizable shock to the economy can affect the potential growth rate, and monetary\n\nJournal of Economics 70, 1956, pp. 65–94, and Trevor W. Swan, “Economic Growth and Capital Accumulation,”\nThe Economic Record 32, 1956, pp. 334–361.) A further advance is the endogenous growth model, which seeks to\nexplain the source of productivity growth. In this model, there need not be diminishing marginal returns to capital if\nhuman capital increases with the stock of physical capital. But even if there are diminishing marginal returns, these\ncan be offset if increases in R&D lead to innovative products and processes. Thus, ongoing growth can be sustained\nby investments in human capital and new technology. (Two early contributions to the endogenous growth literature\nare Robert E. Lucas, Jr., “On the Mechanics of Economic Development,” Journal of Monetary Economics 22, July\n1988, pp. 3–42, and Paul Romer, “Increasing Returns and Long-Run Growth,” Journal of Political Economy 94,\nOctober 1986, pp. 1002–1037.)\n6\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted\neffective January 24, 2012; as amended January 31, 2017.\n\n\f7\npolicy will need to take that into account. The financial crisis and Great Recession affected not only\naggregate demand but also aggregate supply. Potential growth fell and, with it, so did the economy’s\nequilibrium interest rate. There is ongoing research into the mechanism through which large shocks\nmight affect potential growth. Regardless of the mechanism, the fact that potential growth fell had\nimplications for monetary policy. The Fed’s policy rate has been lower than what it would have been had\nthere been no change in the equilibrium rate. The lower equilibrium rate is reflected in the FOMC’s\neconomic projections. For example, in January 2012, the median level of the longer-run fed funds rate\nwas 4-1/4 percent. In the most recent projections, in December 2016, that level is 3 percent.\n\nAn easy way to see the effect of lower equilibrium interest rates is to look at simple monetary policy rules\nthat are often used to assess the degree of monetary accommodation. I don’t believe that monetary policy\nshould be set mechanically using a single policy rule; no rule works well enough across a variety of\neconomic models and in a variety of economic circumstances. But I do find it useful to look at the\noutcomes of an array of simple, robust monetary policy rules as a gauge. You can find updates for a set\nof seven rules and their outcomes across several forecasts on the Cleveland Fed’s website. 7 The\nequilibrium interest rate is a parameter in most of these rules, and when it falls, so does the policy\noutcome from these rules, indicating that policy should respond to changes in these fundamental aspects\nof the economy.\n\nBut this is different from trying to actively use monetary policy to affect the longer-run growth rate of the\neconomy or the longer-run unemployment rate. As Chair Janet Yellen said in her press briefing after the\nDecember FOMC meeting, this is not a strategy she has recommended, and rightly so. 8 I am very\ndoubtful that monetary policy could be targeted to spur a strong pickup in the types of investment in\nhuman capital and physical capital that would raise productivity growth. Monetary policy is a blunt\n7\n\nSee “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. In addition to posting current outcomes\nfor the set of rules, the web page includes a tool that allows the user to customize the rules and the forecasted inputs\ninto the rules to generate alternative policy paths.\n8\n\nSee “Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference,” December 14, 2016, p. 9.\n\n\f8\ninstrument, and despite very low interest rates, we certainly haven’t seen that type of effect during this\ncycle. Indeed, one of the conundrums has been the low productivity growth rates we’ve been\nexperiencing. Attempting to use monetary policy to spur productivity growth would be a risky\nexperiment, both in terms of our ability to achieve our longer-run goal of price stability and in terms of\nfinancial stability given the excessive accommodation such a strategy would require. So once again, we\nneed the serenity to accept that monetary policy cannot affect the economy’s long-run growth rate, and\nthe courage to keep monetary policy focused on what it is capable of achieving: price stability that\npromotes maximum employment.\n\nMonetary Policy vs. Fiscal Policy\nRather than monetary policy, other forms of economic policy are better suited to affecting the\nfundamentals that drive productivity growth and potential growth. Policies and programs that encourage\nhigher levels of investment in R&D and innovation, that help workers displaced from jobs because of\ntechnological change or globalization to transition to other jobs, and that spur investments in education to\nhelp people gain the skills needed in the modern economy all have the potential to raise productivity and\nlonger-run growth. Tax-code changes, immigration policy, and trade policy also have the potential to\naffect the economy’s longer-run growth rate, but whether in a positive or negative direction depends on\nthe particular changes that are made, how they are implemented, and how they are financed.\n\nGovernment spending and tax policies fall under the purview of fiscal policy, not monetary policy. The\ndistinction is important, yet it has become somewhat muddled in the aftermath of the crisis. During the\nfinancial crisis, the Federal Reserve established some special credit and liquidity programs that went\nbeyond traditional monetary policy. Some of these programs, like the term auction facility, which\nauctioned longer-term credit to depository institutions, were related to the Federal Reserve’s role as\nlender of last resort. Other lending programs targeted specific markets, like the commercial paper market.\nIn addition, to put downward pressure on longer-term yields and to support the housing market, the Fed\npurchased large volumes of housing agency debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.\n\n\f9\nThese purchases had the desired effect of adding accommodation once the traditional tool of policy, the\nfed funds rate, had reached its effective lower bound. But they also entailed the Fed’s allocating credit to\na particular sector, housing, something the Fed traditionally has not done.\n\nThese programs were necessary, but they did have some negative aspects. One was that they opened up\nthe Fed to requests to aid other industries or to use its balance sheet to fund government initiatives.\nDuring December 2008, as Congress debated a bailout for American automakers, several members of\nCongress requested of then-Chair Ben Bernanke that the Fed lend directly to auto companies. Needless to\nsay, the Fed was reluctant to go down this path, which would have put it squarely in the midst of\nindustrial policy, a responsibility of Congress. 9 More recently, the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Act,\nor FAST Act, tapped the Fed’s surplus account to pay for highways.\n\nTo avoid the erosion of monetary policy’s independence, it is important to bring monetary policymaking\nback to more normal footing. The Fed recognized this need from the very start of its use of nontraditional\ntools. For example, many of the special lending facilities were designed to be self-liquidating as creditmarket conditions improved. And the Fed clearly states in its policy normalization principles that it\nintends, in the longer run, to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy\nefficiently and effectively, and that the composition of assets will return to being primarily Treasury\nsecurities. 10 This will mean a smaller balance sheet than what we hold today, regardless of the longer-run\npolicy implementation framework the Fed ultimately adopts. 11 The return to primarily Treasuries will\ntake some time, but it will be welcome because it will minimize the effect of the Fed’s asset holdings on\nthe allocation of credit across sectors of the economy, and it may help guard against future calls for the\n\n9\n\nSee the discussion in Chapter 17 of Ben S. Bernanke, The Courage to Act: A Memoir of a Crisis and its Aftermath,\nNew York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2015.\n\n10\n11\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee, “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” September 17, 2014.\n\nThe FOMC has undertaken an extended effort to evaluate different frameworks for implementing monetary policy\nin the long run.

We need the serenity to accept that monetary\npolicy and fiscal policy are distinct, and the courage to push against attempts to use monetary policy for\ngoals that fall under the purview of fiscal policy.\n\nFOMC Projections\nThe final topic I’d like to discuss is the FOMC’s projections of the economy and federal funds rate path.\nThe FOMC is not prescient, nor should we expect it to be. Four times a year, the FOMC provides a\nsummary of economic projections across FOMC participants, conditional on the path of policy that each\nparticipant sees as appropriate. The media focuses attention on changes in the projections over the year,\nand at the end of the year, stories are written about what actually came to pass compared to what the\nFOMC was projecting at the start of the year. For example, according to the central tendency of FOMC\nparticipants’ projections, at the start of 2012, real GDP growth for the year was expected to be 2.2 to 2.7\npercent. It turns out that the economy grew at only a 1.3 percent pace that year, a forecast miss of around\n1.0 to 1.5 percentage points. On the other hand, participants underestimated the improvement seen in the\nunemployment rate in 2012. At the start of the year, they projected an unemployment rate of 8.2 to 8.5\npercent by the fourth quarter, but unemployment ended up lower, at 7.8 percent. The FOMC also was\nmore optimistic about growth at the start of 2015 than what came to pass, and inflation ran below\nprojections over 2013–2015.\n\nThe public has to hold the FOMC accountable for its performance, but it should not hold monetary\npolicymakers to an unrealistic standard. To evaluate the performance of the FOMC’s projections, it is\nimportant to put these forecast misses into context by remembering that forecast errors of this magnitude,\nboth above and below actual outcomes, are the norm among economic forecasters, not the exception. 12\nForecasting is difficult because the economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks, data are revised over\n12\n\nIt is also worth remembering that the FOMC projections are conditional on what each participant views as the\nappropriate policy path and not necessarily what the participant views as the most likely policy path. For a clear and\nvery useful explanation of what the FOMC projections are and are not, see Ben S. Bernanke, “Federal Reserve\nEconomic Projections: What Are They Good For?” Brookings Institution blog post, November 28, 2016.\n\n\f11\ntime, and there is uncertainty about which model will best predict the future path of the economy at any\ngiven time. In its Summary of Economic Projections, the FOMC publishes a table of the average\nhistorical forecast errors across various private-sector and government forecasts.13 For real GDP growth,\na 70 percent confidence interval around the forecast one year out is about ±1-3/4 percentage points. The\nforecast the FOMC made in early 2012 was within the interval. The confidence bands around forecasts of\nunemployment and inflation one year out are also wide: about ±3/4 percentage point for the\nunemployment rate, and about ±1 percentage point for inflation. So the FOMC projection performance is\nquite reasonable by this metric.\n\nSimilar scrutiny has been applied to changes in the policy path that the FOMC includes in its projections.\nA small change in the path can generate many headlines. But we should expect the policy paths to be\nresponsive to changes in economic conditions and changes in fiscal and other government policies, to the\nextent that they change the outlook. Changes in appropriate policy that are based on sound monetary\npolicymaking principles and are systematically related to changes in underlying conditions that affect the\nmedium-run outlook provide useful information on the Fed’s reaction function, helping the public better\nanticipate how the Fed will change policy when economic conditions change.\n\nAs a way to convey some of the uncertainty around our future policy path and outlook, I have been an\nadvocate of the FOMC’s publishing confidence bands around its projections. 14 The Committee is\n\n13\n\nFor example, see p. 11 of the Summary of Economic Projections, included in the “Minutes of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee Meeting, December 13–14, 2016.”\n14\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Forward Guidance in Extraordinary Times, in Normal Times, and Betwixt the Two,”\nremarks at the Money Marketeers of New York University, Inc., New York, NY, November 6, 2014; Loretta J.\nMester, “Forward Guidance and Communications in U.S. Monetary Policy,” Imperial College, London, U.K.,\nNovember 20, 2014; Loretta J. Mester, “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy Communications,”\nNational Association for Business Economics 2015 Economic Policy Conference, Washington DC, March 9, 2015;\nLoretta J. Mester, “Recent Inflation Developments and Challenges for Research and Monetary Policymaking,” The\n47th Konstanz Seminar on Monetary Theory and Monetary Policy, Insel Reichenau, Germany, May 12, 2016;\nLoretta J. Mester, “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” Shadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting, New York, NY,\nOctober 7, 2016.\n\n\f12\ndiscussing it. 15 Confidence bands will help the public understand some of the risks around our\nprojections and remind them of the reasonable amount of variation to expect in outcomes relative to\nprojections. The bands will also illustrate that while the dispersion across FOMC participants’\nprojections of the policy path often gets a lot of attention, this dispersion is actually quite narrow\ncompared with the confidence bands. Finally, confidence bands will also be a helpful reminder to\npolicymakers themselves of the uncertainty we constantly live with. So, we all need the serenity to accept\nthat policymakers aren’t prescient and their forecasts will change over time, and the courage to hold\npolicymakers accountable for being principled and systematic in how they react to changes in economic\nconditions.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, I am a strong supporter of insulating monetary policy decisions from short-run political\nconsiderations. Accountability must go hand in hand with such independence. For the public to be able\nto hold policymakers accountable for their policy decisions, it must understand what it is appropriate to\nexpect from monetary policy. Today, I talked about four areas where expectations need some\nrecalibration: how monetary policy should address business cycle fluctuations; the relationship between\nmonetary policy and long-run growth; monetary policy vis-à-vis fiscal policy; and monetary\npolicymakers’ economic and policy path projections. The serenity prayer provides some guidance for\nthat recalibration: We need the serenity to accept the things that cannot be changed by monetary policy\n(and look for more appropriate solutions). We need the courage to change the things we can (by keeping\nmonetary policy focused on its longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment). And we\nneed the wisdom to know the difference.\n\n15\n\nSee “Minutes of the FOMC Meeting, January 26–27, 2016.”\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe African American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania\nAnnual Business Luncheon\nPittsburgh, PA\nNovember 30, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Doris Carson Williams and members of the African American Chamber of Commerce of Western\nPennsylvania for inviting me to speak today about the economy and monetary policy. As you may know,\nin addition to being president and CEO of the Chamber, Doris chairs the board of the Pittsburgh Branch\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Doris for her service\nto my organization and to the country. In her role as chair, Doris brings us a wealth of information on the\nregional economy, information she has gathered from the entrepreneurs and other contacts in the region. I\nam sure that many of you provide Doris with insights into how your businesses and communities are\nfaring, so I’d like to also thank you for your service.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed represents the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which comprises western\nPennsylvania, as well as the state of Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West\nVirginia. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I make it a point to bring the economic information we have\ngarnered throughout the District from business, consumer, and labor contacts to meetings of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The\nregional information, along with economic and financial data and analysis, plays an important part in the\nFOMC’s setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals of maximum employment\nand price stability.\n\nIndeed, the regional structure of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for more than 100 years.\nCongress established the Fed in 1913 to operate in the public interest to promote the health of the U.S.\neconomy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed as a decentralized central bank, independent\nwithin the government but not independent from the government. The Fed’s design balances publicsector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country and overseen\nby the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This design allows monetary policy decisions to take\n\n\f2\ninto account the diversity of the American economy and its people. The regional structure also helps us\nto carry out our other responsibilities. In addition to setting national monetary policy, the Fed is also\nresponsible for supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions, promoting the\nstability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the nation’s payments system and\nproviding certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying effective community\ndevelopment policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nToday, I would like to focus on our monetary policy role by discussing my outlook for both the national\nand regional economy and my views on monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion is now in its eighth year, and considerable progress has been and continues to be\nmade on both parts of the Fed’s statutory goals of full employment and price stability. In my view, the\nunderlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. Growth has been moderate,\nand although the quarterly pattern has had its share of ups and downs, the economy has been resilient to a\nnumber of shocks throughout the expansion. One of those shocks, the sharp decline in energy prices\nbetween mid-2014 through the end of 2015, was a major negative for the energy-producing sector and its\nsuppliers in this region and elsewhere. Still, the economy and, in particular, employment growth\npersevered.\n\nAll forecasts carry risk, and sometimes, it is difficult to extract the signal about where the economy is\nheaded from noisy economic and financial market data. With these usual caveats in mind, my modal\nforecast is that over the next couple of years, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above\nits longer-run trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will move further\n\n\f3\nbelow its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will return to the\nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\n\nEconomic growth\nAfter a slow first half, U.S. output growth picked up in the third quarter. Consumer spending, which\nmakes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, has been the driver of growth and I expect that to continue.\nImproving household balance sheets, growth in personal income, low borrowing rates, and low oil prices\nhave all supported consumer spending.\n\nSmoothing through the monthly volatility in housing sales, starts, and permits indicates that the housing\nsector is gradually improving. I expect activity in the sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\nThe gradual nature of the housing recovery likely reflects a mixture of supply and demand factors.\nBuilders report that they are having trouble finding qualified workers in some of the construction trades,\nand they are avoiding over-building, having learned from the housing boom and crash. Mortgage rates\nare low, but households are being careful not to take on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and\nbanks are lending, but to those with good credit quality.\n\nIn contrast to consumer spending and housing, manufacturing has been restrained and business fixed\ninvestment has been weak. As I mentioned earlier, part of the weakness in investment reflects the impact\nthat the earlier sharp drop in oil prices had on the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers. In\nwestern Pennsylvania, steel production, which supplies the energy sector, has been down and firms tied to\nthe energy sector have had to cut jobs and curtail investment plans. On a positive note, oil prices have\nstabilized and are up somewhat this year, and we have started to see a pickup in oil drilling activity. The\nrelatively slow growth of our trading partners, which has led to an appreciation in the value of the dollar,\nhas also weighed on manufacturing and investment at firms that are reliant on exporting goods. But even\noutside of the energy- and trade-related sectors, business investment has been soft despite generally\naccommodative financial conditions. Some firms seem to be using the low interest rate environment to\n\n\f4\nbuy back stock rather than to expand plant and equipment spending. More generally, there just seems to\nbe a sense of caution on the part of businesses.\n\nI do expect investment to begin to pick up with economic growth, which would be welcome because a\nstronger pace of capital spending would help raise labor productivity growth from recent low levels. This\nis important because structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth rate of\noutput and of living standards. And a key determinant of productivity growth is investment in physical\nand human capital. Labor productivity growth has risen at an annual rate of a little above a half of a\npercent over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical; some of it reflects longer-run\ndemographics, including the aging of the population, and some of it likely reflects difficulties measuring\nproductivity in the service sector, including intellectual property and information technology. It is\ndifficult to forecast productivity growth, so the recent softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer\nlasting and reflect a structural issue. If it’s the latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy\nmay be lower than the 2 percent growth I’ve been assuming.\n\nSmall businesses\nI do not need to tell this audience about the important role that small and new businesses play in the U.S.\neconomy. The vast majority of firms in the U.S. are small businesses; in fact, three-quarters of U.S.\nbusinesses have fewer than 10 employees. So while it is true that large and mature businesses employ the\nmost people, still, over a quarter of U.S. private-sector jobs are at firms with fewer than 50 employees,\nand over half are at firms with fewer than 500 employees.1 Digging deeper into the data, economist John\nHaltiwanger and his co-authors have documented the important role played, in particular, by young firms.\nThis group includes new firms, which are almost all small to begin with. Their research shows that young\nfirms disproportionately contribute to both overall job creation and job destruction in the U.S. economy,\n1\n\nData from Supplemental Tables F and G of the National Business Employment Dynamics Data, U.S. Bureau of\nLabor Statistics indicate that as of 2016Q1, 28 percent of private-sector employment (20.5 million jobs) was at firms\nwith fewer than 50 employees, and 95 percent of firms have fewer than 50 employees. These tables and others are\navailable at http://www.bls.gov/bdm/bdmfirmsize.htm.\n\n\f5\nand on average, over the 1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3\npercent of total employment per year.2 More recent data show that since the Great Recession, this share\nhas fallen to around 2 percent,3 which brings up a cautionary note about our economy.\n\nAn enviable aspect of the U.S. economy around the globe is our spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship,\nease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility. Small and young businesses have played an\nimportant role in the dynamics of the U.S. economy. This dynamism has contributed to economic growth\nand well-being in the U.S. It allows resources to be reallocated from less-productive to more-productive\nbusinesses and allows workers to move up the career ladder, resulting in higher productivity growth and\nrising incomes.\n\nBut research by Haltiwanger and others has shown that the degree of dynamism in the U.S. economy has\nbeen declining for some time. As indicated above, the start-up rate has been declining, and since 2000,\nkey innovative sectors like high-tech have seen a sharp slowing in the rate of start-ups.4\nThe decline in business and labor market dynamism may be contributing to the slowdown we’ve seen in\nproductivity growth.5\n\nTo better understand one factor important to start-ups and small firms, for the past three years, the Federal\nReserve has conducted a survey on small-business credit. In 2015, seven Reserve Banks, including the\nCleveland Fed, collaborated on the survey, gathering responses from over 5,400 firms with fewer than\n\n2\n\nSee John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Who Creates Jobs? Small Versus Large Versus\nYoung,” Review of Economics and Statistics 95 (May 2013), pp. 347-361.\n3\n\nAuthor’s calculations based on the firm age table from the Business Dynamics Statistics, Firm Characteristics Data\nTables, U.S. Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data_firm.html).\n4\n\nSee John Haltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” paper\nwritten for the Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth conference, August 2015.\n5\n\nHaltiwanger (2015), p. 9.\n\n\f6\n500 employees and located in 26 states.6 The 2015 results indicate that among the more than 3,400\nemployer firms – those small businesses employing at least one person in addition to the owner – both\nfirm performance, in terms of the share reporting profitability and revenue growth, and financing success\nimproved over the previous year. Slightly less than 50 percent of surveyed employer firms applied for\ncredit and about half of those received all the credit they sought. Among the firms receiving less credit\nthan they wanted, micro-businesses (those firms with less than $100,000 in annual revenue) and start-ups\nhad somewhat less success in gaining credit approval. The differential in credit approval by revenue and\nage of firm may appropriately reflect the risks entailed in lending to these types of firms. Nonetheless, it\ndoes point out that the availability of credit is one of the challenges smaller and younger firms are facing\nas they try to grow, and that appropriate access to credit will remain a key attribute of an innovative\neconomy.\n\nAs this brief overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But\noverall, economic growth has proven to be resilient, and I expect growth over the next two years to be at\nor slightly above a trend of around 2 percent. The pace of growth, while lower than in other expansions,\nhas been sufficient to generate significant and sustained progress in labor markets.\n\nLabor markets\nIn fact, since the employment trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 15 million\njobs, about a 10 percent increase. The national unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage\npoints from its peak of 10 percent in late 2009. In addition, other gauges of the under-utilization of labor\nhave improved significantly. These include the broader measures of unemployment that track the number\nof part-time workers who would rather work full time and the number of people who have been\ndiscouraged from looking for a job.\n6\n\nSee “2015 Small Business Credit Survey: Report on Employer Firms,” Federal Reserve Banks of New York,\nAtlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis, March 2016. Other information about the\nsurvey is available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/community-development/small-business/about-the-joint-smallbusiness-credit-survey/2015-joint-small-business-credit-survey.aspx.\n\n\f7\nSo far this year, firms have added slightly more than 1.8 million payroll jobs, or around 180,000 jobs per\nmonth. That’s well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from 75,000 to 120,000\nper month depending on what one assumes about labor force participation. Demographic factors,\nincluding the aging of our population, have resulted in a downward trend in labor force participation,\nwhich is one of the reasons trend employment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago.\n\nAs labor market progress has been made, we have been hearing increasingly from our labor and business\ncontacts across a broad set of industries that firms are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in\nhigh-skilled occupations and in lower-skilled jobs, and that they are responding by raising wages. Now\nthose anecdotal reports are showing through to the wage data where measures such as the employment\ncost index and average hourly earnings are accelerating moderately from year-ago levels.\n\nI expect to see the labor market continue to tighten somewhat over the next couple of years. Although\npayroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace given the progress that’s already been\nmade, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the\nunemployment rate to stay below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\nSo in my view, we have met the maximum employment part of our monetary policy dual mandate; that is,\nmaximum employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can achieve.\n\nIn saying that, I certainly do not want to underestimate the difficulty in finding work that many people\nhave had and some continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced by\ndifferent demographic groups in the U.S. Technological advances and globalization are changing the\nnature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. While the overall economy will\nbenefit from these forces, many individuals and some regions are adversely affected by these structural\ntrends. Government policies and programs, and public-private partnerships, can and should be brought to\nbear to help people and communities make the transition.\n\n\f8\nA promising start is being taken right here in Pittsburgh to help ensure that people are developing the\nskills that will be needed in the workforce of the future, and that those providing the education and\ntraining understand what those jobs will be. Earlier this year, the Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment published an in-depth analysis of the expected supply and demand for labor in the\nPittsburgh region over the next decade and made a number of recommendations to help the region prepare\nfor the coming changes.7 One recommended initiative would create a digital career awareness hub to help\nteachers and students in kindergarten through high school better match curriculum offerings and choices\nto the skill sets in demand in the future. Another would create a digital jobs database to make it easier to\nmatch those with particular skills to employers currently in need of those skills. A further\nrecommendation is to focus resources on high-growth “opportunity occupations,” positions that pay\nhigher than the median wage but don’t require a bachelor’s degree. This diverse group of occupations\nincludes certain jobs in health care, transportation, and bookkeeping.8\n\nThe Federal Reserve, through its Community Development function, has a role to play in easing these\ntypes of transitions. Our objective analysis can help in evaluating the pros and cons of various policies\nand programs, and provide guidance on how to best scale-up those programs found to be most effective.\nAlthough I don’t believe monetary policy is the right tool for solving the longer-run workforce\ndevelopment issues facing our economy, I do believe monetary policy can positively contribute by\nfostering conditions to ensure that the economy achieves an economic expansion that endures. This\neconomic stability will help those demographic groups – minorities, older workers, and lower-income\npeople – who are disproportionately harmed by economic downturns.\n\n7\n\n“Inflection Point: Supply, Demand and the Future of Work in the Pittsburgh Region,” report prepared by Burning\nGlass Technologies and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning with Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment, May 2016.\n8\n\nResearch by the Federal Reserve suggests that even in opportunity occupations, employers are demanding higher\nlevels of skills than they did in the past, both technical skills and so-called soft skills such as being able to handle\nambiguity and to effectively communicate. See “Identifying Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest\nMetropolitan Economies,” Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta, September 2015.\n\n\f9\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s\ntarget of 2 percent for a while, but it has picked up over the past year and I believe the conditions are in\nplace for a return to 2 percent over the next couple of years. As the drags from earlier declines in oil\nprices and non-petroleum imports have dissipated, year-over-year headline inflation measures have\nmoved up, from the very low levels recorded last year to over 1 percent in recent months. To get a better\nsense of the underlying trend in inflation, economists often look at measures that smooth through or strip\nout some of the more volatile components. These include core PCE inflation and trimmed-mean PCE\ninflation, which are gradually nearing the 2 percent goal, as well as core CPI inflation and median CPI\ninflation, which are now over 2 percent. Indeed, the Cleveland Fed median CPI measure has been above\n2-1/4 percent all year, and near 2-1/2 percent for the past several months.9\n\nWhat people think inflation will be over the long run – what economists call inflation expectations – is an\nimportant factor that influences the path inflation actually takes. If people are confident that the Fed will\nset monetary policy to achieve 2 percent inflation over the long run – in other words, if longer-run\ninflation expectations are stable – then they will look through shocks that temporarily raise or lower\ninflation when they make financial or business decisions. This helps inflation move back toward the\ntarget after the effect of the shock dissipates. To assess whether inflation expectations are stable, we look\nat a number of different measures and indicators. Some are based on surveys of consumers and of\nprofessional forecasters; others are based on financial market data. The Cleveland Fed’s expectations\nmeasure of five-year inflation, five years from now, which combines survey and market data, has been\nstable this year, in a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent.10 After dipping earlier in the year, other measures have\nrisen in recent weeks. Based on the various measures, in my view, long-run inflation expectations have\nbeen reasonably stable. This, along with evidence that inflation is moving up, the continued strength in\n9\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-anddata/median-cpi.aspx.\n10\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations measure is available at https://clevelandfed.org/ourresearch/indicators-and-data/inflation-expectations.aspx.\n\n\f10\nthe labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend all suggest that inflation is on a\npath of returning to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years.\n\nRegional growth and labor markets\nAs I mentioned at the start of my talk, assessing regional economic conditions plays an important role in\nsetting national monetary policy, so let me spend a few minutes discussing the Pittsburgh-area economy.\nThe Pittsburgh region has undergone the type of regional economic transformation I discussed earlier,\nmoving from an economy that was dependent largely on steel, coal mining, and heavy industry, to one\nthat has diversified into health care, education, financial services, and technology.11 This is a promising\ndevelopment because we have seen that regions that remain dependent on one particular industry have\nfared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their industrial bases and adapt to the\nchanging economy.\n\nThe path of the economic expansion in Pittsburgh reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks\nthat have hit the economy during the expansion. The Great Recession took its toll on the region, as it did\nin the rest of the nation, and the region is also sharing in the benefits of the expansion. Indeed, Pittsburgh\nwas an early achiever in the recovery.\n\nIn 2012, Pittsburgh was one of the first major U.S. metropolitan areas to see payroll jobs move back up to\npre-Great Recession levels. The U.S. as a whole didn’t achieve this milestone until mid-2014, and\nPennsylvania, not until 2015. But since 2012, job growth in Pittsburgh has been relatively flat, while jobs\nin Pennsylvania and the U.S. have been expanding. A similar story can be told about Pittsburgh’s\n\n11\n\nPittsburgh has a higher share of employment in the service-producing sector than does the U.S., and this share has\nrisen over time, from about 71 percent of employment in the 1990s to about 77 percent today. The comparable\nshares in the U.S. are 64 percent and 71 percent, respectively. The share of employment in the education and health\nservices component of services in Pittsburgh is higher than in the U.S., and it has shown considerable growth over\ntime. In Pittsburgh, this share rose from 17 percent in the 1990s to 21 percent today. The comparable shares in the\nU.S. are 11 percent and 16 percent, respectively. (Author’s calculations using payroll employment data from the\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\n\n\f11\nunemployment rate. After falling sharply from a peak of over 8 percent in 2010 to under 5 percent early\nthis year, the unemployment rate has moved up to 6 percent, about a percentage point higher than the\nnational level.\n\nSome of the recent weakness in the regional labor markets is related to the earlier drop in energy prices.\nThe Marcellus region is now the most important shale-based source of natural gas in the U.S., accounting\nfor about 40 percent of domestic natural gas from shale sources. As a result, among the 50 states,\nPennsylvania is now the second-largest producer of natural gas behind Texas. But while the region\ngained as the natural gas industry developed, the recent contraction in the industry has been a negative.\nOver 2014 and 2015, both natural gas prices and the number of active rigs in the Marcellus region were\ncut in half, resulting in considerable job losses and lower earnings. This year, natural gas prices have\nbegun to increase, and since the summer, the number of active rigs has picked up as well. Although\nAllegheny County is less exposed to the natural gas sector than other parts of the Marcellus region, it felt\nthe spillovers of lower energy prices, as well as slower global growth, both of which put a considerable\ndrag on the steel industry. Here, too, the modest rise in oil prices this year has been a positive\ndevelopment.\n\nAnother positive is the region’s well-educated workforce. Among the 100 largest metropolitan areas,\nPittsburgh ranks in the top half in terms of the percentage of its population holding a bachelor’s degree or\nhigher, and among people aged 25 to 34, its ranking rises to 12th out of 100.12 This bodes well because\nwhen it comes to the economic well-being of entire regions, many studies have documented the\nimportance of investments in human capital.13 As a home to strong universities and a well-educated\n\n12\n\nAccording to the 2015 data from the American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau, Tables B15001 and\nB15002, for the U.S. as a whole, about 31 percent of the population and about 34 percent of the population aged 25\nto 34 hold a bachelor’s degree or higher; for Pittsburgh, the comparable numbers are 33 percent and 46 percent,\nrespectively.\n13\n\nFor example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, education levels were consistently one\nof the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth. See “Altered States: A Perspective on 75\nYears of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005 Annual Report.\n\n\f12\nworkforce, Pittsburgh is already attracting and sustaining many of the businesses of the future. No doubt,\nthis made Pittsburgh an excellent choice to host this October’s White House Frontiers Conference on the\nfuture of innovation both in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nIn addition to a quality workforce, research shows that effective leadership can make a big difference in\nhow regional economies navigate the type of transition Pittsburgh has accomplished. I commend the\nAfrican American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania for its leadership in the region.\n\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy. All participants on the\nFOMC share the same objective – setting monetary policy to promote our longer-run goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. In setting monetary policy, we assess the realized progress the economy\nhas made on our goals and our expectation of further progress based on the economic outlook over the\nmedium run and the risks to the outlook.\n\nIn my view, economic developments have corroborated the Committee’s medium-run outlook that labor\nmarkets will continue to show strength, that growth will rebound to a pace at or slightly above trend, and\nthat inflation will gradually rise to our 2 percent target. We have seen sustained improvement in the labor\nmarket, which, in my view, is now basically at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary\npolicy can do, and inflation has been moving up closer to our goal. I view the risks to the outlook as\nbroadly balanced.\n\nThe current target range for our policy rate, the federal funds rate, is 1/4 to 1/2 percent, which is quite\naccommodative. When the Committee met in early November, it assessed that the case for moving the\npolicy rate up had continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further\nevidence of continued progress toward the dual-mandate objectives. I, and one of my colleagues,\ndissented from that decision, preferring to see a 25-basis-point rise.\n\n\f13\nI view a small step up in interest rates as appropriate, not because I want to curtail the expansion, but\nbecause I believe it will help prolong the expansion. We know that monetary policy affects the economy\nwith long and variable lags, so policy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. The\nlesson that policy should be forward looking is based on the history of poor outcomes when that strategy\nhasn’t been followed and we’ve fallen far behind the curve. If we delay too long and then find ourselves\nin a situation where the labor market becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and\nwe have to move rates up steeply, we could risk a recession, a bad outcome that disproportionately harms\nthe more vulnerable parts of our society. Delaying for too long might also induce investors to search for\nyield, raising risks to financial stability. I do not think we are behind the curve yet, but I think the risks to\nmacroeconomic stability and to financial stability will grow over time should we fail to take appropriate\naction given where we are on our goals and the current low level of our policy rate. I view another\nincrease in interest rates as a prudent step to take.\n\nI anticipate that a gradual upward path of policy is likely to be appropriate given economic developments.\nThat means that the policy rate won’t be moving up at each meeting and that policy will remain\naccommodative for some time, continuing to lend support to the economic expansion going forward. It\nwill allow us to recalibrate policy over time as we gain more insight into the underlying structural aspects\nof the post-crisis economy and as the economy evolves.\n\nConclusion\nBetween now and when the FOMC next meets in December, I will continue to assess economic and\nfinancial conditions to see if any change is warranted in my medium-run outlook. My colleagues on the\nFOMC will be doing that too, and, in December, the FOMC will provide a new set of forecasts\nsummarizing our current views on the economy and monetary policy. I look forward to the meeting, and\nI commend Chair Janet Yellen for fostering an atmosphere of serious deliberation and the free exchange\nof ideas in FOMC meetings. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe the history\n\n\f14\nof the Fed has shown that better policy decisions are made when a diversity of information and views is\nconsidered.\n\nSometimes I’m asked whether the FOMC routinely coordinates our monetary policy actions with those of\nother countries. The answer is no – we set our monetary policy to promote our goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability in the U.S.14 But we operate in a global economy and there are ties among\neconomies and financial markets, so we must consider economic and financial developments abroad to\nthe extent they affect the outlook for the U.S. economy. For example, weak growth abroad has been a\ndrag on our economy because it has meant weaker U.S. export growth. Similarly, the appreciation in the\nvalue of the dollar that began in mid-2014 put downward pressure on inflation by holding down import\nprices. So these developments factored into our assessment of appropriate monetary policy. U.S. fiscal\npolicy is also part of the economic environment. The prospects for some changes to fiscal and other\neconomic policies, such as infrastructure spending, tax code changes, immigration policy, and trade\npolicy, have likely increased. But the form any policy change will take, the timing of passage, and the\ntiming and size of the impacts are very uncertain at this point. When we gauge the effects of any\nforthcoming fiscal and other economic policy changes on the outlook for growth, employment, and\ninflation, the devil will be in the details.\n\nAs we gain more clarity about the policies that might be forthcoming, the FOMC will assess their effects,\nas well as the implications of economic and financial developments, on the medium-run economic\noutlook and appropriate monetary policy. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set course and we will\ncontinue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess the situation. As an FOMC\n14\n\nAn exception is that during times of extreme stress in financial markets, central banks have coordinated action to\npromote orderly market functioning. For example, during the financial crisis, the Fed, Bank of Canada, Bank of\nEngland, European Central Bank (ECB), and Swiss National Bank issued a joint statement announcing certain\nactions being taken to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets, including the authorization of\ntemporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines). (See the press release dated December 12, 2007:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20071212a.htm.) Another example was the\nannouncement of a reciprocal swap line between the Fed and the ECB after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. (See the\npress release dated September 13, 2001:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/2001/20010913/default.htm.)\n\n\f15\nmember, I will remain focused on and committed to setting monetary policy to promote the Federal\nReserve’s longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the public.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nShadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting\nNew York, NY\nOctober 7, 2016\n\n\f1\nVoltaire: Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.\n\nIntroduction\nI thank Mickey Levy and the Shadow Open Market Committee for inviting me to speak today. I have\nknown many of the Shadow Committee’s members for quite a long time – longer than I care to admit!\nOver the years, I have learned much from the position papers and conferences put together by this serious\ngroup of economists. I share their view that the active exchange of diverse ideas and careful deliberations\nultimately result in better policy decisions.\n\nToday, I would like to share my perspective as someone who has participated in some of those policy\ndecisions. I will comment on how I approach monetary policymaking in an uncertain world, review the\ntypes of uncertainty policymakers and economists need to deal with, and provide some recommendations\nfor improving monetary policy communications. Of course, the views I’ll present today are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nMonetary Policy Communications\nI believe monetary policy should be set based on the outlook for the economy over the medium run\nbecause this is the time horizon over which monetary policy can affect the economy. I focus on\nunderlying fundamentals in determining that medium-run outlook, and I have cautioned against overreacting to short-term fluctuations in the economic and financial data.1 I believe credible policy\ncommunications play a key role in policymaking. It has been well established that when the public has a\nclearer understanding about how monetary policy is likely to change as economic conditions evolve –\nwhether those changes in conditions are anticipated or not – monetary policy is more effective.\nPolicymakers can improve the public’s understanding by being clear about the goals of monetary policy,\n\n1\n\nSee Mester (April 1, 2016).\n\n\f2\nthose aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can’t influence, and the economic information that\ninfluences their forecasts and policy decisions, as well as by striving to be systematic in their policy\nresponses to changes in economic conditions that influence the outlook. When the public has a clearer\nunderstanding of the strategy monetary policymakers follow in normal times, not only will they be able to\nmake better financial and employment decisions, they will also understand when nonstandard monetary\npolicy action is required in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has taken many steps over time to improve its policy communications. Recent\nenhancements include the Chair’s press briefings four times a year, the Summary of Economic\nProjections, and the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which established an\nexplicit numerical goal for inflation.\n\nSo CNBC’s August Fed survey of market economists, fund managers, and strategists revealed to my mind\nsome pretty troubling news. Nearly half of the respondents reported that they believe current Federal\nReserve policy is mostly influenced by the current data, while less than 40 percent said they think it’s\ninfluenced by the medium-run outlook, and the rest were unsure. Sixty percent said they thought the Fed\ndoesn’t have a framework for deciding when to adjust policy, while only about a quarter of the\nrespondents said they think we do.\n\nThese results suggest to me that our policy communications could benefit from further enhancements.\nRecently, the FOMC has been describing its policymaking approach as being “data dependent.”\nUnfortunately, I believe there is some confusion about what the Fed actually means by “data dependent.”\nThis phrase has provided a transition from a period of explicit forward guidance, which was used as a\npolicy tool during the recession and early in the recovery, back to more normal policymaking times.2 But\nthis transition has posed somewhat of a challenge for FOMC communications. After the Great Inflation\n2\n\nSee Mester (November 20, 2014) for an overview of the use and evolution of forward guidance during the Great\nRecession and its aftermath.\n\n\f3\nof the 1970s, the FOMC became more predictable and systematic in how it reacted to changes in\neconomic activity and inflation.3 So the public had a pretty good sense of the Fed’s so-called reaction\nfunction and explicit forward guidance was rarely used. But the Great Recession required the Fed to\nbehave in a way quite distinct from its past behavior, and consequently, there is less understanding today\nabout how policymakers are likely to react to incoming economic information. Another factor\ncomplicating communication is that market participants prefer more explicit statements and less\nuncertainty. Thus, they may interpret the forecasts of the economy and the appropriate policy path as\nhaving more certitude than they actually do, which creates some communications issues when the\nforecasts and policy path change.\n\nThe concept of “data dependence” was meant to reinforce the idea that the economy is dynamic and will\nbe hit by economic disturbances that can’t be known in advance. Some shocks will result in an\naccumulation of economic information that changes the medium-run outlook for the economy and the\nrisks around the outlook in a way to which monetary policy will want to respond. But some of these\nshocks will not materially change the outlook or policymakers’ view of appropriate policy.\nUnfortunately, referring to policy as “data-dependent” could be giving the wrong impression that policy is\ndriven by short-run movements in a couple of different data reports. It may even suggest that policysetting is unsystematic in that the salient data reports may be viewed as changing from meeting to\nmeeting. We seem to find ourselves in a situation where market participants and commentators view any\none monthly or quarterly data release as the definitive piece of evidence that will result in either a policy\naction or no action.\n\nTypes of Uncertainty\nI mentioned that market participants tend to like certainty. But that applies more broadly – in many\nsituations, people prefer certainty. But the world is an uncertain place, and I think policymakers should\n3\n\nSee Taylor (2012).\n\n\f4\nfind a better way to acknowledge and convey that uncertainty. The 18th century French philosopher\nVoltaire said, “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.” In other words,\nwe might prefer to live in a world with more certainty, but we don’t. And to pretend we do live in such a\nworld is absurd – it can lead to bad outcomes.\n\nIn terms of economics and monetary policymaking, uncertainty comes into play in a number of ways. For\nexample, price stability and monetary policy are intimately linked, but setting monetary policy to achieve\nprice stability is not trivial. There is uncertainty around our measures and forecasts of inflation and about\nthe transmission of monetary policy to inflation. Recently, economists have been focusing on the\nuncertainty surrounding the underlying structural aspects of the economy, such as the longer-run levels of\nthe unemployment rate, trend output growth, structural productivity growth, and equilibrium interest\nrates, and their implications for monetary policy. As former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan\npointed out: “... uncertainty is not just a pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the\ndefining characteristic of that landscape.”4\n\nData uncertainty\nOne type of uncertainty economists and policymakers need to confront is data uncertainty. The U.S.\nstatistical agencies provide excellent service using best-practice techniques to gather large volumes of\nhigh-quality data on numerous aspects of the economy. But even the highest quality data are inevitably\nmeasured with some error and are sometimes subject to revision as more information is gathered. For\nexample, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 90 percent confidence interval due to sampling\nerror for the monthly change in nonfarm payroll employment is about plus or minus 115,000 jobs.5 Of\ncourse, users of the data know this, but we tend to ignore this issue. Charles Manski has written\n\n4\n5\n\nSee Greenspan (2004).\n\nThe surveys are also affected by nonsampling errors, including data collection errors or variation in response rates.\nSee Technical Notes in “The Employment Situation – August 2016,” Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of\nLabor.\n\n\f5\nextensively on what he calls the problem of “incredible certitude.”6 Downplaying the fact that the official\nstatistics are measured with error can lead less sophisticated users of the data to believe they are more\nprecisely measured than they actually are. Manski points out that the idea that economists, policymakers,\nand the statistical agencies should do much more to convey the sense of error around the statistics is not a\nnew idea. It was strongly encouraged more than 50 years ago by Oskar Morgenstern, a founder of the\nfield of game theory.7\n\nThings have improved since then. Revisions in some of the data reports, like GDP growth and\nemployment, routinely get media coverage, and a body of research investigating the implications of data\nrevisions for forecasting, structural modeling, and policy is growing.8 Still, it seems likely that the\nimprecision in some of the data and the difficulties in forecasting are not fully appreciated. This comes to\nlight every month in the days leading up to the release of the monthly employment report. Economists\nare polled to see what they expect the monthly number to be, and then when the report is released, the\nfinancial press often reports the number as good if it exceeds the consensus estimate or bad if it is weaker\nthan the consensus. Little attention is paid to the dispersion in the economists’ estimates in the first place,\nto the fact that the number in the release is measured with some error, or to the fact that even a job growth\nnumber that comes in less than analysts expected could be strong enough to put further downward\npressure on the unemployment rate.\nData revisions complicate making monetary policy in real time.9 PCE inflation, the measure the Fed uses\nfor its inflation goal, is subject to revision. For example, FOMC transcripts and minutes show that in\n\n6\n\nSee Manski (2011 and 2015).\n\n7\n\nSee Morgenstern (1950 and1963).\n\n8\n\nSee Croushore (2011) for a review of the literature on real-time data analysis.\n\n9\n\nAs discussed by Croushore (2011), the largest revision ever recorded for quarterly GDP growth was for the fourth\nquarter of 2008. The first release was made in January 2009 and showed GDP declining 3.8 percent at an annual\nrate. Just a month later, this number was revised down by 2.4 percentage points, to minus 6.2 percent, confirming\nthe extent of the worst recession since the Great Depression. In the third monthly release in March 2009, the number\nwas revised up a bit to minus 5.4 percent. With the benchmark revisions since then, the reading is now minus 8.2\n\n\f6\nearly 2002, policymakers were concerned about a drop in inflation. Ultimately, much of this drop was\nrevised away. Someone reading the transcripts today not knowing that the data were subsequently revised\ncould be quite confused by the discussion.\n\nMeasurement issues also affect some of the important constructs in macroeconomic models. In a number\nof papers, Athanasios Orphanides has laid out a convincing case that mismeasurement of slack and other\nunobservables like the natural rate of interest led to monetary policy mistakes that contributed to the Great\nInflation of the 1970s. He argues that these mismeasured concepts continue to unduly influence monetary\npolicy today and can lead to poor policy decisions that induce undesirable fluctuations in the\neconomy.10, 11\n\nModel uncertainty\nEconomists and policymakers also need to confront model uncertainty.12 Even if we were all to agree on\none model of the economy – a heroic assumption to be sure – the parameters governing how economic\nagents interact with one another would be estimated from the data and would not be precisely known. So\nthere would be uncertainty around forecasts derived from the model and the appropriate policy stance\nbased on the model, even if we knew with certainty what shocks were going to hit the economy in the\nfuture.\n\nOf course, the situation is even more complicated because economists don’t agree on a single model or a\nsingle set of assumptions within a general class of models. Often, there are competing models or different\npercent. (Data are available in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Real-Time Data Set for\nMacroeconomists.)\n10\n\nSee, for example, Orphanides and Van Norden (2005) and Orphanides (2015).\n\n11\n\nA thorny issue related to data uncertainty is uncertainty about the nature of the shocks hitting the economy. For\nexample, to understand the implications of incoming data on jobs, one needs to understand the nature of the factors\naffecting recent employment growth – are they demand-side factors like growth in output or supply-side factors like\na mismatch between skills available and skills in demand?\n12\n\nDennis (2005) presents a useful nontechnical summary of some of the types of uncertainty confronting monetary\npolicymakers.\n\n\f7\nsets of assumptions that are consistent with the observable data.13 Before the financial crisis, we may\nhave convinced ourselves that we could rely on representative agent models, linearized around a steady\nstate, with one interest rate. But the nature of the financial crisis pointed out the inadequacies of these\nmodels for understanding the interplay between the real economy and financial markets. The good news\nis that macroeconomic models are being developed that include more than just a rudimentary financial\nsector, and policymakers at the Fed and elsewhere are broadening the set of models we routinely\nconsult.14 Nonetheless, while our usual models can give us a pretty good sense of the employment and\ninflation costs of a change in monetary policy, we are still less able to quantify the financial stability costs\nand benefits of particular monetary policy paths. So we need to remain humble, and continue to examine\nthe economy’s performance to assess these costs and benefits.\n\nAddressing Uncertainty in Theory and Practice\nEconomists and forecasters have developed several techniques to handle uncertainty. Bayesian\nestimation techniques are commonly used in macroeconomic modeling to handle parameter uncertainty.\nGiven the model and the available data, these Bayesian methods yield probability distributions of\nforecasts that reflect both uncertainty about the future evolution of the economy and uncertainty about the\nparameters of the model. Model uncertainty is more difficult to address. But if we know the set of\nrelevant models and can write them down, then Bayesian techniques can also be used to address model\nuncertainty. In particular, Bayesian techniques can be used to average across multiple models, based on\n13\n\nManski (2011) calls different assumptions generating different projections “dueling certitudes.” He posits a “Law\nof Decreasing Credibility: The credibility of inference decreases with the strength of the assumptions maintained.”\nStrong assumptions can yield more definitive conclusions, but if the assumptions are questionable, then those\ndefinitive conclusions will be questionable as well.\n14\n\nThe FOMC has been expanding the models it routinely examines as a part of the policymaking process. These\ninclude the Board of Governors staff’s large-scale FRB/US model and two smaller-scale dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium (DSGE) models called EDO and SIGMA, as well as various models maintained and utilized at the\nFederal Reserve Banks. See the discussion of the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing research on DSGE models in\nthe Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 21-22, 2011. Academic researchers are now building\nmodel archives to aid in the systematic comparison of empirical results and policy implications across a large set of\neconomic models as an aid to policy analysis. One such archive, The Macroeconomic Model Data Base (MMB),\nheaded by Volker Wieland of Goethe University Frankfurt, currently includes 61 models. See The Macroeconomic\nModel Data Base (MMB) web page at www.macromodelbase.com for more information on the database; for a\ndiscussion of the approach, see Wieland, Cwik, Müller, Schmidt, and Wolters (2012).\n\n\f8\nthe models’ relative abilities to fit the data. In this model-averaging approach, appropriate policy would\nbe the policy that performs well on average across the set of models but is not necessarily the best policy\nin any one particular model.15 A related literature studies setting policy using simple rules that are robust\nacross a variety of model and economic circumstances.16\n\nIn some cases, it may not be easy to write down all the models that could characterize the economy or\nassociate probabilities to various outcomes. Nobel Laureates Tom Sargent and Lars Hansen have\ndeveloped a robust-control approach that can address model uncertainty and misspecification even in\nthese circumstances. Their approach confronts head-on the fact that models are only an approximation to\nreality and they show the benefit of choosing the policy that produces the best outcome in the worst-case\nscenario across models. The policymaker doesn’t necessarily expect the worst, but she should plan\nagainst it because doing so will lead to acceptable performance across a wide array of circumstances.17\n\nFrom a practical policymaking standpoint, I find that looking at forecasts from several models gives me a\nbetter sense not only of the most likely forecast but also the risks around the forecast. I don’t believe we\nare at the state of knowledge where a single policy rule can be used to set policy because no rule works\nwell enough across a variety of economic models and in a variety of economic circumstances. But I do\nfind it useful to look at the outcomes of an array of simple, robust monetary policy rules as a benchmark\nagainst which to assess current policy. The Cleveland Fed website now publishes the outcomes of seven\nsimple monetary policy rules based on three publicly available forecasts.18\n\n15\n\nBernanke (2007) discusses these techniques in an accessible way. See Waggoner and Zha (2012) for an\napplication.\n16\n\nSee, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2002 and 2007).\n\n17\n\nSee Sargent (1998) and Hansen and Sargent (2007 and 2011). As discussed in Hansen and Sargent (2001),\nBrunner and Meltzer (1967) were early proponents of using a min-max strategy for handling model ambiguity.\n18\n\nSee “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. In addition to posting current\noutcomes for the set of rules, the web page includes a tool that allows the user to customize the rules and the\nforecasted inputs into the rules to generate alternative policy paths.\n\n\f9\nDespite the diversity across the outcomes, I find that the rules provide some discipline in systematically\nrelating incoming data to policy decisions: if the current policy stance is quite different from what the\nrules suggest, one must carefully consider the factors that support that deviation. One caveat of looking at\nthe outcomes of several models and several rules is that you want to be consistent about it. You must\nguard against changing which model or rule you favor merely because it happens to produce results that\nconfirm your intuition or preferred policy stance at the time.\n\nIn terms of policy responses to uncertainty, some results in the literature suggest that when policymakers\nconfront more uncertainty either in their data or models, they should be more cautious in acting, that is, be\nmore inertial in their responses.19 However, subsequent research has shown that this is not generally true.\nFor example, Sargent (1998) points out that caution does not necessarily mean doing less. When there’s\nuncertainty, it might be better in some cases for policymakers to act more aggressively, not less, because\naggressive and preemptive action can prevent the worst-case outcomes from actually coming about.20\nAnother factor that can affect whether the policymaker should be inertial or not is the public’s\nunderstanding of the policymaker’s reaction function and the policymaker’s commitment to following\nthat reaction function. For example, if the policymaker hasn’t effectively communicated, retaining a very\naccommodative monetary policy stance might be interpreted as signaling a gloomy economic outlook\nrather than as a preemptive move against downside risk.21 This points out the importance of clear\ncommunications, the starting point for this talk and where I’d like to conclude.\n\n19\n\nAoki (2003) studied the optimal policy response when data are measured with error and concluded that the degree\nof response to a variable in the policy rule should be less the higher the variable’s measurement error. Brainard\n(1967) studied optimal policy in response to a shock when there is uncertainty about the effect of policy on the\neconomy and concluded that policy should respond less when there is uncertainty than when there is no uncertainty.\nThis result has been shown not to be general across models.\n20\n\nGiannoni (2002 and 2007) shows policymakers averse to uncertainty will react more strongly to fluctuations in\ninflation and the output gap than if there were no uncertainty. They would put more weight on stabilizing inflation\nand the output gap and less weight on stabilizing the nominal interest rate.\n21\n\nSee Woodford (2012).\n\n\f10\nThree Recommendations for Monetary Policy Communications\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but I think we would clarify things for the public by acknowledging\nuncertainty and focusing attention on the medium-run outlook rather than on short-run fluctuations in the\ndata. Let me offer three recommendations that I believe would improve FOMC communications.\n\nFirst, the FOMC should publish confidence bands around the projections in the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP). Four times a year, the FOMC summarizes Committee participants’ projections of\noutput growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the associated appropriate policy path. For the past\nyear, we have also been providing the median projections across the participants for each variable.\nAlthough it is a topic of discussion, the FOMC does not publish error bands around these projections.22 I\nbelieve we could improve our communications if we did.23 Confidence bands are a standard part of\nforecasting, illustrating that the future is inherently uncertain. The confidence bands would give the\npublic a better sense of the normal type of forecast variation one should expect to see, so they could better\nunderstand some of the risks around the forecast and subsequent changes in the forecast. The confidence\nbands would also be a helpful reminder to policymakers to remain humble about our ability to know the\nfuture with much certainty.\n\nAlthough the public at-large may not be aware of it, the Committee does publish a summary table of the\naverage historical errors of projections from 1996 through 2015 made by various private and government\nforecasters. We can apply historical errors to the median FOMC projections to get an approximate,\nsymmetric 70 percent confidence interval for each variable, as illustrated in Figures 1-4.24\n\n22\n\nSee Minutes of the FOMC Meeting of January 26-27, 2016.\n\n23\n\nThe Bank of Canada, Bank of England, European Central Bank, Norges Bank, and the Riksbank all publish a\nforecast with error bands as part of their communications; in some cases, it is the policymakers’ forecast, and in\nother cases, it is a staff forecast.\n24\n\nBecause the September SEP has not yet been published, in the figures, the confidence bands for GDP growth, the\nunemployment rate, and inflation are constructed using the average historical projection errors in Table 2 in the June\nSEP, and the confidence band for the fed funds rate is constructed using the band illustrated in Chair Yellen’s\nspeech in Jackson Hole in August (Yellen, 2016).\n\n\f11\n\nAs you can see in Figure 3, the error band around the inflation forecast one or two years out is about 1\npercentage point. Keeping those confidence bands in mind helps one to judge progress toward our policy\ngoals. In addition, the figure clearly shows that even though the dispersion across FOMC participants\noften gets media attention, it is actually quite narrow when compared with the confidence band around the\ninflation forecast.\n\nThe federal funds rate path differs from the other variables in the SEP because policymakers choose the\npath. But because there is uncertainty around each participant’s projections of growth, the unemployment\nrate, and inflation, there is also uncertainty around the appropriate policy path. Providing a confidence\nband would help remind people that the median policy path in the SEP is not meant to be a firm\ncommitment on the part of the FOMC. Instead, policy should be expected to respond to changes in\neconomic and financial conditions that materially affect the medium-run outlook. As you can see in\nFigure 4, the range of reasonable outcomes for the policy path is actually quite wide, and considerably\nwider than some of the variation we’ve seen in the SEP policy path over time, even though those shifts\nhave often drawn considerable media attention.\n\nMy second recommendation is that the FOMC present a forecast that could serve as the benchmark for\nunderstanding the FOMC’s policy actions and post-meeting statements. The median paths in the SEP are\na step in that direction, but the variables are not linked. So, for example, there is no guarantee that\nsomeone projecting the median inflation path would necessarily be projecting the median output path.\nPublishing a benchmark forecast – with error bands – as do many other central banks would make it\nsomewhat easier to explain how the economic outlook is dependent on the future path of monetary policy.\nIn 2012, the FOMC experimented with developing a forecast representing the consensus of the\n\n\f12\nCommittee.25 It proved difficult to reach a consensus on a consensus forecast, but I think we should\ncontinue to pursue this.26 In the meantime, we should consider publishing the staff’s forecast.\nPolicymakers need not agree with the staff’s forecast, but they could use it as a benchmark against which\nto explain how and why their forecasts may differ.\n\nMy third recommendation pertains to our post-meeting FOMC statement. While it continues to serve the\nCommittee well, I believe the statement could do more to dissuade people from thinking short term, and\nto illuminate that policy is being formulated based on the medium-run outlook, the risks around the\noutlook, and the progress on our policy goals. The statement is an important part of FOMC\ncommunications, providing information on the mapping from economic conditions to the outlook, and\nthen to policy actions. The current formulation of the statement does highlight factors that are important\nin that reaction function, namely, the medium-run outlook for inflation, resource utilization, and inflation\nexpectations. But the first paragraph in the statement tends to concentrate on changes in economic\nconditions since the last FOMC meeting, which can spur a short-run focus. The facts in the paragraph are\nalways true – investment has been soft, unemployment is little changed, employment growth has been\nsolid, on average, and so on. But we could improve the public’s understanding of our monetary policy\nstrategy if we provided more interpretation of those facts – namely, our assessment of how recent changes\nin economic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks around that\noutlook, and therefore the appropriate policy path. We could also strive for more consistency about the\nconditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy so that the public would get a better\nsense of the Committee’s reaction function over time.\n\n25\n\nSee the minutes from the July, September, and October 2012 FOMC meetings\n(www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm#11655).\n26\n\nHetzel (2016) provides one proposal for how this might be implemented.\n\n\f13\n\nConclusion\nUncertainty is the norm, not the exception. I believe it will serve both the public and the FOMC well if\nwe more explicitly acknowledge this uncertainty. Doing so will help the public evaluate whether changes\nin economic conditions or in the outlook are significant or not. It will help them see that the economy\noften evolves differently than the modal forecast, and that it is better to focus on the medium run than on\nshort-run fluctuations in the data. It will give them a better sense of what policymakers mean when they\nsay their policy is data-dependent. My suggestions here are simple ones, but I believe they are consistent\nwith the evolutionary changes the FOMC has been making on its journey to increased transparency.\nAlthough policy communications will likely always remain somewhat of a challenge, I believe striving\nfor even clearer communications is worth the effort.\n\n\f14\nReferences\nAoki, Kosuke, “On the Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Noisy Indicators,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 50, April 2003, pp. 501-523.\nBernanke, Ben S., “Monetary Policy under Uncertainty,” remarks at the 32nd Annual Economic Policy\nConference, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, October 19, 2007.\nBrainard, William C., “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” American Economic Review: Papers\nand Proceedings 57, May 1967, pp. 411-425.\nBrunner, Karl, and Allan H.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGreater Cleveland Partnership Middle-Market Forum\nCleveland, OH\nSeptember 28, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Since my arrival in Cleveland\nover two years ago, I have seen first-hand the important role that the Greater Cleveland Partnership plays\nin supporting the growth of our regional economy and I am very proud to serve on its board. Of course,\nas president of one of the country’s 12 Federal Reserve Banks I have a keen interest in our regional\neconomy. As we gather in the lobby of this historic building, it is hard not to think back to a time more\nthan 100 years ago and applaud the Congressmen – yes, they were all men back then – who came up with\nsuch an ingenious design for our Federal Reserve System. Congress established the Fed in 1913 as a\ndecentralized central bank, independent within the government but not independent from the government.\nThe Fed’s design balances public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street\nconcerns. I believe the design has served the country well by allowing monetary policy decisions to take\ninto account the diversity of the American economy and its people.\n\nAs president of the Cleveland Fed, I make it a point to bring the economic information we have garnered\nfrom business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the District to meetings of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The\ninsightful regional perspectives provided by our directors, advisory council members, and other regional\ncontacts, along with economic and financial data and analysis, all play an important part in the Fed’s\nsetting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price\nstability. I commend Chair Janet Yellen for fostering an atmosphere of serious deliberation and the free\nexchange of ideas in FOMC meetings. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe\nthe history of this institution has shown that better policy decisions are made when a diversity of\ninformation and views is considered.\n\nSome of that diversity was on display when the FOMC met last week and decided to maintain its policy\nrate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. I, along with two of my colleagues, dissented from that consensus decision in\n\n\f2\nfavor of moving the federal funds rate up by 25 basis points. The reason I believe a gradual upward path\nof policy continues to be appropriate and that I favored taking another step on that path in September is\nbecause of the realized progress the economy has made on our monetary policy goals and my expectation\nof further progress. That expectation is based on my outlook for the economy. So today, I would like to\ndiscuss my outlook for both the national and regional economy and my views on monetary policy. Of\ncourse, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. Household balance\nsheets have improved greatly since the recession and households feel confident enough to be borrowing\nagain. We have seen sustained progress in the labor market and wages are gradually beginning to\naccelerate. Oil prices remain low, and while the decline in energy prices has been a considerable negative\nfor the energy-producing sector, it has benefited households and the many businesses that consume\nenergy. The underlying strength in the economy is demonstrated by the resiliency it has shown through a\nnumber of bumps along the road of expansion. Some of the recent bumps include the gyrations in\nfinancial markets at the beginning of the year, the slowdown in growth in China, economic weakness in\nEurope, the large appreciation of the dollar between mid-2014 and the start of this year, and the\nuncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union.\n\nAll forecasts carry risk, and sometimes it is difficult to extract the signal about where the economy is\nheaded from noisy economic and financial market data. With those usual caveats, my modal forecast is\nthat over the next couple of years, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longerrun trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will move further below its\nlonger-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually\nreturn to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\n\n\f3\nEconomic growth\nU.S. output growth in the first half of the year was quite slow, coming in at only around 1 percent. Much\nof that sluggishness was due to a decline in business inventories, and so GDP growth underestimated the\nunderlying strength in demand. Based on incoming data, growth is poised to rebound in the second half\nof the year. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, has been a driver of\ngrowth and I expect that to continue. Improving household balance sheets, growth in personal income,\nlow borrowing rates, and low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending.\n\nThe housing sector is gradually improving and I expect activity in the sector will continue to expand at a\nsustainable pace. The monthly home sales numbers have been volatile from month-to-month, reflecting a\nmixture of supply and demand factors. Builders have been telling us that they are having trouble finding\nqualified workers in some of the construction trades and they are cautiously avoiding over-building,\nhaving learned from the housing boom and crash. Mortgage rates are low, but households are being\ncareful not to take on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending but to those with\ngood credit quality.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak, and this weakness is somewhat of a\npuzzle. Given the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014, it’s not surprising that firms in the drilling and\nmining sector, their suppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector were hurt. We\nhave seen the effects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production, which supplies the\nenergy industry, has been down and other firms tied to energy have cut jobs and reduced investment. But\neven outside of the energy sector, business investment has been soft despite generally accommodative\nfinancial conditions. Manufacturing firms are telling us they are investing, but mainly to sustain current\noperations rather than to expand. Some of the softness in investment reflects weak demand outside of the\nU.S., which has hurt U.S. exports. Other firms seem to be using the low interest rate environment to buy\n\n\f4\nback stock rather than to expand plant and equipment spending. More generally, there just seems to be a\nsense of caution on the part of firms.\n\nI expect investment to begin to pick up with economic growth. But the weakness in investment and the\nassociated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of the U.S. economy.\nStructural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output and increases in\nliving standards. And a key determinant of productivity growth is investment in physical and human\ncapital. Labor productivity growth has risen at an annual rate of only one-half percent over the past five\nyears. Part of this weakness is cyclical; some of it reflects longer-run demographics, including the aging\nof the population, and some of it likely reflects difficulties measuring productivity in the service sector,\nincluding intellectual property and information technology. It is difficult to forecast productivity growth,\nso the recent softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it’s\nthe latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth\nI’ve been assuming.\n\nMonetary policy cannot affect these longer-term structural aspects of the economy, but it needs to\nconsider them. For example, in an economy with lower trend growth and productivity, the average level\nof interest rates that balances supply and demand – what economists call the neutral rate of interest – will\nbe lower. But just because monetary policy can’t move the trend growth rate higher doesn’t mean there\naren’t other steps the country can take to address these longer-run issues: policies that encourage\ninvestments in technology and human capital, tax and regulatory changes, and longer-run fiscal policy\nshould all be under consideration.\n\nAs this brief overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But\noverall, economic growth has proven to be resilient and I expect growth over the next two years to be at\n\n\f5\nor slightly above a trend of around 2 percent. The pace of growth, while lower than in other expansions,\nhas been sufficient to generate significant and sustained progress in labor markets.\n\nLabor markets\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about\n10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its\npeak of 10 percent in late 2009. The past two years have also seen significant improvements in other\ngauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time workers who\nwould rather work full-time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job.\n\nSo far this year, firms have added over 1.4 million payroll jobs, an average of about 180,000 jobs per\nmonth. That’s well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from 75,000 to 120,000\nper month. We are increasingly hearing from businesses across a broad set of industries that they are\nhaving trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skilled occupations and in lower-skilled jobs. And\nwe are now beginning to see firms respond by raising wages.\n\nI expect to see the labor market continue to tighten. Although payroll job growth is projected to slow a\nbit from the current pace given the progress that’s been made, it will be sufficient to put further\ndownward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below 5 percent\nover the next two years.\n\nI do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession\nand slow recovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment\nsituation faced by different demographic groups in the U.S. Technological advances and globalization are\nchanging the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs.\n\n\f6\nI recently visited Hazard, Kentucky, a part of the Cleveland District in the heart of Appalachia. I spoke\nwith some coal miners who were graduating from an electrical-fiber optic lineman training program at the\nHazard Community and Technical College. 1 All 28 graduates had jobs lined up or were entertaining\nseveral job offers. Although this is just one program, it does demonstrate that progress can be made in\naddressing the longer-run workforce development issues our country faces.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, through its Community Development function, has a role to play in easing such\nregional transitions. By objective analysis, we can help measure the scope of the problems communities\nin transition face, determine how best to scale up small, effective programs, and evaluate the pros and\ncons of alternative approaches and policies.\n\nMonetary policy has an important role to play in fostering conditions to ensure that the economy achieves\nan enduring economic expansion. This economic stability will help those demographic groups –\nminorities, older workers, lower-income people – who are disproportionately harmed by economic\ndownturns. But monetary policy cannot directly affect longer-run workforce development problems, and\nfrom the vantage point of our dual-mandated goals, I believe we are at maximum employment.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s\ntarget of 2 percent for quite a while, but it has picked up over the past year. I believe the conditions are in\nplace for a gradual increase in inflation back to 2 percent over the next couple of years. The current low\ninflation rate partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the price of oil and other commodities, as\nwell as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down import prices. As these effects have worked\n1\n\nThe program is part of Kentucky’s Hiring Our Miners Everyday, or H.O.M.E., program, which is housed within\nthe Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program and is funded by an emergency grant from the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor.\n\n\f7\nthemselves through, headline PCE and CPI inflation, measured year-over-year, have moved up from the\nvery low levels recorded last year to around 1 percent in recent months. To get a better sense of the\nunderlying trend in inflation, economists often look at other measures of inflation that smooth through or\nstrip out some of the more volatile components. These include core PCE inflation and trimmed-mean\nPCE inflation, which are both at 1.6 percent and gradually nearing the 2 percent goal, as well as core CPI\ninflation and median CPI inflation, which are now over 2 percent. Indeed, the Cleveland Fed median CPI\nmeasure has been above 2-1/4 percent all year, and at or above 2-1/2 percent for the past four months. 2\n\nStable long-run inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. We look at a\nnumber of different indicators of inflation expectations. Some are based on surveys of consumers and of\nprofessional forecasters; others are based on financial market data. The Cleveland Fed’s expectations\nmeasure of five-year inflation, five years from now, which combines survey and market data, has been\nstable this year, in a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent. 3\n\nReasonably stable long-run inflation expectations, evidence that inflation is moving up, continued\nstrength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend all suggest that inflation\nis on a path of gradually returning to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years.\n\nRegional growth and labor markets\nBefore I turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy, let me talk about our\nregional economy. The Cleveland District comprises all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern\nKentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Our regional economy is quite diverse, but the\n\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-anddata/median-cpi.aspx.\n3\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations measure is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicatorsand-data/inflation-expectations.aspx.\n\n\f8\npath of economic expansion here and the outlook are similar to the nation’s. To be sure, our region tends\nto be more dependent on manufacturing than other parts of the country. For example, manufacturing\naccounts for 15 percent of private-sector jobs in Ohio compared to about 10 percent in the U.S. as a\nwhole. So the region has borne the brunt of the weakness in manufacturing. Similarly, the region had\nenjoyed the benefits of a sharp increase in production and employment in the oil and gas extraction sector\nas new technologies were brought to bear, but the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014 has resulted in a\nsignificant slowdown in natural gas and oil exploration in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, which\ninclude northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The weakness in the energy sector is expected to\npersist somewhat longer, and the longer-term shift away from coal as a source of energy will have lasting\neffects on the coal-producing parts of the region that have not diversified their economies. 4\n\nOn the other hand, the region has benefited from the strength in auto sales, construction, and the service\nsector, including health and education. We are seeing a modest pickup in regional manufacturing,\nparticularly in firms that are more focused on domestic markets and the auto sector. The auto industry\nrepresents a significant share of manufacturing in Ohio and Kentucky, and over the past few years,\nDistrict auto plants have produced about 17 percent of the nation’s autos and light trucks. As auto sales\nhave risen to record levels, regional production has risen as well. Our contacts in the District’s auto\nsector remain optimistic, even though the record sales pace is leveling off.\n\nHousing markets in the region have shown improvement over time. During the housing boom, we didn’t\nsee the sharp increases in home prices experienced in other parts of the country. But we did suffer from\n\n4\n\nFor further discussion of trends in the energy, steel, and auto sectors in the Cleveland Federal Reserve District, see\nMark E.

The situation has improved.\nResidential real estate prices in Ohio are now increasing in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range, with the usual\nvariation across local markets. And according to the Cleveland Fed’s Community Stabilization Index,\ncommunities across the Fourth District experienced increased housing market stability in 2015, with\nmortgage delinquencies and foreclosure rates down. 5 Residential builders tell us they are optimistic that\nregional housing markets will continue to strengthen.\n\nLike the nation, our region has seen considerable improvement in labor markets since the start of the\nrecovery. In Ohio, the unemployment rate peaked at 11 percent in December 2009, and is now down to\n4.7 percent. This is near the national average and quite a bit lower than the near 6 percent average Ohio\nexperienced during the last expansion. Since the start of the recovery, Ohio has had a net gain of a half\nmillion jobs, and payrolls have now surpassed their previous peak by more than 1 percent. People have\nbeen reentering the work force, and over the past year, payroll employment has risen nearly 1-1/2 percent\nin Ohio – a net addition of 78,000 jobs. Job growth here is somewhat slower than the national pace of\n1-3/4 percent, but we are doing considerably better than during the previous expansion, when\nemployment in Ohio was essentially flat.\n\nThis is all good news. But like the nation, the regional economy also faces longer-run challenges\nregarding investments in human and physical capital, as well as low levels of population growth and\nbusiness formation. These challenges will need to be addressed if we are to remain a region with a\nhealthy economy.\n\n5\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s Community Stabilization Index is a composite index that provides a relative measure of local\nhousing market conditions at the ZIP code level, with a particular focus on recovery potential. It is available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/community-development/community-stabilization-index.aspx.\n\n\f10\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy by first laying some groundwork. The theory and practice of central\nbanking provides several lessons for monetary policymakers. First, policymakers should be forwardlooking because monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags. This means policy\nactions need to be taken before our policy goals are fully met, based on the economic outlook over the\nmedium run and the risks around that outlook. Second, policymakers should strive to be consistent in\nhow they respond to economic conditions and to effectively communicate the rationale for their decisions.\nThis helps the public form expectations about the future path of policy and raises public confidence in the\npolicy itself. Third, policymakers should always remain humble about what they know about the\neconomy and how monetary policy can affect it. There is uncertainty around the outlook, around the\nmonetary policy transmission mechanism, and around underlying structural aspects of the economy, such\nas the longer-run levels of the unemployment rate, trend output growth, structural productivity growth,\nand equilibrium interest rates. Policymakers need to recognize that it is possible for the structure of the\neconomy to change, but they should not throw out all that’s been learned from past experience or be led\nastray by thinking this time is completely different.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, last week, the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at\n1/4 to 1/2 percent. In the Committee’s view, the case for an interest rate increase has strengthened but it\ndecided for the time being to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward the dual-mandate\nobjectives. According to the new projections, FOMC participants continue to anticipate that a gradual\nupward path of the policy rate will be appropriate over the next three years. But the consensus view was\nthat it was better not to take the next step on that path in September.\n\nI, and two of my FOMC colleagues, dissented from that decision, preferring to see a 25-basis-point\nincrease in September. All participants on the FOMC share the same objective – setting monetary policy\n\n\f11\nto promote our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability – even if we disagree from\ntime to time on the best way to achieve those goals.\n\nIn my view, economic developments have corroborated the Committee’s medium-run outlook that labor\nmarkets will continue to show strength, that growth will rebound to a pace at or slightly above trend, and\nthat inflation will gradually rise to our 2 percent target. We have seen sustained improvement in the labor\nmarket, which is now basically at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do,\nand inflation has moved up over the past year. The risks that have concerned the Committee, including\nthe volatility in financial markets at the start of the year, economic weakness abroad, and the aftermath of\nthe U.K. vote to leave the European Union, have subsided, and the economic expansion has proved to be\nresilient.\n\nI view another small step on the gradual upward path as appropriate, not because I want to curtail the\nexpansion, but because I believe gradually moving rates up as we continue to make progress on our goals\nwill help prolong the expansion. It is also consistent with the policy communications we have been\nissuing for quite a while. I note that the gradual path I’m anticipating means that policy will remain\naccommodative for some time, continuing to lend support to the economic expansion going forward. The\ngradual path will also allow us to recalibrate policy over time as we gain more insights into the underlying\nstructural aspects of the post-crisis economy.\n\nNow, one can always say it’s better to wait for more information before making a move, and a cautious\napproach has served us well so far during the expansion. But there are also risks to delaying for too long.\nIf we continue to delay even as we make further progress on our inflation goal and labor markets continue\nto tighten, we risk having to undertake a considerably steeper policy path later on. Such a strategy is\ninconsistent with what we have been communicating; it risks confusing the public about our policy\nrationale and undercutting the credibility of Fed communications. This would cause problems for future\n\n\f12\npolicymaking. In addition, if we delay too long and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor\nmarket becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up\nsteeply, we could risk a recession, a bad outcome that history tells us disproportionately harms the more\nvulnerable parts of our society. I think we also have to recognize that if we fail to exit gracefully from the\nnontraditional policy actions we took in the aftermath of the crisis – actions I thought were necessary and\neffective – we could jeopardize their use in the future, should the need arise again.\n\nFor these reasons, I favor taking the next step on the gradual path of rising interest rates. The lesson that\npolicy should be forward looking is based on the history of poor outcomes when that strategy hasn’t been\nfollowed. In the face of evidence that the economy is on track to meet our goals over the medium run,\nsometimes being prudent means moving the policy rate up.\n\nConclusion\nTwo years ago in one of my first media interviews after becoming president of the Cleveland Fed, I was\nasked where I saw myself on the avian spectrum – would I be a dove, who would tend to favor low\ninterest rates, or a hawk, who would tend to favor higher interest rates. My answer was that I’d prefer not\nbe thought of as either; instead, my hope was to be viewed as an owl. Of course, that’s not up to me to\ndecide – being thought of as an owl is my aspiration. But what I can do and will continue to do is explain\nto the public my view of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and the rationale for my policy\ndecisions. I view this as an essential part of Fed communications so that the public can hold us\naccountable for our policy decisions. I hope that you and our other regional contacts will continue to\ngenerously provide the Cleveland Fed with your perspectives on the regional economy. This regional\ninformation plays an important role in helping us to set national monetary policy in pursuit of the Federal\nReserve’s longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the public.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2016 Kentucky Summit on Philanthropy\nEconomic Transition: Leading Through Philanthropy\nThe Kentucky Philanthropy Initiative\nLexington, Kentucky\nSeptember 1, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Kentucky Philanthropy Initiative (KPI) for inviting me to be with you today, and for the great\npartnership KPI has forged with the Cleveland Fed as we work together to understand and find solutions\nto the economic challenges facing this region. I appreciate this opportunity not only to enjoy the beautiful\nbluegrass scenery but also to gather firsthand information about economic conditions in this part of the\ncountry. Yesterday I observed an electrical/fiber optic lineman training program at Hazard Community\nand Technical College and met with representatives of the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment\nProgram, the Foundation for Appalachian Kentucky, the Housing Development Alliance, and the\nMountain Association for Community Economic Development. These were very productive discussions.\n\nEastern Kentucky is part of the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which also includes the state of Ohio,\nwestern Pennsylvania, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. That’s a pretty diverse region,\nencompassing larger cities, small towns, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries and\noccupations. The Federal Reserve System, established by Congress more than 100 years ago, was\ndesigned in a way to ensure that the Fed’s decisions about monetary policy take into account this very\ndiversity. We recognize that our policy decisions affect Main Streets and communities all across the\ncountry. As the president of a Federal Reserve Bank, I make it a point to bring the economic information\nwe have garnered from business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the District to meetings of the\nFederal Open Market Committee. That’s the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The\ninsightful regional perspectives that our contacts provide, along with economic and financial data and\nanalysis, all play an important part in the Fed’s setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our\nstatutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhile most people associate the Federal Reserve with monetary policy, the Fed has had an interest in\ncommunity development issues for quite a long time. In 1981, the Fed created its Community Affairs\nfunction to provide technical training and support to depository institutions to bolster their compliance\n\n\f2\nwith the Community Reinvestment Act, a law that promotes equitable access to credit for all individuals\nand neighborhoods.\n\nFrom this targeted beginning, the Federal Reserve’s work in the area of community development has\nevolved and expanded, much as the nature of community development in general has changed over time.\nAs people in this room know, access to credit is but one factor – albeit an important one – in determining\nthe economic vitality of households and neighborhoods. Today, the Fed’s community development\nfunction is active in research and outreach concerning housing markets, workforce development,\neducation, health, and small business lending, among other issues.\n\nWhile the focus may have changed over time, one thing that hasn’t changed is the Federal Reserve’s\ncommitment to helping to identify effective policies and best practices for promoting economic progress\nin low- and moderate-income communities. The Cleveland Fed very much values the relationships we\nhave built with key philanthropic, government, and other organizations working on programs aimed at\nimproving the economic outcomes of people in eastern Kentucky. Those relationships were instrumental\nin informing our analysis of some of the community development efforts I’ll discuss today. I want you to\nknow that the Cleveland Fed’s work is just part of the initiatives taking place at the 12 Federal Reserve\nBanks across the country. For example, the Minneapolis Fed has established a Center for Indian Country\nDevelopment to forge partnerships between the Fed and other organizations to study business, housing,\nand educational issues affecting Native American communities. The Dallas Fed’s Colonia project is\nexamining infrastructure, housing, and economic opportunity efforts in the neighborhoods along the U.S.Mexico border. And the St. Louis Fed’s Delta Communities Initiative is working with distressed\ncommunities across the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta regions.\n\nThere are many other examples, but today I will focus on approaches and programs that are helping to\nmake a difference in regions like eastern Kentucky, regions that are undergoing significant economic\n\n\f3\ntransitions. Before I continue, let me note that the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEastern Kentucky in Transition\nEastern Kentucky, comprising 31 counties, has been facing economic challenges for some time. In 1964,\nPresident Lyndon Johnson knelt on the front porch of a Martin County family’s cabin as part of his\nadministration’s “War on Poverty” tour. A photograph of that meeting became an icon in the country’s\neffort to eradicate poverty.1 As discussed in two recent Cleveland Fed articles, while some progress has\nbeen made, the challenges remain substantial.2 In the 1960s, about 60 percent of families in eastern\nKentucky lived below the poverty line. Today that percentage has fallen to around 25 percent, but that is\nstill about twice as high as the national average and 9 percentage points higher than the rest of Kentucky.\nIn fiscal year 2016, the Appalachian Regional Commission has designated 26 of the 31 counties in eastern\nKentucky as distressed.3\n\nThe sources of eastern Kentucky’s difficulties are familiar to all of you. Over the past decade or so,\neastern Kentucky has lost more than 13,000 jobs; about half of those were jobs in coal mining. The\ndecline in employment has affected the regional economy in a number of ways. Coal miners earn nearly\ndouble the average annual income in eastern Kentucky: about $73,000 per year compared to $36,000 per\nyear. So the loss of those jobs has meant a sizable drop in local spending power. In addition, tax\nrevenues derived from the coal industry have fallen sharply as the level of coal production has fallen. For\n1\n\nThe photograph was reproduced in the Cleveland Fed’s 2006 Annual Report essay (see Mark Schweitzer and Peter\nRupert, “Understanding the Persistence of Poverty”) and in a joint report profiling 16 high-poverty communities,\nincluding Martin County, Kentucky, issued by the Federal Reserve and the Brookings Institution (see “The Enduring\nChallenge of Concentrated Poverty in America,” A Joint Project of the Community Affairs Offices of the Federal\nReserve System and the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, October 2008).\n2\n\nMatt Klesta documents economic trends in eastern Kentucky in “Eastern Kentucky: A Region in Flux,” Forefront,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, March 2, 2016, and “Comings and Goings in Eastern Kentucky,” Forefront,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, August 1, 2016.\n3\n\nSee ARC-Designated Distressed Counties, Fiscal Year 2016.\n\n\f4\nexample, the coal severance tax in Kentucky has dropped 40 percent in just the past three years. The\nweakened economy has exacerbated some social issues in the region. Eastern Kentucky has experienced\nthe pain of the country’s opioid epidemic. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, over the period 2000 to 2014, the age-adjusted death rate from drug overdoses more than\ndoubled, with opioids being the main driver of these deaths.4 According to this sad metric, in 2014,\nKentucky’s death rate from this cause was the fourth highest among the 50 states.\n\nThe economic challenges in eastern Kentucky are also reflected in population trends. While the rest of\nKentucky has gained population since 1980, population in eastern Kentucky has been fairly flat and has\neven begun to decline over the past five years as the coal industry has contracted. Deaths are now\noutpacing births, and net migration in eastern Kentucky has shifted from an inflow of around 1,300\npeople a year on average from 1995 to 2011 to an outflow of about 1,100 people a year on average since\nthen.5\n\n4\n\nSee Rose A. Rudd, Noah Aleshire, Jon E. Zibbell, and R. Matthew Gladden, “Increases in Drug and Opioid\nOverdose Deaths – United States, 2000-2014,” Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 64, pp. 1378-1382 (January\n1, 2016).\n5\n\nThese are Internal Revenue Service Migration data. See the August 1, 2016 article by Klesta referenced earlier.\n\n\f5\nFactors Supporting Regional Transformation\nEastern Kentucky is not alone in facing economic challenges, many of which arise from the\ntransformation being driven by technological change and globalization. In the Fourth Federal Reserve\nDistrict, regions that have been dependent on one particular industry like heavy manufacturing or oil have\nfared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their industrial bases and adapt to the\nchanging economy. Research and analysis by Federal Reserve staff and others have identified a number\nof specific factors that support regional economic transitions. The three I will discuss today are:\nleadership and collaboration, a skilled workforce, and infrastructure.\n\nLeadership and Collaboration\nEffective leadership can make a big difference in how regional economies navigate transitions. The\nBoston Fed examined small and mid-sized cities that lost manufacturing employment and found that\n“resurgent cities,” meaning those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree\nof leadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private\ncitizens, corporations, and government.6 But the researchers also found that to have an effect on\neconomic outcomes, leadership and collaboration must be part of long-lasting campaigns. There are no\nshortcuts or easy fixes.\n\nFortunately, we are seeing some encouraging signs of leadership and collaboration in eastern Kentucky.\nThis summit is a great example of a broad cross-section of funders coming together to support economic\ntransitions. The Kentucky Philanthropy Initiative is aligned with the Appalachia Funders Network and\nthe Appalachian Regional Commission, both of which are active partners of the Cleveland Fed, as well as\nthe Richmond and Atlanta Feds, whose Districts encompass parts of central Appalachia. In fact, Federal\n6\n\n“Reinvigorating Springfield’s Economy: Lessons from Resurgent Cities,” Public Policy Discussion Paper No. 096, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 1, 2009.\n\n\f6\nReserve staff members participate in four workgroups operated by the Appalachia Funders Network\nrelated to health, food systems, strengthening community capacity, and energy and natural resources. Our\nstaff members are actively engaged with our regional partners to aid in data analysis when possible and to\nfoster leadership connections and information sharing.\n\nLeadership and collaboration also affect the success of employers in recruiting newly trained workers into\ntheir industries. Cleveland Fed analysts undertook case studies of five sector-based initiatives across the\nFourth District.7 These sectors were health care in western Pennsylvania, information technology (IT) in\nnortheastern Ohio, advanced manufacturing in central Ohio, marine mechanics in northwestern Ohio, and\ncoal mining in eastern Kentucky. Four of these five initiatives provide direct training to workers, while\nthe IT initiative is focused on increasing and enhancing the pipeline of IT talent through deep employer\nengagement with educational institutions at all levels. The analysts found that successful programs\ninvolve employers who are actively and substantively engaged: they provide advice on curricula, directly\ninteract with students, and tend to come from the highest ranks of their organizations so that they are free\nto speak on behalf of the employers. The case studies also showed that relationships and trust among\nemployers and partners are important drivers of success. Trust is necessary because, in many cases, the\nemployers are competitors; sustained relationships among the many partners are important because they\ngive the initiatives time to evolve and grow.\n\nMany of you are probably familiar with an initiative called Shaping Our Appalachian Region, or SOAR.\nThis effort bears many of the leadership and collaboration qualities that are critical to supporting\neconomic transitions.8 Since its inception in 2013, SOAR has embarked on building a set of working\ncommittees that allow individuals and institutions to join together to steer the course of economic\n7\n\n“Addressing Employment Needs through Sector Partnerships: Case Studies from across the Federal Reserve’s\nFourth District,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, August 15, 2016.\n8\n\nSee http://www.soar-ky.org/ for more information.\n\n\f7\nrevitalization in the region. The leadership and collaboration displayed by SOAR are straight out of the\nresurgent cities’ playbook: the leaders involved in SOAR recognize that it is in their own best interest to\nsupport economic rebirth and that collaboration is essential because the process of economic transition is\nnecessarily complex. By providing an easy-to-access venue for eastern Kentucky’s organizations,\nbusinesses, civic leaders, and private citizens to come together and plan for a stronger economic future,\nSOAR also provides the essential foundation to effect change. One concrete example of success is the\nnew associate’s degree program in broadband technology at Big Sandy Community and Technical\nCollege. This is the first such program in Kentucky and only the third in the country. According to the\ncollege’s president, the program came about in large part because of the coordinated work of SOAR,\nKentucky public officials, and One East Kentucky, a nine-county regional organization comprising\nprivate businesses and local chambers of commerce.9\n\nA Skilled Workforce\nOne of the areas SOAR is targeting is workforce development, and wisely so. Just as investments in\nphysical capital, such as plants, equipment, and software, can make businesses more productive, so can\ninvestments in human capital – educational and training programs – that allow people to become and\nremain productive members of the modern labor force.\n\nWhen it comes to the economic well-being of entire regions, many studies have documented the\nimportance of investments in human capital. For example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a\n75-year period, education levels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each state’s per\n\n9\n\nSee “Board of Regents Approves Broadband Technology Degree Program at BSCTC,” Big Sandy News and\nEvents, March 11, 2016. The Kentucky Community and Technical College Board of Regents approved this new\nprogram in March 2016. The program will be divided into three tracks: broadband technician, broadband\ntelecommunications equipment installer, and broadband design and applications.\n\n\f8\ncapita income growth10 and that counties with higher levels of high school graduates tend to have lower\npoverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.11 A study by a Philadelphia Fed researcher\nfound that resilient regions, that is, regions that have been able to avoid persistent declines in population\nover the long run, tend to have a more educated population and a more diverse industry mix.12\n\nThe benefits of investing in human capital are also evident at the individual level. For individuals, better\neducation is correlated with lower levels of unemployment and higher wages. For example, at the\nnational level, the current unemployment rate for those with a college degree is 2.5 percent, compared to\n5.0 percent for those with a high school diploma, and 6.3 percent for those who didn’t graduate from high\nschool. The difference in wages between those with a college degree and those without, the so-called\nskill premium, has widened substantially over time, more than doubling since the 1970s. And over a\nlifetime, in present value terms, a college graduate can expect to earn nearly twice as much as a high\nschool graduate.13\n\nMost studies have tended to focus on the benefits of a college education because that’s where the data are\nmore readily available. But other approaches to workforce development are also needed. Technological\nchange and globalization have been changing the nature of the jobs available in the U.S. Those workers\nwho have been displaced from their current occupations, for example, coal miners and assembly line\nworkers, often need to retrain for the modern economy. Apprenticeships, certificate programs, and onthe-job training can all potentially play an important role in getting people back into productive jobs.\n10\n\n“Altered States: A Perspective on 75 Years of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005\nAnnual Report.\n11\n\nMark Schweitzer and Peter Rupert, “Understanding the Persistence of Poverty,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland 2006 Annual Report.\n12\n\nJeffrey Lin, “Regional Resilience,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper No. 13-1, December 17,\n2012.\n13\n\nKartik Athreya and Janice Eberly, “The College Premium, College Noncompletion, and Human Capital\nInvestment,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Working Paper 13-02R, February 2015.\n\n\f9\n\nThe Registered Apprenticeship program is administered by the Employment and Training\nAdministration’s Office of Apprenticeship within the U.S. Department of Labor, in conjunction with\nState Apprenticeship Agencies. The apprenticeship programs offer structured on-the-job training\ncombined with related technical instruction tailored to industry needs in a variety of occupations,\nincluding electricians, plumbers, truck drivers, and child care workers. One study of the program\ncovering 10 states, including Kentucky, found that the program has been highly effective in generating\nhigher incomes for participants in a cost-effective way.14 In the ninth year after enrollment, the average\nperson who had participated in the program was earning almost $6,000 more in annual salary than similar\nnonparticipants, and the difference in lifetime earnings amounted to about $98,000. These differences\nwere even greater for those who completed the apprenticeship programs. For Kentucky, data limitations\nprecluded looking at earnings in the ninth year after enrollment, but in the sixth year after enrollment, the\naverage participant in Kentucky was earning over $5,700 more per year than the average nonparticipant.\nThe study also concluded that the estimated social benefits of the program exceeded the social costs.15 In\nsum, the study’s evidence suggested that effective apprenticeships not only lead to higher earnings, but\nalso help people stay employed longer.\n\nWhile it is important to help people already in the labor force transition to other occupations in high\ndemand, it is also important to start training people still in school so that they can develop the skills for\nthe jobs of the future and to make sure that those providing that education and training understand what\n14\n\nMathematica Policy Research, “An Effectiveness Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis of Registered\nApprenticeship (RA) in 10 States,” Final Report July 25, 2012. The 10 states included in the study were Florida,\nGeorgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.\n15\n\nThe potential benefits considered included the increased productivity of a worker trained through the program and\ntheir reduced use of government support programs, including unemployment insurance, welfare, and food stamps.\nThe costs included the costs of administering the program at the federal and state levels, as well as the costs of\ncommunity colleges providing supportive technical training. Under a baseline scenario, the study estimated that\nover the career of an apprentice, the estimated social benefits would exceed the costs by about $124,000. Under\nmore conservative assumptions, the study estimated these net social benefits at about $49,000. See Mathematica\nPolicy Research, 2012.\n\n\f10\nthe jobs in demand will be. The Allegheny Conference on Community Development commissioned an\nin-depth analysis of the supply and demand for labor in the Pittsburgh region over the next decade.16 The\nresulting report made a number of recommendations to help prepare employers, current and future\nworkers, educators, and civic leaders for the coming changes. One initiative would create a digital career\nawareness hub for students and teachers in kindergarten through high school to better match curriculum to\nthe skill sets in demand in the future. Another would create a digital jobs database to make it easier to\nmatch those with particular skills to employers currently needing those skills. A further recommendation\nis to focus resources on high-growth “opportunity occupations,” positions that pay higher than the median\nwage but don’t require a bachelor’s degree. This diverse group of occupations includes certain jobs in\nhealth care, transportation, and bookkeeping. Research by the Federal Reserve suggests that even in\nopportunity occupations, employers are demanding higher levels of skills than they did in the past, so\naligning skill development with these types of jobs will need to be a priority.17 And it’s important to note\nthat not all the necessary skills are technical ones.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s case studies of sector-based training programs that I mentioned earlier found that\neven if a jobseeker meets the technical skill requirements for a position, lacking the necessary “soft skills”\ncan be a significant barrier to employment. By their very nature, soft skills, such as the ability to work in\nteams and effective communication, are difficult to measure, but studies are now examining the role of\ncharacteristics like persistence and other personality traits as they relate to labor market outcomes.18 The\nACT WorkKeys test attempts to measure foundational and “soft skills,” and Kentucky is using it as a\nmetric to help evaluate whether a community has the infrastructure and workforce sought by employers.\n16\n\n“Inflection Point: Supply, Demand and the Future of Work in the Pittsburgh Region,” report prepared by Burning\nGlass Technologies and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning with Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment, May 2016.\n17\n\n“Identifying Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies,” Federal Reserve Banks\nof Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta, September 2015.\n18\n\nPaul Tough discusses some of the research in How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of\nCharacter, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: New York, 2012.\n\n\f11\n\nAmong Kentucky’s most successful retraining efforts is the Hiring Our Miners Everyday, or H.O.M.E.,\nprogram. Housed within the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program , H.O.M.E. is funded\nby an emergency grant from the U.S. Department of Labor and, as its name implies, helps miners and\ntheir families affected by the decline in the coal industry. H.O.M.E. appreciates that displaced miners are\nfar from unskilled; rather they need the opportunity to hone their skills for different industries. For\nexample, the H.O.M.E. program puts out-of-work miners through a course to prepare them for work as\nelectrical utility linemen, a job that not only pays well, but also provides much-needed fiber optic lines to\nrural areas. As a result of this program, eastern Kentucky may be able to keep a share of its skilled\nworkforce in the region, thereby helping the local economy to grow. H.O.M.E. is also an example of\ncommunity leadership and collaboration in action, as it brings together a wide range of entities and\ninterlocking relationships, from the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce to Hazard Community and\nTechnical College. An important next step will be for the partners to undertake a focused evaluation of\nthe program so that we can all learn which specific strategies work and why they work, and which\nstrategies are less effective and therefore less deserving of continued investment.\n\nInfrastructure\nThe final factor I’ll discuss today that’s been found to help in revitalizing distressed communities is\ninvestment in infrastructure. In fact, infrastructure is a critical component of economies of all sizes. The\nAppalachian Development Highway System, started in 1965, is a key piece of eastern Kentucky’s\ninfrastructure. This system includes 3,000-plus miles of highways across 13 states and was designed for\nthe express purpose of linking otherwise isolated and distressed areas of Appalachia to the Interstate\n\n\f12\nHighway System. Several studies have documented that economic activity is higher in places connected\nby the highway.19\n\nOf course, in 2016, the regional infrastructure needs of vibrant businesses and households have expanded\nto include not only the physical highway but also the digital highway. Broadband internet access has\nbecome a necessity in our connected world. A recent report issued by Cornell University found that\nnonmetropolitan counties that have had a high rate of broadband adoption have also experienced higher\ngrowth in median household income and lower rates of job loss than similarly situated counties that have\nhad low broadband adoption.20 A 2013 federal government report on broadband access and adoption\nfound that adoption rates vary by household income levels: fewer than half of households with incomes\nbelow $25,000 a year use broadband at home, compared with over 90 percent of households with annual\nincomes exceeding $100,000.21 There is also wide disparity in broadband access, especially access to\nhigh-speed broadband, between rural and urban areas, putting the growth prospects of rural areas at a\ndisadvantage. Eastern Kentucky stands to benefit from KentuckyWired, a statewide effort to bring\nbroadband access to underserved areas in the state.\n\nI note that the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) provides a significant opportunity to boost programs\nlike this aimed at closing the digital divide. Recent revisions to the CRA rules recognize that a reliable\ncommunications infrastructure, such as broadband internet service, can help to revitalize or stabilize\nunderserved nonmetropolitan, middle-income areas. So depository institutions will now receive credit for\n\n19\n\nSome of these studies are summarized in “Appalachian Development Highway System Economic Analysis Study:\nSynthesis of Findings to Date,” a study prepared for the Appalachian Regional Commission by the Economic\nDevelopment Research Group, Inc., May 2016.\n20\n\nBrian Whitacre, Roberto Gallardo, and Sharon Strover, “Broadband’s Contribution to Economic Health in Rural\nAreas,” Issue Number 64, Research and Policy Brief Series, Community and Regional Development Institute,\nDepartment of Development Sociology, Cornell University, February 2015.\n21\n\nSee “Four Years of Broadband Growth,” Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Economic\nCouncil, The White House, Washington, D.C., June 2013.\n\n\f13\ninvesting in this infrastructure for the purposes of meeting the CRA requirement of serving the needs of\nlow- and moderate-income communities.22\n\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by noting that the economy has made significant strides in coming back from the Great\nRecession. The unemployment rates in both the nation and in eastern Kentucky are down about 5\npercentage points since their respective peaks during the recession. Accommodative monetary policy has\nprovided important support to the economy on this cyclical journey, helping to promote improving labor\nmarkets. But we need to recognize that the labor market outcomes for people in eastern Kentucky are\nbelow the national average and there continue to be longer-run challenges in regions like eastern\nKentucky that are undergoing economic transformation. Technological advances and globalization are\nchanging the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. To raise our shared\nstandard of living and to make us more competitive in the global economy, the U.S. needs to ensure that\npeople can enter and remain productive members of the transforming economy.\n\nYou may have heard that, last week, I and several other Federal Reserve System leaders met with\nrepresentatives from the Center for Popular Democracy’s Fed Up Campaign in a public forum held before\nthe Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It was a productive exchange of views about\nhow to solve some of the labor market challenges still afflicting certain communities and demographic\ngroups. Like the Fed Up Campaign, I believe these are important challenges that the country needs to\naddress, but unlike the Fed Up Campaign, I do not believe that at this point in the business cycle, the\ncurrent very low level of interest rates is an effective solution to these longer-run issues. But the good\nnews is that the programs I discussed today and many of the other efforts underway can make a real\n\n22\n\nSee page 485111, “Community Reinvestment Act; Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community\nReinvestment; Guidance,” Federal Register, vol. 81, no. 142, Monday, July 25, 2016, Rules and Regulations.\n\n\f14\ndifference to the people and communities in transition. To be sure, these programs are but a small part of\nthe overall strategy needed to support economic transitions. Laying the foundation for sustained\neconomic growth is neither a quick nor an easy task. It involves many different players working together\nwith perseverance. I commend this audience for undertaking this effort. As members of the Kentucky\nPhilanthropy Initiative and related charities, you provide leadership and foster collaboration, key\ningredients to the revitalization and resiliency of our regions.\n\nLike the KPI, the Federal Reserve takes seriously its role as a convener. Bringing together people to\nshare their different perspectives and experiences can ultimately lead to more effective economic policies.\nI have spoken many times about how the diversity of views expressed around the FOMC table helps the\nFed make better monetary policy. I believe the same is true for public policies aimed at addressing the\nchallenges faced in community development. KPI performs an invaluable service by pulling together\npeople and groups to support grant making and to promote public-private partnerships targeting the\nregion’s persistent challenges. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland looks forward to our continued\ncollaboration with you in those efforts.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAustralian Business Economists\nSydney, Australia\nJuly 13, 2016\n\nThese remarks are an update of remarks that I made at the European Economics and Financial Centre’s\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar in London, U.K. on July 1, 2016.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Australian Business Economists for the kind invitation to be with you today, and I would like\nto say g’day to you all. I started coming to Australia about 30 years ago with my husband, who grew up\nin Canberra. I have to admit, I have not yet acquired a taste for Vegemite – my tastes run more toward\nlamingtons and Anzac biscuits – but Australians are so welcoming that it is always a pleasure to be Down\nUnder.\n\nAs an economist and policymaker, I appreciate hearing the perspectives of market and business\neconomists. Just as the different views expressed by my colleagues around the monetary policy table help\nto inform my own policy views, the insights of economists like you help to shape my own economic\noutlook. The chance to hear perspectives from this side of the Pacific is particularly welcome at this time\nbecause we live in a global economy. Today, I will focus my remarks on the U.S. economy and monetary\npolicy. To help put the discussion into context, I will start with a brief overview of the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I should note that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFederal Reserve Structure and Governance\nThe Federal Reserve System, established by Congress in 1913, is a decentralized central bank. It is\nindependent within the government but not independent from the government. The structure is one of\nbalance. Congress designed the Federal Reserve System to alleviate concerns that it would become\ndominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. The design includes\nrepresentation from the rest of the nation, balancing public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall\nStreet and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in\nWashington that oversees those Banks. The governors, who serve the public, are appointed by the\n\n\f2\npresident of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, the upper house of Congress. Governors\nserve staggered 14-year terms, which span several terms of the president and members of Congress. The\nlength of the term is intended to insulate the governors from short-term political influence and allows\nthem to take a longer-run perspective when setting monetary and financial regulatory policy. The\nchairman and vice chairman of the Board of Governors are chosen by the president and confirmed by the\nSenate from among the sitting governors for four-year terms. They can be reappointed until their terms as\ngovernors expire.\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks also operate in the public interest. They are distributed around the country in\nlocations that were the centers of economic activity back when the Fed was established.1 Each Reserve\nBank has a nine-member board of directors who are chosen in a nonpolitical process. Three directors\nrepresent banks and six are nonbankers who represent business, agricultural, industrial, and public\ninterests in the Districts they serve. The nonbank directors are responsible for choosing the Bank’s\npresident, who is subject to approval by the Fed’s Board of Governors. This structure may seem pretty\ncomplicated, but it actually works quite well. Before the Fed was established, there were two earlier\nattempts at central banks in the U.S. Each lasted only 20 years. In contrast, the Federal Reserve recently\nmarked its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, was established in 1934 and is the body within the\nFederal Reserve System responsible for setting monetary policy. The FOMC holds eight regularly\nscheduled meetings a year in Washington. This 12-member Committee is made up of the seven members\nof the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents\nwho serve on a rotating basis. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I vote every other year, as does the\n1\n\nSome Reserve Banks also have Branches. For example, the Cleveland Fed has a Branch in Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, and a Branch in Cincinnati, Ohio. Each Branch of a Reserve Bank has a board of directors of\nbetween three and seven members.\n\n\f3\nChicago Fed president. The other presidents vote every third year. I note, though, that presidents who\nhappen not to be voting members at the moment still participate in FOMC meetings. Thus, by design, the\ndiscussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the\ncountry. This information helps inform our setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of the goals\ngiven to us by the U.S. Congress. These monetary policy goals, often called the Fed’s dual mandate, are\nprice stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nOur last FOMC meeting was held in mid-June and our next meeting will be two weeks from now. As is\nalways the case, during this intermeeting period, Fed policymakers are evaluating economic\ndevelopments and assessing the outlook. Of course, the anticipated consequences of the recent decision\nby U.K. voters to exit the European Union will need to be part of that assessment. This is a developing\nstory, and how it plays out will ultimately determine its implications for the global economy and\nmonetary policy. For the U.S. economy, while the risks and uncertainty surrounding the outlook have\nincreased in the wake of the U.K. vote, FOMC members will be taking the time up to our July meeting to\ncontinue to evaluate whether conditions in the aftermath of the decision and other economic and financial\ndevelopments will necessitate a material change in the modal outlook.\n\nIn thinking about the economic outlook, I try to stay focused on underlying fundamentals because they\ndetermine the outlook for the economy over the medium run, the time horizon over which monetary\npolicy can affect the economy. In my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the U.S. economic\nexpansion remain sound. These include accommodative monetary policy, household balance sheets that\nhave improved greatly since the recession, continued progress in the labor market, a more resilient\nbanking system, and low oil prices. There are risks around all forecasts, but my modal forecast has been\nthat over the next two years the U.S. economy will continue to expand at a pace slightly above its longerrun trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will remain slightly under\n\n\f4\nits longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually\nreturn to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Of course, even in the best of times, without the\nincreased uncertainty of our current situation, there is some variation in growth and other economic\nindicators over time. The trick is to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from economic\nand financial market information that can often be quite noisy.\n\nEconomic growth\nWe’ve seen this kind of variability in the quarterly measures of U.S. GDP growth. Growth in the first\nquarter of the year slowed, although less so than originally estimated. Incoming information suggests that\nwe are seeing a rebound of growth in the second quarter. This is very similar to the pattern we saw in\n2014 and 2015. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output in the U.S., has\naccelerated in recent months. The continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in\npersonal income, low borrowing rates, and relatively low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending.\nIn the U.S., the drop in gasoline prices by almost $1 per gallon between 2014 and 2015 saved the average\nhousehold about $700. Although gasoline prices have moved up in the past couple of months, the U.S.\nEnergy Information Administration now forecasts that the average price of gasoline will be down again\nthis year, resulting in another $200 in cost savings for the average household. Some of those savings\nhave been spent. For example, we’ve seen high levels of auto sales for the past two years. Some\nhouseholds likely saved part of the windfall instead of spending it, or used it to pay down debt. Either\nway, stronger household balance sheets will help support future consumption spending.\n\nThe U.S. housing sector has been gradually recovering for some time. In the aftermath of the housing\ncrash, house prices in the U.S. began rising again in mid-2011, and for the past two years, they have been\nincreasing at a 5 to 6 percent annual rate. At the aggregate level, homeowners lost an unprecedented $7\ntrillion in real estate equity during the housing crash, but the increases in house prices have allowed\nhomeowners to recover nearly all of that. Sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of home sales\n\n\f5\nin the U.S., are now back near the levels seen before the housing bubble run-up in the early to mid-2000s.\nI am using the pre-bubble level as my benchmark because we shouldn’t want to see the housing market\nreturn to bubble proportions. Other parts of the housing sector haven’t yet fully recovered. Construction\nand sales of new homes have been rising at a gradual pace, but they are not back up to their pre-bubble\nlevels. Starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer\nrun, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn’t kept up with demand. In addition, the type of\nhousing being built has shifted. Over the past five years, increases in multifamily housing starts have\nsignificantly outpaced increases in single-family starts. This may reflect a shift in preferences toward\nmore urban living, but it likely also reflects the desire on the part of some people who lived through the\ncrisis to rent rather than own. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on\nmore mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. My\nassessment of conditions is that the recovery in housing should continue at a moderate pace.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak. While the sharp drop in oil prices since\nmid-2014 benefited consumers and many businesses, firms in the drilling and mining sector, their\nsuppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector have been hurt. We have seen the\neffects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production has been down and firms tied to\nenergy have had to cut jobs and reduce investment. But even outside of the energy sector, business\ninvestment has been soft despite generally accommodative financial conditions. Manufacturers have been\ninvesting but mainly to maintain current operations rather than to expand. Part of the softness in\ninvestment reflects weakness in demand outside of the U.S., which has hurt U.S. exports.\n\nIndeed, firms exposed to U.S. trade have had to operate in a very challenging environment. The nominal\nvalue of the U.S. dollar has appreciated about 19 percent on a broad trade-weighted basis since mid-2014.\nThis has placed a significant drag on manufacturing output and export growth. But the slowdown in the\nrate of appreciation in recent months was starting to diminish the drag on growth from net exports.\n\n\f6\n\nOf course, global growth, commodity price changes, and currency fluctuations are not necessarily\nindependent events. For example, a portion of the more than 50 percent decline in oil prices since mid2014 likely reflects expectations of weaker growth in China and other countries, although supply factors\nhave likely played a greater role. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar since mid-2014 has reflected\nexpectations that real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as\nprojected real interest rate differentials between the U.S. and other economies. We have to be careful not\nto think of these shocks as independent events and merely sum their effects. We live in an interconnected\nglobal economy. Changes in prices and currency values are one way economies reach a new equilibrium\nafter a shock.\n\nWhile I would expect investment to begin to pick up as overall economic growth expands, the weakness\nin investment and the associated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of\nthe U.S. economy. Structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output\nand increases in living standards. And investment in capital, including human capital, is a key\ndeterminant of productivity growth. In the U.S., labor productivity growth has risen at only a half of a\npercent annual rate over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical: weak investment during the\nrecession and early part of the expansion contributed to slow productivity growth over this five-year\nperiod. But the weakness in investment and the slow productivity growth have persisted in the U.S. and\nin several other countries. Productivity growth is very difficult to forecast, so the softness may reverse\nitself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it’s the latter, then the longer-run growth\nrate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth I’ve been assuming.\n\nAs this overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But overall,\neconomic growth has proven to be resilient and at a pace slightly above trend. The pace has been\nsufficient to generate significant progress in labor markets.\n\n\f7\n\nLabor markets\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about\n10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its\npeak of 10 percent in late 2009. Over the past two years, there have also been significant improvements\nin other gauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time\nworkers who would rather work full-time and the number of people who have only been looking for work\nsporadically or have been discouraged from looking at all because they don’t think they will find a job.\nIncreasingly, we are hearing from businesses that they are having trouble finding qualified workers.\nEarly on, such reports were concentrated in high-skilled occupations but now they are expanding to\ninclude lower-skilled jobs in a broader set of industries.\n\nThere has been some month-to-month variation in recent employment reports for the U.S. Payroll growth\nslowed considerably in May, raising the question of whether we were at the start of a reversal from the\nconsiderable progress that’s been made in labor markets, or whether the weak reading was the type of\ntransitory change we typically see during expansions. Hiring rebounded in June, alleviating that concern.\n\nBased on my read of the available data, I believe the U.S. labor market remains sound and that we’ll\ncontinue to see further improvements in the job market, although the pace of improvement will\nnecessarily slow given the progress that’s already been made. It’s important to put monthly jobs reports\ninto context. One thing we have learned is that we shouldn’t take too much signal from one or two\nmonthly reports. Payroll growth has slowed several times during this expansion, only to pick up again.\nIn addition, we should expect to see some slowdown in the pace of job growth as the economy nears full\nemployment. Over the past three months U.S. firms added an average of 147,000 jobs per month. That\npace exceeds the 75,000 to 120,000 per month range of trend employment growth estimates from various\n\n\f8\nmodels that take into account the aging of the population and other demographic factors affecting labor\nforce participation. So it is enough to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nOther incoming data remain consistent with an improving labor market. Claims for unemployment\ninsurance are low. The rates of job openings and hiring are high. The quit rate is also high, suggesting\nthat workers are confident enough to be looking for better jobs. The unemployment rate is low, and while\nthe labor force participation rate has varied from month to month, averaging through the recent variability\nwe see that the level of the participation rate is consistent with estimates of its longer-run downward\ntrend. Another positive is that there are signs in the data and from anecdotal reports that wages may be\naccelerating.\n\nAll of this suggests to me that labor market progress will continue. At the same time, I do not want to\nunderestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession and slow\nrecovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced\nby different demographic groups in the U.S. The deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and\nexacerbated longer-run workforce development issues affecting U.S. labor markets. Technological\nadvances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform\nthose jobs. I believe that government programs and private-public partnerships, including educational\nassistance, retraining programs, and apprenticeships, can be effective in addressing these long-run labor\nforce challenges and should be brought to bear. On the other hand, I do not believe that monetary policy\nwould be effective in addressing these longer-run problems. So from the standpoint of what monetary\npolicy can do, I believe the economy is basically at maximum employment, one part of the Fed’s dual\nmandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s\n\n\f9\ngoal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the\nprice of oil and other commodities, which began in mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar,\nwhich has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S.2\n\nThe most recent inflation data have been encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the\nFOMC. Inflation measures have gradually risen as the effects of previous declines in oil prices and dollar\nappreciation have begun to fade. Headline PCE and CPI inflation, as measured by the year-over-year\nchanges in the underlying indices, have moved up from the very low levels recorded last year and have\nbeen stable around 1 percent in recent months. The core inflation measures, which omit food and energy\nprices because they tend to be volatile, have also been moving up and are above the headline numbers.\nAnother gauge of underlying inflation, the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate, rose to over 2.5\npercent in May, its highest level in over seven years.3\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. Even in the face of\nsizable declines in energy prices, inflation expectations have been relatively stable in my view. At this\npoint I expect them to remain reasonably well anchored, but I am monitoring readings carefully. There\nare various measures of inflation expectations. Survey-based measures have tended to be more stable\nthan those based on market data. Inflation compensation, as distinct from expectations, is the difference\nin yields between nominal U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities. Inflation\ncompensation has fallen by more than the survey measures of expectations, but various models suggest\nthat the movement more likely reflects changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than\n2\n\nAccording to dynamic simulations of the Federal Reserve Board staff’s SIGMA model, a 10 percent rise in the real\nvalue of the dollar affects core inflation via import prices fairly quickly, resulting in a drop of about 0.5 percent in\ncore inflation a year after the shock, which partially reverses over the subsequent year. A shock to the value of the\ndollar also tends to reduce GDP with a lag, and the model indicates that this would put additional downward\npressure on inflation. See Chart 5 in Stanley Fischer, “U.S. Inflation Developments,” remarks at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, WY, August 29, 2015.\n3\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-anddata/median-cpi.aspx.\n\n\f10\nchanges in inflation expectations. Over a period of heightened market volatility and safe-haven flows into\nU.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based\nmeasure of inflation compensation than from the survey measures. The Cleveland Fed’s model of\ninflation expectations provides somewhat of a compromise by incorporating survey measures, as well as\nmarket data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps. Its measure of 5-year inflation, 5 years from\nnow has been stable, at about 1.9 percent, in recent months.4\n\nGiven these readings on inflation and inflation expectations, so long as the real side of the economy\ncontinues to perform as expected, I anticipate that inflation will continue to gradually move back to our\ngoal of 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn setting monetary policy, the FOMC assesses both realized and expected progress on our statutory\nlonger-run goals of price stability and maximum employment. That assessment encompasses a wide\nrange of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators,\nas well as the information FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions.\n\nAt its June meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½\npercent. The FOMC indicated that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, it\nanticipates further improvements in the economy. This was reflected in the Summary of Economic\nProjections also released at the June meeting. The median projection among the FOMC participants\nshows growth at about 2 percent over the next three years, consistent with the median estimate of longerrun trend growth; the unemployment rate coming down a bit from current levels and remaining under the\n\n4\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations measure is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicatorsand-data/inflation-expectations.aspx.\n\n\f11\nmedian longer-run estimate of 4.8 percent through 2018; and inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent\nby the end of 2018.\n\nIn June, the FOMC also indicated that economic developments will likely warrant only gradual increases\nin the fed funds rate. Of course, the timing of those rate increases and the overall slope of that gradual\npath will depend on how the economy, the economic outlook, and the risks evolve.\n\nIndeed, in the June projections, the median fed funds rate path of appropriate policy was somewhat\nshallower than in the last set of projections in March – partly reflecting somewhat slower growth\nprojected for this year, and partly reflecting a lower estimate of the fed funds rate over the longer run.\n\nI supported the decision not to change rates in June. My support did not reflect a fundamental change to\nmy outlook. The progress being made on our policy goals and the outlook suggest that a gradual upward\npath of interest rates continued to be appropriate. A gradual path means that monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against\ndownside risks. As I said, I believe that the progress in labor markets has been good and will continue,\nand I view the inflation data as supportive of a gradual return to target. Now, some might argue that in an\nabundance of caution, we should wait for clarity on these issues, and I agree that there are risks to acting\ntoo soon. But there are also risks to forestalling rate increases for too long when we are continuing to\nmake cumulative progress on our policy goals. Waiting too long increases risks to financial stability and\nraises the chance that we would have to move more aggressively in the future, which poses its own set of\nrisks to the outlook. I believe waiting too long also jeopardizes our future ability to use the nontraditional\nmonetary policy tools that the Fed developed to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and\ndeep recession. If we fail to gracefully navigate back toward a more normal policy stance at the\nappropriate time, then I believe there is a non-negligible chance that these tools will essentially be off the\ntable because the public will have deemed them as ultimately ineffective. This is a risk to the outlook\n\n\f12\nshould we ever find ourselves in a situation of needing such tools in the future. Of course, such a risk is\nhard to measure and is not one we typically consider. But we live in atypical times, and we need to take\nthe whole set of risks into account when assessing appropriate policy.\n\nSo why, then, did I think it appropriate not to raise rates in June? The reason was timing. There was\nconsiderable uncertainty about the outcome of the upcoming U.K. referendum on membership in the\nEuropean Union. The vote was being held a week after the June FOMC meeting. It was clear there was\ngoing to be volatility in financial markets surrounding the vote. If the vote favored exit, there was the\npotential of disruption in markets. Given that I do not think U.S. monetary policy is behind the curve yet,\nI saw little cost in waiting to take the next step.\n\nAfter the U.K. Referendum\nIt is an understatement to say that market volatility increased on the outcome of the U.K. referendum. We\nare now in a world of heightened economic and political uncertainty, and I expect we will be living with\nuncertainty for a while as the U.K. and Europe establish the terms of their new relationship.\n\nWhen a shock like this hits financial markets, the first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is\nsufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets to continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of\nextreme volatility, and to assure the public that we are prepared to act as necessary. The Bank of\nEngland, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 countries, and several other\nindividual central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal\nReserve, put out statements indicating that they stand ready to use established liquidity tools to support\nmarket functioning.5 Central banks are monitoring the situation for possible contagion across financial\n\n5\n\nSee the following statements released on June 24, 2016: Statement from the Bank of England; Statement from the\nGovernor of the Bank of England Following the E.U. Referendum Result; Statement of G-7 Finance Ministers and\nCentral Bank Governors; ECB is Closely Monitoring Financial Markets; Statement by Minister Aso and Governor\n\n\f13\nmarkets. The considerable efforts undertaken by policymakers in response to the global financial crisis to\nincrease the resiliency of the financial system, including higher capital and liquidity requirements, mean\nthat financial institutions are now in considerably better shape to withstand short-run volatility while\ncontinuing to extend credit to households and businesses. Despite the volatility, markets have generally\nbeen functioning in an orderly manner. Investors have been moving funds to safe-haven assets, which has\nled to lower yields on U.S. Treasuries and appreciation of the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen against the\nU.K. pound. Reflecting concerns about where U.K. property values may settle, some commercial real\nestate funds in the U.K. have suspended redemptions. Central banks are continuing to monitor financial\nmarket developments closely.\n\nUltimately, global economies will adjust to the new trading and labor relationships negotiated between\nthe U.K. and Europe. Economists continue to evaluate what the magnitude of the effects on the global\neconomy will be. This will depend on how the situation evolves, so the evaluation will take some time to\nfully develop. In the U.S., in determining whether a material change in our medium-run economic\noutlook is needed, monetary policymakers are assessing the consequences of the U.K. referendum in the\ncontext of other economic and financial developments. While the U.K. represents about 4 percent of\nworld output and global trade, London is one of the major financial centers of the world. About 4 percent\nof U.S. exports go to the U.K., which is a relatively small share, but the financial ties between our two\ncountries are larger. Barring any major disruption in financial and banking markets, one of the main\nmechanisms through which the exit decision could affect the U.S. economy is through dollar appreciation,\nwhich, depending on its persistence and magnitude, could dampen U.S. export growth and cause a delay\nin the return of inflation to 2 percent. Slower growth outside of the U.S. would also lower demand for\n\nKuroda on the U.K.’s Decision to Leave the E.U.; and The Federal Reserve is Carefully Monitoring Developments\nin Global Financial Markets.\n\n\f14\nU.S. exports. But it is important to remember that exports make up only about 12 percent of U.S. output;\nso whatever the reduction in export growth, it would mean a smaller reduction in overall GDP growth.\n\nHeightened and persistent uncertainty is another factor that can affect the economy. When the exit\ndecision was announced, investors moved away from risk assets. Higher credit spreads and lower equity\nprices, coupled with continued uncertainty, could put firms and households in a wait-and-see mode,\nreducing economic activity for a time. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has highlighted the\ndampening effect uncertainty could have on economic performance in the U.K. and steps have been taken\nthere to ease credit conditions. These include reducing the countercyclical capital requirements for banks\nand encouraging banks to continue lending to households and businesses.6\n\nAs I said, it is too soon to judge the full magnitude of such effects. However, despite the uncertainty,\nbetween now and our meeting later this month, FOMC policymakers will continue to evaluate the full set\nof economic and financial developments to judge whether the medium-run U.S. economic outlook has\nbeen meaningfully affected and whether that changes our assessment of appropriate U.S. monetary policy\ngoing forward. Monetary policymakers cannot let the lack of economic clarity distract us from our\nimportant mission. We must continue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess\nthe situation. As an FOMC member, I will remain focused on and committed to setting monetary policy\nto promote the Federal Reserve’s longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the\nbenefit of the public.\n\n6\n\nSee, Mark Carney, “Uncertainty, the Economy and Policy,” Bank of England, June 30, 2016; Mark Carney,\n“Financial Stability Report Press Conference, Opening Remarks by the Governor,” July 5, 2016; and “Joint\nStatement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, and Main British Banks and Building Society on\nMaintaining Support for Households and Businesses,” July 5, 2016.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Sydney Banking and Financial Stability Conference\nUniversity of Sydney\nSydney, Australia\nJuly 12, 2016\n\nThese remarks are based on remarks that I made at the Sveriges Riksbank Conference on Rethinking the\nCentral Bank’s Mandate in Stockholm, Sweden, on June 4, 2016.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the University of Sydney for inviting me to participate in today’s conference on banking and\nfinancial stability. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, economists and policymakers all over the world\nhave been evaluating the factors that led to the crisis, assessing what could have been done to prevent, or\nat least limit, the damage, and considering what can and should be done to reduce the probability and\nimpact of future disruptions to financial stability. To its credit and understanding the importance of the\nfinancial system to a vital economy, Australia began undertaking thoughtful, periodic reviews of its\nfinancial system and regulatory structure well before the crisis. Based on the recommendations coming\nout of these inquiries, Australian policymakers implemented changes to address the evolving nature of the\nfinancial services landscape.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to learn more about the financial stability efforts underway here and to\nprovide a perspective from the other side of the Pacific. Today, I will focus my remarks on the\nconnections between monetary policy and financial stability. To help put the discussion into context, I\nwill start with a brief overview of the U.S. financial system regulatory structure as it pertains to financial\nstability. I should note that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe U.S. Financial System Regulatory Structure and Financial Stability\nIt is probably an understatement to say that the financial system regulatory structure in the U.S. is\ncomplex. In part, its complexity reflects the wide array of institutions that provide financial services,\nhelping to support an $18 trillion economy. Banks, a category that includes commercial banks, savings\nand loans, and credit unions, provide only about a third of the credit in the U.S. Other providers include\ninsurance companies; mutual funds; pension funds; government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie\n\n\f2\nMae and Freddie Mac, which issue mortgage-backed securities; and other non banks including brokerdealers, finance companies, and mortgage real estate investment trusts.1\n\nThese diverse financial institutions are able to provide valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity\nservices to businesses and households because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged\ncompared with nonfinancial businesses. But this risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic\nproblems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and\nimpose significant economic costs.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which\ncontributed to a buildup in financial imbalances and systemic risk. In response to the crisis, the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in 2010. Provisions in the\nact aim to foster financial stability in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of a financial crisis, and\nsecond, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system.\nUnder Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies in the U.S. were directed\nto augment their traditional microprudential approach, which promotes the safety and soundness of\nindividual institutions, with a macroprudential approach in which examiners and supervisors take a\nhorizontal view of risk across institutions rather than looking at only one institution at a time. Although\nthere is still more to be done, U.S. regulators continue to make progress in developing tools to implement\nthe macroprudential approach and to monitor the risks over the business and financial cycles.\n\nIn the U.S., the application of these tools is complicated by the complexity of the regulatory structure\nitself. At the federal level, there are multiple financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the\n1\n\nSee Fischer (2015).\n\n\f3\nNational Credit Union Association, the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency. There are financial system regulators at the state level as well. In many cases,\nthe regulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by instrument.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to promote coordination\nand information sharing across these financial system regulators. The 10 voting members of the FSOC\ninclude the heads of the nine federal regulatory entities I just mentioned, and an independent member\nwith insurance expertise, who is appointed by the president of the U.S. An important power of the FSOC\nis its ability to designate nonbanks as systemically important, bringing them under more banking-type\nsupervision and regulation. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has the responsibility\nfor supervising systemically important financial institutions, including these FSOC-designated nonbank\nfinancial companies, large bank holding companies, and the U.S. operations of certain foreign banking\norganizations.\n\nThe complexity of the financial system makes monitoring risks more complicated. The Office of\nFinancial Research, established under Dodd-Frank, is collecting data to aid in this task. The Federal\nReserve has also developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, which is helping us to better\nidentify changes in conditions over time. Financial stability surveillance is receiving regular attention at\nmeetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body within the Federal Reserve that is\nresponsible for setting monetary policy.2 One might ask why that’s the case given that financial stability\n\n2\n\nThis framework, which is described in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013), involves tracking a standard set of\nfinancial system vulnerabilities, including the pricing of risk, leverage, maturity and liquidity transformation, and\ninterconnectedness and complexity. Recognizing the complex nature of the U.S. financial system, Federal Reserve\nstaff track these risks across four broad areas of the financial system: asset markets, the banking sector, shadow\nbanks, and the nonfinancial sector.\n\n\f4\nis not an explicit part of the FOMC’s monetary policy mandate. It is because the goals of monetary\npolicy and financial stability are interconnected.\n\nThe Nexus Between Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\nIn my view, a central bank should care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of\nthe real economy. Volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a\ndynamic economy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something the monetary policy\nauthority should respond to. Indeed, to the extent that the word “stability” gives the impression that the\nfinancial system is static, we may want to adopt the language used in the United Kingdom and speak\nabout financial system resiliency, that is, the financial system’s ability to continue to provide the core\nfinancial services of intermediation, risk management, and payments in the face of the inevitable shocks\nthat will hit a dynamic economy.3\n\nMonetary policy mainly works through its ability to affect current and expected future interest rates;\nhowever, in certain circumstances, it also has the ability to affect risk-taking by investors and financial\ninstitutions, and thereby is linked to financial stability.4 I believe that, in general, the goals of monetary\npolicy and financial stability are complementary. For example, price stability helps businesses,\nhouseholds, and financial institutions make better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial\nsystem. And a stable financial system allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy\nthroughout the economy. I view this complementarity as similar to the complementarity between the two\nmonetary policy goals that the U.S. Congress has given to the FOMC, namely, price stability and\nmaximum employment.\n\n3\n\nSee Tucker (2015).\n\n4\n\nSee Adrian and Shin (2011) for a review of the literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.\n\n\f5\nBut during the financial crisis we learned that financial imbalances can build up even in a low-inflation\nenvironment, so that while price stability may promote financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition.\nWe also learned that financial instability can arise from nonbanks and from institutions that are solvent\nand not necessarily highly leveraged.5\n\nA large body of research has aided our understanding about how systemic risk can build up and propagate\nthrough the economy. Well before the financial crisis, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) did seminal work on\nthe important role collateral plays in lending markets. In their model, because borrowers cannot be forced\nto repay, all lending is collateralized. When the economy is performing well, the value of the collateral\nincreases, which supports further borrowing and higher output. But when a negative shock hits the\neconomy and output declines, collateral values also fall, which means borrowing falls, which depresses\noutput even further. Thus, the collateral constraint is a mechanism that amplifies and propagates the\neffects of temporary shocks on the economy.\n\nBrunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) build on the Kiyotaki and Moore model. In their model, an economic\nboom increases bank capital levels high enough so that credit is amply available to borrowers. This\nlowers the volatility of both output and asset prices. The lower volatility induces banks to increase their\nleverage and lend even more, so much so that the system is now vulnerable to a negative shock. Gorton\nand Ordoñez (2014) examine how private market activities generate endogenous accumulations of and\nsubsequent collapses in leverage. These models illustrate that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by\nthe choices of the model’s decision makers, and varies across the cycle.\n\n5\n\nFeroli, Kashyap, Schoenholtz, and Shin (2014) focus on market “tantrums,” which they define as periods in which\nrisk premiums inherent in market interest rates fluctuate widely. Using data on inflows and outflows to open-end\nmutual funds, they conclude that market tantrums can arise independently of the degree of leverage in the system.\n\n\f6\nDuring the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission\nof monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. In those circumstances, the actions taken to\nimplement monetary policy can also affect financial stability. The FOMC has acknowledged that\nnonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of very\nlow interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and by\nspurring risk-taking in a search for yield.6 Empirical work is beginning to document this effect. For\nexample, Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) use data on 23 million bank loans from the\nSpanish credit registry and find that a lower overnight policy rate induces low-capitalized banks to lend\nmore to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized banks, direct\nevidence of monetary policy’s effect on risk-taking.7\n\nThus, while I believe that, in most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are\ncomplementary, we need to recognize that, at times, actions taken to foster financial stability and those\ntaken to promote our monetary policy goals might be in conflict, at least in the short run. In the U.K., the\nFinancial Services Act recognizes this potential tradeoff and explicitly says that the Financial Policy\nCommittee (FPC) is not authorized to act in a way that it feels is “likely to have a significant adverse\neffect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the\nmedium or long term.”8\n\nIn deciding whether to take action against a growing imbalance, policymakers need to balance the\nexpected improvement in future economic conditions against the potential cost of unduly limiting credit\n\n6\n\nThe Board of Governors discusses developments related to financial stability in its monetary policy report to\nCongress. For example, see Board of Governors (2016), p. 20.\n7\n\nJiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) separately identify how a change in the monetary policy rate affects\nthe demand for credit and the volume and composition of credit supplied, in particular, the supply to riskier\nborrowers.\n8\n\nSee Section 9c(4) of the U.K.’s Financial Services Act 2012.\n\n\f7\nextension. Too high a resiliency standard will thwart risk-taking and innovation, which will undermine\nlonger-run economic growth. In setting the standard, we need to come to some common understanding\nabout the amount of growth and prosperity we are willing to give up in order to lower the risk to financial\nstability. In the U.S., people who are 80 years old have lived through two major financial crises (the\nGreat Depression and the 2008 crisis). Is that too many? Would we rather lower the probability of such\nan event to one every 1,000 years? What would we be willing to give up to do that?\n\nThat may be a premature question at this point. There are likely things that can be done and that are being\ndone to lower the risk to financial stability without much cost in terms of longer-run growth. If we think\nof there being a risk-return frontier relating financial stability risk to the economic return that a wellfunctioning financial system can provide, then it isn’t hard to imagine that we were operating at a point\nwell interior to that frontier in the run-up to the crisis, and that the improvements being made in our\nfinancial regulatory and supervisory regime are moving us toward the frontier without sacrificing growth.\n\nMacroprudential Tools\nTo foster the resiliency of the financial system, regulators in the U.S. and throughout the world are\ndeveloping macroprudential tools aimed at lowering the probability that instability will arise and to limit\nthe damage when financial shocks do arise. Some tools focus on building up the structural resiliency of\nthe financial system throughout the business cycle. In my view, these structural resiliency tools are the\nmost promising. They include the Basel III risk-based capital requirements, minimum liquidity\nrequirements, central clearing for derivatives, and bank stress tests. Living-will resolution plans and the\nOrderly Liquidation Authority, which is housed at the FDIC, are intended to make it easier for regulators\nand policymakers to allow large complex financial institutions to fail.\n\nIn addition to structural tools, there are countercyclical tools that aim to mitigate the systemic risk that can\nbuild up over the business cycle. These include the countercyclical capital buffer and the capital\n\n\f8\nconservation buffer.9 Other possible cyclical tools, not yet established in the U.S. but used in other\ncountries, include loan-to-value ratio limits and debt-to-income ratio limits that vary over the cycle and\nwhich have been targeted to particular sectors like housing credit or household credit.10\n\nThe performance of the set of macroprudential tools is largely untested. Cross-country studies find mixed\nresults, with the effectiveness of the tools varying with economic circumstances and the types of shocks\nhitting the financial sector.11 In the U.S., the need to coordinate countercyclical macroprudential policy\nactions across multiple regulators adds a complication to effectively using such tools in a timely way.\n\nCurrently, policymakers in the U.K. are putting one of the countercyclical tools to the test. The\nuncertainty arising from U.K. voters’ decision to exit the European Union has the potential to dampen\neconomic performance in the U.K. In response, policymakers there have taken steps to ease credit\nconditions. One such step, taken by the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), is a\nreduction in the countercyclical capital buffer rate for banks to zero percent from half of a percent of\nbanks’ U.K. exposures, with the expectation that the zero percent rate will be maintained until at least\n\n9\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer allows regulators to increase risk-based capital requirements when credit growth\nis judged to be excessive and leading to rising systemic risk. The capital conservation buffer ensures that banks\nraise capital above regulatory minimums in good times so that when they cover losses in bad times, their capital\nratio will stay at or above the regulatory minimum.\n10\n\nFor example, Canada tightened loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits on mortgage lending over the 2009 to\n2012 period (Krznar and Morsink, 2014). Beginning in 2010, Israel also implemented a package of macroprudential\ntools to restrict the supply of housing credit (Fischer, 2014). Spain introduced dynamic loan-loss provisioning in\n2000. This method builds up reserves during good economic times according to the historical losses experienced by\nthe asset classes held in the bank’s portfolio. This buffer is then available to absorb losses in bad times (Balla and\nMcKenna, 2009).\n11\n\nFor example, a study by economists at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) examined the effectiveness of\nmacroprudential tools in reducing systemic risk in 49 countries. The authors concluded that many of the most\nfrequently used tools were effective in reducing the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage, but the effectiveness\ndepended on the type of shock hitting the financial sector. (See Lin, Columba, Costa, Kongsamut, Otani, Saiyid,\nWezel, and We, 2011.) Another study published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) examined 57\ncountries over a span of up to three decades and found that imposing maximum debt-service-to-income ratios can\nlimit the buildup of credit in housing markets, but maximum loan-to-value ratios were less effective, and\ninstruments like reserve and liquidity requirements focused on the supply of credit had little impact on housing\nmarkets. (See Kuttner and Shim, 2016.)\n\n\f9\nJune 2017.12 This is a reduction in regulatory capital buffers by 5.7 billion pounds, which the FPC\nestimates will raise banks’ capacity to lend by as much as 150 billion pounds, or the equivalent of about\n$260 billion AUD, or about $190 billion USD. Usually, when one thinks about the use of the\ncountercyclical tools it is to mitigate building financial stability risk by tightening credit conditions, but\nhere is an example of the use of a macroprudential tool to ease credit conditions in support of monetary\npolicy goals – an illustration of the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability policy.\n\nLessons from Monetary Policy for Financial Stability Policy\nAnother connection between the two stems from hard-won lessons learned from years of monetary\npolicy-setting, lessons that can now be productively applied to financial stability policy-setting. Let me\ndiscuss two of these lessons. First, to the extent possible, policymakers should take a systematic approach\nin applying financial stability policy rather than relying on discretion. The financial crisis underscored\nthe important role of incentives in financial markets – not only the incentives of financial institutions but\nalso those of regulators and policymakers. Time-inconsistency problems and moral hazard issues are\nimportant factors that need to be considered when designing a framework for implementing financial\nstability policy. These types of problems argue for taking a systematic approach to such policymaking.\n\nThe benefits of systematic monetary policy are well established. When monetary policymakers respond\nin a systematic fashion to incoming information, the public will have a better sense of how policymakers\nare likely to react to economic developments – whether those developments are anticipated or\nunanticipated – so their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment\nhelps the public make better financial and economic decisions, thereby making monetary policy more\neffective.\n12\n\nAnother step was taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in encouraging banks to continue lending to\nhouseholds and businesses. See Carney (June 20, 2016 and July 5, 2016) and Joint Statement from the Chancellor\nof the Exchequer and Banks (July 5, 2016).\n\n\f10\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which\npolicymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. Being\nsystematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems in monetary policy, whereby policymakers\nmay favor the short run over the long run. Note that by systematic policy I do not mean that monetary\npolicy will be set mechanically by a policy rule or that policymakers need to be prescient about the types\nof shocks that will hit the economy. Rather, I mean that policy will react in a systematic fashion to\neconomic developments that change the economic outlook.\n\nA systematic approach to financial stability policy is perhaps even more important than in the case of\nmonetary policy because of the important role played by incentives. The crisis shined a bright light on\nsignificant moral hazard problems that exist in financial markets. A financial stability policymaker that is\nsystematic in how it applies its tools to promote stability will likely help tame some of the moral hazard\nproblems and also some of the time-inconsistency problems to which the regulators themselves are\nsubject.\n\nAn important tool in this regard is the resolution of insolvent financial institutions. Without a credible\nresolution method, during the crisis in the face of serious distress at a large financial firm, governments\nfaced a dilemma: either rescue the firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and\nrisk causing a cascade of other failures. The fact that policymakers had to make these decisions in the\nheat of the moment using their best judgment based on limited information didn’t help. Without a\ncredible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that even well-intentioned policymakers will be\nbiased toward bailouts. A resolution method that can be applied systematically can help alleviate this\nproblem. The living-will resolution plans and Orderly Liquidation Authority in the U.S. are promising,\nbut still untested, tools in a process that will allow large firms to fail. This, in turn, provides incentives\n\n\f11\nfor these large, systemically important institutions to reorganize themselves in a way that reduces the risk\nthey pose to the financial system.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has become more systematic in monitoring risks across the financial\nsystem. Coupling that monitoring with the application of a resiliency standard across the entire financial\nservices landscape, including the so-called shadow banking system that was less-heavily regulated in the\npast, would limit regulatory arbitrage. As the financial crisis made clear, taking an action that pushes risk\nfrom one set of institutions to another doesn’t eliminate the risk, it just moves it around, potentially to a\npart of the financial system where the risk is more difficult to monitor and control.13\n\nI acknowledge that this broad application of the resiliency standard across the financial system may be\nparticularly difficult in the U.S. with its complex regulatory structure. Still, we can devise ways to make\nthe macroprudential tools more systematic and less discretionary. Regulators could agree in advance on\nthe contingencies under which the cyclical macroprudential tools would be invoked, rather than waiting\nuntil the risks escalated before starting the process to coordinate action. For example, we can write down\na formula for a countercyclical buffer, and we can define an explicit trigger for contingent convertible\nbonds. Knowing that such policies will be systematically applied and what will trigger them may induce\nfinancial market participants to limit the buildup of risks in the first place.\n\nAnother lesson we’ve learned from setting monetary policy – or perhaps, we are still learning it – is the\nimportance of transparency and clear communication. In my view, to be effective, macroprudential\npolicy actions must be communicated in a clear way to avoid creating a conflict with or causing confusion\n13\n\nApplication of a resiliency standard would allow the type of supervision to vary appropriately by the nature of the\nsystemic risk associated with each part of the financial system. As discussed in Mester (2015), this is a component\nof the regime for financial stability advocated by Paul Tucker (2015). Several of the macroprudential tools are\nfocused on those institutions that have been deemed systemically important, including the capital surcharge for\nglobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and the U.S. stress tests for banks with more than $50 billion in\nassets.\n\n\f12\nover actions taken to foster monetary policy goals. Transparency and clear communication are hallmarks\nof best-practice monetary policymaking. Clear communication helps align the public’s policy\nexpectations, which makes monetary policy more effective. Transparency is necessary so that the public\nand elected officials have the ability to hold monetary policymakers accountable for their decisions. The\nFederal Reserve has been given independence in setting monetary policy, which has been well\ndocumented as yielding more effective policy and better economic outcomes. But accountability must go\nhand-in-hand with independence. So the Federal Reserve regularly communicates the basis for its policy\ndecisions.\n\nA parallel can be drawn with financial stability policy. Although, in some cases, prudential supervisory\ninformation should be kept private, as a general principle, I think financial stability policymakers should\nstrive for greater transparency and more disclosure. Similarly, they should require more disclosure from\nfinancial firms so that creditors and other market participants can exert market discipline.\n\nOf course, clear communication is easier said than done. Three aspects make this even harder for\nfinancial stability policy than for monetary policy. First, the framework and tools of financial stability\npolicy are new. It will take considerable effort on the part of the financial stability policymakers to\nexplain the tools they are using and the rationale for their policy decisions. However, such\ncommunication is necessary so that the public understands when an action is being taken because of\nconcerns about financial stability rather than concerns about monetary policy goals. This would be\nparticularly true when the monetary policy authority is also responsible for taking financial stability\nactions, and if monetary policy were the tool used to address the financial stability concerns. It is worth\nconsidering whether separating decisions about financial stability from decisions about monetary policy\n\n\f13\nwithin the central bank, perhaps by having separate committees as in the U.K., could aid communication\nand decision-making.14\n\nA second complication in effective communication of financial stability policy is timing. If effective\nmonetary policy means taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, then effective financial\nstability policy might mean taking away the punch bowl before the guests have even arrived because the\nseeds of financial instability are sown much earlier and action must be taken earlier as well. If the need\nfor monetary policy to be forward looking is a difficult concept for the public to grasp, the need for\nfinancial stability policy to act well before there are clear signs of instability may be even more difficult\nto explain.\n\nYet a third complication in effective communication is the complexity of the financial regulatory regime\nitself.15 In my view, a sometimes overlooked lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can\ncomplicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Given the scope and everchanging nature of the financial system, regulatory complexity is, to a certain extent, unavoidable. But\nthe tradeoffs should be recognized. For example, it is reasonable to require banks to hold higher levels of\ncapital against higher-risk assets, but a system of risk weights that is overly granular and complex would\nbe counterproductive. In practice, too much complexity would make it harder for regulators to assess\ncompliance and to determine whether institutions were engaging in some practices merely as a way to\nhide risk and lower their capital requirements. If regulators have made the rules so complex that they\ncannot assess compliance, then, in practice, there are no consequences for firms that fail to meet the\nstandards. Complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the monitors. It might be worth exploring\n\n14\n15\n\nKohn (2015) discusses the benefits of such separation.\n\nHaldane and Madouros (2012) discuss the benefits of a less complex financial regulatory structure and argue that\nthe complexity of the financial landscape does not call for a complex financial regulatory structure, but just the\nopposite.\n\n\f14\nwhether we would be better off with a much simpler macro- and microprudential supervisory structure,\none that is easier to implement and simpler to govern and that is approximately right across various\neconomic models and states of the world even if it is never optimal in any particular model or state.\n\nOf course, we aren’t in that simpler regime. So the question is, given the current financial structure in the\nU.S., how should policy respond to emerging financial stability risks and what role should monetary\npolicy play?\n\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability Risks\nI do not believe financial stability should be added to the Fed’s statutory monetary policy goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. But U.S. monetary policymakers need to remain cognizant of the\nlinkages between financial stability and our monetary policy goals. In my view, the first line of defense\nagainst financial instability involves the tools that will make the structure of the financial system less\nprone to crisis. These structural resiliency tools include higher capital standards (including a minimum\nnon-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards), liquidity standards, stress tests,\nliving wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically important bank and nonbank financial\ninstitutions. Much work has been done to develop these structural resiliency tools, and I believe the\nsystem is in a better position to handle shocks now than it was before the financial crisis.\n\nCountercyclical macroprudential tools, such as limits on loan-to-value ratios in particular markets, are\nworth further study, but at this point, I am not convinced that we have enough knowledge and experience\nwith them to use them effectively in the U.S. That consideration leads me to think that we should set\nstandards for the structural resiliency tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more\nconfidence in the countercyclical tools.\n\n\f15\nWhat about using monetary policy to combat heightened financial stability risks? As I’ve discussed,\nmonetary policy and financial stability goals and actions are interrelated. Very loose monetary policy\nincreases the likelihood that financial instabilities will develop, thereby increasing the likelihood that\nmacroprudential policy tools will be needed. Tight macroprudential policy can tighten financial\nconditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that a monetary policy response will be\nneeded.\n\nThat said, in my view, U.S monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and\nmaximum employment, and financial stability should not be added as a third objective for monetary\npolicy. First, it isn’t clear that monetary policy would be very effective against emerging financial\nstability risks. While interest rates affect the fundamental value of assets, it is not clear that they affect\nthe speculative or bubble portion; the impact may depend on the underlying nature of the financial\nimbalance.16 Second, monetary policy tends to be a blunt instrument, so any benefits of using it to stem\nfinancial imbalances, mispricing of assets, or excessive leverage need to be weighed against the economic\ncosts in terms of price stability and employment. Svensson (2016) brings some metrics to the question\nand concludes that the costs outweigh the benefits.17\n\nWhile I don’t believe financial stability should be part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate, monetary\npolicymakers need to be aware of the linkages between our monetary policy actions and financial\nstability. In the case of the housing market, which precipitated the last crisis, policymakers\nunderestimated the breadth and depth of the negative impact this would have on the rest of the economy\n16\n17\n\nFor example, in the Gali (2014) model, raising interest rates to combat a bubble can actually inflate it.\n\nThe benefit of “leaning against the wind,” that is, running monetary policy tighter than it otherwise would be in\norder to stem emerging financial instabilities, is a reduction in the probability of entering into a financial crisis. The\ncost is worse economic conditions today and higher economic costs should the economy enter into a crisis. By\nSvensson’s (2016) metrics, these costs outweigh the small reduction in the probability of a crisis. One caveat about\nSvensson’s analysis is that it is based on a log-linear model, but we know that financial crises involve extreme states\nand nonlinearities.\n\n\f16\nand financial system. To the extent that we misjudged the impact, there is a larger potential gain to\ncarefully monitoring financial market conditions, implementing the structural macroprudential tools, and\nbeing open to taking offsetting action should imbalances develop.18\n\nIf our macroprudential tools proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks continued to grow, I\nbelieve monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. However, in this case, the blurring\nbetween financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to\nfinancial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also\nbe in jeopardy. Which brings me back to my original point: in most cases, the goals of price stability,\nmaximum employment, and financial stability are complementary.\n\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by noting that in his 2015 presidential address to the American Finance Association,\nLuigi Zingales (2015) posed the question, “Does Finance Benefit Society?” While academics, and, I\nbelieve, central bankers, typically say “yes,” a recent survey indicates that the average American is much\nless certain.19 I am hopeful that the considerable efforts underway across the globe will change that. I\nbelieve it is our responsibility to ensure that we create and maintain a financial system that the public\nviews as being beneficial, and one that truly is.\n\n18\n\nPeek, Rosengren, and Tootell’s (2015) textural analysis of the transcripts of FOMC meetings from 1982 through\n2009 suggests that the FOMC does consider financial stability when setting monetary policy.\n19\n\nZingales (2015) cites the Chicago Booth-Kellogg School Financial Trust Index survey of a representative sample\nof about 1,000 American households, conducted by Social Science Research Solutions. Forty-eight percent of\nrespondents to the December 2014 survey said that the U.S. financial system hurts the U.S. economy, while only 34\npercent said that it benefits the U.S. economy.\n\n\f17\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring.” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series (FEDS) paper 2013-21, Divisions of Research and Statistics and\nMonetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board, March 2013.\nAdrian, Tobias, and Hyun Song Shin, “Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics,” in Handbook\nof Monetary Economics, Vol. 3a, ed. by B.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe European Economics and Financial Centre\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\nLondon, U.K.\nJuly 1, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the European Economics and Financial Centre for the invitation to speak to this distinguished\naudience, in this venerable venue, at this historically significant time. I will focus my remarks today on\nthe other side of the pond – in particular, the U.S. economy and monetary policy. But as you know, we\nlive in a global world, and so we are monitoring very closely what is happening on this side of the pond\nand assessing the implications for the economic outlook and monetary policy on my side of the pond.\nBefore I begin, I should note that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe consequences of last week’s decision by U.K. voters to exit the European Union are on everyone’s\nmind. This is a developing story, and how it plays out will ultimately determine its implications for the\nglobal economy and monetary policy. For the U.S. economy, while the risks and uncertainty surrounding\nthe outlook have increased, it is too early to judge whether conditions in the aftermath of the decision will\nnecessitate a material change in the modal outlook. In structuring my remarks today, I think it would be\nhelpful to first discuss my views on the U.S. economy prior to the vote. These were the views I carried\ninto the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting two weeks ago and that helped inform the\neconomic projections I submitted as part of the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).\nI will then discuss the potential ramifications of the U.K.’s exit decision for the U.S. economic outlook.\n\nIn thinking about the economic outlook, I try to stay focused on underlying fundamentals because they\ndetermine the outlook for the economy over the medium run, the time horizon over which monetary\npolicy can affect the economy. In my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the U.S. economic\nexpansion remain sound. These include accommodative monetary policy, household balance sheets that\nhave improved greatly since the recession, continued progress in the labor market, a more resilient\nbanking system, and low oil prices. There are risks around all forecasts, but my modal forecast has been\n\n\f2\nthat over the next two years the U.S. economy will continue to expand at a pace slightly above its longerrun trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will remain slightly under\nits longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually\nreturn to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Of course, even in the best of times, without the\nincreased uncertainty of our current situation, there is some variation in growth and other economic\nindicators over time. The trick is to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from economic\nand financial market information that can often be quite noisy.\n\nEconomic growth\nWe’ve seen this kind of variability in the quarterly measures of U.S. GDP growth. Growth in the first\nquarter of the year slowed, although less so than originally estimated. Incoming information suggests that\nwe are seeing a rebound of growth in the second quarter. This is very similar to the pattern we saw in\n2014 and 2015. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output in the U.S., has\naccelerated in recent months. The continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in\npersonal income, low borrowing rates, and relatively low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending.\nIn the U.S., the drop in gasoline prices by almost $1 per gallon between 2014 and 2015 saved the average\nhousehold about $700. Although gasoline prices have moved up in the past couple of months, the U.S.\nEnergy Information Administration now forecasts that the average price of gasoline will be down again\nthis year, resulting in another $200 in cost savings for the average household. Some of those savings\nhave been spent. For example, we’ve seen high levels of auto sales for the past two years. Some\nhouseholds likely saved part of the windfall instead of spending it, or used it to pay down debt. Either\nway, stronger household balance sheets will help support future consumption spending.\n\nThe U.S. housing sector has been gradually recovering for some time. In the aftermath of the housing\ncrash, house prices in the U.S. began rising again in mid-2011, and for the past two years, they have been\nincreasing at a 5 to 6 percent annual rate. At the aggregate level, homeowners lost an unprecedented $7\n\n\f3\ntrillion in real estate equity during the housing crash, but the increases in house prices have allowed\nhomeowners to recover nearly all of that. Sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of home sales\nin the U.S., are now back near the levels seen before the housing bubble run-up in the early to mid-2000s.\nI am using the pre-bubble level as my benchmark because we shouldn’t want to see the housing market\nreturn to bubble proportions. Other parts of the housing sector haven’t yet fully recovered. Construction\nand sales of new homes have been rising at a gradual pace, but they are not back up to their pre-bubble\nlevels. Starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer\nrun, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn’t kept up with demand. In addition, the type of\nhousing being built has shifted. Over the past five years, increases in multifamily housing starts have\nsignificantly outpaced increases in single-family starts. This may reflect a shift in preferences toward\nmore urban living, but it likely also reflects the desire on the part of some people who lived through the\ncrisis to rent rather than own. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on\nmore mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. My\nassessment of conditions is that the recovery in housing should continue at a moderate pace.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak. While the sharp drop in oil prices since\nmid-2014 benefited consumers and many businesses, firms in the drilling and mining sector, their\nsuppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector have been hurt. We have seen the\neffects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production has been down and firms tied to\nenergy have had to cut jobs and reduce investment. Business contacts in the steel industry have told us\nthey’ve been encouraged by the firming in oil and other commodity prices since the start of the year, but\nthey remain uncertain about the sustainability of those increases. Other contacts in the energy sector have\ntold us that the price increases have spurred moving forward on some investment projects that had been\nput on hold. But even outside of the energy sector, business investment has been soft despite generally\naccommodative financial conditions. Manufacturers have been investing but mainly to maintain current\noperations rather than to expand. Some manufacturers in the Cleveland District have told us that\n\n\f4\nbusinesses’ reluctance to expand capacity reflects concern about the overall longer-run direction of the\neconomy rather than concerns about the economy in the near term or their own firms’ performance. Part\nof the softness in investment reflects weakness in demand outside of the U.S., which has hurt U.S.\nexports.\n\nIndeed, firms exposed to U.S. trade have had to operate in a very challenging environment. From mid2014 until last week, the nominal value of the U.S. dollar has appreciated about 18 percent on a broad\ntrade-weighted basis. This has placed a significant drag on manufacturing output and export growth. But\nthe slowdown in the rate of appreciation in recent months was starting to diminish the drag on growth\nfrom net exports. In the first quarter, net exports made a slightly positive contribution to U.S. output\ngrowth; in contrast, they subtracted about a half of a percentage point from growth last year.\n\nOf course, global growth, commodity price changes, and currency fluctuations are not necessarily\nindependent events. For example, a portion of the more than 50 percent decline in oil prices since mid2014 likely reflects expectations of weaker growth in China and other countries, although supply factors\nhave likely played a greater role. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar since mid-2014 has reflected\nexpectations that real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as\nprojected real interest rate differentials between the U.S. and other economies. We have to be careful not\nto think of these shocks as independent events and merely sum their effects. We live in an interconnected\nglobal economy. Changes in prices and currency values are one way economies reach a new equilibrium\nafter a shock.\n\nWhile I would expect investment to begin to pick up as overall economic growth expands, the weakness\nin investment and the associated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of\nthe U.S. economy. Structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output\nand increases in living standards. And investment in capital, including human capital, is a key\n\n\f5\ndeterminant of productivity growth. Labor productivity growth has risen at only a half of a percent\nannual rate over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical: weak investment during the\nrecession and early part of the expansion contributed to slow productivity growth over this period. But\nthe weakness in investment and productivity has persisted. Productivity growth is very difficult to\nforecast, so the softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it’s\nthe latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth\nI’ve been assuming.\n\nAs this overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But overall,\neconomic growth has proven to be resilient and at a pace slightly above trend. The pace has been\nsufficient to generate significant progress in labor markets.\n\nLabor markets\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about\n10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its\npeak of 10 percent in late 2009. Over the past two years, there have also been significant improvements\nin other gauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time\nworkers who would rather work full-time and the number of people who have only been looking for work\nsporadically or have been discouraged from looking at all because they don’t think they will find a job.\nIncreasingly, we are hearing from businesses that they are having trouble finding qualified workers.\nEarly on, such reports were concentrated in high-skilled occupations in information technology, health\ncare, and specialized construction. Now, the reports are expanding to include lower-skilled jobs and lessspecialized occupations in a broader set of industries.\n\nSo when the U.S. labor market report for May was released early last month, it garnered considerable\nattention. Just when we were beginning to see signs of a pickup in growth in the second quarter, we\n\n\f6\nreceived news that firms added just 38,000 jobs to their payrolls in May. Part of the weakness reflected\nthe effects of a strike by workers at Verizon Communications. But even adjusting for that, which\naccounted for about 35,000 jobs, the pace was a considerable step down from the 200,000-plus jobs per\nmonth the U.S. economy was adding last year and early this year. The question is: was this the start of a\nreversal from the considerable progress that’s been made in labor markets, or was this the type of\ntransitory change we typically see during expansions?\n\nMy read of the available data puts me in the second camp: I believe the U.S. labor market remains sound\nand that we’ll continue to see further improvements in the job market, although the pace of improvement\nwill necessarily slow given the progress that’s already been made. It’s important to put the May jobs\nreport into context. One thing we have learned is that we shouldn’t take too much signal from one or two\nmonthly reports. Payroll growth has slowed several times during this expansion, only to pick up again.\nWe will see how payrolls behaved in June when the report is released next Friday.\n\nIn addition, we should expect to see some slowdown in the pace of job growth as the economy nears full\nemployment. The bigger surprise may have been the very strong job numbers early this year. Adjusting\nfor the Verizon strike, over the past three months firms added an average of 127,000 jobs per month.\nThat pace exceeds the 75,000 to 120,000 per month range of trend employment growth estimates from\nvarious models that take into account the aging of the population and other demographic factors affecting\nlabor force participation. So it is enough to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nOther incoming data remain consistent with an improving labor market. Claims for unemployment\ninsurance are low. The rates of job openings and hiring are high. The quit rate is also high, suggesting\nthat workers are confident enough to be looking for better jobs. The unemployment rate is low. Of\ncourse, just as I discount taking a strong signal from weak May payrolls, I don’t read May’s sharp drop in\nthe unemployment rate to 4.7 percent as indicating a significant tightening in labor market conditions.\n\n\f7\nThe drop reflected not only a decline in the number of unemployed people but also an outsized decline in\nthe labor force participation rate. The participation rate varies from month to month, but averaging over\nthe past several months, the level of the participation rate is consistent with estimates of its longer-run\ndownward trend. Another positive is that there are signs in the data and from anecdotal reports that\nwages may be accelerating.\n\nAll of this suggests to me that labor market progress will continue. At the same time, I do not want to\nunderestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession and slow\nrecovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced\nby different demographic groups in the U.S. There are serious longer-run workforce development issues\naffecting U.S. labor markets, and the deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated\nthese problems. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and\nthe skill sets needed to perform those jobs. As a country, the U.S. needs to ensure that people can enter\nand remain productive members of the modern labor force. This will raise our shared standard of living\nand make us more competitive in the global economy. I believe that government programs and privatepublic partnerships, including educational assistance, retraining programs, and apprenticeships, can be\neffective in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and should be brought to bear. On the other\nhand, I do not believe that monetary policy would be effective in addressing these longer-run problems.\nSo from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, I believe the economy is basically at maximum\nemployment, one part of the Fed’s dual mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s\ngoal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the\nprice of oil and other commodities, which began in mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar,\nwhich has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S. According to dynamic simulations\n\n\f8\nof the Federal Reserve Board staff’s SIGMA model, a 10 percent rise in the real value of the dollar affects\ncore inflation via import prices fairly quickly, resulting in a drop of about 0.5 percent in core inflation a\nyear after the shock, which partially reverses over the subsequent year. A shock to the value of the dollar\nalso tends to reduce GDP with a lag, and the model indicates that this would put additional downward\npressure on inflation.1\n\nThe most recent inflation data have been encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the\nFOMC. Inflation measures have gradually risen as the effects of previous declines in oil prices and dollar\nappreciation have begun to fade. Headline PCE and CPI inflation, as measured by the year-over-year\nchanges in the underlying indices, have moved up from the very low levels recorded last year and have\nbeen stable at a little more than 1 percent in recent months. The core inflation measures, which omit food\nand energy prices because they tend to be volatile, have also been moving up and are above the headline\nnumbers. Another gauge of underlying inflation, the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate, rose to\nover 2.5 percent in May, its highest level in over seven years.2\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. Even in the face of\nsizable declines in energy prices, inflation expectations have been relatively stable in my view. At this\npoint I expect them to remain reasonably well anchored, but I am monitoring readings carefully. There\nare various measures of inflation expectations. Survey-based measures have tended to be more stable\nthan those based on market data. Inflation compensation, as distinct from expectations, is the difference\nin yields between nominal U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities. Inflation\ncompensation has fallen by more than the survey measures of expectations, but various models suggest\n\n1\n\nSee Chart 5 in Stanley Fischer, “U.S. Inflation Developments,” remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, WY, August 29, 2015.\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-anddata/median-cpi.aspx.\n\n\f9\nthat the movement more likely reflects changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than\nchanges in inflation expectations. Over a period of heightened market volatility and safe-haven flows into\nU.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based\nmeasure of inflation compensation than from the survey measures. The Cleveland Fed’s model of\ninflation expectations provides somewhat of a compromise by incorporating survey measures, as well as\nmarket data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps. Its measure of 5-year inflation, 5 years from\nnow has been stable, at about 1.9 percent, in recent months.3\n\nGiven these readings on inflation and inflation expectations, so long as the real side of the economy\ncontinues to perform as expected, I anticipate that inflation will continue to gradually move back to our\ngoal of 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn setting monetary policy, the FOMC assesses both realized and expected progress on our statutory\nlonger-run goals of price stability and maximum employment. That assessment encompasses a wide\nrange of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators,\nas well as the information FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions.\n\nAt its June meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds\nrate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC indicated that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary\npolicy, it anticipates further improvements in the economy. This was reflected in the Summary of\nEconomic Projections also released at the June meeting. The median projection among the FOMC\nparticipants shows growth at about 2 percent over the next three years, consistent with the median\n\n3\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations measure is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicatorsand-data/inflation-expectations.aspx.\n\n\f10\nestimate of longer-run trend growth; the unemployment rate coming down a bit from current levels and\nremaining under the median longer-run estimate of 4.8 percent through 2018; and inflation gradually\nmoving up to 2 percent by the end of 2018.\n\nIn June, the FOMC also indicated that economic developments will likely warrant only gradual increases\nin the fed funds rate. Of course, the timing of those rate increases and the overall slope of that gradual\npath will depend on how the economy, the economic outlook, and the risks evolve.\n\nIndeed, in the June projections, the median fed funds rate path of appropriate policy was somewhat\nshallower than in the last set of projections in March – partly reflecting somewhat slower growth\nprojected for this year, and partly reflecting a lower estimate of the fed funds rate over the longer run.\n\nI supported the decision not to change rates in June. My reason did not reflect a fundamental change to\nmy outlook. The progress being made on our policy goals and the outlook suggest that a gradual upward\npath of interest rates continued to be appropriate. A gradual path means that monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against\ndownside risks. As I said, I do not think we are at the start of a significant reversal in labor markets, and I\nview the inflation data as supportive of a gradual return to target. Now, some might argue that in an\nabundance of caution, we should wait for clarity on these issues, and I agree that there are risks to acting\ntoo soon. But there are also risks to forestalling rate increases for too long when we are continuing to\nmake cumulative progress on our policy goals. Waiting too long increases risks to financial stability and\nraises the chance that we would have to move more aggressively in the future, which poses its own set of\nrisks to the outlook. I believe waiting too long also jeopardizes our future ability to use the nontraditional\nmonetary policy tools that the Fed developed to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and\ndeep recession. If we fail to gracefully navigate back toward a more normal policy stance at the\nappropriate time, then I believe there is a non-negligible chance that these tools will essentially be off the\n\n\f11\ntable because the public will have deemed them as ultimately ineffective. This is a risk to the outlook\nshould we ever find ourselves in a situation of needing such tools in the future. Of course, such a risk is\nhard to measure and is not one we typically consider. But we live in atypical times, and we need to take\nthe whole set of risks into account when assessing appropriate policy.\n\nSo why, then, did I think it appropriate not to raise rates in June? The reason was timing. There was\nconsiderable uncertainty about the outcome of the upcoming U.K. referendum on membership in the\nEuropean Union. The vote was being held a week after the June FOMC meeting. It was clear there was\ngoing to be volatility in financial markets surrounding the vote. If the vote favored exit, there was the\npotential for disruption in markets. Given that I do not think U.S. monetary policy is behind the curve\nyet, I saw little cost in waiting to take the next step.\n\nAfter the U.K. Referendum\nIt is an understatement to say that market volatility increased on the outcome of the U.K. referendum. We\nare now in a world of heightened economic and political uncertainty, and I expect we will be living with\nuncertainty for a while as the U.K. and Europe establish the terms of their new relationship.\n\nWhen a shock like this hits financial markets, the first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is\nsufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets to continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of\nextreme volatility, and to assure the public that we are prepared to act as necessary. The Bank of\nEngland, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 countries, and several other\nindividual central banks including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal\nReserve, put out statements last Friday indicating that they stand ready to use established liquidity tools to\n\n\f12\nsupport market functioning.4 Central banks are monitoring the situation for possible contagion across\nfinancial markets. Despite the volatility, markets have been functioning in an orderly manner. The\nconsiderable efforts undertaken in the U.K., Europe, the U.S., and other countries in response to the\nglobal financial crisis to increase the resiliency of the financial system, including higher capital and\nliquidity requirements, mean financial institutions are now in considerably better shape to withstand\nshort-run volatility while continuing to extend credit to households and businesses.\n\nUltimately, global economies will adjust to the new trading and labor relationships negotiated between\nthe U.K. and Europe. It is too early to judge what the magnitude of the effects on the global economy\nwill be and, for the U.S. economy, whether there will be a material change in the medium-run outlook. It\nwill depend on how the situation evolves, so the assessment will take some time to fully develop. While\nthe U.K. represents about 4 percent of world output and global trade, London is one of the major financial\ncenters of the world. About 4 percent of U.S. exports go to the U.K., which is a relatively small share, but\nthe financial ties between our two countries are larger. Barring any major disruption in financial and\nbanking markets, one of the main mechanisms through which the exit decision could affect the U.S.\neconomy is through dollar appreciation, which, depending on its persistence and magnitude, could\ndampen U.S. export growth and cause a delay in the return of inflation to 2 percent. Slower growth\noutside of the U.S. would also lower demand for U.S. exports. But it is important to remember that\nexports make up only about 12 percent of U.S. output, so whatever the reduction in export growth, it\nwould mean a smaller reduction in overall GDP growth.\n\n4\n\nSee the following statements released on June 24, 2016: Statement from the Bank of England; Statement from the\nGovernor of the Bank of England Following the E.U. Referendum Result; Statement of G-7 Finance Ministers and\nCentral Bank Governors; ECB is Closely Monitoring Financial Markets; Statement by Minister Aso and Governor\nKuroda on the U.K.’s Decision to Leave the E.U.; and The Federal Reserve is Carefully Monitoring Developments\nin Global Financial Markets.\n\n\f13\nHeightened and persistent uncertainty is another factor that can affect the economy. When the exit\ndecision was announced, investors moved away from risk assets. Higher credit spreads and lower equity\nprices, coupled with continued uncertainty, could put firms and households in a wait-and-see mode,\nreducing economic activity for a time. In his speech yesterday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney\nhighlighted the dampening effect uncertainty could have on economic performance in the U.K. and\nindicated possible responses to it.5\n\nAs I said, it is too soon to judge the full magnitude of such effects. At this point, we need to continue to\nmonitor developments. For example, some of the tightening in financial conditions after the\nannouncement of the vote’s outcome has been reversed in recent days. As we see how things play out,\nwe will have a better sense of whether the medium-run U.S. economic outlook has been meaningfully\naffected and whether that changes our assessment of appropriate U.S. monetary policy going forward.\nMonetary policymakers cannot let the lack of economic clarity distract us from our important mission.\nWe must continue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess the situation. As an\nFOMC member, I will remain focused on and committed to setting monetary policy to promote the\nFederal Reserve’s longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the\npublic.\n\n5\n\nMark Carney, “Uncertainty, the Economy and Policy,” Bank of England, June 30, 2016.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSveriges Riksbank Conference on Rethinking the Central Bank’s Mandate\nStockholm, Sweden\nJune 4, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Stefan Ingves and Anders Vredin for inviting me to participate in this conference on the central\nbank’s mandate. It seems very fitting that such a discussion should take place in Sweden, as the Riksbank\nis considered to be the oldest central bank in the world, only a couple of years shy of 350 years old. The\nFederal Reserve, which recently marked its 100th anniversary, is quite a youngster by comparison,\nalthough the Fed has endured considerably longer than the first two attempts at central banks in the U.S.,\neach of which lasted only 20 years.\n\nSince the 2008 global financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed, economists and\npolicymakers have been evaluating the factors that led to the crisis, assessing what could have been done\nto prevent, or at least limit, the damage, and considering what can and should be done to reduce the\nprobability and impact of future disruptions to financial stability. That this is a very broad topic can\neasily be seen by looking at the agendas of this and previous years’ conferences organized by the\nRiksbank. Today I will focus my remarks on the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability,\nand I’ll arrange my comments around five main points. Before I continue, I should mention that these are\nmy own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nPoint 1: Financial stability matters to central banks because the goals of monetary policy and\nfinancial stability are interconnected.\nCentral banks care about financial stability. Financial institutions are able to provide valuable credit, riskmanagement, and liquidity services to businesses and households because they are designed to take risks\nand are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial businesses. But this risk-taking and leverage raise\nthe possibility of systemic problems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real\neconomic activity, and impose significant economic costs. In fact, the Federal Reserve was established in\n\n\f2\n1913 after a series of financial panics to help promote a more stable financial system and avoid costly\nbank runs.\n\nIn my view, a central bank should care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of\nthe real economy. Volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a\ndynamic economy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something the monetary policy\nauthority should respond to. Indeed, to the extent that the word “stability” gives the impression that the\nfinancial system is static, we may want to adopt the language used in the United Kingdom and speak\nabout financial system resiliency, that is, the ability of the financial system to continue to provide the core\nfinancial services of intermediation, risk management, and payments in the face of the inevitable shocks\nthat will hit a dynamic economy.1\n\nMonetary policy mainly works through its ability to affect current and expected future interest rates;\nhowever, in certain circumstances, it also has the ability to affect risk-taking by investors and financial\ninstitutions, and thereby is linked to financial stability.2 I believe that, in general, the goals of monetary\npolicy and financial stability are complementary. For example, price stability helps businesses,\nhouseholds, and financial institutions make better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial\nsystem. And a stable financial system allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy\nthroughout the economy. I view this complementarity as similar to the complementarity between the two\nmonetary policy goals that the U.S. Congress has given to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),\nnamely, price stability and maximum employment.\n\n1\n\nSee Tucker (2015).\n\n2\n\nSee Adrian and Shin (2011) for a review of the literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.\n\n\f3\nBut during the financial crisis we learned that financial imbalances can build up even in a low-inflation\nenvironment, so that while price stability may promote financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition.\nWe also learned that financial instability can arise from nonbanks and from institutions that are solvent\nand not necessarily highly leveraged.3\n\nA large body of research has aided our understanding about how systemic risk can build up and propagate\nthrough the economy. Well before the financial crisis, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) did seminal work on\nthe important role collateral plays in lending markets. In their model, because borrowers cannot be forced\nto repay, all lending is collateralized. When the economy is performing well, the value of the collateral\nincreases, which supports further borrowing and higher output. But when a negative shock hits the\neconomy and output declines, collateral values also fall, which means borrowing falls, which depresses\noutput even further. Thus, the collateral constraint is a mechanism that amplifies and propagates the\neffects of temporary shocks on the economy.\n\nBrunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) build on the Kiyotaki and Moore model. In their model, an economic\nboom increases bank capital levels high enough so that credit is amply available to borrowers. This\nlowers the volatility of both output and asset prices. The lower volatility induces banks to increase their\nleverage and lend even more, so much so that the system is now vulnerable to a negative shock. Gorton\nand Ordoñez (2014) examine how private market activities generate endogenous accumulations of and\nsubsequent collapses in leverage. These models illustrate that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by\nthe choices of the model’s decision makers, and varies across the cycle.\n\n3\n\nFeroli, Kashyap, Schoenholtz, and Shin (2014) focus on market “tantrums,” which they define as periods in which\nrisk premiums inherent in market interest rates fluctuate widely. Using data on inflows and outflows to open-end\nmutual funds, they conclude that market tantrums can arise independently of the degree of leverage in the system.\n\n\f4\nDuring the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission\nof monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. In those circumstances, the actions taken to\nimplement monetary policy can also affect financial stability. The FOMC has acknowledged that\nnonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of very\nlow interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and by\nspurring risk-taking in a search for yield.4 Empirical work is beginning to document this effect. For\nexample, Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) use data on 23 million bank loans from the\nSpanish credit registry and find that a lower overnight policy rate induces low-capitalized banks to lend\nmore to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized banks, direct\nevidence of monetary policy’s effect on risk-taking.5\n\nThus, while I believe that, in most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are\ncomplementary, we need to recognize that, at times, actions taken to foster financial stability and those\ntaken to promote our monetary policy goals might be in conflict, at least in the short run. In the U.K., the\nFinancial Services Act recognizes this potential tradeoff and explicitly says that the Financial Policy\nCommittee is not authorized to act in a way that it feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on\nthe capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long\nterm.”6\n\nIn deciding whether to take action against a growing imbalance, policymakers need to balance the\nexpected improvement in future economic conditions against the potential cost of unduly limiting credit\n\n4\n\nThe Board of Governors discusses developments related to financial stability in its monetary policy report to\nCongress. For example, see Board of Governors (2016), p. 20.\n5\n\nJiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) separately identify how a change in the monetary policy rate affects\nthe demand for credit and the volume and composition of credit supplied, in particular, the supply to riskier\nborrowers.\n6\n\nSee Section 9c(4) of the U.K.’s Financial Stability Act 2012.\n\n\f5\nextension. Too high a resilience standard will thwart risk-taking and innovation, which will undermine\nlonger-run economic growth. In setting the standard, we need to come to some common understanding\nabout the amount of growth and prosperity we are willing to give up in order to lower the risk to financial\nstability. In the U.S., people who are 80 years old have lived through two major financial crises (the\nGreat Depression and the 2008 crisis). Is that too many? Would we rather lower the probability of such\nan event to one every 1,000 years? What would we be willing to give up to do that?\n\nThat may be a premature question at this point. There are likely things that can be done and that are being\ndone to lower the risk to financial stability without much cost in terms of longer-run growth. If we think\nof there being a risk-return frontier relating financial stability risk to the economic return that a wellfunctioning financial system can provide, then it isn’t hard to imagine that we were operating at a point\nwell interior to that frontier in the run-up to the crisis, and that the improvements being made in our\nfinancial regulatory and supervisory regime are moving us toward the frontier without sacrificing growth.\nThis brings me to my second point.\n\nPoint 2: To foster the resiliency of the financial system, macroprudential tools are being developed\nto lower the probability that instability arises and to limit the damage when financial shocks arise.\nIn the U.S., the regulatory reforms engendered in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act aim to foster financial stability in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of\na financial crisis, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits\nthe financial system. Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies in\nthe U.S. were directed to augment their traditional microprudential approach, which promotes the safety\nand soundness of individual institutions, with a macroprudential approach in which examiners and\nsupervisors take a horizontal view of risk across institutions rather than looking at only one institution at a\ntime.\n\n\f6\nAlthough there is still more to be done, regulators continue to make progress in developing tools to\nimplement the macroprudential approach and to monitor the risks over the business and financial cycles.\nSome tools focus on building up the structural resiliency of the financial system throughout the business\ncycle. In my view, these structural resiliency tools are the most promising. They include the Basel III\nrisk-based capital requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, central clearing for derivatives, and\nbank stress tests. Living-will resolution plans and the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which is housed at\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), are intended to make it easier for regulators and\npolicymakers to allow large complex financial institutions to fail.\n\nIn addition to structural tools, there are countercyclical tools that aim to mitigate the systemic risk that can\nbuild up over the business cycle. These include the countercyclical capital buffer and the capital\nconservation buffer.7 Other possible cyclical tools, not yet established in the U.S. but used in other\ncountries, include loan-to-value ratio limits and debt-to-income ratio limits that vary over the cycle and\nwhich have been targeted to particular sectors like housing credit or household credit.8\n\nThe performance of the set of macroprudential tools is largely untested. Cross-country studies find mixed\nresults, with the effectiveness of the tools varying with economic circumstances and the types of shocks\n\n7\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer allows regulators to increase risk-based capital requirements when credit growth\nis judged to be excessive and leading to rising systemic risk. The capital conservation buffer ensures that banks\nraise capital above regulatory minimums in good times so that when they cover losses in bad times, their capital\nratio will stay at or above the regulatory minimum.\n8\n\nFor example, Canada tightened loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits on mortgage lending over the 2009 to 2012\nperiod (Krznar and Morsink, 2014). Beginning in 2010, Israel also implemented a package of macroprudential tools\nto restrict the supply of housing credit (Fischer, 2014). Spain introduced dynamic loan-loss provisioning in 2000.\nThis method builds up reserves during good economic times according to the historical losses experienced by the\nasset classes held in the bank’s portfolio. This buffer is then available to absorb losses in bad times (Balla and\nMcKenna, 2009).\n\n\f7\nhitting the financial sector.9\n\nIn the U.S., the application of these countercyclical tools is complicated by the complexity of the\nregulatory structure. There are multiple financial regulators in the U.S., including the Federal Reserve,\nthe FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Association, the U.S.\nTreasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In many cases, the\nregulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by instrument. While\nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), created by the Dodd-Frank Act, promotes coordination\nand information sharing across these financial system regulators, the need to coordinate countercyclical\nmacroprudential policy actions across multiple regulators in the U.S. adds a complication to effectively\nusing such tools in a timely way.\n\nThe complex financial system also makes monitoring risks more complicated. The Office of Financial\nResearch, established under Dodd-Frank, is collecting data to aid in this task. The Federal Reserve has\nalso developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, and financial stability surveillance is\nreceiving regular attention in FOMC meetings.10 This regular and systematic analysis is helping us to\n\n9\n\nFor example, a study by economists at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) examined the effectiveness of\nmacroprudential tools in reducing systemic risk in 49 countries. The authors concluded that many of the most\nfrequently used tools were effective in reducing the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage, but the effectiveness\ndepended on the type of shock hitting the financial sector. (See Lin, Columba, Costa, Kongsamut, Otani, Saiyid,\nWezel, and We, 2011.) Another study published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) examined 57\ncountries over a span of up to three decades and found that imposing maximum debt-service-to-income ratios can\nlimit the buildup of credit in housing markets, but maximum loan-to-value ratios were less effective, and\ninstruments like reserve and liquidity requirements focused on the supply of credit had little impact on housing\nmarkets. (See Kuttner and Shim, 2016.)\n10\n\nThis framework is described in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013), and involves tracking a standard set of financial\nsystem vulnerabilities, including the pricing of risk, leverage, maturity and liquidity transformation, and\ninterconnectedness and complexity. Recognizing the complex nature of the U.S. financial system, Federal Reserve\nstaff track these risks across four broad areas of the financial system: asset markets, the banking sector, shadow\nbanks, and the nonfinancial sector.\n\n\f8\nbetter identify changes in conditions over time. This brings me to my next point: the importance of\ntaking a systematic approach to financial stability.\n\nPoint 3: To the extent possible, policymakers should take a systematic approach in applying\nfinancial stability policy rather than relying on discretion.\nThe financial crisis underscored the important role of incentives in financial markets – not only the\nincentives of financial institutions but also those of regulators and policymakers. Time-inconsistency\nproblems and moral hazard issues are important factors that need to be considered when designing a\nframework for implementing financial stability policy. These types of problems argue for taking a\nsystematic approach in applying financial stability policy rather than relying on discretion.\n\nThe benefits of systematic monetary policy are well established. When monetary policymakers respond\nin a systematic fashion to incoming information, the public will have a better sense of how policymakers\nare likely to react to economic developments – whether those developments are anticipated or\nunanticipated – so their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment\nhelps the public make better financial and economic decisions, thereby making monetary policy more\neffective.\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which\npolicymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. Being\nsystematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems in monetary policy, whereby policymakers\nmay favor the short run over the long run. Note that by systematic policy I do not mean that monetary\npolicy will be set mechanically by a policy rule or that policymakers need to be prescient about the types\nof shocks that will hit the economy. Rather, I mean that policy will react in a systematic fashion to\neconomic developments that change the economic outlook.\n\n\f9\nA systematic approach to financial stability policy is perhaps even more important than in the case of\nmonetary policy because of the important role played by incentives. The crisis shined a bright light on\nsignificant moral hazard problems that exist in financial markets. A financial stability policymaker that is\nsystematic in how it applies its tools to promote stability will likely help tame some of the moral hazard\nproblems and also some of the time-inconsistency problems to which the regulators themselves are\nsubject.\n\nAn important tool in this regard is the resolution of insolvent financial institutions. Without a credible\nresolution method, during the crisis in the face of serious distress at a large financial firm, governments\nfaced a dilemma: either rescue the firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and\nrisk causing a cascade of other failures. The fact that policymakers had to make these decisions in the\nheat of the moment using their best judgment based on limited information didn’t help. Without a\ncredible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that even well-intentioned policymakers will be\nbiased toward bailouts. A resolution method that can be applied systematically can help alleviate this\nproblem. The living-will resolution plans and Orderly Liquidation Authority in the U.S. are promising,\nbut still untested, tools in a process that will allow large firms to fail. This, in turn, provides incentives\nfor these large, systemically important institutions to reorganize themselves in a way that reduces the risk\nthey pose to the financial system.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has become more systematic in monitoring risks across the financial\nsystem. Coupling that monitoring with the application of a resiliency standard across the entire financial\nservices landscape, including the so-called shadow banking system that was less-heavily regulated in the\npast, would limit regulatory arbitrage. As the financial crisis made clear, taking an action that pushes risk\n\n\f10\nfrom one set of institutions to another doesn’t eliminate the risk, it just moves it around, potentially to a\npart of the financial system where the risk is more difficult to monitor and control.11\n\nI acknowledge that this broad application of the resiliency standard across the financial system may be\nparticularly difficult in the U.S. with its complex regulatory structure. Still, we can devise ways to make\nthe macroprudential tools more systematic and less discretionary. Regulators could agree in advance on\nthe contingencies under which the cyclical macroprudential tools would be invoked, rather than waiting\nuntil the risks escalated before starting the process to coordinate action. For example, we can write down\na formula for a countercyclical buffer, and we can define an explicit trigger for contingent convertible\nbonds. Knowing that such policies will be systematically applied and what will trigger them may induce\nfinancial market participants to limit the buildup of risks in the first place. This underscores the\nimportance of communication, my fourth point.\n\nPoint 4: Macroprudential policy actions must be communicated in a clear way to avoid creating a\nconflict with or causing confusion over actions taken to foster monetary policy goals.\nTransparency and clear communication are hallmarks of best-practice monetary policymaking and the\nsame should be true for financial stability policymaking. Clear communication helps align the public’s\npolicy expectations, which makes monetary policy more effective. Transparency is necessary so that the\npublic and elected officials have the ability to hold monetary policymakers accountable for their\ndecisions. The Federal Reserve has been given independence in setting monetary policy, which has been\nwell documented as yielding more effective policy and better economic outcomes. But accountability\n\n11\n\nApplication of a resiliency standard would allow the type of supervision to vary appropriately by the nature of the\nsystemic risk associated with each part of the financial system. As discussed in Mester (2015), this is a component\nof the regime for financial stability advocated by Paul Tucker (2015). Several of the macroprudential tools are\nfocused on those institutions that have been deemed systemically important, including the capital surcharge for\nglobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and the U.S. stress tests for banks with more than $50 billion in\nassets.\n\n\f11\nmust go hand-in-hand with independence. So the Federal Reserve regularly communicates the basis for\nits policy decisions.\n\nA parallel can be drawn with financial stability policy. Although, in some cases, prudential supervisory\ninformation should be kept private, as a general principle, I think financial stability policymakers should\nstrive for greater transparency and more disclosure. Similarly, they should require more disclosure from\nfinancial firms so that creditors and other market participants can exert market discipline.\n\nOf course, clear communication is easier said than done. Three aspects make this even harder for\nfinancial stability policy than for monetary policy. First, the framework and tools of financial stability\npolicy are new. It will take considerable effort on the part of the financial stability policymakers to\nexplain the tools they are using and the rationale for their policy decisions. However, such\ncommunication is necessary so that the public understands when an action is being taken because of\nconcerns about financial stability rather than concerns about monetary policy goals. This would be\nparticularly true when the monetary policy authority is also responsible for taking financial stability\nactions, and if monetary policy were the tool used to address the financial stability concerns. It is worth\nconsidering whether separating decisions about financial stability from decisions about monetary policy\nwithin the central bank, perhaps by having separate committees as in the U.K., could aid communication\nand decision-making.12\n\nA second complication for effective communication of financial stability policy is timing. If effective\nmonetary policy means taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, then effective financial\nstability policy might mean taking away the punch bowl before the guests have even arrived because the\nseeds of financial instability are sown much earlier and action must be taken earlier as well. If the need\n12\n\nKohn (2015) discusses the benefits of such separation.\n\n\f12\nfor monetary policy to be forward looking is a difficult concept for the public to grasp, the need for\nfinancial stability policy to act well before there are clear signs of instability may be even more difficult\nto explain.\n\nYet a third complication to effective communication is the complexity of the financial regulatory regime\nitself.13 In my view, a sometimes overlooked lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can\ncomplicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Given the scope and everchanging nature of the financial system, regulatory complexity is, to a certain extent, unavoidable. But\nthe tradeoffs should be recognized. For example, it is reasonable to require banks to hold higher levels of\ncapital against higher-risk assets, but a system of risk weights that is overly granular and complex would\nbe counterproductive. In practice, too much complexity would make it harder for regulators to assess\ncompliance and to determine whether institutions were engaging in some practices merely as a way to\nhide risk and lower their capital requirements. If regulators have made the rules so complex that they\ncannot assess compliance, then, in practice, there are no consequences for firms that fail to meet the\nstandards. Complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the monitors. It might be worth exploring\nwhether we would be better off with a much simpler macro- and microprudential supervisory structure,\none that is easier to implement and simpler to govern and that is approximately right across various\neconomic models and states of the world even if it is never optimal in any particular model or state.\n\nOf course, we aren’t in that simpler regime. So the question is, given our current financial structure, how\nshould policy respond to emerging financial stability risks and what role should monetary policy play?\nThis question is the focus of my final point.\n\n13\n\nHaldane and Madouros (2012) discuss the benefits of a less complex financial regulatory structure and argue that\nthe complexity of the financial landscape does not call for a complex financial regulatory structure, but just the\nopposite.\n\n\f13\nPoint 5: Financial stability should not be added as another goal for monetary policy, but monetary\npolicymakers need to remain cognizant of the linkages between financial stability and monetary\npolicy goals.\nIn my view, the first line of defense against financial instability involves the tools that will make the\nstructure of the financial system less prone to crisis. These structural resiliency tools include higher\ncapital standards (including a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital\nstandards), liquidity standards, stress tests, living wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically\nimportant bank and nonbank financial institutions. Much work has been done to develop these structural\nresiliency tools, and I believe the system is in a better position to handle shocks now than it was before\nthe financial crisis.\n\nCountercyclical macroprudential tools, such as limits on loan-to-value ratios in particular markets, are\nworth further study, but at this point, I am not convinced that we have enough knowledge and experience\nwith them to use them effectively in the U.S. That consideration leads me to think that we should set\nstandards for the structural resiliency tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more\nconfidence in the countercyclical tools.\n\nWhat about using monetary policy? As I’ve discussed, monetary policy and financial stability goals and\nactions are interrelated. Very loose monetary policy increases the likelihood that financial instabilities\nwill develop, thereby increasing the likelihood that macroprudential policy tools will be needed. Tight\nmacroprudential policy can tighten financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood\nthat a monetary policy response will be needed.\n\nIn my view, monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and maximum\nemployment; financial stability should not be added as a third objective for monetary policy. First, it isn’t\nclear that monetary policy would be very effective against emerging financial stability risks. While\ninterest rates affect the fundamental value of assets, it is not clear that they affect the speculative or\n\n\f14\nbubble portion; the impact may depend on the underlying nature of the financial imbalance.14 Second,\nmonetary policy tends to be a blunt instrument, so any benefits of using it to stem financial imbalances,\nmispricing of assets, or excessive leverage need to be weighed against the economic costs in terms of\nprice stability and employment. Svensson (2016) brings some metrics to the question and concludes that\nthe costs outweigh the benefits.15\n\nWhile I don’t believe financial stability should be part of the monetary policy mandate, I do think that\nwhen we are making monetary policy decisions, we need to be cognizant of the linkages between our\nmonetary policy actions and financial stability. In the case of the housing market, which precipitated the\nlast crisis, policymakers underestimated the breadth and depth of the negative impact this would have on\nthe rest of the economy and financial system. To the extent that we misjudged the impact, there is a\nlarger potential gain to carefully monitoring financial market conditions, implementing the structural\nmacroprudential tools, and being open to taking offsetting action should imbalances develop.16\n\nIf our macroprudential tools proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks continued to grow, I\nbelieve monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. However, in this case, the blurring\nbetween financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to\nfinancial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also\nbe in jeopardy. Which brings me back to my original point: in most cases, the goals of price stability,\nmaximum employment, and financial stability are complementary.\n14\n\nFor example, in the Gali (2014) model, raising interest rates to combat a bubble can actually inflate it.\n\n15\n\nThe benefit of “leaning against the wind,” that is, running monetary policy tighter than it otherwise would be in\norder to stem emerging financial instabilities, is a reduction in the probability of entering into a financial crisis. The\ncost is worse economic conditions today and higher economic costs should the economy enter into a crisis. By\nSvensson’s (2016) metrics, these costs outweigh the small reduction in the probability of a crisis. One caveat about\nSvensson’s analysis is that it is based on a log-linear model, but we know that financial crises involve extreme states\nand non-linearities.\n16\n\nPeek, Rosengren, and Tootell’s (2015) textural analysis of the transcripts of FOMC meetings from 1982 through\n2009 suggests that the FOMC does consider financial stability when setting monetary policy.\n\n\f15\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by noting that in his 2015 presidential address to the American Finance Association,\nLuigi Zingales (2015) posed the question, “Does Finance Benefit Society?” While academics, and, I\nbelieve, central bankers, typically say “yes,” a recent survey indicates that the average American is much\nless certain.17 I am hopeful that the considerable efforts underway across the globe will change that. I\nbelieve it is our responsibility to ensure that we create and maintain a financial system that is seen by the\npublic as being beneficial, and one that truly is.\n\n17\n\nZingales (2015) cites the Chicago Booth-Kellogg School Financial Trust Index survey of a representative sample\nof about 1,000 American households, conducted by Social Science Research Solutions. Forty-eight percent of\nrespondents to the December 2014 survey said that the U.S. financial system hurts the U.S. economy, while only 34\npercent said that it benefits the U.S. economy.\n\n\f16\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring.” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series (FEDS) paper 2013-21, Divisions of Research and Statistics and\nMonetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board, March 2013.\nAdrian, Tobias, and Hyun Song Shin, “Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics,” in Handbook\nof Monetary Economics, Vol. 3a, ed. by B.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Cleveland Association for Business Economics, CFA Society Cleveland,\nand the Risk Management Association, Northern Ohio Chapter\nCleveland, OH\nApril 6, 2016\n\nPresident Mester delivered similar remarks about the national economy to the New York Association for\nBusiness Economics in New York, NY on April 1, 2016.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon and thank you for that very kind introduction. I also thank the Cleveland Association for\nBusiness Economics, CFA Society Cleveland, and the Northern Ohio chapter of the Risk Management\nAssociation for inviting me to speak today. The very first speech I gave in Cleveland as president of the\nCleveland Fed was at your organizations’ invitation. As they say, you never forget your first, and so it is\nwith great pleasure that I am back with you today. Another reason I’m happy to be here is that I believe\nan important responsibility of Federal Reserve policymakers is to share their economic perspectives with\nthe public. Congress has wisely given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in\npursuit of our statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. I say “wisely” because a body\nof research and practical experience both here and abroad show that when central banks formulate\nmonetary policy free from short-run political interference, the policy is more effective and yields better\neconomic outcomes. But to preserve that independence, the central bank must be held accountable for its\npolicy decisions. And a key component of that accountability involves policymakers providing\ninformation to the public on their evaluation of economic conditions, their outlook for the economy, and\nthe rationale for their decisions.\n\nAt its March meeting, three weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC also released a new set of economic\nprojections, something that it does four times a year. Today, I plan to discuss my outlook for the national\nand regional economy and monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nDespite the gyrations in financial markets at the start of the year, the underlying fundamentals of the U.S.\neconomy remain sound. I expect the economy to grow at a moderate pace of 2.25 to 2.5 percent this year,\nslightly above its longer-run trend and sufficient to generate further job gains and a further reduction in\n\n\f2\nthe unemployment rate this year. I anticipate that inflation will continue to move gradually up toward our\ntarget of 2 percent over time. In my view, it will be appropriate for monetary policymakers to continue to\ngradually reduce the level of accommodation this year.\n\nIn putting together my forecast for the March FOMC meeting, I incorporated the new information we had\nreceived since the December FOMC projections. Although we publish our forecasts four times a year, let\nme assure you that policymakers are constantly assessing incoming information for its implications for\nthe outlook and risks around the outlook. This information includes the official statistical releases and the\nreports we garner from talking to our boards of directors, advisory councils, and other contacts in our\nregions. It is important that our policy be “data-dependent,” meaning that policy should depend on how\neconomic and financial conditions evolve, to the extent that those conditions have implications for the\nmedium-run outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nThe focus is on the medium run because that’s the time horizon over which monetary policy affects the\neconomy. But we live in a high-frequency world. Measures of stock market volatility, like the VIX,\nattest to that. The market gyrations at the end of last year and the beginning of this year were notable.\nThe declines in global equity markets partly reflected market participants’ reassessment of the outlook for\nglobal growth, as well as their views on how effective policy actions taken abroad will be. Over the past\nmonth or so, we’ve seen some stability return to financial markets. Volatility has declined, stock prices\nhave risen, and credit risk spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed. As a result, on balance, financial\nconditions are only slightly more restrictive than they were in December.\n\nWhile less volatile than financial market indicators can be, economic data can also vary quite a bit from\nmonth to month. “Data-dependent” policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every short-run\nchange in the data – that would be a mistake. One of the challenges for monetary policymakers is making\n\n\f3\nlow-frequency policy in a high-frequency world. We need to extract the signal about where the economy\nis headed from economic and financial market information that can often be noisy.\n\nMy own forecasts tend to have some consistency over time because I try to stay focused on underlying\nfundamentals and the medium-run outlook. That said, I have made some changes to my outlook since\nDecember. Most of the changes have to do with my longer-run projections. The moderate growth of\naround 2 percent that we’ve seen during the expansion has been sufficient to generate a significant fall in\nthe unemployment rate, while inflation has remained low. Taking that evidence on board, I slightly\nmoved down my estimates of longer-run growth, the longer-run unemployment rate, and the longer-run\nfed funds rate, reducing each by 25 basis points. I now project longer-run growth at 2 percent, the longerrun unemployment rate at 5 percent, and the longer-run fed funds rate at 3.25 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\nIn terms of the forecast, as I’ve mentioned, I anticipate that growth will pick up to a 2.25 to 2.5 percent\nrange this year. That is slightly lower than my last forecast and reflects both the weakness we saw in the\nfourth quarter, which suggests that the economy entered 2016 with a little less momentum, and slightly\ntighter financial conditions, which partly reflect somewhat slower growth abroad. So far, the information\nwe have suggests that growth in the first quarter will remain near the fourth quarter’s pace of around 1.5\npercent, but there is still more information coming in.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, has been one of the economy’s\nstrengths, although it too has shown month-to-month volatility that we need to smooth through.\nConsumer spending has been buoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets; growth in\npersonal income, reflecting the progress in labor markets; and lower oil prices, as well as highly\naccommodative monetary policy that has kept borrowing rates low. The drop in gasoline prices from\n$3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42 per gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S.\n\n\f4\nEnergy Information Administration now forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.89 per gallon this\nyear, which would mean another $400 in cost savings for the average household. I believe we are seeing\na positive effect on spending from lower gasoline prices. Auto sales were particularly strong over the past\nyear, hitting a new record of nearly 17.5 million; many of these were SUVs and other larger vehicles.\nInstead of spending it, some households may be choosing to save some of the windfall from lower gas\nprices – we’ve seen the savings rate rise. Or they may be using it to pay down debt. Either way, the\nimprovement in balance sheets will help support future consumption.\n\nThe housing sector has also shown steady improvement, and I expect that to continue. Total sales of new\nand existing homes have been rising slowly over the past few years. Existing home sales have made\nconsiderable progress in approaching the average level seen before the run-up during the housing bubble,\nwhile new home sales still have some ways to go to reach that milestone. Housing starts have been\nmoving up but are still below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the\nlonger run, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn’t kept up with demand. So there is some\nchance we will see an acceleration in construction this year. Mortgage rates are low, but households are\nbeing appropriately careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are\nlending to those with good credit quality. House prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace, on a\nnational level. This has allowed households to rebuild some of the housing equity they lost during the\nhousing bust, another factor that will support consumer spending going forward.\n\nWhile residential investment has been improving, business fixed investment remains weak. The sharp\ndrop in oil prices since mid-2014 has benefitted consumers but has weighed heavily on firms in the\ndrilling and mining sector, on their suppliers, and on regions whose economies depend on the energy\nsector. Firms tied to the sector have responded by cutting jobs and reducing investment. Some firms may\nface bankruptcy or will need to merge. In the face of low oil prices, I expect this sector to feel continued\npressure.\n\n\f5\n\nManufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging\nenvironment. The dollar has appreciated around 20 percent since mid-2014. This appreciation has been a\nconsiderable drag on U.S. export growth and on manufacturing output. We can expect the dollar to\nremain strong because real growth in the U.S. is expected to exceed growth abroad, and interest rates in\nthe U.S. are expected to be higher than those in our major trading partners for some time to come.\nHowever, the rate of appreciation of the dollar has slowed, so the direct effect on U.S. net exports will\nlikely lessen over time. Indeed, after last year’s deceleration in manufacturing output, several surveys\nsuggest that manufacturing activity may be stabilizing. These include the national survey conducted by\nthe Institute for Supply Management, as well as the regional surveys conducted by the Dallas, New York,\nPhiladelphia, and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nAs this review suggests, some parts of the economy are doing better than others. But the message I take\nfrom U.S. economic performance is that despite financial market volatility, despite the pain inflicted on\nthe energy sector from falling oil prices, and despite the relatively weak growth abroad, the U.S. economy\nhas proven to be remarkably resilient.\n\nLabor Markets\nStrong evidence of this resiliency is seen in labor markets. The unemployment rate is now half of what it\nwas at its peak of 10 percent in October 2009. Over the past two years, we’ve also seen significant\nimprovement in other measures of the under-utilization of labor. The share of workers who are working\npart-time but who would prefer to work full-time has declined significantly, as has the number of people\nwho have only been looking for work sporadically or who have been discouraged from looking at all\nbecause they don’t think they’ll find a job. Since its low point last September, the labor force\n\n\f6\nparticipation rate has risen by over half of a percentage point and is now at a level consistent with\nestimates of its longer-run trend.1\n\nPayroll job growth has averaged more than 200,000 jobs per month over the past two years. And while\nthere have been ups and downs in the monthly reports – as there always are – I think it is notable that\neven as output growth slowed during the fourth quarter of last year, firms continued to add workers to\ntheir payrolls at a very good pace. The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor\nTurnover Survey, or JOLTS, show that some dynamism is returning to the labor market.2 The rate of job\nopenings is stronger than during the previous expansion, and both the hiring and quit rates have risen to\nlevels suggesting that firms are looking to hire and workers are confident enough to be looking for better\njobs.\n\nWage acceleration typically lags the improvement in labor markets, and this time is no different. Average\nhourly earnings have only slowly accelerated over the past few years, and the employment cost index,\nwhich measures total compensation, has risen at about 2 percent a year over the past three years. Some of\nthe anecdotal reports suggest that wage pressures may be building. We have heard for some time from\nemployers in our region that it has been hard to find workers with the necessary skills in certain higherskilled occupations, including information technology, health care, and specialized construction. Firms\nhave had to increase wages and benefits and offer and sweeten retention packages for these types of\nworkers. But we are now hearing increasingly from firms across the service sector that they are having\n\n1\n\nSee Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William\nWascher, “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic\nActivity, Fall 2014, pp. 197-255.\n2\n\nNote that John Haltiwanger argues that there has been a longer-run decline in labor market fluidity. See John\nHaltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” paper written for\nthe Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth conference, August 2015.\n\n\f7\ndifficulty finding workers in lower-skilled and less-specialized occupations, like bank tellers and retail\nstaff. As labor markets continue to tighten, I expect to see wages accelerate somewhat.\n\nI do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many workers have had during the recession and slow\nrecovery, and that many continue to have. For example, those who have lost jobs in the mining, oil, and\ngas sectors in Appalachia and eastern Ohio have been slow to find new work because the economies in\nthose areas are not well-diversified. I believe there are longer-run workforce development issues\naffecting U.S. labor markets, and the deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated\nthese problems. As a country, we need to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of\nthe labor force to raise our standard of living and make us more competitive in the global economy. The\nquestion is how to do that. I do not believe monetary policy would be effective in addressing these\nlonger-run problems. More than that, trying to rely on it to do so is counterproductive because it takes the\nfocus off of programs and policies that can help to prepare and sustain workers in the modern workforce.\nSo from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, the totality of the evidence suggests to me that\nthe economy is basically at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment.\nHowever, I do believe that government policy and programs, such as educational assistance and retraining\nprograms, have a role to play in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and it should be brought\nto bear.\n\nRegional Growth and Labor Markets\nAn important role of Federal Reserve Bank presidents is gathering information from our regions to help\ninform national monetary policy. For example, the anecdotal information on wages that I just mentioned\nhas been particularly useful. Let me spend a few minutes on economic developments in the Fourth\nFederal Reserve District, which comprises all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the\nnorthern panhandle of West Virginia. Our regional economy is quite diverse, but the path of economic\nexpansion here has been similar to the nation’s, with some sectors performing better than others and with\n\n\f8\nlonger-run economic challenges evident. The outlook for our regional economy is similar to that of the\nnation.\n\nThe energy sector in our region continues to feel the effects of the sharp decline in oil prices since mid2014, as well as the longer-term shift away from coal as a source of energy. The region had seen a sharp\nincrease in production and employment in the oil and gas extraction sector as new technologies were\nbrought to bear. But while natural gas production remains at historic highs, the sharp drop in oil prices\nsince mid-2014 has resulted in a significant slowdown in natural gas and oil exploration in the Marcellus\nand Utica shale regions, which include the part of our District in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.\nSuppliers and other service providers to the industry and those employed in the industry have also\nexperienced the slowdown.3\n\nRegional firms with international exposure, such as steel producers, also continue to struggle in the wake\nof dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices that reflect weak global demand. Like the nation as a\nwhole, the region’s economy has diversified over time, with jobs shifting from manufacturing to the\nservice sector. Still, manufacturing remains a relatively important sector in our region, accounting for 15\npercent of private-sector jobs in Ohio compared to about 10 percent in the U.S. While manufacturers\nwith ties to energy and steel production have faced challenges, the weakness in that segment has been\noffset by production increases at manufacturers supplying the construction industry, and by the auto\nindustry, which represents a significant share of manufacturing in Ohio and Kentucky. Over the past few\nyears, District auto plants have produced about 17 percent of the nation’s autos and light trucks, so as auto\nsales have risen to record levels, regional production has risen as well. Our contacts in the District’s auto\nsector remain optimistic even though the record sales pace seems likely to level off.\n3\n\nFor further discussion of trends in the energy, steel, and auto sectors in the Cleveland Federal Reserve District, see\nMark E. Schweitzer, Robert Sadowski, and Christopher Vecchio, “Three Trends Influencing the Region’s Growth,”\nForefront, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, January 15, 2016.\n\n\f9\n\nLike the rest of the nation, our region has seen considerable improvement in labor markets. In Ohio, the\nunemployment rate has fallen sharply from a peak of 11 percent in December 2009 to 4.9 percent in\nFebruary, about the national average. Since the start of the expansion, jobs in Ohio have been growing at\nan annual pace of 1.2 percent. Admittedly, this is slower than the nation’s 1.4 percent pace. However,\nOhio’s job growth has been well above the pace we saw during the previous expansion, when\nemployment in Ohio was essentially flat. When I last spoke before your organizations in September\n2014, employment in Ohio had not quite made it back to its pre-recession peak. There is no denying that\nit was a long time in coming, but Ohio payroll employment has finally regained its pre-recession peak.\n\nThe longer-run challenges facing national labor markets also affect the regional economy. In addition,\npopulation growth in our region has been slower than in other parts of the country. Ohio’s population has\nbeen growing at less than 0.4 percent a year over the past 5 years, about half as fast as in the nation as a\nwhole, and considerably slower than in the southern and western parts of the country. This is an\nadditional factor that will need to be considered when assessing the future outlook for regional labor\nmarkets and the overall economic health of the region.\n\nInflation\nIn addition to maximum employment, price stability is the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate. Inflation\nhas been running below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the\neffects of earlier declines in the price of oil and other commodities since mid-2014, as well as the\nappreciation of the dollar, which has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S. But the\nmost recent data have been somewhat encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the\nFOMC. As oil prices and the dollar have shown some stability of late, the headline and underlying\nmeasures of inflation have moved higher. And these moves are not just one month’s data. Headline and\ncore inflation, as measured by the year-over-year changes in the underlying indices, have been moving up\n\n\f10\nover the past year. Headline PCE inflation has risen to 1 percent from 0.2 percent at the start of last year,\nand core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent, compared to 1.3 percent a year ago. Core CPI inflation is now\nabove 2 percent. The Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is 2.4 percent and it, too, has been rising\nover the past year.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. In my view, inflation\nexpectations have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices. Marketbased inflation compensation, which measures the difference in yields between nominal Treasury\nsecurities and Treasury inflation-protected securities, has fallen by more than the survey measures of\ninflation expectations. But movements in inflation compensation have been highly correlated with\nchanges in oil prices, and in this period of heightened market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into\nU.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based\nmeasure of inflation compensation. Various models suggest that the movements in inflation\ncompensation more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes\nin expectations.4\n\n4\n\nThe Cleveland Fed publishes estimates of inflation expectations and the inflation risk premium based on a model\nthat incorporates survey measures of inflation expectations as well as market data on nominal Treasuries and\ninflation swaps. The 5-year/5-year-forward measure of inflation expectations has been relatively stable and near 2\npercent. The data are available at www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/inflationexpectations.aspx For a discussion of this model, see Joseph Haubrich, George Pennacchi, and Peter Ritchken,\n“Inflation Expectations, Real Rates, and Risk Premia: Evidence from Inflation Swaps,” The Review of Financial\nStudies, 25, 2012, pp. 1588-1629. See also the Atlanta Fed’s macroblog discussion by Nikolay Gospodinov and\nPaula Tkac, “Are Long-Term Inflation Expectations Declining? Not So Fast, Says Atlanta Fed,” January 15, 2016.\nThe authors conclude that long-run inflation expectations remain stable and that the large correlation of marketbased inflation compensation and oil prices is due mainly to the liquidity premium on TIPS. These conclusions are\nbased on a model described in Nikolay Gospodinov and Bin Wei, “Forecasts of Inflation and Interest Rates in NoArbitrage Affine Models,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Working Paper 2016-3, February 2016, and Nikolay\nGospodinov and Bin Wei, “A Note on Extracting Inflation Expectations from Market Prices on TIPS and Inflation\nDerivatives,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, November 2015.\n\n\f11\nBased on the evidence at hand, if the real side of the economy continues to perform consistent with my\nprojections, I expect inflation to remain low this year but to gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent\nover the next couple of years. And I will continue to monitor all of the measures of inflation and inflation\nexpectations to assess whether this forecast is on track.\n\nRisks to the Forecast\nOf course, we have to recognize that the economy rarely evolves exactly as expected. The world is a\ndynamic place and the economy is hit by shocks, both positive and negative. So any economic forecast is\nsurrounded by fairly wide confidence bands, and mine is no exception. I see risks on both the downside\nand the upside around my forecast. If the dollar were to appreciate more than I’ve assumed, perhaps\nbecause of weaker growth abroad, or if there were a significant further decline in oil prices rather than a\nstabilization, then growth and inflation could be lower than in my baseline forecast. The actions taken by\nseveral foreign central banks to increase monetary accommodation to further support their economies\nmay help to mitigate some of this risk.\n\nBecause inflation has been undershooting our goal for some time, many people have quite reasonably\nbeen focusing on the downside risks to inflation. But it is also good to keep in mind that, according to\nanalysis by the Cleveland Fed staff, over the last 15 years historical forecast errors from several highly\nregarded inflation forecasting models have skewed to the upside; that is, the models have tended to\nunderestimate actual inflation.5 While the steep declines in oil prices have kept inflation low, in the\ncurrent environment, low oil prices also pose an upside risk to inflation over the medium run. They may\n\n5\n\nModels whose forecast errors skew to the upside include the Faust and Wright inflation-expectations gap model\nand the Stock and Watson unobserved components model. See Jon Faust and Jonathan H. Wright, “Forecasting\nInflation,” in Handbook of Economic Forecasting, Graham Elliott and Allan Timmermann, eds., Amsterdam:\nElsevier Press, vol. 2A, 2013, pp. 2-56, and James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson, “Why Has U.S. Inflation Become\nHarder to Forecast?” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, supplement to vol. 39, no. 1, February 2007, pp. 3-33.\n\n\f12\nspur stronger-than-expected consumer spending, and this, combined with accommodative monetary\npolicy, could lead to a faster increase in inflation than forecasted.\n\nThe intense volatility in financial markets that we saw at the end of last year and the beginning of this\nyear has subsided. But were it to intensify and be sustained, this could lead to a broader pullback in risk\nappetites among investors, businesses, and consumers, which could dampen the U.S. economy. I note,\nthough, that even during the recent turbulence we did not see this. Focusing too much on signals from\nmarket volatility is also a risk, as messages from the market can turn around quickly. It could be that if\nmarkets remain relatively stable, businesses may begin to feel more secure and investment spending may\npick up more than expected. The resiliency of the U.S. economy throughout turbulent times is worth\nremembering as we aim to set monetary policy that will promote our longer-run goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\nGiven actual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward\nour policy goals, my assessment at this time is that it will be appropriate to continue to gradually reduce\nthe degree of accommodation this year. Gradual normalization means that monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against\ndownside risks. I think that’s appropriate given some of the forces still affecting our economy – for\nexample, slow growth abroad, appreciation of the dollar, somewhat more restrictive financial conditions,\nand the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, at our March meeting the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds\nrate at ¼ to ½ percent. I did not dissent from that decision. Even though I expect it will be appropriate to\ncontinue on the path of normalization this year, I recognized that the data we had on the first quarter were\nlimited. I agreed that a reasonable case could be made to wait until more information could be gathered\n\n\f13\nand assessed to see if they confirm that the economy is evolving as anticipated – namely, resumption of\nthe moderate growth trajectory, with continued improvement in labor markets and inflation on track for a\ngradual return to 2 percent.\n\nI do not think the FOMC is behind the curve, but while there are risks to moving too soon, there are also\nrisks to waiting too long to take the next steps on the normalization path given the lags with which\nmonetary policy affects the economy. We live with uncertainty and one could always make the case that\nwe should wait to act until we gather more information. But waiting until every piece of data lines up in\nthe correct way means waiting too long and risks having to move rates up more aggressively in the future,\nwith negative impacts on our economy. Similarly, forestalling rate increases for too long in light of\nfinancial market volatility that doesn’t affect the outlook may simply produce more volatility in the future\nif we find ourselves having to increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to achieve our goals.\n\nOf course, the actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how\nthey affect the outlook. As we’ve seen over this expansion, things can take unexpected turns, and we\nwant policy to appropriately react to changes in the medium-run outlook. The policy path I foresee as\nappropriate today is slightly more gradual than the path I foresaw in December, partly because of the\nslight downward revision to my growth forecast but mainly because I now estimate a lower longer-run\nequilibrium interest rate. But these are small changes. As indicated in the March Summary of Economic\nProjections, or SEP, the other FOMC participants also currently anticipate that it will be appropriate for\nthe funds rate to move up gradually over time, with the median path across participants now slightly\nshallower than in December. The change in the path provides an excellent illustration of how our policy\nis data dependent. The important point I’d like to leave you with is that the economy has shown\nconsiderable resiliency, and in my view, the outlook and risks around the outlook will likely support\ngradual reductions in the degree of accommodation this year.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, NY\nApril 1, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. I thank Ellen Zentner and the New York Association for Business Economics for the\ninvitation to speak to you today. I believe that one of the important responsibilities of a Federal Reserve\npolicymaker is to share his or her economic perspectives with the public. Congress has wisely given the\nFed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of our statutory goals of price stability\nand maximum employment. I say “wisely” because a body of research and practical experience both here\nand abroad show that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from short-run political\ninterference, the policy is more effective and yields better economic outcomes. But to preserve that\nindependence, the central bank must be held accountable for its policy decisions. And a key component\nof that accountability involves policymakers providing information to the public on their evaluation of\neconomic conditions, their outlook for the economy, and the rationale for their decisions.\n\nAt its March meeting, about two weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee made one of those\ndecisions: it decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC\nalso released a new set of economic projections, something that it does four times a year. Today, I plan to\ndiscuss my outlook for the economy and monetary policy. In doing so, I realize I am going against the\nteachings of Laozi, the 6th century BC Chinese philosopher, who said, “Those who have knowledge,\ndon’t predict, and those who predict, don’t have knowledge.” However, I take my inspiration from a\nmore modern thinker, Henri Poincaré, the 19th century French mathematician, who said, “It is far better to\nforesee even without certainty than not to foresee at all.” Before I discuss what I foresee, I should remind\nyou that the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nDespite the gyrations in financial markets at the start of the year, the underlying fundamentals of the U.S.\neconomy remain sound. I expect the economy to grow at a moderate pace of 2.25 to 2.5 percent this year,\n\n\f2\nslightly above its longer-run trend and sufficient to generate further job gains and a further reduction in\nthe unemployment rate this year. I anticipate that inflation will continue to move gradually up toward our\ntarget of 2 percent over time. In my view, it will be appropriate for monetary policymakers to continue to\ngradually reduce the level of accommodation this year.\n\nIn putting together my forecast for the March FOMC meeting, I incorporated the new information we had\nreceived since the December FOMC projections. I know that many people in this room have to forecast\nat a much higher frequency than four times a year. Let me assure you that policymakers are also\nconstantly assessing incoming information for its implications for the outlook and risks around the\noutlook. This information includes the official statistical releases and the reports we garner from talking\nto our boards of directors, advisory councils, and other contacts in our regions. It is important that our\npolicy be “data-dependent,” meaning that policy should depend on how economic and financial\nconditions evolve, to the extent that those conditions have implications for the medium-run outlook and\nrisks around the outlook.\n\nThe focus is on the medium-run outlook because that’s the time horizon over which monetary policy\naffects the economy. But we live in a high-frequency world. Measures of stock market volatility, like the\nVIX, attest to that. The market gyrations at the end of last year and the beginning of this year were\nnotable. The declines in global equity markets partly reflected market participants’ reassessment of the\noutlook for global growth, as well as their views on how effective policy actions taken abroad will be.\nOver the past month or so, we’ve seen some stability return to financial markets. Volatility has declined,\nstock prices have risen, and credit risk spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed. As a result, on\nbalance, financial conditions are only slightly more restrictive than they were in December.\n\nWhile less volatile than financial market indicators can be, economic data can also vary quite a bit from\nmonth to month. “Data-dependent” policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every short-run\n\n\f3\nchange in the data – that would be a mistake. One of the challenges for monetary policymakers is making\nlow-frequency policy in a high-frequency world. We need to extract the signal about where the economy\nis headed from economic and financial market information that can often be noisy.\n\nMy own forecasts tend to have some consistency over time because I try to stay focused on underlying\nfundamentals and the medium-run outlook. That said, I have made some changes to my outlook since\nDecember. Most of the changes have to do with my longer-run projections. In particular, the cumulative\nevidence since I last adjusted my longer-run projections has led me to slightly move down my estimates\nof longer-run growth, the longer-run unemployment rate, and the longer-run fed funds rate, each by 25\nbasis points. My longer-run growth and unemployment rate estimates had been on the high side of\nFOMC projections. Of course, it’s important to remember that because of the considerable uncertainty\naround estimates of potential growth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the equilibrium real interest\nrate, the differences across FOMC participants’ longer-run estimates are not statistically significant, nor\nare the 25-basis-point reductions I made to my own estimates. Nonetheless, I wanted to recognize that\nthe moderate growth of around 2 percent that we’ve seen during the expansion has been sufficient to\ngenerate a significant fall in the unemployment rate, while inflation has remained low. That combination\nof moderate growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and low inflation persuaded me that it was\ntime to take the evidence on board and to move my estimates of the longer-run values down a bit. I now\nproject longer-run growth at 2 percent, the longer-run unemployment rate at 5 percent, and the longer-run\nfed funds rate at 3.25 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\nIn terms of the forecast, as I’ve mentioned, I anticipate that growth will pick up to a 2.25 to 2.5 percent\nrange this year. That is slightly lower than my last forecast and reflects both the weakness we saw in the\nfourth quarter, which suggests that the economy entered 2016 with a little less momentum, and slightly\ntighter financial conditions, which partly reflect somewhat slower growth abroad. So far, the information\n\n\f4\nwe have suggests that growth in the first quarter will remain near the fourth quarter’s pace of around 1.5\npercent, but there is still more information coming in.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, has been one of the economy’s\nstrengths, although it too has shown month-to-month volatility that we need to smooth through.\nConsumer spending has been buoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets; growth in\npersonal income, reflecting the progress in labor markets; and lower oil prices, as well as highly\naccommodative monetary policy that has kept borrowing rates low. The drop in gasoline prices from\n$3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42 per gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S.\nEnergy Information Administration now forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.89 per gallon this\nyear, which would mean another $400 in cost savings for the average household. I believe we are seeing\na positive effect on spending from lower gasoline prices. Auto sales were particularly strong over the past\nyear, hitting a new record of 17.5 million; many of these were SUVs and other larger vehicles. Instead of\nspending it, some households may be choosing to save some of the windfall from lower gas prices –\nwe’ve seen the savings rate rise. Or they may be using it to pay down debt. Either way, the improvement\nin balance sheets will help support future consumption.\n\nThe housing sector has also shown steady improvement, and I expect that to continue. Total sales of new\nand existing homes have been rising slowly over the past few years. Existing home sales have made\nconsiderable progress in approaching the average level seen before the run-up during the housing bubble,\nwhile new home sales still have some ways to go to reach that milestone. Housing starts have been\nmoving up but are still below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the\nlonger run, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn’t kept up with demand. So there is some\nchance we will see an acceleration in construction this year. Mortgage rates are low, but households are\nbeing appropriately careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are\nlending to those with good credit quality. House prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace, on a\n\n\f5\nnational level. This has allowed households to rebuild some of the housing equity they lost during the\nhousing bust, another factor that will support consumer spending going forward.\n\nWhile residential investment has been improving, business fixed investment remains weak. The sharp\ndrop in oil prices since mid-2014 has benefitted consumers but has weighed heavily on firms in the\ndrilling and mining sector, on their suppliers, and on regions whose economies depend on the energy\nsector. Firms tied to the sector have responded by cutting jobs and reducing investment. Some firms may\nface bankruptcy or will need to merge. In the face of low oil prices, I expect this sector to feel continued\npressure.\n\nManufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging\nenvironment. The dollar has appreciated around 20 percent since mid-2014. This appreciation has been a\nconsiderable drag on U.S. export growth and on manufacturing output. We can expect the dollar to\nremain strong because real growth in the U.S. is expected to exceed growth abroad, and interest rates in\nthe U.S. are expected to be higher than those in our major trading partners for some time to come.\nHowever, the rate of appreciation of the dollar has slowed, so the direct effect on U.S. net exports will\nlikely lessen over time. Indeed, after last year’s deceleration in manufacturing output, several surveys\nsuggest that manufacturing activity may be stabilizing. These include the national survey conducted by\nthe Institute for Supply Management, as well as the regional surveys conducted by the Dallas, New York,\nPhiladelphia, and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nAs this review suggests, some parts of the economy are doing better than others. But the message I take\nfrom U.S. economic performance is that despite financial market volatility, despite the pain inflicted on\nthe energy sector from falling oil prices, and despite the relatively weak growth abroad, the U.S. economy\nhas proven to be remarkably resilient.\n\n\f6\nLabor Markets\nStrong evidence of this resiliency is seen in labor markets. The unemployment rate is now about half of\nwhat it was at its peak of 10 percent in October 2009. Over the past two years, we’ve also seen\nsignificant improvement in other measures of the under-utilization of labor. The share of workers who\nare working part-time but who would prefer to work full-time has declined significantly, as has the\nnumber of people who have only been looking for work sporadically or who have been discouraged from\nlooking at all because they don’t think they’ll find a job. Since its low point last September, the labor\nforce participation rate has risen by half of a percentage point and is now at a level consistent with\nestimates of its longer-run trend. 1\n\nPayroll job growth has averaged more than 200,000 jobs per month over the past two years. And while\nthere have been ups and downs in the monthly reports – as there always are – I think it is notable that\neven as output growth slowed during the fourth quarter of last year, firms continued to add workers to\ntheir payrolls at a very good pace. The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor\nTurnover Survey, or JOLTS, show that some dynamism is returning to the labor market. 2 The rate of job\nopenings is stronger than during the previous expansion, and both the hiring and quit rates have risen to\nlevels suggesting that firms are looking to hire and workers are confident enough to be looking for better\njobs.\n\nWage acceleration typically lags the improvement in labor markets, and this time is no different. Average\nhourly earnings have only slowly accelerated over the past few years, and the employment cost index,\n\n1\n\nSee Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William\nWascher, “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic\nActivity, Fall 2014, pp. 197-255.\n2\n\nNote that John Haltiwanger argues that there has been a longer-run decline in labor market fluidity. See John\nHaltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” paper written for\nthe Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth conference, August 2015.\n\n\f7\nwhich measures total compensation, has risen at about 2 percent a year over the past three years. Some of\nthe anecdotal reports suggest that wage pressures may be building. We have heard for some time from\nemployers in our region that it has been hard to find workers with the necessary skills in certain higherskilled occupations, including information technology, health care, and specialized construction. Firms\nhave had to increase wages and benefits and offer and sweeten retention packages for these types of\nworkers. But we are now hearing increasingly from firms across the service sector that they are having\ndifficulty finding workers in lower-skilled and less-specialized occupations, like bank tellers and retail\nstaff. As labor markets continue to tighten, I expect to see wages accelerate somewhat.\n\nI do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many workers have had during the recession and slow\nrecovery, and that many continue to have. For example, in my region, those who have lost jobs in the\nmining, oil, and gas sectors in Appalachia and eastern Ohio have been slow to find new work because the\neconomies in those areas are not well-diversified. I believe there are longer-run workforce development\nissues affecting U.S. labor markets, and the deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and\nexacerbated these problems. As a country, we need to ensure that people can enter and remain productive\nmembers of the labor force to raise our standard of living and make us more competitive in the global\neconomy. The question is how to do that. I do not believe monetary policy would be effective in\naddressing these longer-run problems. More than that, trying to rely on it to do so is counterproductive\nbecause it takes the focus off of programs and policies that can help to prepare and sustain workers in the\nmodern workforce. So from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, the totality of the evidence\nsuggests to me that the economy is basically at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum\nemployment. However, I do believe that government policy and programs, such as educational assistance\nand retraining programs, have a role to play in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and it\nshould be brought to bear.\n\n\f8\nInflation\nPrice stability is the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s goal\nof 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the price of\noil and other commodities since mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down\nthe prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S. But the most recent data have been somewhat\nencouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the FOMC. As oil prices and the dollar have\nshown some stability of late, the headline and underlying measures of inflation have moved higher. And\nthese moves are not just one month’s data. Headline and core inflation, as measured by the year-overyear changes in the underlying indices, have been moving up over the past year. Headline PCE inflation\nhas risen to 1 percent from 0.2 percent at the start of last year, and core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent,\ncompared to 1.3 percent a year ago. Core CPI inflation is now above 2 percent. The Cleveland Fed’s\nmedian CPI inflation rate is 2.4 percent and it, too, has been rising over the past year.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. In my view, inflation\nexpectations have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices. Marketbased inflation compensation, which measures the difference in yields between nominal Treasury\nsecurities and Treasury inflation-protected securities, has fallen by more than the survey measures of\ninflation expectations. But movements in inflation compensation have been highly correlated with\nchanges in oil prices, and in this period of heightened market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into\nU.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based\nmeasure of inflation compensation. Various models suggest that the movements in inflation\ncompensation more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes\n\n\f9\nin inflation expectations. 3\n\nBased on the evidence at hand, if the real side of the economy continues to perform consistent with my\nprojections, I expect inflation to remain low this year but to gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent\nover the next couple of years. And I will continue to monitor all of the measures of inflation and inflation\nexpectations to assess whether this forecast is on track.\n\nRisks to the Forecast\nOf course, we have to recognize that the economy rarely evolves exactly as expected. The world is a\ndynamic place and the economy is hit by shocks, both positive and negative. So any economic forecast is\nsurrounded by fairly wide confidence bands, and mine is no exception. I see risks on both the downside\nand the upside around my forecast. If the dollar were to appreciate more than I’ve assumed, perhaps\nbecause of weaker growth abroad, or if there were a significant further decline in oil prices rather than a\nstabilization, then growth and inflation could be lower than in my baseline forecast. The actions taken by\nseveral foreign central banks to increase monetary accommodation to further support their economies\nmay help to mitigate some of this risk.\n\n3\n\nThe Cleveland Fed publishes estimates of inflation expectations and the inflation risk premium based on a model\nthat incorporates survey measures of inflation expectations as well as market data on nominal Treasuries and\ninflation swaps. The 5-year/5-year-forward measure of inflation expectations has been relatively stable and near 2\npercent. The data are available at www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/inflationexpectations.aspx. For a discussion of this model, see Joseph Haubrich, George Pennacchi, and Peter Ritchken,\n“Inflation Expectations, Real Rates, and Risk Premia: Evidence from Inflation Swaps,” The Review of Financial\nStudies, 25, 2012, pp. 1588-1629. See also the Atlanta Fed’s macroblog discussion by Nikolay Gospodinov and\nPaula Tkac, “Are Long-Term Inflation Expectations Declining? Not So Fast, Says Atlanta Fed,” January 15, 2016.\nThe authors conclude that long-run inflation expectations remain stable and that the large correlation of marketbased inflation compensation and oil prices is due mainly to the liquidity premium on TIPS.

But it is also good to keep in mind that, according to\nanalysis by the Cleveland Fed staff, over the last 15 years historical forecast errors from several highly\nregarded inflation forecasting models have skewed to the upside; that is, the models have tended to\nunderestimate actual inflation. 4 While the steep declines in oil prices have kept inflation low, in the\ncurrent environment, low oil prices also pose an upside risk to inflation over the medium run. They may\nspur stronger-than-expected consumer spending, and this, combined with accommodative monetary\npolicy, could lead to a faster increase in inflation than forecasted.\n\nThe intense volatility in financial markets that we saw at the end of last year and the beginning of this\nyear has subsided. But were it to intensify and be sustained, this could lead to a broader pullback in risk\nappetites among investors, businesses, and consumers, which could dampen the U.S. economy. I note,\nthough, that even during the recent turbulence we did not see this. Focusing too much on signals from\nmarket volatility is also a risk, as messages from the market can turn around quickly. It could be that if\nmarkets remain relatively stable, businesses may begin to feel more secure and investment spending may\npick up more than expected. The resiliency of the U.S. economy throughout turbulent times is worth\nremembering as we aim to set monetary policy that will promote our longer-run goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\nGiven actual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward\nour policy goals, my assessment at this time is that it will be appropriate to continue to gradually reduce\n\n4\n\nModels whose forecast errors skew to the upside include the Faust and Wright inflation-expectations gap model\nand the Stock and Watson unobserved components model. See Jon Faust and Jonathan H. Wright, “Forecasting\nInflation,” in Handbook of Economic Forecasting, Graham Elliott and Allan Timmermann, eds., Amsterdam:\nElsevier Press, vol. 2A, 2013, pp. 2-56, and James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson, “Why Has U.S. Inflation Become\nHarder to Forecast?” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, supplement to vol. 39, no. 1, February 2007, pp. 3-33.\n\n\f11\nthe degree of accommodation this year. Gradual normalization means that monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against\ndownside risks. I think that’s appropriate given some of the forces still affecting our economy – for\nexample, slow growth abroad, appreciation of the dollar, somewhat more restrictive financial conditions,\nand the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, at our March meeting the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds\nrate at ¼ to ½ percent. I did not dissent from that decision. Even though I expect it will be appropriate to\ncontinue on the path of normalization this year, I recognized that the data we had on the first quarter were\nlimited. I agreed that a reasonable case could be made to wait until more information could be gathered\nand assessed to see if they confirm that the economy is evolving as anticipated – namely, resumption of\nthe moderate growth trajectory, with continued improvement in labor markets and inflation on track for a\ngradual return to 2 percent.\n\nI do not think the FOMC is behind the curve, but while there are risks to moving too soon, there are also\nrisks to waiting too long to take the next steps on the normalization path given the lags with which\nmonetary policy affects the economy. We live with uncertainty and one could always make the case that\nwe should wait to act until we gather more information. But waiting until every piece of data lines up in\nthe correct way means waiting too long and risks having to move rates up more aggressively in the future,\nwith negative impacts on our economy. Similarly, forestalling rate increases for too long in light of\nfinancial market volatility that doesn’t affect the outlook may simply produce more volatility in the future\nif we find ourselves having to increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to achieve our goals.\n\nOf course, the actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how\nthey affect the outlook. As we’ve seen over this expansion, things can take unexpected turns, and we\nwant policy to appropriately react to changes in the medium-run outlook. The policy path I foresee as\n\n\f12\nappropriate today is slightly more gradual than the path I foresaw in December, partly because of the\nslight downward revision to my growth forecast but mainly because I now estimate a lower longer-run\nequilibrium interest rate. But these are small changes. The important point is that the economy has\nshown considerable resiliency, and in my view, the outlook and risks around the outlook will likely\nsupport gradual reductions in the degree of accommodation this year.\n\nThe FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections\nAs indicated in the March Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, the other FOMC participants also\ncurrently anticipate that it will be appropriate for the funds rate to move up gradually over time, with the\nmedian path across participants now slightly shallower than in December. A lot of media commentary\nhas focused on this somewhat flatter policy path. To my mind, this change in the path is an excellent\nillustration of how our policy is data dependent. There were slight reductions in the participants’\neconomic projections between December and March, reflecting incoming economic information\nincluding weak fourth quarter U.S. growth, lower estimates of global growth, volatility in financial\nmarkets, and somewhat tighter financial conditions. Each participant took these developments into\naccount when revising his or her projections and the policy path the participant thought was appropriate to\nachieving those outcomes. Because there is uncertainty around each participant’s projections of growth,\nthe unemployment rate, and inflation, there is also uncertainty around the appropriate policy path. Thus,\nno one should read the median path in the SEP as a promised policy path. Policy is not on a pre-set\ncourse; the actual path of the fed funds rate will depend on the economic outlook and risks around the\noutlook. But the median policy path and changes in that path over time help to illuminate participants’\nreaction functions – how participants believe policy should systematically respond to changes in\neconomic conditions that affect the outlook.\n\nI believe the discipline of forecasting how the economy might evolve over the medium run and the\nuncertainty around the forecast is an essential part of the framework for setting monetary policy. It\n\n\f13\nprovides a useful methodology for avoiding too much focus on short-run changes in the economic data or\nvolatility in the markets. It allows us to do low-frequency policymaking in a high-frequency world. It\nforces us to consider how changes in the economic and financial data may or may not change the\nmedium-run outlook, the risks around the outlook, and the appropriate policy path. It is the construct\nthrough which our policymaking can be made systematic, yet responsive to the evolution of economic\nconditions. The outcome of this process – the projections of economic outcomes and the policy paths\nthought appropriate to achieve those outcomes – is summarized in our SEP four times a year, allowing the\npublic to better understand how the assessments of the economy and monetary policy are evolving. I\nview this as essential transparency, which is why I believe the SEP continues to be an important part of\nFOMC communications.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nSarasota, FL\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank David Kotok and his colleagues at the Global Interdependence Center for giving me the\nopportunity to speak with you this morning about economic developments and monetary policy. I am\nvery happy to be here – and not just because I left single-digit temperatures in Cleveland. No, it’s\nbecause at each GIC program I’ve attended over the years – and there have been many – I’ve always\nwalked away with some new insight or perspective with which to view the economy and policy. The\nGIC’s Central Banking Series is an important forum for discussing economic matters of global interest,\nand I am privileged to say that today’s talk is my second in the series. Last March, at the GIC’s program\nwith the Banque de France, I spoke about the journey from extraordinary monetary policy back to\nordinary monetary policy. Today, I will update you on the progress that’s been made on that journey and\nmy outlook for the economy and monetary policy. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own\nand not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions and Communications: Steps on the Normalization Path\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½\nof a percent. I supported this decision because I believe that policy, for the time being, is well-calibrated\nto the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook. The current target range had been set in\nDecember when the FOMC implemented its first change in the policy rate in 7 years and the first rate\nincrease in 9 ½ years. I supported that decision as well. December’s increase in the rate from essentially\nzero recognized the considerable progress the economy has made since the Great Recession, which\nofficially ended more than six years ago, as well as the FOMC’s outlook that the economy will improve\nfurther, supported by monetary policy that continues to be quite accommodative. The rate increase in\nDecember was a step on the path toward more normal policy, a journey that arguably began in October\n2014 when the FOMC ended its third large-scale asset purchase program, also known as quantitative\neasing, or QE3.\n\n\f2\nThe Committee has indicated that, in setting policy, it assesses both realized and expected progress\ntoward the FOMC’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The policy\ndecisions in December and January represented the outcomes of such an assessment, which encompasses\na wide range of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market\nindicators, as well as the information I and other FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in\nour regions. When the FOMC says its decisions are “data-dependent,” I view this as shorthand for this\nmore comprehensive process of parsing economic and financial information to evaluate current economic\nconditions, and then determining what that information implies about the medium-run economic outlook\nand the risks around that outlook. The medium run is the relevant time horizon for monetary policy\nbecause it takes time for monetary policy to have an effect throughout the economy.\n\nThe Evolution of Forward Guidance Toward Data Dependency\nI don’t view this “data-dependent” approach to policymaking as something new. Instead, I view it as a\nstep on the journey back from extraordinary to more ordinary monetary policymaking. You will recall\nthat one of the policy tools the FOMC used during the recession and early part of the recovery was\nexplicit forward guidance. That guidance changed over time. It began as qualitative guidance offered in\nDecember 2008 when the FOMC indicated that weak economic conditions were likely to warrant\nexceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for “some time.” This changed to calendar-date guidance in\nAugust 2011 when the FOMC said that it anticipated an exceptionally low fed funds rate at least through\nmid-2013. Guidance based on economic thresholds was offered in December 2012 when the Committee\nsaid that it anticipated that the 0-to-¼ percent target range for the fed funds rate would be appropriate at\nleast as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years\nahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored. A year later, in December\n2013, the FOMC blended state-contingent forward guidance with an element of calendar-date forward\nguidance, indicating the information it would consider in determining how long to maintain highly\naccommodative monetary policy as well as an assessment that it would likely be “well past the time that\n\n\f3\nthe unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below\nthe Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.”\n\nIn March 2014, the FOMC abandoned quantitative thresholds and moved toward the type of forward\nguidance we have today, which links the path of policy to the Committee’s assessment of both realized\nand expected progress toward its dual-mandate objectives. The guidance continued to provide a time\nelement by indicating it was likely that liftoff would not occur for “a considerable time after the asset\npurchase program ends.”\n\nAfter the purchase program ended, using it as a benchmark for guidance became less salient. In January\n2015, the FOMC replaced this benchmark and simply said it judged it could be patient in beginning to\nnormalize policy. In March, the FOMC fine-tuned this by stating the two criteria it would use to assess\nwhen it would be appropriate to make the first fed funds rate increase. These criteria were further\nimprovement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to its 2\npercent objective over the medium term. Since December’s liftoff, the Committee has continued to\nindicate that the path of policy will depend on progress toward our goals, and that while the actual path\npolicy takes will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data, the Committee’s current\nassessment is that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in\nthe federal funds rate.\n\nThis evolution in the FOMC’s forward rate guidance represents a return to more normal times. While\nexplicit forward guidance was used as a policy tool during the recession and early in the recovery, in\nmore normal times, away from the zero lower bound, I believe forward guidance should be viewed more\nas a communications device. But this step back from explicit guidance poses a challenge for the FOMC\nfor at least two reasons. First, market participants tend to like more explicit statements and less\nuncertainty. Yet, it’s appropriate for monetary policy to respond to economic developments, whether\nforeseen or not. Second, while before the Great Recession, the public had a pretty good sense of how\n\n\f4\nmonetary policy would respond to economic developments, there is likely less clarity about the Fed’s socalled reaction function now. After the great inflation of the 1970s, the FOMC became more predictable\nand systematic in how it reacted to changes in economic activity and inflation. 1 As a result, explicit\nforward guidance was rarely used. But the Great Recession required the Fed to behave in a way quite\ndistinct from its past behavior, and consequently, there is less understanding about how policymakers are\nlikely to react to incoming economic information than there was earlier.\n\nThus, in my view, an important goal of FOMC communications is to explain the rationale of our\ndecisions to the public so they will have a sense of how policy is likely to change, in response not only to\nexpected changes in economic conditions but also to unforeseen changes in conditions. I believe that the\nFOMC statements have been evolving along these lines, although there are likely further steps we could\ntake to provide more information about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance\nof policy to the economy’s actual and anticipated progress toward our dual-mandate goals. In addition to\nthe policy statement, I believe the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) can be helpful in\nilluminating the FOMC’s reaction function.\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections\nFOMC policymakers provide funds rate projections in the SEP that represent their views of appropriate\npolicy – the renowned dot plot – as well as projections of economic growth, the unemployment rate, and\ninflation that are conditional on their policy path. It’s important to note that the policy paths in the SEP\nare not policy forecasts, unlike interest rate projections in private-sector forecasts. Nonetheless, because\nthere is uncertainty around the outlook, there is also uncertainty around the FOMC’s policy path. If the\neconomy’s evolution turns out to be different from what we currently anticipate, our policy path may well\nhave to deviate from our current expectation. The policy paths in the SEP should be expected to change\n\n1\n\nFor a discussion, see John B. Taylor, “Monetary Policy During the Past 30 Years with Lessons for the Next 30\nYears,” luncheon address at the Cato Institute’s 30th Annual Monetary Conference on Money, Markets and\nGovernment: The Next 30 Years, Washington, D.C., November 15, 2012.\n\n\f5\nover time as the outlook changes. I don’t view this as problematic – we want policy to respond\nappropriately to changes in the outlook. Thus, the actual path normalization takes could very well turn\nout to be either less gradual or more gradual than what we anticipate it to be today.\n\nThe last SEP projections were released in December; the next set of projections will be released at our\nMarch FOMC meeting. The evolution of the dot plot in the SEP over meetings to come will provide the\npublic with information on how participants think monetary policy should appropriately respond to\nchanges in the outlook that reflect economic developments. I think the SEP will be particularly helpful in\nMarch given the global economic and financial developments we’ve seen since our last set of projections.\n\nThe FOMC’s policy statement in January made it clear that the Committee is closely monitoring these\ndevelopments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of\nrisks to the outlook. I certainly will use the time between now and the March meeting to continue to\ngather information from contacts in the Fourth Federal Reserve District about economic developments\naffecting businesses, customers, and households; to look at the details of the official economic statistical\nreleases and financial market indicators; and to consider the results from the economic models and\nforecasts developed by the Cleveland Fed’s staff as well as those of other economists. I will walk into\nthe March FOMC meeting with my own assessment of the medium-run outlook for the U.S. economy and\nrisks around the outlook, but I will want to hear the views of others around the table who may or may not\nshare my views based on their own analysis. By design, the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a\nmosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. This regional information,\nalong with national data and analysis, plays an important role in setting national monetary policy. The\neconomic developments we’ve seen since the beginning of the year will be part of the discussion, so let’s\nturn to those now.\n\n\f6\nThe Economy\nAccording to the first estimate, real GDP growth slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of last year, to\nan annualized growth rate of only 0.7 percent, down from an average pace of about 3 percent in the\nsecond and third quarters. A decline in net exports and a reduced pace of inventory investment were the\nmain drags on growth last quarter, but nonresidential investment also declined. In contrast, consumer\nspending and residential investment held up well. So, one question is whether the softness seen last\nquarter will persist. Another question is whether the recent financial market volatility and decline in oil\nprices are signaling a material change in the medium-run outlook.\n\nMarket Volatility\nThe declines in global equity markets since the beginning of the year partly reflect market participants’\nreassessment of the outlook for growth in China and their views on whether policy actions undertaken by\nChinese policymakers will be effective in fostering growth there. China is undergoing a longer-run\nstructural transition from an economy driven by trade to one more dependent on domestic consumption\ngrowth, and these kinds of structural changes can be challenging and long lasting. Over the past couple of\ndecades, we have seen some of those challenges play out on a much smaller scale at the regional level in\nthe U.S. as industrial states have transitioned from manufacturing-based economies to more diversified\neconomies.\n\nAs it relates to U.S. growth, the direct trade ties between the U.S. economy and China are not very strong:\nExports to China represent 7 to 8 percent of total U.S. exports and total U.S. exports are about 12 to 13\npercent of U.S. GDP. So the direct effect of trade with China on U.S. output is small. Of course, some\nU.S. industries and regions of the country are more exposed to international developments via trade than\nothers, and because many emerging economies are considerably more dependent on trade with China, the\nimplications of developments in China for the global economy need to be considered.\n\n\f7\nIn addition to the decline in stock prices, we have seen another sharp decline in oil prices since the\nbeginning of the year. In part, this reflects the same reassessment of global growth prospects affecting the\nstock market. But supply-side factors are also very important. Worldwide oil inventories remain high\nand oil production has not been as responsive as one might have thought, given the declines in oil prices\nseen over the past 18 months. This means that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than\npreviously anticipated, as it is taking longer for supply to rebalance with demand.\n\nAt this point, I see the market volatility and sharp drop in oil prices as posing risks to the forecast, but I\nbelieve it is premature to conclude they necessitate a material change in my modal economic outlook.\nWhile there is a possibility that a steeper, more persistent drop in equity markets could lead to a broader\nand more persistent pullback in risk-taking and credit extension, with spillovers to the broader economy,\nso far we have not seen this. Solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, and healthy\ngrowth in real disposable income suggest that underlying U.S. economic fundamentals remain sound. I\ncontinue to monitor developments, but until I see further evidence to the contrary, my current expectation\nis that the U.S. economy will work through this episode of market turbulence and the soft patch of\neconomic data to regain its footing for moderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors\nremain challenged.\n\nConsumer Spending, Housing, and Credit\nConsistent with this view, January’s advance retail sales report suggests that consumer spending, which\nmakes up about two-thirds of output, started the year on a strong note, rebounding from a somewhat\nsofter reading in December. Sales gains were broad-based, including those of motor vehicles, which have\nbeen particularly strong over the past year. The relative strength in the consumer sector shouldn’t be too\nmuch of a surprise because it is based on sound economic fundamentals. Consumer spending has been\nbuoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in personal income, which\nreflects the progress in labor markets, and lower oil prices.\n\n\f8\nAmidst highly volatile markets, stock prices were little changed, on net, in 2015, and are down since the\nstart of this year. But the cumulative increase in stock prices since the financial crisis ended is still\nsignificant. Similarly, house prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace over the past couple of years,\nallowing households to rebuild their housing equity. Housing has been slowly recovering for some time.\nHousing starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer\nrun. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than\nthey can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. These factors are supportive of\nhousing continuing to make a positive contribution to growth and of households continuing to build their\nhousing equity.\n\nIn the aggregate, households lost $13 trillion in net worth during the Great Recession, but the\ndeleveraging that households undertook, coupled with the cumulative increase in stock and house prices\nover the expansion, means that households have recovered that loss and have added an additional nearly\n$18 trillion in net worth to their balance sheets.\n\nBank balance sheets have also improved considerably, and lending, which supports economic growth, is\nrising. The proportion of loans that are nonperforming, delinquency rates, and default rates have all been\ndeclining and, outside of the real estate portfolio, are back to pre-crisis levels. At the same time, capital\nratios and loan-loss reserves are rising, so that banks generally are in a considerably better position to\nhandle future losses should they arise. Although risk premia have increased, especially on higher-yield\nbonds, credit for higher-quality borrowers remains available to support growth.\n\nThe fact that consumer lending is rising is an indication that, in general, consumers are feeling pretty\npositive about their earnings prospects. This is a very reasonable view, reflecting the cumulative progress\nthat has been made in the labor market.\n\n\f9\nLabor Markets\nIt is good to remember how far we have come. Over the past six years, the unemployment rate has been\nmore than halved, falling from a high of 10 percent in October 2009 to 4.9 percent in January. Other\nmeasures of underutilization of labor have also improved significantly over the past few years, although\nthey are not quite back to pre-recession levels. These measures include the long-term unemployment rate,\nas well as the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and part-time workers who would\nrather work full-time. Nonfarm payrolls are now more than 4 ¾ million above their previous peak before\nthe Great Recession. Last year, the economy added about 2 ¾ million jobs, an average pace of nearly\n230,000 per month. Solid labor market performance continued into this year. Firms added 151,000 jobs\nin January. While this was somewhat fewer than the average monthly increase last year, it is\nconsiderably more than the 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month that economists currently estimate would be\nenough to keep the unemployment rate constant. I continue to expect that growth this year will be\nsufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets. I wouldn’t be surprised if the pace of\njob gains slowed somewhat, based on demographics and the stage of the business cycle, but the gains\nshould be strong enough to put additional downward pressure on the unemployment rate and support\nbroader acceleration in wages.\n\nI do not want to underplay the significant longer-run challenges the country faces in the labor market.\nUnemployment rates among minorities have been chronically higher than those for whites. The structural\ntransition of our economy from one based on traditional manufacturing to one encompassing high-tech\nmanufacturing and services has also created demand for different skill sets, thereby requiring workers to\nincrease their human capital. 2 The difference in wages between those with a college degree and those\nwithout, the so-called skill premium, has widened substantially over time, more than doubling since the\n\n2\n\nFor further discussion, see Loretta J. Mester, “Community Development and Human Capital,” remarks at the 2015\nPolicy Summit on Housing, Human Capital, and Inequality, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland,\nPhiladelphia, and Richmond, Pittsburgh, PA, June 19, 2015.\n\n\f10\n1970s. 3 This skill premium is inducing people to increase their skills, often taking on student debt to do\nso. Enrollments in college are near historic highs, but non-completion rates are also quite high. 4 So\nwhile the proportion of 25-year-olds with college degrees has moved up from 25 to 30 percent over the\npast 15 years, by this metric, the U.S. is now ranked only 12th among developed nations. 5\n\nThese developments pose difficult challenges. As a country, we need to ensure that people can enter and\nremain productive members of the modern labor force, to raise our standards of living and to make us\nmore competitive in the global economy. The question is how to do that. I do not believe monetary\npolicy would be effective in addressing these longer-run problems and leaning on it to try to do so can be\ncounterproductive. It takes the focus off of programs and policies that are better suited to addressing\nthese issues. From the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, in my view the totality of evidence\nsuggests that the economy is at or very nearly at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum\nemployment. However, I do believe there is a role for government policy and that it should be brought to\nbear on these challenges. There is evidence of positive externalities from education. Less-educated\nworkers appear to benefit in the form of higher wages from working in areas populated with moreeducated workers. 6 And cities with more highly educated populations experience lower unemployment\nrates, higher productivity growth, and higher growth in entrepreneurship than what would have been\n3\n\nMedian hourly wages for those with a bachelor’s degree are now about 80 percent higher than wages for high\nschool graduates. (See Jonathan James, “The College Wage Premium,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nEconomic Commentary, August 2012.) Over a lifetime, in present value terms, a college graduate can expect to earn\nnearly twice as much as a high school graduate. (See Kartik Athreya and Janice Eberly, “The College Premium,\nCollege Noncompletion, and Human Capital Investment,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Working Paper 1302R, February 2015.)\n4\n\nAccording to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, only about 55 percent of students who start\ncollege earn bachelor’s degrees within five years. (See Digest of Education Statistics, table 302.60 for enrollment\nrates (http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_302.60.asp) and table 326.10 for completion rates\n(http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_326.10.asp).)\n5\n\nSee p. 57 of Robert J. Gordon, “Secular Stagnation: A Supply-Side View,” American Economic Review: Papers\nand Proceedings 5, May 2015, pp. 54-59.\n\n6\n\nEnrico Moretti estimated spillovers from college education by comparing wages for similar individuals who work\nin cities that differ by the proportion of college graduates in their labor force, being careful to consider unobserved\ndifferences in the individuals and the cities. He found that each percentage point increase in the share of college\ngraduates between 1980-1990 was associated with 1.6 percent higher wages of high school graduates and 0.4\npercent higher wages of college graduates. See Moretti, “Estimating the Social Return to Higher Education:\nEvidence from Longitudinal and Repeated Cross-Sectional Data,” Journal of Econometrics 121, 2004, pp. 175-212.\n\n\f11\npredicted by considering only the educational levels of individuals. 7 The positive externalities suggest we\nare under-investing in education from society’s viewpoint and that appropriately constructed government\npolicies and programs can be a valuable investment for the country to undertake.\n\nOil Prices\nIn addition to improved balance sheets and earning prospects, lower oil prices are a third factor that will\ncontinue to support consumer spending in the U.S., even as it continues to weigh heavily on the U.S.\nenergy and manufacturing sectors. The drop in gasoline prices from $3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42\nper gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.98 per gallon this year, which would mean\nanother $300 in cost savings for the average household. Households may be choosing to spend some of\nthis gain – we’ve seen this already in high sales of SUVs and other larger vehicles – or they may be\nchoosing to save some of this gain – we’ve seen the savings rate rise – and these savings will help support\nfuture consumption.\n\nOf course, there is a downside to the lower energy prices, too, for both growth and inflation. The drop in\noil and other commodity prices has weighed heavily on firms in the drilling and mining sector, and on\ntheir suppliers, and these firms have responded by cutting jobs and reducing investment. Some firms may\nface bankruptcy or will need to merge. I expect firms in these sectors to face continued pressure.\nManufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging\nenvironment. The dollar has appreciated more than 20 percent since mid-2014, reflecting the expectation\nthat real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as projected interest\nrate differentials between the U.S. and foreign economies. A stronger dollar means better terms of trade\nfor U.S. consumers and businesses, which is a positive for a growing economy in the longer run. But in\n7\n\nSee Edward L. Glaeser, Giacomo A.M. Ponzetto, and Kristina Tobio, “Cities, Skills, and Regional Change,”\nRegional Studies 48, 2014, pp. 7-43, and the discussion in Lisa Nelson and Francisca Richter, “The Prospects of\nNon-College Bound Workers in the Fourth District,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland A Look Behind the\nNumbers, February 2014.\n\n\f12\nthe near term, this appreciation has been a considerable drag on U.S. export growth. Should economic\ngrowth in our trading partners weaken, this would put further strains on U.S. exports. I expect that net\nexports will be a negative influence on real GDP growth for some time to come.\n\nInflation\nThe latest round of oil price declines means headline inflation will remain lower for longer than I\npreviously thought. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s 2 percent goal for quite some time.\nHeadline inflation, measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, was 0.6 percent in December, and core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices,\nwhich tend to be volatile, was 1.4 percent. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of declines in oil\nprices and other commodity prices since mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has\nheld down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S.\n\nWhile headline inflation is likely to remain low in the near term, I still think a reasonable forecast is that\ninflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the medium run. I can point to a couple of things to\nsupport this view. First, measures of underlying inflation, like the core, the trimmed mean, and the\nCleveland Fed’s median CPI, are higher than headline inflation. They have remained relatively stable\ndespite the continuing sharp drop in the prices of oil and other commodities and the appreciation of the\ndollar we’ve seen over the past 18 months.\n\nIn my view, longer-run inflation expectations, an important factor in the inflation forecast, have also been\nrelatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices, which, according to analysis by the\nCleveland Fed staff, account for much of the movement in longer-run inflation expectations. 8 I take less\nof a signal from the downward moves in market-based measures of inflation compensation, because\n\n8\n\nSee Randal J. Verbrugge and Amy Higgins, “Do Energy Prices Drive the Long-Term Inflation Expectations of\nHouseholds?” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Trends, March 24, 2015.\n\n\f13\nestimates suggest that these more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather\nthan changes in inflation expectations.\n\nOil prices cannot continue to decline indefinitely, nor can the dollar continue to appreciate forever. At\nsome point, both will regain some stability and the effect of previous changes on inflation will dissipate.\nIn fact, we saw those dynamics play out toward the end of last year when oil prices and the value of the\ndollar had begun to stabilize, and the underlying inflation measures began to firm. When oil prices and\nthe dollar both regain some stability, and with inflation expectations remaining stable and economic\ngrowth continuing, it is reasonable to expect that inflation will move back slowly to 2 percent; it just\nmight take a bit longer now, given the most recent decline in oil prices.\n\nMonetary Policy\nOf course, going forward, it will be important to continue to monitor inflation developments, in particular\ninflation expectations, as well as economic developments both here and abroad. We want to set the path\nof policy based on an outlook informed by economic developments, a path that will best achieve our\nlonger-run objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Given my outlook that the economy\nwill work through this rough patch and resume a trajectory of moderate growth, with continued\nimprovement in labor markets and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent, I believe the appropriate\npolicy path will involve gradual reductions over time in the extraordinary level of accommodation that\nwas necessary to address the Great Recession. Even as policy gradually normalizes, it will likely need to\nremain accommodative for some time to come, given some of the forces still impacting our economy –\nfor example, slow growth abroad, dollar appreciation, more restrictive financial conditions, and the\ncontinued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nThe actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how they affect\nthe outlook. As we’ve seen, things can take unexpected turns. Our economic forecasting models are, by\nnecessity, simplifications. The economy is dynamic and can be hit by various shocks that might lead to\n\n\f14\nchanges in the medium-run outlook for employment and inflation to which policy would want to respond\nin a systematic fashion in order to promote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIt is good to remember that confidence bands around economic forecasts tend to be wide. I wish we were\nable to forecast with more precision – economists are working on it – but unfortunately the state of the\nscience, or perhaps I should say the state of the art, isn’t there yet. For example, averaging across several\nmodels, the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or\nminus 1 percentage point; the confidence band around a forecast of short-term interest rates one year out\nis of similar magnitude. When the FOMC releases its projections, some observers tend to focus on the\ndispersion across FOMC participants. But this dispersion is actually pretty modest compared to the\nuncertainty around the projections.\n\nBut just because we cannot forecast the future with as much precision as we’d like does not mean the\nexercise is without value. The discipline of forecasting how the economy might evolve over the medium\nrun and assessing the uncertainty around the forecast is an essential part of the framework for setting\nmonetary policy. It provides a useful methodology to help policymakers avoid focusing too much on\nshort-run changes in the economic data or volatility in the markets. It forces one to consider how those\nchanges in the economic and financial data may or may not change the medium-run outlook, the risks\naround the outlook, and the appropriate policy path. It is the construct through which our policymaking\ncan be made systematic, yet responsive to changes in economic conditions. The outcome of this process\nis communicated in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is why I view the SEP as an\nimportant part of FOMC communications, one that will continue to serve us well as we continue on the\njourney toward more normal monetary policy.\n\n\f"

            "content": "A Monetary Policymaker’s Lexicon\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMarket News International\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 4, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nThank you for the invitation to present some remarks and to participate in what I am sure will be an\ninteresting question and answer session to follow. I say “interesting” because over the 18 months in\nwhich I’ve served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, I find that whenever I present\nremarks, I learn a lot from the questions posed by the audience – most likely, more than they learn from\nme. I view the exchange of ideas with the public as one of a Fed president’s duties, but it has also turned\nout to be one of its pleasures.\n\nAnother pleasure of mine is serving on the Federal Open Market Committee’s Subcommittee on\nCommunications. The Federal Reserve has worked over many years to improve its communications with\nthe public and to increase transparency. This work is gratifying but it is also challenging. One of the\nchallenges is trying to explain policy decisions and the rationale behind those decisions, which can be\nquite complex. In a world in which every word of the FOMC is scrutinized, those of us on the\nCommittee try to be very careful with our language. But at times, this can make us seem somewhat\ninscrutable. So today I would like to give you my own interpretation of four expressions that have\nbecome part of the lexicon of monetary policymakers. These phrases are: data dependent, gradual\nnormalization, well underway, and symmetric inflation goal. Before proceeding, let me emphasize that\nthis is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the lingo monetary policymakers use; if I tried to do that,\nwe would be here all night and never get to the Q&A portion of the program. Let me also emphasize that\nthese are my views and interpretations, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the FOMC.\n\n“Data Dependent”\nThe FOMC has described its monetary policy decisions as being “data dependent.” At its January\nmeeting held last week, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at one\nquarter to one half of a percent. This target was set in December when the FOMC implemented its first\nchange in the policy rate in 7 years and the first rate increase in 9-1/2 years. December’s increase in the\n\n\f2\nrate from essentially zero recognized the considerable progress the economy has made since the Great\nRecession, which officially ended more than six years ago, and the FOMC’s outlook that the economy\nwill improve further, supported by monetary policy that continues to be quite accommodative.\n\nThe Committee has indicated that, in setting policy, it assesses both realized and expected progress\ntoward the FOMC’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The decision to\nmaintain the target range in January, just as the decision to raise it in December, represents the outcome\nof such an assessment. This assessment encompasses a wide range of economic information – the official\neconomic statistical releases and financial market indicators, as well as the information I and other FOMC\nparticipants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions. When the FOMC says its decisions are\n“data-dependent,” I view this as shorthand for this more comprehensive process of parsing economic and\nfinancial information to evaluate current economic conditions, and then assessing what that information\nimplies about the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nI supported the decision of no change in the fed funds rate target in January because I believe that policy,\nfor the time being, is well-calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nIt is important to note that “data dependent” policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every\nshort-run change in the data. For example, volatility in financial markets or a change in a short-run data\nreport is not a rationale for making a monetary policy decision. Instead, an assessment has to be made of\nwhat the incoming data and financial market developments are telling us about underlying economic\nconditions and the medium-run outlook. The relevant time horizon for monetary policy is the medium\nrun because it takes time for monetary policy to have an effect throughout the economy.\n\nA case in point is the economic and financial developments we’ve seen since the beginning of the year.\nAccording to the first estimate, real GDP growth slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of last year, to\nan annualized growth rate of only 0.7 percent, down from an average pace of about 3 percent in the\n\n\f3\nsecond and third quarters. A decline in net exports and a reduced pace of inventory investment were the\nmain drags on growth last quarter, but nonresidential investment also declined. In contrast, consumer\nspending and residential investment held up well. So, the question is: how long will the softness seen last\nquarter persist?\n\nWe also have to evaluate what the recent market volatility might imply about medium-run growth. The\ndeclines in global equity markets since the beginning of the year partly reflect market participants’\nreassessment of the outlook for growth in China and their views on how effective policy actions\nundertaken by Chinese policymakers will be in fostering growth there. China is undergoing a longer-run\nstructural transition from an economy driven by trade to one more dependent on domestic consumption\ngrowth, and these kinds of structural changes can be challenging and long lasting. Over the past couple of\ndecades, we have seen some of those challenges play out on a much smaller scale at the regional level in\nthe U.S. as industrial states have transitioned from manufacturing-based economies to more diversified\ngoods- and services-based economies.\n\nAs it relates to U.S. growth, the direct trade ties between the U.S. economy and China are not very strong:\nexports to China represent 7 to 8 percent of total U.S. exports and total U.S. exports are about 12 to 13\npercent of U.S. GDP. So the direct effect of trade with China on U.S. output is small. Of course, some\nU.S. industries are more exposed to international developments via trade and changes in the value of the\ndollar than others, and because many emerging economies are considerably more dependent on trade with\nChina, the implications of developments in China for the global economy need to be considered.\n\nIn addition to the decline in stock prices, we have seen another sharp decline in oil prices since the\nbeginning of the year. In part, this reflects the same reassessment of global growth prospects affecting the\nstock market. But supply-side factors are also very important. Worldwide oil inventories remain high\nand oil production has not been as responsive as one might have thought given the declines in oil prices\n\n\f4\nseen over the past 18 months. This means that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than\npreviously anticipated, as it is taking longer for supply to rebalance with demand.\n\nHow should a data-dependent policymaker incorporate these recent developments into the medium-run\noutlook? At this point, I view them as posing some risk to the outlook, but I believe it is premature to\nmaterially change my modal outlook. The drop in oil prices means that the U.S. energy and\nmanufacturing sectors will continue to experience considerable pressure. However, lower energy prices\nwill provide an offsetting benefit for U.S. households and for those in other oil-importing countries.\nHouseholds may choose to spend some of this gain – we’ve seen this already in high sales of SUVs and\nother larger vehicles – or they may choose to save some of this gain – we’ve seen the savings rate rise –\nand these savings will help support future consumption. While there is a possibility that a steeper, more\npersistent drop in equity markets could lead to a broader and more persistent pullback in risk-taking,\nwhich would negatively affect the outlook, so far we have not seen this.\n\nI continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the\noutlook and risks to the outlook. At this point, solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll\ngrowth, and healthy growth in real disposable income, suggest that underlying U.S. economic\nfundamentals remain sound. Until we see further evidence to the contrary, my expectation is that the U.S\neconomy will work through the latest episode of market turbulence and soft patch to regain its footing for\nmoderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors remain challenged. I continue to expect\nthat growth this year will be sufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets. I wouldn’t\nbe surprised if the pace of job gains slowed somewhat, but the gains should be strong enough to put\nadditional downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nThe latest round of oil price declines means headline inflation will remain lower for longer than I\npreviously thought. But I still think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will gradually return to 2\npercent over the medium run. I can point to a couple of things to support this view. First, measures of\n\n\f5\nunderlying inflation, like the core, the trimmed mean, and the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, are higher\nthan headline inflation. They have remained relatively stable despite the continuing sharp drop in oil\nprices we’ve seen over the past 18 months and the appreciation of the dollar, which puts downward\npressure on the price of U.S. imports. In my view, longer-run inflation expectations, an important factor\nin the inflation forecast, have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices.\nI take less of a signal from the downward moves in market-based measures of inflation compensation,\nbecause estimates suggest that these moves more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation\nrisk premia rather than changes in inflation expectations.\n\nOil prices cannot continue to decline indefinitely, nor can the dollar continue to appreciate forever. At\nsome point, both will regain some stability and the effect of previous changes on inflation will dissipate.\nAs that happens, with inflation expectations remaining stable and economic growth continuing, it is\nreasonable to expect that inflation will move back slowly to 2 percent; it just might take a bit longer now\ngiven the most recent decline in oil prices.\n\nOf course, going forward, it will be important to monitor inflation developments, in particular inflation\nexpectations, as well as economic developments both here and abroad. As we’ve seen, things can take\nunexpected turns. We want to set the path of policy based on an outlook informed by economic\ndevelopments, a path that will best achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nWhile the actual path the fed funds rate follows will depend on the economic outlook, and thus, will be\ndata dependent, my current view is that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant rates\nmoving up gradually over time to more normal levels. And this brings me to the second term in the\nmonetary policymakers’ lexicon: gradual normalization.\n\n“Gradual Normalization”\nI expect monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time to come. But given my outlook of\nmoderate growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent,\n\n\f6\nI believe the appropriate policy path will involve gradual reductions in the extraordinary level of\naccommodation that was necessary to address the Great Recession and its aftermath.\n\nThe FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, which includes a dot plot of each FOMC\nparticipant’s fed funds rate projection, gives a good sense of the meaning of “gradual normalization.” In\nMarch, we will have a new set of FOMC projections. The December projections showed that the\nmajority of FOMC participants believe it will be appropriate for the level of the fed funds rate to move up\nover time, but at a pace that means over the next couple of years the funds rate will be below the level\nmost participants expect to prevail over the longer run. According to the December projections, across\nparticipants, this longer-run level ranges from 3 to 4 percent, with a median projection of 3.5 percent. So\none meaning of gradual is that the level of the policy rate is expected to be relatively low for some time.\n\nAnother way to see that this pace is gradual is to compare it to past tightening cycles, when economic\nconditions and the outlook differed from those today. The median path in the December SEP is about\nhalf the pace of tightening the Committee undertook in the 2004-2006 period, the period of “measured\npace” increases. It is even more gradual when compared to the 1994 tightening cycle when the fed funds\nrate target rose by 300 basis points over 13 months.\n\nA third way to view this as gradual is to compare it to prescriptions from some simple monetary policy\nrules. As I’ve said elsewhere, 1 I believe in a systematic approach to monetary policy, but I don’t believe\nwe are at the state of knowledge where we can choose a single policy rule to set policy because no rule\nworks well enough across a variety of economic models and in a variety of economic circumstances.\nStill, I find it useful to look at the outcomes of a variety of such rules as a gauge. The median policy path\nin the December SEP is more gradual than the policy path that would be prescribed by many, although\n\n1\n\nLoretta J. Mester, “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech before the Forecasters Club of New\nYork, April 16, 2015,\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom%20and%20events/speeches/sp%2020150416%20the%20economic%20out\nlook%20and%20monetary%20policy.\n\n\f7\nnot all, simple policy rules. For example, suppose the economy evolved in the way described by the\nmedian economic projections from the December SEP. Then the simple Taylor 1993 rule would project\nthe fed funds rate rising by over 3 percentage points by the end of 2017, while the median appropriate\npolicy path in the December SEP is considerably more gradual, with the funds rate rising by about 2\npercentage points by the end of 2017. 2 In other words, according to FOMC participants, in order to\nachieve the median economic projections in the SEP, a more gradual path than the one described by a\nsimple Taylor rule will be appropriate.\n\nThus, it is anticipated that even as policy gradually normalizes, it will likely need to remain\naccommodative for some time to come given some of the forces still impacting our economy – for\nexample, slow growth abroad, dollar appreciation, more restrictive financial conditions, and the continued\nrebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nWe use the word “normalization,” but in the aftermath of the Great Recession, there is some uncertainty\nabout what the “normal” level of interest rates is. If productivity growth remains low and the potential\ngrowth rate of the economy over the longer run has moved lower, as many economists estimate it has,\nthen the longer-run level of the fed funds rate consistent with price stability and maximum employment –\nthe so-called neutral rate – would also be lower than it was in earlier periods. But estimates of long-run\ngrowth are imprecise and subject to revision, so this means there is considerable uncertainty around this\nneutral fed funds rate as well. A gradual approach to normalization will not only allow us to be\nresponsive to economic developments but also allow us to recalibrate policy over time as some of the\n2\n\nThe median policy path in the December SEP has the funds rate rising to 1.4 percent by the end of this year, 2.4\npercent by the end of 2017, and 3.3 percent by the end of 2018. The simple Taylor 1993 rule is Rt = r* + πt + 0.5(πt\n– π*) + 0.5 [(yt – y*)/y*], where Rt is the nominal federal funds rate at time t, r* is the longer-run real interest rate, πt\nis inflation at time t, π* is the inflation target, yt is the output level at time t, and y* is the level of potential output.\nSince the output gap is not contained in the FOMC projections, I translate the output gap, (yt – y*)/y*, into an\nunemployment gap, Ut – U*, where Ut is the unemployment rate and U* is the longer-run unemployment rate, and\n(yt – y*)/y* = −2.3×(Ut – U*), based on the estimated historical relationship between the output gap and the\nunemployment gap. In this Taylor rule exercise, if we ignore the fact that the economic outcomes projected in the\nSEP are conditioned on each participant’s appropriate policy path and use the median economic outcomes as inputs\ninto the Taylor rule, then the simple Taylor 1993 rule would project the fed funds rate rising to 3.1 percent by the\nend of this year, to 3.6 percent by the end of 2017, and to 3.7 percent by the end of 2018.\n\n\f8\nuncertainties surrounding the longer-term level of interest rates, the economy’s potential growth rate, and\nthe longer-run unemployment rate are resolved.\n\nWhile I’ve been using the median fed funds projection in the December SEP as a benchmark, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that these projections are not a commitment because in order to best achieve\nour goals of maximum employment and price stability, policy should be expected to react in a systematic\nfashion to material changes in the outlook. Our economic forecasting models are, by necessity,\nsimplifications. The economy is dynamic and can be hit by various shocks that might lead to changes in\nthe medium-run outlook for employment and inflation to which policy would want to respond.\nConfidence bands around economic forecasts tend to be wide. For example, averaging across several\nmodels, the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or\nminus 1 percentage point; the confidence band around a forecast of short-term interest rates one year out\nis of similar magnitude.\n\nUnlike private-sector forecasters, FOMC policymakers provide funds rate projections in the SEP that\nrepresent their views of appropriate policy rather than a policy forecast. But because there is uncertainty\naround the outlook, there is also uncertainty around the FOMC’s policy path. If the economy’s evolution\nturns out to be different from what we currently anticipate, our policy path may well have to deviate from\nwhat our current expectation is. The policy paths in the SEP will change over time as the outlook\nchanges. I don’t view this as problematic – we want policy to respond appropriately to changes in the\noutlook. Thus, the actual path normalization takes could very well turn out to be either less or more\ngradual than what we anticipate it to be today. The evolution of the FOMC’s dot plot in the SEP over\nmeetings to come will provide the public with information on how participants think monetary policy\nshould appropriately respond to changes in the outlook. As I mentioned, our next SEP will be released in\nMarch.\n\n\f9\n“Well Underway”\nAnother aspect of current monetary policy involves the Fed’s balance-sheet strategy. The Fed took some\nextraordinary policy actions in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Some of those\nactions involved purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities to\nexert downward pressure on long-term interest rates. As a result of those purchases, banks and other\ndepository institutions now hold at the Fed over $2 trillion in reserves in excess of regulatory\nrequirements, and the Fed holds about $4.5 trillion in assets on its balance sheet, nearly five times as\nmuch as before the financial crisis. Currently, the Fed is maintaining the size of its balance sheet by\nreinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities\ninto agency mortgage-backed securities and by rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The\nFOMC has said it anticipates doing this until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well\nunderway. One might reasonably ask what “well underway” means. The FOMC hasn’t given a precise\ndefinition.\n\nIn my view, “well underway” refers to the state of the economy and not a particular length of time after\nthe initial rate increase. This is consistent with the FOMC’s policy normalization principles, which\nindicate that the decision about when to cease or begin phasing out reinvestments will depend on how\neconomic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve. 3 As demonstrated in December, the\nFed has the tools to raise the fed funds rate to the target range even though the balance sheet is very large.\nSo from a policy implementation perspective, there isn’t a compelling reason to end reinvestments\nquickly. But consistent with the normalization principles, I would like the balance sheet to eventually\nreturn to a more normal size and composition; the first step in that process is ending reinvestments. We\ndon’t know precisely how the economy will evolve; this argues against deciding to end reinvestments\nafter some particular period of time has elapsed. Instead, because some policy accommodation is\nprovided via the balance sheet, it would seem better to base the decision about reinvestments on economic\n\n3\n\nSee “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” September 17, 2014,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\n\n\f10\nconditions and the outlook, just as we do with the funds rate path. Indeed, the economic conditions and\noutlook that would support reducing the degree of monetary accommodation by gradually raising the fed\nfunds rate would also tend to support slowly reducing the size of the balance sheet, which would result\nwhen reinvestments end. Thus, in my view, the level of the fed funds rate might be used as a guide to\nwhen to end reinvestments – in this case, both our fed funds rate path and our balance-sheet policy would\nbe data dependent. I would be comfortable ending reinvestments after we have a few more funds rate\nincreases under our belt, perhaps when the funds rate has reached 1 percent or so. This is my\ninterpretation of “well underway,” but as Chair Yellen indicated in her December press briefing, the\nFOMC has not given further guidance on this. 4\n\nThe final phrase in the monetary policymakers’ lexicon I’d like to discuss is the FOMC’s “symmetric\ninflation goal.”\n\n“Symmetric Inflation Goal”\nThe FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy serves to clarify the FOMC’s\nframework for making monetary policy decisions. 5 I view the statement as a very important part of the\nCommittee’s communications arsenal. This statement makes explicit the FOMC’s numerical goal for\ninflation over the longer run. This goal is 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change\nin the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. Since first being issued in\nJanuary 2012, the statement has been reaffirmed at the Committee’s annual organizational meetings each\nJanuary.\n\n4\n\nSee “Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference,” December 16, 2015,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/fomcpresconf20151216.pdf. Also see the discussion of\nreinvestments in the minutes of the September 2015 FOMC meeting,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150917.pdf.\n5\n\nSee “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012,\namended effective January 26, 2016,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_20160126.pdf.\n\n\f11\nGiven that it lays out the FOMC’s decision-making framework, I view the statement on long-run goals as\nsomewhat constitutional in nature, but periodically, the FOMC and its Subcommittee on Communications\nappropriately consider whether there are any changes that might be beneficial in clarifying the\nframework.\n\nOne such change was made this January when the FOMC clarified that the 2 percent inflation target is\nsymmetric. As indicated in the statement, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running\npersistently above or persistently below the goal. Persistent one-side misses can be of concern because in\nmany models of the inflation process, current and past deviations from the target are informative about\nfuture inflation. Another factor affecting the outlook for inflation is inflation expectations. Persistent\nmisses on either side of the goal can be of concern because they might ultimately cause inflation\nexpectations to become unanchored, thereby undermining the achievement of the Fed’s longer-run\ninflation objective.\n\nThese concerns may or may not rise to the level of necessitating a policy action. The FOMC has to\nbalance a number of considerations in setting policy to promote its dual mandate goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. As we’ve discussed, policy action is tied to the medium-run outlook. If\nthe one-sided misses have changed the outlook for inflation and employment materially, then policy\nmight need to respond in order to foster attainment of our goals. In other cases, even if inflation were\nrunning above or below the target, no policy response might be called for because the outlook continued\nto be for inflation to return to 2 percent over time and for the economy to be at full employment.\n\nAn example is the period in late 2006 and early 2007. The minutes of the December 2006 FOMC\nmeeting indicate that the economy was expected to expand at a moderate pace and all FOMC participants\nwere concerned about inflation.6 Nearly all participants felt that the core measures of inflation were\n“uncomfortably high.” Part of the increase in both headline and core inflation reflected earlier rises in\n6\n\nSee “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 12, 2006,”\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20061212.htm.\n\n\f12\nenergy and other commodity prices. The FOMC continued to forecast that core inflation would move\nlower over time as the effects of higher energy and commodity prices passed through and growth\nmoderated. They expressed concern that if inflation didn’t moderate as expected, there would be\nsignificant costs if inflation expectations drifted up. But on balance, these concerns did not elicit a\nchange in the fed funds rate, although there was one dissent in favor of raising rates in light of the\ninflation outlook. Similarly, in meetings in early 2007, the Committee was concerned about inflation but\nthe forecast was for inflation to moderate and there was no policy response.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Great Recession and our experience with low inflation, I have not heard many\npeople say that they believe that the Fed interprets its inflation target as a ceiling, and is only concerned\nabout misses on the upside. Nonetheless, I do think the change the Committee made in January to clarify\nthe symmetric nature of the inflation target was a positive step toward improved transparency and\ncommunications.\n\nAnd I hope that my remarks today helped to clarify for you my own interpretation of four catch-phrases in\nthe monetary policymaker’s lexicon: data dependent, gradual normalization, well underway, and\nsymmetric inflation goal. Thank you for your attention.\n\n\f"

I\nwill begin with the\nFederal Reserve’s\norigins and then touch\non some gradual\nchanges it has made in the way it conducts monetary policy. Then I\nwill focus on some of the more recent changes in monetary policy\nthat were brought on by the financial crisis and deep recession. I will\nconclude by discussing the monetary policy actions taken just last\nweek. Before I begin, I have to note that these are my views alone\nand not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nP resident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank o f Cleveland\nThe University of Dayton RISE 14\nDayton, Ohio\n\nMarch 27, 2014\n\nSince we are on a college campus, I think it is appropriate to begin\nwith a brief history lesson. In October 1907, the US economy was\nseized by panic. It began with the ominous failure of New York City’s\nKnickerbocker Trust Company. The collapse of that institution was\nmade all the more sensational because the president of\nKnickerbocker committed suicide a month later. Knickerbocker’s\ndemise set the table for a series of bank failures that spread across\nmany American cities. Depositors lined up for blocks to withdraw\ntheir funds from troubled banks. The stock market crashed and the\nunemployment rate rose sharply. The prevailing emotion of the time\nwas fear. As it was later said, “The nation had lost its confidence. It\nwould take leadership and courage to bring it back.”[1]\nLeadership and courage found their form six years later. On\nDecember 23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal\nReserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve System. To this day,\nthere is no organization in America structured quite like the Federal\nReserve. The structure of the Federal Reserve reflects the debate\nthat led to its formation. Commercial bankers wanted the Federal\nReserve to be owned and operated by the banks. Businesses and\nbanks outside of New York City wanted to make sure the Federal\nReserve w asn’t controlled by Wall Street. Meanwhile, many in\nCongress wanted the central bank to be a part of the government.\nThe resulting legislation struck a compromise. It may sound\ncontradictory, but the Federal Reserve is a decentralized-central\nbank with public and private components.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/for_the_public/news_and_media/speeches/2014/pianalto_20140327.cfm[4/29/2014 9:50:26 AM]\n\n\fThe Federal Reserve: Policy Approaches Then and Now :: March 27, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nTo be more concrete, the Federal Reserve Act established the\nFederal Reserve Board in Washington, DC, with seven governors\nappointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. And it\ndivided the country into regional districts with Federal Reserve Banks\nheadquartered in each. The president of each of the 12 Reserve\nBanks is appointed by a board of directors consisting of private\ncitizens from the district.\nThe Federal Reserve has a number of responsibilities, many of which\nyou may not be familiar with. For example, the Federal Reserve\nserves as the lender of last resort. Federal Reserve Banks can make\nloans to address financial panics, and we certainly made use of that\npower during the financial crisis in 2008. We supervise the banking\nsystem. We work to ensure an accessible, efficient, and secure US\npayments system, and we serve as the federal government’s bank.\nOur community development efforts support the economic growth of\nlow- and moderate-income neighborhoods across the country.\nBut a lot has changed over the past 100 years. Clearly, as a woman, I\nwouldn’t have been leading a Federal Reserve Bank in 1913, nor\nwould a woman have been the Federal Reserve Board’s chair, as is\nnow the case with Janet Yellen. As an employer, the Federal Reserve\nhas definitely adapted to reflect the times and our nation’s diversity.\nIn addition, there are plenty of examples of how the Federal\nReserve’s responsibilities have evolved over the years to fit the\nnation’s changing needs and ambitions. Monetary policy is a prime\nexample.\nTo begin with, monetary policy as we know it today didn’t exist in\n1913. At that time, the US economy operated under the gold\nstandard. There was no such thing as buying and selling financial\nassets to influence interest rates. But the gold standard proved too\ninflexible in times of stress like the Great Depression, and it was\ngradually abandoned. Ultimately, the country transitioned from a\nsystem of money backed by gold to a system of money backed by\npublic confidence in the US economy.\nIt w asn’t really until the 1930s that the Federal Reserve began\nconducting “monetary policy.” During that decade, Congress\nestablished the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, as the\nnation’s monetary policy body. The Committee consists of the seven\nFederal Reserve governors and five of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents\nwho vote on a rotating basis.\nThe Federal Reserve’s objectives have been refined and updated over\nthe decades as well. After World War II, lawmakers were concerned\nabout millions of soldiers returning home with no job prospects. In\nresponse, Congress passed the Employment Act of 1946, which called\nfor all parts of the government-including the Federal Reserve—to\npromote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\nThen in 1978, Congress gave the FOMC an official mandate. The\neconomy was reeling from energy price shocks, rising unemployment,\nand rapidly increasing inflation. In response, Congress approved the\nFull Employment and Balanced Growth Act, often called the\nHumphrey-Hawkins Act after its sponsors. It directed the Federal\nReserve to “promote full employment” and “reasonable price\nstability.” Today we call those objectives the Federal Reserve’s dual\nmandate.\nSo you can see that the Federal Reserve has continued to adapt over\nthe past 100 years. However, some of the most significant changes in\nthe way we conduct monetary policy have occurred very recently in\nthe aftermath of the financial crisis, severe economic recession, and\nensuing slow recovery.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/for_the_public/news_and_media/speeches/2014/pianalto_20140327.cfm[4/29/2014 9:50:26 AM]\n\n\fThe Federal Reserve: Policy Approaches Then and Now :: March 27, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBefore the crisis, the Federal Reserve’s main monetary policy tool\nwas to target the federal funds rate. By way of background, the\nfederal funds rate is a very short-term rate that influences a whole\nhost of other interest rates. So when the federal funds rate goes\ndown, car loans get cheaper, home mortgage rates decline, and even\ncredit card rates may get less expensive, to name just a few. Low\ninterest rates have a positive impact on the broader economy. When\nconsumers can borrow at lower interest rates, they can afford to buy\nmore goods and services, and the businesses that supply those goods\nand services can hire more people. And when more people are\nworking, they have more money to spend. More spending creates\nmore jobs, and more jobs create more spending. The reverse happens\nwhen we raise the target federal funds rate. So that is why targeting\nthe federal funds rate for many, many years was an effective way for\nthe Federal Reserve to fulfill its objectives.\nBut that ended in late 2008. When the economy teetered on the\nbrink of another depression, we lowered the federal funds rate to\nessentially zero. It couldn’t go any lower than that, but the economy\nwas still in a recession. So we had to turn to unconventional tools.\nThe most well-known of these tools is what we call large-scale asset\npurchases, or what you may know as Quantitative Easing, or QE.\nThe purpose of the asset purchase program is to put downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates. And we accomplish this goal\nby purchasing longer-term securities. This is in contrast to the way\nwe lower the target federal funds rate, which we do by buying veryshort-term securities. In turn, the purchase of longer-term securities\npushes down the interest rates that consumers and businesses borrow\nat. Mortgage interest rates are a good example of the kind of interest\nrates that get pushed down by our asset purchase program.\nThe other major unconventional monetary policy tool we have turned\nto is what we call forward guidance. I know the term may sound\nstrange, but really all it means is that we are giving the public more\ninformation on how monetary policy is likely to evolve.\nIncreasingly, the\neffectiveness of\nmonetary policy\ndepends on how the\npublic reacts to the\npolicy action. This is\nespecially true with our\nforward-guidance tool.\nBanks are quick to\nunderstand that our\nforward guidance means\nthat their cost of funds\nwill remain low. But the\npolicy effects are\nstrongest when not only\nlenders but borrowers\nhave confidence that\nshort-term interest\nrates will stay low.\nStudies have shown that\nboth of our\nunconventional to o lsforward guidance and\nasset purchases—have\nhelped to significantly\nlower long-term interest\nrates, just as we\nintended. [2]\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/for_the_public/news_and_media/speeches/2014/pianalto_20140327.cfm[4/29/2014 9:50:26 AM]\n\n\fThe Federal Reserve: Policy Approaches Then and Now :: March 27, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSo the way we conduct monetary policy has changed significantly,\nand the way that we communicate about policy has also changed. It\nwas only 20 years ago that we first communicated our policy decision\nto the public immediately following an FOMC meeting by releasing a\nstatement at the conclusion of the meeting. And on that first\noccasion, the statement was only a few sentences long, and we\nweren’t sure whether we would be making similar announcements on\na regular basis. Compare that to today, when we release a statement\nfollowing every meeting, and the average policy statement is now up\nto 900 words.\nOur enhanced communications go beyond issuing regular policy\nstatements. Here are some other recent enhancements to our\ncommunications: We have told the public that our objective for\ninflation is 2 percent over the longer-term. We have started releasing\nprojections for inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and our\nexpectations for the federal funds rate on a quarterly basis. And now\nthe chair of the Federal Reserve holds press conferences following\nfour of the FOMC’s eight meetings each year. Janet Yellen held her\nfirst press conference as Federal Reserve chair just last week.\nIn a time when the use of unconventional tools has made monetary\npolicy more complex, uncertainty about monetary policy could have\ngone up. But in my view, our enhanced communications have\ndelivered greater clarity to the public and financial markets. We\nhave come a long way from when former Federal Reserve Chairman\nAlan Greenspan proudly said, “If I turn out to be particularly clear,\nyou have probably misunderstood what I said.”\nSo that is some background on how monetary policy works and why\ncommunications are so important. Now, let me tie everything up by\ndiscussing the rationale for the FOMC’s recent policy decisions. To\nput it simply, even though we are making some progress, we are still\nfalling short of achieving our objectives for maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation.\nOn the employment front, the economy has generated 180,000 net\njobs per month over the past year. That is a respectable number and\nit is helping to reduce the unemployment rate. In fact, the\nunemployment rate has fallen from around 8 percent at the start of\nthe current QE program in September 2012 to 6.7 percent today. Our\nlatest QE program is aimed at supporting ongoing improvement in\nlabor market conditions. So in light of the improving labor market,\nthe Committee decided last week to make another modest reduction\nin the pace of its asset purchases. This was our third consecutive\nreduction since December of last year. We have now trimmed our\npurchases to $55 billion of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities\neach month.[3]\nBut at 6.7 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated. In\naddition, there are too many people who can find only part-time\nwork even though they would rather work full-time, while others\nhave simply given up looking for work. And the still-very-large\nnumbers of people that have been unemployed for long durations\nremains a significant concern.[4]\nTurning to inflation, we are falling short of our 2 percent objective.\nThe main inflation gauge we watch at the FOMC—the PCE price index\n—has hovered around only 1.1 percent over the past year. Low\ninflation might sound like good news, but today it is also a sign of an\neconomy that is not firing on all cylinders. The big risk is that\npersistently low inflation could tip into deflation, which is when the\nlevel of prices actually falls. When deflation happens, businesses and\nconsumers put off spending and investment because they are waiting\nfor even lower prices, which is bad for the economy.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/for_the_public/news_and_media/speeches/2014/pianalto_20140327.cfm[4/29/2014 9:50:26 AM]\n\n\fThe Federal Reserve: Policy Approaches Then and Now :: March 27, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGiven elevated unemployment and persistently low inflation,\nmonetary policy remains very accommodative. Even though we are\nscaling back our asset purchases, we are still buying a sizable\namount. At this point, we have accumulated about $4 trillion worth\nof securities—which is four times the size of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet six years ago before the financial crisis and recession.\nThese sizable asset holdings should continue to maintain downward\npressure on interest rates.\nThe FOMC has also indicated its intent to keep the target federal\nfunds rate exceptionally low in order to continue to make progress\non both maximum employment and inflation. The Committee will\ntake into account a wide range of information in determining how\nlong to keep the target federal funds rate low. We will be watching\nlabor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation\nexpectations, and readings on financial developments. It is a\ncomplicated world out there, and no single data point will determine\nour next move.\nWith appropriate monetary policy, I see the economy expanding at a\nslightly stronger rate this year than last. I expect GDP growth this\nyear to be around 3 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to fall\nto 6.2 percent by the end of the year. And I project that\naccommodative monetary policy, a strengthening economy, and\nstable inflation expectations will bring inflation back to our 2\npercent objective over time, but I expect that progress to be slow.\nThat is my outlook and the current stance of monetary policy in a\nnutshell. To sum up my talk this morning, I have discussed some\nnotable changes in the way the Federal Reserve conducts monetary\npolicy. I hope that you have a better understanding of the Federal\nReserve’s actions, and can see that we are working to build an\neconomy where soon-to-be young professionals like many of you can\nfollow your dreams.\n\n[1] “The Panic of 1907: Lessons Learned from the Market’s Perfect\nStorm,” by Robert F.

It is sometimes hard for me to fathom that I\nhave spent more than half my life in the Federal Reserve System, and\nroughly one-third of its existence! In many ways, I have grown up\nwith this institution. When I reflect back on those 30 years, I am\nstruck by the many changes that I have witnessed. The Federal\nReserve has adapted and evolved. It is very much a learning\norganization. I don’t have time today to go through all the changes I\nhave seen over this 30-year period, so tonight I will share my\nreflections on some of the changes that have occurred in Federal\nReserve operations. Then I will walk through some of the changes\nresulting from the financial crisis and severe economic recession. I\nwill wrap up with thoughts on the collaborative spirit of the Federal\nReserve. Before I start, I need to give the standard disclaimer that\nthese are my views alone and not necessarily those of others in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nOn December 23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal\nReserve Act, which created the nation’s central bank and set the\nstage for the establishment of 12 Reserve Banks, including one in\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2014/Pianalto_20140226.cfm[4/29/2014 9:47:54 AM]\n\n\fMy Life at the Federal Reserve: Embracing Change and Collaboration :: February 26, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCleveland. My Federal Reserve District covers all of Ohio, western\nPennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West\nVirginia. The Federal Reserve was purposefully designed as a\ndecentralized organization, with both public and private components\nand broad geographic representation. Our congressional founders\nrecognized that the central bank needed to reflect the diversity of\nthe nation while protecting decisions from political interference.\nSo what does a Federal Reserve Bank do? The Federal Reserve Banks\ncooperate with the Board of Governors in Washington, DC, in\nsupervising commercial banks in our respective regions. We also\nconduct research on national and regional economic conditions; we\nprovide financial services to banks and the US Treasury; and we are a\nresource for people and organizations that are involved in community\nand economic development. A Reserve Bank is a multifaceted\noperation with many moving parts, and over the past three decades\nor so, I have witnessed many changes and many accomplishments at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\nWhen I started at the Bank, most of our employees were involved in\noperational activities—that is, processing checks, cash, and savings\nbonds. Cash processing remains a core function at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, but we no longer process paper checks or\nTreasury bonds.\nWe once processed 11 million paper checks every night in my Reserve\nBank District. That means we took in trucks full of checks, ran them\nthrough high-speed sorting machines, debited and credited the\nappropriate financial institutions, and then sent those checks to their\nultimate destinations—it was a really large operation. But today the\nnumber of paper checks we process is zero. The Federal Reserve now\nprimarily processes checks electronically. Other forms of payment\nhave become popular, and Americans have simply stopped writing\npaper checks like they used to. Technological innovations have also\nproduced new efficiencies, allowing Federal Reserve Banks to\nconsolidate many operations. Those trends are a large part of the\nreason why our employee base at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland has shrunk from 1,600 people when I took over as\npresident to about 900 today. In fact, across the whole System, about\n4,000 fewer people work at Reserve Banks today compared with\n2003.1 Like the rest of the world, we at the Federal Reserve have\nharnessed the power of technology to become more efficient.\nAs the fiscal agent to the US Treasury, we are also using technology\nto make payments to and from government agencies more efficient.\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, we have developed a\nwebsite called Pay.gov where the public can make payments to 175\nagencies. In 2013, we processed 121 million transactions valued at\nmore than $115 billion. If you have made a payment on your federal\nstudent loan recently, one of our Pay.gov employees processed that\npayment for you.\nAdvances in technology have had a tremendous positive impact on\nwhat we do at the Federal Reserve and how we do our work. Now let\nme turn to some of the changes that have occurred as a result of the\nfinancial crisis and severe economic recession.\nIn many ways, the 2008 financial crisis resembled a classic financial\npanic. A panic happens when investors and the public lose confidence\nin key financial institutions and markets. One of the first actions we\ntook at the Federal Reserve to restore confidence in the banking\nsystem was to do what we were created to do—to serve as a lender\nof last resort. At the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, lending to\nfinancial institutions in my District in 2008 totaled almost $100\nbillion. To give you an idea of how big that number is, in 2006 when\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2014/Pianalto_20140226.cfm[4/29/2014 9:47:54 AM]\n\n\fMy Life at the Federal Reserve: Embracing Change and Collaboration :: February 26, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nfinancial markets were more normal, our lending total was less than\n$2 billion.2 Put another way, we needed to provide 50 times the\nusual amount of liquidity to respond to the 2008 financial crisis.\nAnother move we made to restore confidence in financial markets\nwas to conduct a series of stress tests on the 19 largest financial\ninstitutions. Three of them are headquartered in my District. Stress\ntests put institutions through severe scenarios to see if they would\nhave enough capital should housing prices suddenly plummet or the\nunemployment rate spike. Letting the public know that most banks\nhad enough capital and making capital available through the\ngovernment for those that didn’t was helpful in restoring public\nconfidence in the banking system.\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and across the Federal\nReserve System, we now conduct stress tests every year on the\nlargest institutions, and we help smaller banks conduct their own. We\nalso lead the banks we supervise in annual capital planning exercises\nto ensure that they have enough capital to handle an economic\nshock. Another benefit of stress tests is they help ensure that banks\nhave sufficient capital to continue to provide loans to creditworthy\ncustomers during a downturn. We learned during the crisis that some\nbanks stopped lending in order to shrink assets to improve their\ncapital ratios, which only aggravated the tight-credit situation. We\nalso make public the results of those stress tests on the largest\ninstitutions. It is obviously useful for banks themselves to know they\ncan weather a storm, but it is equally useful for the public to know\nthat the banks are well capitalized. Again, it helps promote\nconfidence.\nAn important feature of stress testing is the comparison of risks\nacross banks. For example, we might look at levels of commercial\nreal estate holdings across banks. We want to identify risks that are\nevident in multiple banks and which could have a larger impact on\nthe financial system. The Federal Reserve has recognized the\nimportance of monitoring banks as a group and not just as individual\ninstitutions. That is why, today, my staff at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Cleveland includes a large number of financial system supervisors\nwhose job goes beyond assessing the condition of individual banks. It\nis also why my staff has taken it upon themselves to better\nunderstand regional banks—what you might think of as mid-sized\ninstitutions. Understanding the proper level of regulation and\nsupervision for regional banks is important given the relationships and\ncommon vulnerabilities among them.\nThese changes represent significant progress in the Federal Reserve’s\napproach to supervision and regulation in the aftermath of the\nfinancial crisis. Quite appropriately, we have shifted from a focus on\nthe safety and soundness of individual banks to the financial stability\nof the entire system.\nAnother area where the financial crisis, severe recession, and slow\nrecovery have prompted changes at the Federal Reserve is in the\nconduct of monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee, or\nFOMC, is the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy body. It consists of\nthe seven members of the Board of Governors in Washington and the\n12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents. Right now, I happen to be the\nlongest-serving Federal Reserve Bank president. Janet Yellen is the\nnew chair of the FOMC. We meet eight times a year to review\nfinancial and economic conditions and determine appropriate\nmonetary policy responses. At each meeting, we have to decide how\nto best achieve the mandate that Congress has given us to promote\nmaximum employment and stable prices. Put another way, monetary\npolicy is supposed to preserve the value of the dollar while\ncultivating an economy where there are enough jobs for everyone\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2014/Pianalto_20140226.cfm[4/29/2014 9:47:54 AM]\n\n\fMy Life at the Federal Reserve: Embracing Change and Collaboration :: February 26, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nwho wants one.\nAt each FOMC meeting, we begin with reports from the staff on\nfinancial market developments and on US and worldwide economic\ndevelopments. Then each Reserve Bank president and each governor\nprovides comments on business conditions and their economic\noutlook. This is called the economic “go-round.” Next, we turn to a\ndiscussion of possible monetary policy actions, the so-called policy\ngo-round. We usually have a selection of policy alternatives to\ndiscuss. Each participant gives his or her view, and the meeting ends\nwith a vote on the federal funds rate target.\nEleven years ago, my description of an FOMC meeting might have\nstopped right there. But things have grown a bit more complicated in\nthe interim. In the uncertain aftermath of the financial crisis,\nrecession, and slow recovery, achieving our inflation and employment\nobjectives has become much more challenging.\nBefore the crisis, the main policy tool we voted on was the federal\nfunds rate. By way of background, the federal funds rate influences a\nwhole host of other interest rates. So when the federal funds rate\ngoes down, car loans get cheaper, home mortgages decline, and even\ncredit card rates may get less expensive, to name just a few. And\nthat has a positive impact on the broader economy. When consumers\ncan borrow at lower interest rates, they can afford to buy more goods\nand services, and the businesses that supply those goods and services\ncan hire more people. And when more people are working, they have\nmore money in their bank accounts and may be more likely to spend.\nMore spending creates more jobs, and more jobs create more\nspending. The entire economy benefits in a virtuous circle of growth.\nThe reverse happens when we raise the federal funds rate. So that is\nwhy targeting the federal funds rate for many, many years was an\neffective way for the Federal Reserve to fulfill its objectives.\nBut that ended in late 2008. With the economy on the brink of\nanother depression, we lowered the federal funds rate to zero. It\ncan’t go any lower than that, so when the economy needed further\nsupport we had to turn to unconventional tools. The most well-known\nof those tools is what we call large-scale asset purchases, or what\nyou may know as Quantitative Easing, or QE. The goal of the asset\npurchase program is to maintain downward pressure on long-term\ninterest rates. After the crisis, the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases\nhave risen to unprecedented levels, although the purpose of the\nprogram is still to lower interest rates for consumers and businesses.\nToday we are in our third round of QE, and studies show that the\nasset purchases have succeeded in pushing down longer-term interest\nrates and have generally eased financial conditions.\nAnother tool we have turned to is what we call forward guidance. We\nare telling the public that we expect that a highly accommodative\nstance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable\ntime after the asset purchase program ends and the economic\nrecovery strengthens. Again, we had limited previous experience with\nforward guidance. Yet like our experience with large-scale asset\npurchases, this unconventional tool has also proven itself effective. It\nhas helped convince the public that interest rates will remain low,\njust as we had hoped. Lenders are more willing to continue making\nloans at lower rates because they have confidence that interest rates\nwill stay low, and businesses and consumers can make decisions with\nmore certainty about the borrowing environment.\nSo those are two unconventional tools we are using to attain our\nobjectives. Not only are they new to us in scale and scope, they are\nalso new to the American public. Recognizing that, we have engaged\nin a parallel effort to help the public and financial markets\nunderstand why we are doing what we are doing. That is because the\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2014/Pianalto_20140226.cfm[4/29/2014 9:47:54 AM]\n\n\fMy Life at the Federal Reserve: Embracing Change and Collaboration :: February 26, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\neffectiveness of monetary policy depends importantly on the public’s\nexpectations of how policy will evolve.\nSo let me give some specific examples of how the Federal Reserve\nhas tried to make clearer the link between our policy actions and\ndeveloping economic conditions. In January 2012, the FOMC published\na statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy. It was in that\nstatement that we first announced that our inflation objective would\nbe 2 percent. That was a big step—we had never before publicly\nannounced a numerical goal for inflation. We also began publishing\nFOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment\nrate. That way, people will know what we think of as maximum\nemployment. Right now, the range is from 5.2 percent to 6 percent,\nbut that is subject to revision over time.\nAnother way that we have enhanced communications around our\nobjectives is by releasing FOMC participants’ forecasts for inflation,\nthe unemployment rate, and economic growth. These forecasts also\ninclude projections of future federal funds rates that we see as most\nappropriate for achieving the Committee’s objectives. All of this\ninformation is included in our quarterly Summary of Economic\nProjections, which is posted on the Federal Reserve Board’s website.\nSo now, the public can see more transparently how the FOMC expects\nthe economy to develop relative to its longer-run objectives. And\nforgive me for sounding like a late-night TV commercial, but wait—\nthere’s more! The chair of the FOMC now takes questions at quarterly\npress conferences, another first. In a time when the use of\nunconventional tools could have ratcheted up uncertainty about\nmonetary policy, these communications have instead delivered a\nmuch-needed dose of clarity to the public and financial markets.\nThrough all of these changes, what has impressed me the most has\nbeen the commitment of the people around the FOMC table to\nconsistently come together on policy actions aimed at achieving our\nshared objectives. I would even venture to say that we could not\nhave made as much progress as we have in getting people back to\nwork and keeping prices stable without this commitment.\nWe arrive at each meeting with our own forecasts based on analysis\nby our own staffs. We have widely different backgrounds—you may\nhave heard the old joke that it’s difficult to get two economists to\nagree on anything; well, at the FOMC you can add lawyers, former\nbankers, and bank examiners to that mix. We work hard to develop a\npolicy action that the Committee can broadly support.\nI don’t think I’m going out on a limb to say that the FOMC has always\nbeen a collegial group. What I can tell you for certain as an\neyewitness for the past 11 years, however, is that the Committee\nunder Ben Bernanke’s leadership took purposeful steps to strengthen\nits commitment to collaboration and consensus-building.\nFor example, at his first meeting as chairman in 2006, Ben Bernanke\nwanted to increase interactions among participants at the FOMC\nmeeting, so he introduced what he called a “two-handed”\nintervention. Instead of raising just one hand to get the chair’s\nattention to be called on to give comments in the economic and\npolicy go-rounds, you could raise both hands to signal that you\nwanted to ask a question of someone else at the table or to add a\ncomment. Chairman Bernanke also started the practice of going last\non the important policy go-round. He listened to everyone’s views\naround the table before laying out his own views and suggesting a\nway forward.\nHearing the diversity of views and interacting in this way around the\ntable helps us reach better decisions. I draw this picture in contrast\nto the stereotypical portrayal of FOMC participants in the media. The\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2014/Pianalto_20140226.cfm[4/29/2014 9:47:54 AM]\n\n\fMy Life at the Federal Reserve: Embracing Change and Collaboration :: February 26, 2014 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nmedia is fond of classifying FOMC participants as the “hawks” who\nwant to tighten policy and the “doves” who want more\naccommodation. I myself have been called a “centrist,” and it has\nbeen said that watching the center tends to give you a good sense of\nwhich way the Committee is leaning.\nI have also never dissented at a meeting. But I want to point out that\nfor all the headlines the dissenters grab, dissents are actually quite\nrare on the FOMC. In my 11 years serving on the Committee, only 11\nof my 40 colleagues have dissented.3 To put it even more plainly,\nthere have been 48 total dissenting votes since 2003 compared with\nabout 1,000 votes supporting the consensus.\nOverall, I think the Committee’s nearly unanimous voting record is\nextraordinary given everything we have gone through since the\nfinancial crisis, severe economic recession, and ensuing slow\nrecovery. A less-collaborative FOMC may not have been able to move\nas aggressively or creatively to embrace the unconventional tools\nthat proved vital in stabilizing the financial system and putting the\neconomy on a path to recovery. It w asn’t uncommon in the thick of\nthe crisis for any of us on the FOMC to receive a weekend phone call\nfrom Ben Bernanke asking us about our views. The collegial and\nrespectful atmosphere of the FOMC allowed us to quickly process a\nrange of different views and forecasts, and then move forward with a\nwell-considered decision. You never know where the best ideas are\ngoing to come from, so you have to be open to hearing different\nperspectives. We do not have to look too far, unfortunately, to see\nexamples of institutions that have failed to foster a collaborative\natmosphere, with gridlock and standoffs the unfortunate\nconsequence.\nNow I would like you to think back to the opening of my remarks\nwhen I told you about the Federal Reserve’s origins. I noted that the\nFederal Reserve was designed to be decentralized so that different\nviews could be heard and it would be protected from short-term\npolitical influence so the best long-term interests of the country\ncould be pursued. I did not say that Congress forced us to embrace\nchange and collaboration. Those words are not in the Federal Reserve\nAct, or in any subsequent legislation. But we do have the freedom to\nwork together toward our objectives of getting Americans back to\nwork and keeping prices stable. To me, that is the genius of the\nSystem.\nIncidentally, Janet Yellen’s first meeting as chair of the FOMC will be\nnext month. Though I will be a part of only two meetings under her\nleadership, I would wager that one thing she won’t change will be\nthe commitment to building consensus and being open-minded in\norder to reach solutions that benefit the US economy.\nSo to sum up, today I have talked about some of the changes I have\nobserved during my time at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\nWe have moved away from processing paper payments and enhanced\nthe way we supervise the banking system. The Federal Reserve has\nadopted some unconventional monetary policy tools and we have\nchanged the way we communicate. And the Federal Open Market\nCommittee has embraced a consensus-building approach to achieving\nits objectives.\nMy career with the Federal Reserve has been extremely satisfying. My\nfamily immigrated to this country from Italy when I was five years\nold, and I remember helping my parents study for their citizenship\ntest. I was fascinated by the way the American government was set\nup and the different responsibilities the various entities carried.\nFrom then on, I knew I wanted a career in public service.

Then I\nwill turn to the focus of this conference—the housing market. I will\ndiscuss the importance of the housing sector in the broader economy\nand highlight some notable national trends. And I will wind up with\nsome thoughts on the factors that continue to hold back the\nrecovery. As always, the views I express today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)—the Federal Reserve's\nmonetary policymaking body--has a dual mandate given to us by\nCongress to promote maximum employment and price stability. The\nfinancial crisis and recession required us to supply a very\naccommodative monetary policy to get the economy back on a path\nto achieving those mandates. Our main and traditional tool to\nstimulate the economy in the face of a cyclical downturn is an\ninterest rate for overnight loans between banks: the federal funds\nrate. As the recession that accompanied the financial crisis\ndeepened, the Federal Open Market Committee drove short-term\nrates as low as they could go, right down to nearly zero.\nBut the recovery struggled to gain momentum, and it became clear\nthat the economy would benefit from further monetary policy\nstimulus. So we turned to some unconventional tools to push down\nlonger-term rates.\nOne of them is large-scale asset purchases, often referred to as\nquantitative easing, or QE. The FOMC is now on a third round of\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20131106b.cfm[4/29/2014 1:16:33 PM]\n\n\fHousing in the National Economy: A Look Back, a Look Forward :: November 6, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nbuying Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. When we\nbegan the current program last September, the FOMC said it would\ncontinue asset purchases until there was a substantial improvement in\nthe outlook for the labor market, as long as this was accomplished\nwithout a threat to price stability. Whether and when the pace of\nasset purchases would begin to slow has been the focus of much\nattention over the past few months.\nIn my view, we have accumulated meaningful progress in labor\nmarkets since the program began; on net, employers have created\nabout 180,000 jobs per month. At the same time, inflation has been\nrunning below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent. And\nfor this audience, I would add that the program has also helped\nconditions in the housing market by keeping mortgage rates\nhistorically low.\nHowever, the latest employment report was a case where the glass\ncould be described as either half empty or half full. The half-full\nperspective is that the unemployment rate fell to 7.2 percent, which\nrepresents steady improvement from the approximately 8 percent\nunemployment rate that prevailed at the start of the asset purchase\nprogram last September. The half-empty perspective is that only\n148,000 jobs were added, which is fewer than we would expect to\nsee in a labor market firing on all cylinders. The impact of the\nfederal fiscal retrenchment over the past year has also slowed\nmomentum in economic growth, which may impact employment\ngrowth in the coming months.\n\nAt last week's meeting, the FOMC described the improvement in\neconomic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset\npurchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in\nthe broader economy. However, the FOMC decided to await more\nevidence that the recovery's progress will be sustained before scaling\nback the pace of asset purchases. My hope is that the economic\nrecovery will accelerate so that the Committee gains the reassurance\nit needs to begin winding down the program. As I have said in the\npast, we have limited experience with asset purchases so it pays to\nbe cautious, especially in this uncertain economic environment.1\nWhile to date the risks have mostly remained theoretical, I remain\nconvinced that we need to be cautious in our expansion of asset\npurchases. The FOMC is constantly weighing the known benefits of\nasset purchases with their potential costs.\nBut when these initial steps to scale back our asset purchases occur,\nthey should not be interpreted as an outright tightening of monetary\npolicy. I want to reinforce the Committee’s message that even when\nthe rate of purchases is slowed and eventually stopped altogether, an\naccommodative monetary policy will still be needed to support the\neconomy. Indeed, the FOMC expects that the federal funds target\nrate will remain near zero for at least the next two years.2 Most\nFOMC participants don’t anticipate the first rate increase until\nsometime in 2015. Even by 2016, when unemployment is projected to\nbe much improved and inflation approaches our 2 percent objective,\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20131106b.cfm[4/29/2014 1:16:33 PM]\n\n\fHousing in the National Economy: A Look Back, a Look Forward :: November 6, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nmost FOMC participants expect the federal funds rate to be at or\nbelow 2 percent-still far below historical norms, still very supportive\nof the economy.\nA major reason why the economic recovery has been so slow and has\nrequired so much policy support has been the performance of the\nhousing market. Ordinarily, deep recessions are followed by strong\neconomic snap-backs. But an economist at my Bank and his co-author\nfound two exceptions to that rule: the Great Depression and the\nrecent recession.3In this last episode, the evidence points to the\ncollapse of the housing market as the key explanation for the slow\nrecovery. Most of the time, home construction and spending on\nhousehold goods can be counted on to provide a big push to the\nrecovery. Historically, residential investment has contributed about\nhalf a percentage point to GDP growth in each quarter during the\ntwo-year period immediately following a recession. During the first\ntwo years of this recent recovery, however, the contribution from\nresidential investment to GDP growth was basically zero. Because the\nrecent recession was caused in part by a housing crisis, the housing\nmarket was too damaged to provide its customary lift to GDP growth.\nLet me briefly discuss the housing bubble’s origins and its aftermath.\nThe run-up of housing prices in the early 2000s was partly\nattributable to the outsized amount of mortgages taken out by\ncredit-constrained borrowers—primarily people with low credit scores\nwho probably would not have qualified for mortgages in the 1980s\nand 1990s. The easing of credit constraints for many borrowers\nresulted in a larger than usual amount of consumption—not only for\nhomes, but for items to fill homes, including furniture and\nelectronics.\nThe housing boom fueled spending by enabling homeowners to\nwithdraw cash from the housing equity on their balance sheets, or to\nborrow against it as collateral. It is difficult to know how much\nspending during the boom years was driven by access to homeowners'\nequity. Some recent research indicates that homeowners borrowed\nroughly $1.25 trillion against their homes from 2002 to 2006.4\nHowever, the most interesting aspect of this research is the finding\nthat the borrowing was not evenly spread among households.\nHomeowners with the lowest credit scores borrowed very aggressively\nagainst increases in their home equity, while those with the highest\ncredit scores, as is typical, borrowed hardly anything. Altogether,\nhousehold debt rose from about 75 percent of household income in\n1990 to 135 percent in 2007.5\nThen came the bust. The housing crisis wiped out more than $7\ntrillion of household net worth. This is particularly important because\nhousing is the single most important asset on most families' balance\nsheets. Households hold the equity in their homes as a form of saving\nand can use it as collateral to secure loans.\nWith the crash, home values fell but debt obligations did not. This\ncreated a situation in which millions of homeowners owed more on\ntheir homes than their houses were actually worth, making them socalled underwater homeowners. Even those who did not sink\nunderwater got pretty soaked. In the two decades before the\nrecession, equity accounted for 60 percent of the value of all\nresidential real estate in this country. After the recession, equity\nplunged to 40 percent. In essence, mortgage holders went from\nowning more than half their homes outright, to owning less than\nhalf. Faced with this sizable loss of wealth, households hunkered\ndown. They cut back on spending and started saving.\nBesides affecting consumers, the housing downturn also affected\nsmall businesses. In another research finding by my Bank's\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20131106b.cfm[4/29/2014 1:16:33 PM]\n\n\fHousing in the National Economy: A Look Back, a Look Forward :: November 6, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\neconomists, we learned that the decline in housing prices posed a\nsignificant constraint to small business borrowing. That is because\nsmall business owners often use their own homes as collateral to\nfinance their businesses. Small businesses lost nearly $2.5 trillion in\nthe value of real estate assets during the recession.6 Those losses in\nturn made it more difficult for small business owners to qualify for\nloans.\nSince the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s highly accommodative\nmonetary policy has helped to put downward pressure on mortgage\nrates, enabling millions of homeowners to refinance on better terms,\nfreeing up cash flow for additional spending and saving. The\ncombination of higher housing prices and the paying down of\nmortgage debt has enabled homeowners to rebuild their housing\nwealth. In the aggregate, homeowners now hold a 50 percent equity\nstake in their homes, up sharply from the aforementioned 40 percent\nshare a couple years ago. And household debt as a share of household\nincome has dropped 26 percentage points from its pre-recession highs\nto 109 percent today.\nImproving household balance sheets has helped contribute to the\nrecovery in housing. Over the past year, in fact, housing has been a\nrelative star performer in the economy. Prices, starts, and sales are\nup.\nBut despite this progress, the housing sector still has a way to go to\nregain the vitality it enjoyed prior to the recession. Existing home\nsales have, for the most part, not climbed back to their pre­\nrecession levels, nor has new residential building. Even mortgage\noriginations are not what they used to be, despite the still\nhistorically low rates available to borrowers. In many markets, prices\nhave not yet returned to their 2000 levels. Finally, mortgage\napplications fell in May and June when mortgage rates moved up, and\nthey have been up and down since then.\nSo that is where we have been--a housing bust followed by a\nrecession and sluggish economic recovery that was made all the more\nsluggish because of the weakened housing market. Looking ahead,\ntight conditions in mortgage credit markets will continue to hold the\nhousing sector and broader economy from getting back to full\nstrength more quickly.\nLet me elaborate on that point. In a recent Federal Reserve survey of\nsenior loan officers, bankers reported that credit standards for all\ncategories of home mortgage loans have remained tighter than the\nstandards that have prevailed on average since 2005.7 Financing\ncompanies no longer assume that houses will provide adequate\ncollateral for borrowers with fragile credit histories. In addition,\nfinancial market regulators are standing vigilant to ensure there is no\nrecurrence of the housing bubble that almost brought the financial\nsystem and global economy to its knees.\nMoreover, access to mortgage credit has become far more restrictive.\nTo get a mortgage today, it helps to have a very high credit score.\nLenders are more likely to extend mortgage credit to consumers they\nperceive as very low risk. As a result, the pool of potential mortgage\nborrowers has shrunk. Households with low credit scores that were\nable to get credit before the crisis now are the least able to\nrefinance their homes, or to obtain new mortgage loans. These are\nalso the households who seem to be especially cautious in their\nspending these days. For these households, the days of extracting\n\"free cash\" from their homes are over. It is now mostly households\nwith ample savings that spend and save as they normally would.\nAnother development that could lead to tighter credit conditions in\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20131106b.cfm[4/29/2014 1:16:33 PM]\n\n\fHousing in the National Economy: A Look Back, a Look Forward :: November 6, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nthe future involves the secondary mortgage market. The outlook for\nthe government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is\nuncertain. The GSEs, as they are known, had to be rescued after the\nfinancial crisis and Congress is weighing reforms that might greatly\nreduce the government's large position in housing finance. The\nhousing market today is being heavily supported by Fannie and\nFreddie. Without the government guarantees on mortgage-backed\nsecurities, the amount of credit available for mortgage originations\nwould be substantially smaller today.\nTo sum up my remarks, it was the housing bust that got us into this\nsituation. And the lasting consequences of the bust continue to hold\nback the housing market and broader economy. The big picture is\nthat many households are still adjusting to the large shock to their\nnet worth that occurred during the financial crisis and are dealing\nwith uncertainty over their future earnings prospects. For these\nreasons, consumer spending will likely continue at a moderate pace.\nBut over time, I expect these effects to fade and credit conditions to\nimprove.\nThe Federal Reserve is focused on fostering economic conditions that\nwill promote job growth and keep prices stable.\nEmployment in our economy continues to expand, and the\nunemployment rate is declining. That will eventually lead to a more\nvibrant economy in which more people move to and from jobs and\nhousehold incomes rise. As job and income prospects gradually\nimprove, younger families who have been doubling up with relatives\nmay increasingly leave the nest. Moreover, as I noted, a lot of people\nhave been paying down their debt during the past five years, giving\nthem renewed capacity to take on mortgage debt. My view is that\nthese developments will continue to slowly but surely heal both the\nhousing market and the overall economy. But patience is needed all\naround as we march forward, step by step, little by little.\nWhat I hope is that this perspective provides some context for what\nyou have been experiencing on the ground. I think it is crucial that\nwe have best facts at hand when making decisions about the way\nforward—whether that is setting monetary policy at the Federal\nReserve, or working on behalf of vibrant housing markets right here\nin Ohio.\n1.

My colleagues and I\non the Federal Open Market Committee responded swiftly and\ncreatively to the building threats, and our actions helped stave off a\nwider crisis and put the national economy on the road to recovery. I\nam extremely proud of my involvement in those efforts, and honored\nto have worked with so many dedicated professionals and public\nservants.\nMonetary policy is still getting a lot of attention. Today, I will discuss\nthe FOMC's decision last month to stay the course on our asset\npurchase program. Then I will discuss why very supportive monetary\npolicy remains essential to support the economy. I will finish with a\nlook at the principal drivers of regional economic growth, with an eye\ntoward Pittsburgh’s remarkable economic resurgence. As always, my\ncomments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me provide some context for the most recent meeting of the\nFOMC, which was held on September 17 and 18.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank o f Cleveland\nCFA Society Pittsburgh and the\nEconomic Club of Pittsburgh\nThe Fairmont Pittsburgh Hotel,\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nOctober 8, 2013\nSandra Pianalto - Reflection...\n\n<0\n\n0:00 / 48:52\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate given to us by Congress to\npromote maximum employment and price stability. The financial\ncrisis and recession meant we had to supply a very accommodative\nmonetary policy to get the economy back on a path to achieving\nthose mandates. Our main and traditional tool to stimulate the\neconomy in the face of a cyclical downturn is an interest rate for\novernight loans between banks: the federal funds rate. As the\nrecession that accompanied the financial crisis deepened, the FOMC\ndrove short-term rates as low as they could go, right down to nearly\nzero.\nBut the recovery struggled to gain momentum, and it became clear\nthat the economy would benefit from further monetary policy\nstimulus. So we turned to some unconventional tools to push down\nlonger-term rates.\nOne of them is asset purchases, often referred to as quantitative\neasing, or QE. The FOMC is now on a third round of buying Treasury\nsecurities and mortgage-backed securities. That program was\ninitiated in September 2012, a time when the pace of payroll gains\nwas 96,000 jobs per month1 and when most FOMC participants were\nprojecting hardly any improvement in labor markets until late 2013.\nThe FOMC said it would continue its asset purchases until there was a\nsubstantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.\nAlthough labor markets are not yet where we want them to be, I\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20131008.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:15 PM]\n\nYou Tube\n\n\fReflections on What Works in Supporting the Economy :: October 8, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nhave seen encouraging developments since last September. Employers\nover the past year have been creating about 180,000 jobs per month.\nMeanwhile, since the start of the current purchase program last\nSeptember, the unemployment rate has moved down 0.8 percentage\npoints to 7.3 percent, reflecting, in part, 2.3 million more private\nsector jobs.\nSome people have questioned whether the decrease in the\nunemployment rate is meaningful. They cite ongoing declines in the\nlabor force participation rate—the fraction of the population that is\neither working or looking for work. The recession and the slow\nrecovery have contributed to those declines, since some workers\nhave become so discouraged about their prospects of finding work\nthat they have stopped looking. However, research by my staff shows\nthat much of the decline is related to demographics, with the baby\nboom generation moving into retirement, for example. Overall, I\nbelieve we are seeing meaningful progress on employment levels. My\nforecast is that the unemployment rate will continue to drop as labor\nmarket conditions slowly heal.\nI know that my FOMC colleagues and I share the same goals—to\nensure that as many Americans as possible who want to have jobs,\nhave jobs. For me the improvement in labor markets seemed\nsubstantial enough to support a scaling back of the asset purchase\nprogram at last month's FOMC meeting. The statement that followed\nthe September meeting, in fact, acknowledged improvement in\neconomic activity and labor market conditions. However, the\nCommittee had some concerns that the tightening of financial\nconditions that had occurred over the summer could slow growth. In\naddition, the Committee noted that the extent of the effects of\nrestrictive fiscal policies remained unclear, and that the fiscal debate\ncould add additional risk to financial markets and to the broader\neconomy.\nIn the end, as you know, the FOMC decided to await more evidence\nthat the recovery's progress will be sustained before scaling back the\npace of asset purchases. I hope that the additional evidence that the\nCommittee is looking for arrives soon. As I have said in the past,2 we\nhave limited experience with asset purchases so it pays to be\ncautious, especially in this uncertain economic environment. While to\ndate the risks have mostly remained theoretical, I remain convinced\nthat we need to be cautious in our expansion of asset purchases. The\nFOMC is constantly weighing the known benefits of asset purchases\nwith their potential costs.\nI have just told you that I have seen improvements in the labor\nmarket, but I also know that the economy still has some way to go to\nregain its full health.\nLet me elaborate on why I think that is the case. It is true that bank\nlending is gradually strengthening and the housing market appears to\nbe stabilizing. Home prices are up and home building has resumed in\nmost parts of the country. And consumers have made considerable\nprogress in paying down their debts, putting them in better position\nto contribute to growth. That is all certainly good news. But in order\nfor growth to pick up, consumer spending must increase further. That\nin turn will give businesses more confidence to increase their\ninvestment and hiring. Unfortunately, confidence is being shaken\nthese days by the fiscal situation. Uncertainty about the course of\nfiscal policy over the coming months and the strains related to the\ndebt ceiling debate pose downside risks to the outlook.\nAssuming the fiscal situation is resolved fairly soon, my forecast is for\nsteady but slow improvement in the economy. This outlook is\nrelatively consistent with that of my colleagues on the FOMC. GDP\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20131008.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:15 PM]\n\n\fReflections on What Works in Supporting the Economy :: October 8, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ngrowth this year has been around 2 percent. For the next few years,\nFOMC participants expect GDP growth to pick up a bit, but remain\nfairly modest, in the range of about 2.5 to 3.5 percent. Modest\ngrowth in all likelihood will bring about only a gradual reduction in\nthe unemployment rate. It is not until 2016 that most FOMC\nparticipants predict the unemployment rate will fall below 6 percent,\nwhich is what I would consider close to full employment.\nTurning to inflation, over the last 12 months, inflation as measured\nby the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, has\nbeen just 1.2 percent. Based on analysis at my Bank, I view the\ncurrent low levels of PCE inflation as temporary and I expect PCE\ninflation to gradually rise toward the FOMC's longer-term objective of\n2 percent.\nIn this environment, it should be clear that monetary policy still has\na big job to do, and we are committed to pursuing our long-run\nobjectives of maximum employment and stable prices by holding\ninterest rates low until we are closer to these objectives. Meanwhile,\nthe Federal Reserve's substantial holdings of securities will continue\nto apply downward pressure to longer-term interest rates. These\nlower interest rates should add support to the economy until we are\ncloser to the FOMC's dual mandate objectives. Even when we ease up\non the rate of new asset purchases, we will still be some distance\nfrom beginning to increase short-term rates.\nIndeed, the FOMC expects that the federal funds target rate will\nremain near zero for at least the next two years. Most FOMC\nparticipants don't anticipate the first rate increase until sometime in\n2015. Even by 2016, when unemployment is projected to be much\nimproved and inflation approaches our 2 percent objective, most\nFOMC participants expect the federal funds rate to be at or below 2\npercent—still far below historical norms, still very supportive of the\neconomy.\nMonetary policy can be powerful, but it has limits. To accomplish\nlong-lasting prosperity, other kinds of policies are necessary. And\nthat allows me to pivot to my other focus: how we can build stronger\nregional economies.\nPittsburgh 30 years ago was a blue collar town panicked by the severe\nloss of jobs in the steel industry. Back then, my colleagues and I at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland were monitoring the mass\nlayoff notices in our region and we were concerned about the Iron\nCity's future. Steel mills were closing and the unemployment rate in\nPittsburgh topped 16 percent.\nBut the city has pulled off a remarkable rebound. The unemployment\nrate here today is below the national average. Pittsburghers earn\nmore income than the national average and more than the workers in\nany other metro area in my District. Just walking here today I saw a\nbustle and vibrancy that would be the envy of other cities within my\nDistrict.\nHow have you done it? Pittsburgh certainly looks different than it did\n30 years ago, with your new convention center, office buildings,\nsports venues, and your attractive waterfront. However, in my view,\nthe most meaningful transformation has not been in the physical\ncapital, but rather it has been in the human capital. Pittsburgh has\nreinvented itself into a brain hub—a place with a high concentration\nof jobs that rely on human capital, innovation, and ideas.\nBack when I started at the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank in 1983,\nthis country had a little less than one knowledge job for every one\nmanufacturing job. A manufacturing job is one that produces physical\ngoods in a plant. Today, there are 2.5 knowledge jobs for every one\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20131008.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:15 PM]\n\n\fReflections on What Works in Supporting the Economy :: October 8, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nmanufacturing job in this country. That is just an extraordinary shift\nover the past 30 years.\nPittsburgh has trumped that shift, with almost 3 knowledge jobs per\nmanufacturing job.3 And Pittsburgh has added knowledge jobs at a\nfaster pace than most other major cities in the country. As a result,\nPittsburgh's economic performance has been better than most other\nmajor cities. Like other brain hubs, it is seeing the largest increases\nin jobs and income.\nThe saying goes that luck favors the well prepared, and Pittsburgh is\nvery well prepared indeed when it comes to having education levels\nnecessary to prosper in today's economy. Pittsburgh stands out for its\nhigh numbers of well-educated young people. The metro area ranks\nnear the top nationally for young workers with bachelor's degrees.\nAbout 42 percent of young Pittsburgh residents have a bachelor's\ndegree, which puts you at 12th out of the top 100 metropolitan\nstatistical areas. The investments made by this state and this region\nin human capital are paying off.\nI should add that Pittsburgh's experience tracks closely to the findings\nof research by economists at my Bank. We looked at 50 states over a\n75-year period, and throughout that entire period two factors stood\nout as the most important for driving income growth: educational\nattainment and innovation.4 And since innovation rarely happens\nwithout education, those two factors really go hand in hand. So what\nour research basically says is that if we want to improve our region's\neconomy, if we want people to have higher incomes, we need highly\neducated workers. That has been true for 75 years. And Pittsburgh\nhas proved it is still true today.\nGranted, there is no shortage of stories in the media about the\nstruggles of recent college graduates to find jobs matching their\nskills. But it is important to realize that even with mounting student\ndebt, the value of a college education endures. The unemployment\nrate for fresh college graduates was 7.8 percent at the end of 2012,\nalmost half that of people of the same age with less than a college\ndegree. My point is that education matters. Your experience here in\nPittsburgh is testament to that.\nA lot has happened during my 30 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland. I have seen this fading rust belt town transform into an\nup-and-coming technology center. And I have worked through a\nfinancial crisis that pushed our national economy to the brink. It took\ncourageous and creative efforts to achieve Pittsburgh's\ntransformation. And it has taken courageous and creative monetary\npolicies to get our national economy back on firmer ground. I am\nhopeful that the ground will soon be solid enough that the Federal\nReserve can begin to move away from one of our most innovative\ntools—long-term asset purchases—and return to supporting growth\nwith our traditional tool of influencing short-term interest rates.\nAs I am completing my service as president and CEO of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, I find myself in a reflective mood. Many\npeople have asked me what I have learned during my time as the\nleader of the Bank and a participant on the FOMC. I believe that my\nkey takeaway has been that most challenges can be overcome\nthrough collaboration. From making monetary policy decisions, to\nmeeting the challenges of the US payments system, to working out\nour country's fiscal difficulties, I believe that collaboration is central\nto resolving our differences and moving forward. Pittsburgh has\nlearned this lesson and used collaboration to transform itself and\nrewrite its future. More could learn from your example.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20131008.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:15 PM]\n\n\fReflections on What Works in Supporting the Economy :: October 8, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n1.

It is a treat to be\nable to speak before an audience dedicated to a cause that I\npersonally hold so dear. College Now plays a crucial role in providing\nguidance and access to funds that help Cleveland-area students\npursue educational opportunities. And if there is a consistent message\nI have been emphasizing during my 10 years as president of the\nCleveland Federal Reserve, it is that education is the key to successboth for individuals and for regions.\n\nP resident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank o f Cleveland\nCollege Now Greater Cleveland Bag\nLady Luncheon\nCleveland, OH\n\nSeptember 26, 2013\n\nI was asked to share a few observations about the role education\nplays in our region’s economy. Let me cut to the chase. We have a\nproblem in Greater Cleveland. Not enough of our residents have a\ncollege degree. I know you understand that—you would not be at a\nCollege Now event otherwise. But I want to illustrate the gravity of\nthe problem in crystal clear terms.\nOnly about one in four adults in Cleveland has a college degree. That\nputs us in the bottom half of America’s largest 100 cities. Our state\nalso has plenty of room for improvement. Right now, Ohio ranks 39th\nout of the 50 states in adults with a college degree.\nFor individuals, the benefits of education are straightforward: higher\npay and better job prospects. College graduates earn more than\nthose with high school diplomas. In fact, they earn about a million\ndollars more on average over their careers. College graduates are\nalso about half as likely to be unemployed as those with just a high\nschool degree. They tend to be healthier and more involved in civic\nactivities, making them stronger assets to their communities.\nIf a city lacks educated young people, it will be a challenge for it to\nprosper. There is an overwhelming amount of research that\ndemonstrates the importance of educational attainment in helping\ncities grow and thrive. Some of that research was performed by my\nstaff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\nEconomists in my Bank have done extensive research on how\neducation affects communities. We looked at the 50 states over a 75year period, and throughout that entire period two factors stood out\nas the most important for driving income growth: education and\ninnovation.\nAnd since innovation rarely happens without education, those two\nfactors really go hand in hand. That has been true for 75 years. And\nthere is mounting evidence that education and innovation are going\nto play an even more important role in the future. So what our\nresearch basically says is that if we want to improve our region’s\neconomy, if we want people here to have higher incomes, we need\nto improve the educational attainment of our citizens, especially our\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130926.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:32 PM]\n\n\fEducation Never Goes Out o f Style :: September 26, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nyoung people.\nJust 20 years ago, this country had one knowledge job for every one\nmanufacturing job. A knowledge job is one that relies on human\ncapital, innovation, and ideas. Manufacturing jobs produce physical\ngoods in a plant. Today, there are 2.5 knowledge jobs for every one\nmanufacturing job in this country. That is just an extraordinary shift,\nand it suggests to me that we need to do more to help our region’s\nstudents compete and prepare for knowledge jobs.\nHelping students prepare for knowledge jobs would also benefit our\nregion. Places with a higher concentration of knowledge jobs than\nthe national average of 2.5, which we call “brain hubs.” are seeing\nthe largest increases in jobs and incomes. Pittsburgh, a city which is\nalso in my District, was once a steel manufacturing center, and is\nnow on the brain hub bandwagon--it has 2.9 knowledge jobs for\nevery manufacturing job, more than the national average. But\nCleveland lags the national average; we have only 1.8 knowledge\njobs per manufacturing job.\nWe have to continue to work on transforming our region into a brain\nhub because the bottom line is that if we want to grow, we need\nmore knowledge jobs. We need to become a brain hub. And I am\noptimistic that Cleveland can become a brain hub. We have the tools\nto get there: Access to colleges and universities is a trait that most\nbrain hub cities have in common. Conveniently, the Cleveland area\nhas many outstanding public and private educational institutions.\nGenerating a more educated workforce can create a virtuous circle of\ngrowth. Over time, regions that develop educated labor pools also\nattract employers looking for skilled workers. Simultaneously, highly\nskilled workers will flock to these areas where the jobs are.\nSo to improve our own region’s economic outlook and prosperity, we\nmust reinvent ourselves. To do that, we need to help more young\npeople acquire the skills and education required to flourish in today’s\neconomy.\nAt the risk of preaching to the choir, I want to point out some of the\nconcrete steps we can take to expand educational attainment levels\nhere in Cleveland.\nThe first is helping students pay for college. I w on’t spend too much\ntime on this area, since that is one of College Now’s main goals.\nEverybody knows that tuition at both public and private institutions\nhas risen dramatically in recent years, and such a heavy financial\nburden is especially challenging for low- and even middle-income\nfamilies. Financial aid is wonderful when it’s available, but signing up\ncan be a confusing process. Aid packages differ widely, making it\nhard to compare costs between schools in an apples-to-apples way.\nOur region’s students and families deserve financial aid system that is\neasier to understand and access.\nAnother area where we could do better is with programs that help\nhigh school graduates earn certificates through training so they can\nsmoothly transition to the workforce. I hear from manufacturers all\nthe time that in today’s high-tech factory environment, a high school\ndegree no longer cuts it. But a four-year degree may not be\nessential, either. The training recent high school graduates need can\ncome in the form of certificate-type programs that equip workers\nwith the skills necessary to handle sophisticated machinery—and earn\na wage sufficient to support a family. Our community colleges are\nmaking great strides in this area. And everything I have been hearing\nfrom manufacturers tells me that the demand for such programs will\nonly grow. Let’s look for more opportunities to support these training\nprograms.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130926.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:32 PM]\n\n\fEducation Never Goes Out of Style :: September 26, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nI also want to put a plug in for support of early childhood education.\nEconomists have found that children enrolled in pre-kindergarten\nprograms are more likely to graduate high school, get a job, and pay\ntaxes. Early childhood development iseconomic development, and it\nis economic development with a very high public return.\nTaking these steps to improve educational attainment is easier said\nthan done. And it is especially difficult when cultural barriers to\nhigher education exist. Consider this: Nationally, one survey found\nthat about 80 percent of students whose parents have a college\ndegree enroll in college immediately after they graduate high school.\nBut for those whose parents did not attend college, the percentage\ndrops dramatically to about 50 percent. Other recent surveys have\nfound gaps just as large. That is a cultural problem—too many kids\ngrow up not knowing about the opportunities that college can afford\nthem.\nThese statistics make it clear that we have a big challenge on our\nhands in Greater Cleveland because the majority of the region’s\nparents are not college graduates. That means that without some\ntype of intervention, their children are unlikely to attend college,\nand this cycle is likely to continue.\nBut I am here to tell you that the cycle can be broken. In fact, I am\nthe poster child for first-generation college students. My parents had\nthe opportunity to attend school only through the fifth grade in Italy.\nThey moved our family from Italy to Akron when I was 5 years old\nbecause they knew that their children would have better educational\nopportunities in America. Even then, it was not a given that I would\ngo to college—good Italian girls at that time often did not earn much\nmore than a high school degree, and they certainly did not move\naway from home at age 18 to go to college! But I was fortunate to\nhave support from my family and I had the University of Akron in my\nbackyard. I enrolled right after high school, majored in economics,\nand never looked back.\nSo cultural barriers to higher education don’t scare me, but I realize\nthey are very real. I think our approach should be to instill positive\nideas about college in our children from an early age. I think about\nmy nieces and nephews and how from the time they were in\nkindergarten, their parents started talking to them about college. It\nwas just assumed that they would go! Today, I have a niece who is a\nClemson Tiger, a nephew who is a Dayton Flyer, and another niece\nwho is following in my footsteps as an Akron Zip! The remaining seven\nare still deciding which college to attend, and our family has fun\nlearning about and talking about different colleges. But that is just\nnot the experience for so many children in inner-city Cleveland.\nCultural change definitely starts at home. It did in mine. But\ninstitutions can play a role, too. In a new program, students who\ngraduate from Akron Public Schools with a 3.0 GPA or who meet\nother academic requirements can receive scholarships to the\nUniversity of Akron.1 The University of Pittsburgh’s medical center,\nUPMC, is doing something similar with its Promise program to\nsubsidize college tuition for Pittsburgh city students.2 These\ninstitutional-level steps eventually trickle down to the household\nlevel. Parents come to understand that their children will have\nopportunities if they are ready for them. It can become part of the\ncultural fabric for families of all socioeconomic backgrounds to talk\nto their kids about going to college beginning in early childhood.\nLet’s help foster this cycle by seeking more institutional\narrangements that can change our cultural attitudes about college. I\nam talking about helping to steer kids down the right path, and\ninforming them of the possibilities, from the time they are toddlers\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130926.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:32 PM]\n\n\fEducation Never Goes Out of Style :: September 26, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nuntil they are teenagers. Over time, that is the way we can best\nprepare our young people for college, and over time, that is the way\nwe will build a more diverse, innovative workforce, right here in\nNortheast Ohio.\nI would like to close on a somewhat personal note. I plan to retire as\npresident and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland early\nnext year. Among other factors, I have decided that I would like to\ndevote more time to my civic and non-profit activities here in the\nregion. I am especially looking forward to doing more work with\nCollege Now and focusing on improving the educational attainment of\nthe residents of Northeast Ohio.\nAs I have noted, I have been extremely fortunate in my upbringing\nand in my career. I have been afforded so many opportunities and\nencouragement from so many people. I do not take any of them for\ngranted. I would not be up here today without the help of countless\nothers, which is why it is so important to me to stay involved in the\ncommunity.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke perfectly captured my\nfeelings on this topic in a recent speech to Princeton’s graduating\nclass: He said that those of us who have been luckiest in health,\ncareers, and family support—and I’ll quote him directly here--“have\nthe greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the\nbetterment of the world, and to share their luck with others.”\nYou would not be here today if you did not agree with that\nsentiment. Whether you are volunteering in the classroom, donating\nyour time to a school fundraiser, or even purposely overpaying for a\ngreat handbag today—you are doing your part. College Now as an\norganization would not exist if not for efforts like these, large and\nsmall. These contributions add up.\nEducation is an investment in human capital that ultimately makes\nour region’s workforce more valuable in the highly competitive global\neconomy. It is one of the most effective ways to better ourselves,\nand our neighborhoods.\nBut there are no quick fixes. It is relatively easy to identify gaps in\nour region’s education strategies; the difficulty lies in developing and\nimplementing solutions that will be far-reaching and long-lasting.\nTackling these issues will take extraordinary commitment, patience,\nand endurance. I hope you will join me on the front lines. Know that\nthe objective of helping students prepare for and graduate from\ncollege is not only admirable, but essential. Higher educational\nattainment offers both financial and social benefits. It can change\npeople’s lives and the direction of entire communities—both today\nand in future generations. It certainly changed my life.\n1. UA deal will generate $13.5 million in scholarships for APS\nstudents.\n2.

I would like to\nthank our hosts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for once again\nmaking us all feel so welcome. I am speaking today in my role as\nchair of the Federal Reserve’s Financial Services Policy Committee,\nwhich is responsible for directing the financial services operations of\nthe Federal Reserve Banks. The committee also provides Federal\nReserve Bank leadership for the evolving US payments system.\nI don’t have to tell you that this is an exciting time to be involved in\npayments. New technologies are expanding possibilities in ways that\nseemed unimaginable only a decade ago. Over the next two days, you\nwill discuss many of these possibilities, and in the process help\ninfluence the course of our work in the years to come.\nToday I am going to report on the gaps and opportunities the Federal\nReserve Banks have identified as we have charted our strategic\ndirection for financial services. I will then focus on the potential for\npursuing a near-real-time retail payments system in this country. I\nwill conclude with some thoughts on how industry collaboration can\ndrive meaningful changes in the payments system.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank o f Cleveland\nPayments Symposium\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nSeptember 24, 2013\nCleveland Fed President Pianalto\nhighlights “Payment System\nImprovement - Public Consultation\nPaper” in remarks to the Payments\nSymposium at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Chicago.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has always kept a focus on the integrity,\nefficiency and accessibility of payments in the United States. We\nhave largely pursued this mission in the context of our function as an\noperator in the interbank market. Last October, I spoke at this\nconference about the Federal Reserve Banks’ strategic direction in\npayments. At the heart of the strategy is a vision to improve the endto-end speed, efficiency, and safety of the US payments system over\nthe next decade. By end-to-end, I mean more than just interactions\nbetween banks; I mean from the point of payment origination to the\npoint of receipt.\nIn the past year we at the Federal Reserve Banks completed an\nanalysis of the gaps and opportunities in the US payments system to\nunderstand key areas where the system could be enhanced. Some of\nthat analysis shaped the content of this conference agenda, as well\nas the Payment System Improvement - Public Consultation Paper1\nthat was released two weeks ago and made available to all of you.\nThe purpose of the Consultation Paper is to solicit broad, cross­\nindustry input on the challenges facing the payments system and to\nidentify possible next steps.\nThe gaps and opportunities we identified as we have pursued our\nstrategic direction for financial services should come as no surprise;\nthey are well known. First, there is still too much paper. While the\nshare of check payments in the US has been declining for many years,\nit still represents almost 20 percent of all non-cash retail\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130924.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:50 PM]\n\n\fIn Pursuit of a Better Payments System :: September 24, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ntransactions, or 60 million transactions per day. America’s payments\nsystem is costlier as a result.\nNext, we have not seen enough improvement in cross-border\npayments. Major drivers of cross-border payments are business-tobusiness transactions and remittances. The growth in cross-border\nbusiness-to-business transactions is reflected in the value of imports\nand exports in the US economy, which has risen by 40 percent to\n$4.2 trillion a year over the past decade. The value of remittance\nflows to developing countries has tripled to $351 billion annually over\nthe same period. Yet the options for cross-border payments have not\nkept pace. Opportunities exist for improving the cost-effectiveness,\ntimeliness, and convenience of cross-border payments.\nOn the domestic front, the United States lacks a universal, near-real­\ntime retail payments option for consumers and businesses. Cash and\ndebit cards are the closest thing to it, but both fall short of fully\nsatisfying business and consumer needs. We have heard from\npayments stakeholders that there is demand for a better system. At\nthe same time, we are mindful of lessons learned in other countries\nthat implementing a faster payments solution requires years of hard\nwork.\nAs always, we are keeping a focus on safety and security. New ways\nof making payments and accessing bank accounts create new\nvulnerabilities. We must stay a step ahead of fraud schemes and\ncyber threats. Preserving public confidence in the payments system\nis core to our mission and requires the collective efforts of everyone\nin the industry.\nOver the next two days, you will have an opportunity to share your\ninsights on key challenges facing the US payments system. These\nchallenges include the migration to electronics, the development of\nindustry standards, and the need to raise levels of efficiency,\nsecurity, and speed. Right now, I would like to specifically address\nthe issue of payment speed.\nWe can ask ourselves, “How will most payments be made in the US 20\nyears from now?” I think the more appropriate question is, “How\nshould most payments be made?” Our vision is that most payments\nwill be executed in real time. This would mean that any consumer or\nbusiness would be able to make an immediate payment to anyone,\nelectronically and conveniently; the sender of the payment could\ninitiate the transaction even without having the receiver’s account\ninformation; most payments would be accompanied by confirmation\nof good funds and timely notification to both parties that the\ntransaction had been made; and the automated payment instruction\nwould accommodate additional information, such as invoice details,\nto ease reconcilement.\nIt is pretty clear that future generations will not use paper checks. In\nfact, I would add that Millennials as a group are not currently using\nchecks to any material degree. Future generations will also rely less\nthan we do on cash, although I hasten to add that cash will remain\nwidely used and widely accepted. Future generations will expect that\nany payment they initiate, whether online, mobile, or at point-ofsale, will be executed immediately. They will gravitate to financial\ninstitutions and other providers that offer this level of service.\nThis vision of the future reflects the imperatives of the present. Our\nconversations with industry participants over the past year have\nunderlined that they find many characteristics of near-real-time\nretail payments desirable. They see pursuit of a faster payments\nsystem as an opportunity, one that involves some risks and that\nrequires industry collaboration.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130924.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:50 PM]\n\n\fIn Pursuit of a Better Payments System :: September 24, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBusinesses and consumers alike have expressed interest in the ability\nto make last-minute payments of all types. Businesses and\ngovernments are drawn to the potential for enhanced cash\nmanagement afforded by quicker confirmation of good funds. Real­\ntime transactions could reduce fraud losses for banks and businesses.\nFor consumers, a faster and more convenient electronic payments\nmechanism would be an attractive alternative to checks. As it stands,\nmany consumers today believe that their payments are real-time.\nMost businesses know all too well that this is not the case.\nThe Federal Reserve is not alone in recognizing the opportunities of\nuniversal near-real-time retail payments. In the past few years, a\nnumber of providers have introduced networks with features\nresembling real-time payments. These networks work well when both\nthe payer and the payee are members. But it is difficult for a\nparticipant in such a system to send money to a receiver who is not a\nmember. These networks generally do not efficiently or quickly pass\ntransactions to one another or into the mainstream payments\nsystems. These emerging networks suggest the right course. But they\nlack the end-to-end speed and universal access needed for an\nefficient payments mechanism that will meet end-user expectations\nin the future.\n“Faster” alone is not a solution, nor is it a stopping point. A faster\npayment method that is not convenient and accessible to end users\ndoes not achieve the goal. We seek a solution that better serves the\nend user and those of us who facilitate transactions for them. A\nfaster payments solution must be built on standards that preserve\nopportunities to offer unique services in the market while ensuring\ninteroperability across the industry.\nUniversal access is necessary to achieve the greatest benefit. This has\nbeen the case for check, ACH2, and wire transfers. The benefit of\neach of these payment instruments multiplied as they became more\nwidely accepted and used. Over many years, these systems have\nevolved to nearly universal access.\nWe know a near-real-time payments system is possible because a\nnumber of other countries have implemented or are in the process of\nimplementing one. The UK introduced its system, the Faster\nPayments Service, in 2008. This service demonstrates that it is\npossible to accelerate end-to-end delivery of individual payments\nfrom the next day to no more than a few seconds or minutes.\nConsumers, businesses, and government entities make use of the\nservice for both ad hoc and scheduled payments.\nThe UK’s Faster Payments Service is growing and evolving. In the past\nyear, its traffic has grown to about 5 percent of all non-cash retail\npayments volume in the United Kingdom. Financial institutions have\nadded phone-initiated and file-initiated transaction features to what\nbegan as an online-only service. In 2014, the Service will make new\nfeatures available to participating banks, including mobile\napplications that enable bill payments and payments at point-of-sale.\nThe UK Payments Council is working on a 2014 initiative that would\nliberate payment originators from having to know the bank account\nnumber of their counterparties. Instead, the mobile phone number of\nthe receiver will be substituted.\nThere are other faster payment systems in various stages of\nimplementation or planning in Australia, Singapore, Poland, and\nMexico, among other nations. A lengthy collaboration effort was\nneeded in all of these countries to bring faster payments from idea to\nimplementation. These efforts involved financial institutions,\nprocessors, network providers, vendors, national payment authorities,\nand central banks.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130924.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:50 PM]\n\n\fIn Pursuit of a Better Payments System :: September 24, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nYou will hear about some of these initiatives at this conference. You\nwill have an opportunity to consider lessons learned from these\nexperiences and where our unique needs require different paths and\nsolutions.\nLet me also acknowledge that the pursuit of near-real-time payments\nin the United States is not a given. We are in the early stages of\nthinking about such a solution for this country. There are many\nchallenges to consider before pursuing a near-real-time retail\npayments system in the US.\nFirst, the strength and nature of demand for the service is unclear. In\ntoday’s US payments system, there are concrete examples of demand\nfor faster retail payments, such as expedited bill payments and cross­\nborder remittances. But the examples remain anecdotal and episodic,\nin part because there is no existing infrastructure for universal faster\nretail payments. That is why the Federal Reserve is looking at the\navailable research and undertaking efforts to get a clearer picture of\nend-user needs.\nAnother potential challenge is the lack of a definitive business case\nacross the supply chain for near-real-time retail payments. But this is\nnot an insurmountable obstacle. If we look back over the last few\ndecades, universal payments systems that we now take for granted\ndid not have clear evidence of demand, business cases, or\ninfrastructure plans at this stage of development.\nThe development of electronic payments in the 1960s provides an\ninstructive example. At that point in history, the organizations that\nare today identified as the founders of the credit card system, ATM\nnetworks, and the ACH, were awash in paper and costly branch\nsystems. To address their seemingly unsustainable back-office\nsituations, they turned to what was then state-of-the-art 1960s\ncomputer technology. They had no clear multi-decade vision for the\nUS payments system in mind. However, over time, they created the\nnation’s retail electronic payments systems - the ACH, credit card,\nand debit card systems.\nLet me draw a parallel to the topic at hand. When many of us in this\nroom think about the business case for faster payments, we give\ngreat weight to the possibility of eliminating costly paper checks. So\nwe are motivated by the potential for cost savings, much like the\nmotivation that the founders of electronic payments had in the 1960s\nwhen they embarked on their efforts. The investment decisions they\nmade in the 1960s and 1970s did in fact provide cost savings, but\nthere were additional benefits. These benefits included unforeseen\ncost savings, and new products and revenue streams for the financial\nsector. The new electronic payment channels created their own\ndemand. That is why when I hear people argue that the demand for\nnear-real-time payments is unclear, I counter that they may very well\nbe underestimating the demand for a potentially groundbreaking new\nservice.\nHere is the point: Overall, I see more opportunities than challenges\nin pursuing a near-real-time payments system.\nI am in favor of seizing those opportunities. But I recognize that\nwhether we pursue near-real-time retail payments or not, the only\nway we will make an informed decision is by investigating the issues\ntogether. At a glance, this collective approach might seem contrary\nto the thrust of history. Innovation in the US payments system has\nmainly been driven by the individual, entrepreneurial activity of\nbanks, vendors, processors, and nonbank service providers. They\nrespond to customer demand in a fiercely competitive environment.\nIt is safe to say that American businesses and consumers derive great\nbenefit from this competition in the form of diverse options and\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130924.cfm[4/29/2014 1:17:50 PM]\n\n\fIn Pursuit of a Better Payments System :: September 24, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nlower costs.\nThere have been times, however, when individual action on the part\nof banks, vendors, and nonbank service providers was not sufficient\nto move the payments system forward. Collective action was needed\nto implement MICR technology; to establish the ACH, card and ATM\nnetworks; and to implement Check 213. Collaboration will be\nnecessary to continue to improve the US payments system.\nToday at this conference, we continue our dialogue with the industry\nto understand your views. We are interested in your thoughts on the\nquestions raised in the Consultation Paper. We are interested in\nknowing your views on the benefits and costs of addressing gaps and\nopportunities, the technical and operational impacts of potential\nsolutions, and the associated safety and settlement issues. Speak up\nand speak openly during this conference; and then please take time\nto go back and submit your organization’s written response to the\nquestions posed in the paper. Your input will influence the Federal\nReserve’s strategy. We look forward to working with you to explore\nthe best ideas for improving the nation’s payments system.\nI want to conclude on a personal note. As many of you know, I am\nretiring early next year as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland. So I will not be back here in 2014 to report on our\nprogress. I leave the next steps in the capable hands of Federal\nReserve leaders who have guided our payments strategy for years and\ndeveloped the vision in the Consultation Paper.\nIt has been a privilege to chair the Financial Services Policy\nCommittee for the past four years. During that time and throughout\nmy 30 years at the Federal Reserve, I have worked with many\ntalented individuals and organizations, and I have observed the gains\nthat can be achieved through collaboration. To succeed, we must\ncontinue to engage and find ways to leverage our collective strengths\nand resources.\nWe have done it before and I know we will do it again. I am\nconfident that a year from now my colleagues will have exciting news\nto share. Thank you.\n1. Paper available at http://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/\n2.

Ohio\n\nSeptember 19, 2013\n\nSome of you may know that I am retiring early next year. so I will\nnot be here as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at\nthe next Policy Summit. I would like to use this occasion to reflect on\nsome of the lessons I have learned during my service, particularly as\nthey relate to topics you will be discussing over the next two days.\nOver the past 10 years as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland--and really. over my past three decades in the Federal\nReserve System--I have come to appreciate the virtues of cooperation\nand finding shared ground. Around the Federal Open Market\nCommittee table. where monetary policy is set for this country. I\nhave seen first-hand the importance of looking at issues from\ndifferent perspectives and building consensus around new\napproaches. There were times during the thick of the financial crisis\nwhen the stakes were high and difficult decisions needed to be made\nquickly. Under the leadership of Chairman Ben Bernanke. my\ncolleagues and I came together to initiate swift and aggressive\nresponses. often using unconventional and innovative tools. I think it\nis widely acknowledged that the Federal Reserve's actions helped\nprevent an even bigger crisis. and put the nation’s economy on a\npath to recovery. We would not have been able to accomplish what\nwe did without being open to different points of view. being willing\nto put new ideas into practice. and recognizing that we each wanted\nto do what was best for our country.\nToday. I want to discuss the importance of building consensus around\nnew approaches to overcoming the challenges we face in modernizing\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130919.cfm[4/29/2014 1:18:27 PM]\n\n\fLooking for Common Ground and New Solutions in Household and Consumer Finance :: September 19, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nhousing and consumer finance policies. I will begin by providing a\nsnapshot of today's financial services landscape. Then I will highlight\nseveral recent cases where people with different perspectives are\nreaching agreement on solutions to some stubborn housing problems.\nI will conclude by suggesting a common effort where an open-minded\napproach might be especially valuable. As always, the views I express\ntoday are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIt is no exaggeration to say the financial crisis was a game-changer.\nThe market failures were vast and well-documented, particularly in\nthe housing finance marketplace. In response to the crisis, Congress\npassed sweeping legislation to govern the financial services industry,\nchiefly through the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.\nThe impact of Dodd Frank and other legislation motivated by the\ncrisis provides the backdrop for many topics at this Policy Summit.\nFor example, Dodd Frank established an entirely new agency, the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, to regulate financial\nproducts. Among the Bureau’s new rules is a measure aimed at\nmaking qualified mortgage loans safer for borrowers. Additional\nregulations on mortgages and other products are designed to promote\nthe stability of the entire financial system. And soon, Congress will\nbe debating serious proposals for reforming the governmentsponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nIn some ways, the response to the financial crisis has reinforced longheld views about the role of government in the financial system.\nThose who favor stronger regulations see the response as appropriate\nto ensure that markets operate fairly for everyone, and at the same\ntime, are more stable. Those who favor a limited role for\ngovernment see the response as likely to distort markets, hamper\ncredit availability, and substitute the government’s judgment for\ndecisions that should be made in free markets.\nEmotions still run strong. Consumers' distrust of the financial services\nindustry is high--only one in four Americans say they have a positive\nview of the banking system. Meanwhile, many in the financial\nservices sector contend that some regulations have been excessive,\nand may block some people from access to credit and services that\nthey want, and that they can use responsibly. The challenge now is\nfor the financial services industry and the communities and\nconsumers it serves to move past their entrenched positions and\ninstead work together to find new solutions.\nI am optimistic about the possibilities for agreement on new solutions\nin consumer finance and housing policies because I have seen people\nwith different viewpoints come together to enact policies with\nsubstantial benefit.\nMy optimism stems from observations I have made close to home. As\neveryone in this room knows, this region has a long-standing problem\nwith vacant and abandoned properties—and this problem was\nexacerbated by the foreclosure crisis. Empty homes are magnets for\ncrime and they contribute to neighborhood blight. They can be\neyesores that bring down nearby property values.\nFor a long time, the response to vacancy and abandonment was\nsimple: rehabilitation. This strategy was based on the principle that\nindividual blocks of homes could be stabilized through rehabilitation\nof select vacant properties, with the side benefit that historically\nsignificant houses would be saved.\nResearch by the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank pointed toward the\npossibility of an additional approach1. We found that property values\nin some of our older, industrial communities are primarily determined\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130919.cfm[4/29/2014 1:18:27 PM]\n\n\fLooking for Common Ground and New Solutions in Household and Consumer Finance :: September 19, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nby the desirability of the land underneath the structures. It is not the\nhouse itself that has value--it is the land the house stands on. This\nled us to the counterintuitive concept that the best policy to\nstabilize neighborhoods may not always be rehabilitation--it may be\ndemolition.\nI think it is natural that many people reacted negatively to this idea\nat first. But the strategy has gained currency over the years, and\ngroups that initially were opposed to any program that would tear\ndown homes rather than try to save them slowly changed their\nminds. In part, this shift happened because of complementary\nresearch that showed how demolitions might work in tandem with\nother measures to deal with distressed housing. This multipronged\neffort promised to work to the advantage of all stakeholders-homeowners, bankers, and communities at large.\nLand banking is my Exhibit A. Our research strongly suggested that in\nmany communities with weak housing markets, there was an\noversupply of housing. This specific situation would not be helped by\none-size-fits-all policies; it demanded tailored policy support.\nCuyahoga County’s pioneering land bank is showing us the right way\nto do it. The land bank is an entity equipped to acquire distressed\nproperties, clear title defects, and either rehabilitate or demolish\nstructures. This flexibility enables the land bank to make decisions\nthat specifically address the conditions of individual neighborhoods.2\nIf you recall, it was not so many years ago that people in both the\nfinancial services industry and public sectors were resistant to the\nidea of land banking. Financial institutions were initially wary of the\nimpact of land banks on their bottom lines, and community leaders\nwere initially suspicious that land banks would undercut\nneighborhood revitalization efforts. Yet today, land banks enjoy\nbroad and well-deserved support. The positive impact that land\nbanks can have is evident all over Cuyahoga County. A great\nillustration of this is happening in East Cleveland, where the county\nland bank acquired two vacant, condemned apartment buildings,\ncleared their titles, and demolished them to make way for two new,\nmodern apartment buildings. The vision is that residents of these new\nunits will have easy access to the bustling nearby University Circle\ndevelopment.\nLet me give you another example of building consensus on innovative\nhousing policy. We at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland recently\nhave developed what we think are useful ideas for streamlining\nOhio’s foreclosure process. Over the past year, we traveled across\nthe state to discuss policy options that we believe could enhance\nforeclosure outcomes.\nMany community groups have been skeptical of proposals that would\nspeed up the foreclosure process because of their concern that some\nborrowers would be unfairly removed from their homes. But we have\nactually found that for many, “removed” is the wrong term. It turns\nout that approximately a quarter of borrowers leave their homes\nbefore the initiation of foreclosure by the lender, which further\nextends the length of time properties remain vacant.\nThe overwhelming conclusion of our research was that it takes too\nlong for loans on abandoned properties to go from delinquency\nthrough foreclosure in Ohio. In fact, plans to protect homeowners\nwho have already left their homes could unintentionally create costs\nto entire communities. These costs include physical damage to\nproperties and downward pressure on the value of neighboring\nhomes. We discovered that many affordable housing advocates,\nhousing lenders, and municipal officials agreed with our ideas. Today,\nseveral proposals are being considered at the state level that would\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130919.cfm[4/29/2014 1:18:27 PM]\n\n\fLooking for Common Ground and New Solutions in Household and Consumer Finance :: September 19, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\naccelerate the foreclosure process. The headway we have made is a\ntribute to the willingness of people to reconsider long-held beliefs\nwhen presented with new policy options based on new information.\nLand banks and accelerating the foreclosure process on abandoned\nhomes are efforts that I would already put in the win column. On the\nhorizon, I see another challenge that seems ripe for progress: finding\nnew approaches to improve access to affordable rental housing\nprograms.\nThe first obstacle to overcome in this area is shedding outdated\nnotions about the homeownership society. The financial crisis taught\nus that homeownership is not for everyone. For many people, renting\nis the better choice. This shift in attitude could be particularly\nbeneficial for low-income households.\nWe also know that there are some shortcomings in existing rental\nprograms for low-income households. For too many families, finding\naffordable rental properties in desirable neighborhoods remains\ndifficult.\nAs those of you who regularly deal with affordable housing policy\nknow, there are two major rental programs for low-income\nhouseholds. The Housing Choice Voucher is primarily a tenant-based\nprogram that lets people choose where they want to live, while the\nLow Income Housing Tax Credit is a place-based program that\nsubsidizes the rent on some units in housing developments, making\nthem more affordable for renters. Individually, the programs have\ntheir own specific strengths and drawbacks. The programs operate\nunder completely different rules and are administered independently\nof one another.\nThe tenant-based voucher program, which is targeted primarily at\npeople with very low incomes, offers the most freedom of choice;\nafter all, renters should be able to choose the housing location they\nbelieve will most improve their quality of life. Nevertheless, research\nshows that families who use vouchers often do not experience a\nbetter quality of life or financial situation. Too frequently, they\ncannot find, or do not select, apartments in neighborhoods with\nbetter schools, for example, or places where their job prospects\nwould be brighter.\nMeanwhile, the tax credit program would seem to be a smart way to\nmake housing units available in places that offer attractive amenities\nto their residents, and thereby contribute to their residents'\neconomic well-being. Yet research suggests that tax-credit housing\nprograms have a mixed record. Too frequently, they result in\nsubsidized buildings being located in neighborhoods with\nunderperforming schools, or with limited access to jobs and health\ncare. In addition, depending on local market conditions, rents in\nthese buildings may be close to the market rates and not affordable\nfor poor households.\nThose who support affordable rental housing programs should want to\nachieve the same results; namely, clean homes in safer\nneighborhoods that give tenants better access to good schools, health\ncare, and jobs. So what can be done?\nThe basic problem we face is that there is a far greater need for\naffordable rental housing than there is public money being provided.\nWith limited resources, it is critical to look for ways to enhance the\nflexibility of agencies to administer their funds, and allow the two\nprograms to work more effectively together.\nLet me give you an example of an approach at HUD3 that fosters\npartnerships at the federal level. HUD has been conducting a\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130919.cfm[4/29/2014 1:18:27 PM]\n\n\fLooking for Common Ground and New Solutions in Household and Consumer Finance :: September 19, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ndemonstration program with select public housing authorities across\nthe country. The program provides the flexibility to combine funds\nfrom several different programs so they can be used like \"block\ngrants,\" allowing for more experimentation toward the goal of\nneighborhood stability. One of the benefits of this approach has\nbeen the ability to leverage HUD funds with tax credit projects at the\nlocal level to meet community needs. States have the same\nopportunity with their tax credit programs. We should encourage\nmore new approaches like this.\nI know practitioners operate under significant restraints on what they\nare allowed to do and what they can spend. But in the end, wider\naccess to affordable rental housing by families in need is not just a\nmatter of increasing the resources available; it is about finding\ncreative ways for the nation’s affordable rental housing programs to\nwork better and more efficiently together. Let’s keep our eye on the\nbroader goal. We want people to live in neighborhoods with high caliber schools, safer streets, and better employment opportunities. I\nam confident we can find solutions to achieve this objective.\nI have just cited three examples in the housing market--land banking,\nexpedited foreclosures, and affordable rental housing--where\ncooperation around new ideas promises to make a positive\ndifference, or where such an approach already has made a\ndifference. Let me conclude by suggesting how openness to new\nideas can help consumers make better financial choices. Success here\ncould have a lasting impact on the housing market and the overall\neconomy.\nWe now recognize that vulnerable, under-informed consumers\nsometimes make decisions that don’t serve them well. And no\nwonder. The financial marketplace is incredibly complex. People do\nnot always understand the obligations they are taking on when they\nuse certain services or buy certain products.\nIn this environment, certain regulatory protections and oversight are\nlikely to be very helpful to many consumers. That said, and as I have\nnoted, there are some who fear that regulatory overstep could\nactually hurt consumers by limiting their access to potentially\nbeneficial services. Here, I think all parties--consumers, financial\ninstitutions, and regulators--have an opportunity to achieve our\nindividual objectives by working through ideas old and new with a\ncommon purpose.\nThe better informed consumers are about financial products and\nhousehold budgeting, the better their financial decisions will be.\nConsumers should be protected from predatory practices, but they\nshould also be informed enough to recognize what services could be\nfinancially harmful to them. They need to understand the importance\nof saving so that they are not forced to go outside of conventional\nfinancial services into higher-cost, riskier alternatives. For a long\ntime, we have agreed that there is no substitute for a betterinformed consumer.\nBut there are some thought-provoking implications of new research\nthat I also want to emphasize. Making good financial decisions is not\njust about providing information and teaching people about financial\nand legal contracts--it is also about understanding the context in\nwhich financial decisions are made. Tomorrow at this conference, the\nclosing session will focus on consumer protection in the new\nregulatory environment, and the Princeton University psychologist\nEldar Shafir will deliver an address on how consumers actually make\nfinancial decisions. The closing session and the address will feature\nthe application of behavioral research to policy. Opt-in and opt-out\nstrategies figure prominently in the applications favored by Shafir\nand others in the realm of behavioral economics. Achieving this kind\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130919.cfm[4/29/2014 1:18:27 PM]\n\n\fLooking for Common Ground and New Solutions in Household and Consumer Finance :: September 19, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nof financial literacy has elements of corporate responsibility as well\nas personal responsibility.\nFinancial institutions have it in their power to get in front of this\ntrend by offering more products with built-in features that are likely\nto benefit consumers-- features like automatic opt-ins for savings\nplans when funds from checking accounts are periodically swept into\ncustomers’ savings accounts. There is no need to wait for regulators\nto require such behavioral features. And consumer groups should see\nthis as an opportunity to help the financial services industry\nunderstand what sort of product designs are most likely to be\neffective. A little imagination and collaboration could go a long way\ntoward a financial marketplace with fair play, more financially\nresilient households, and profitable financial institutions.\nLet me step back here as I wrap up my remarks and offer a bit of\nperspective. I realize that my talk today is unlikely to set the\nnewswires on fire: “Federal Reserve Policymaker Calls\nfor....Innovation and Cooperation!” I have read more exciting\nheadlines, to be sure. But I am not interested in capturing headlines.\nI am interested in sharing my experience as president of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, which has instilled in me the importance\nof consensus-building around new and different perspectives.\nToo often today, standoffs are the norm. People want to solve\nproblems, but they are unwilling to consider opposing or new\nviewpoints. This gridlock benefits no one. Thinking beyond our\nimmediate interests is not easy. But the way forward does not have\nto be a zero-sum game where only one side wins and the other side\nloses. We have seen the opportunities for win-win solutions with\nhousing policy and we could see the same with many of the areas\nunder discussion at this conference--such as small business lending\nand most certainly consumer finance. By keeping an open mind to\ndifferent views and new ideas, we might surprise ourselves with how\nmuch we can accomplish. We have seen it right here in Cleveland\nwith the evolution of views on land banks and demolition. I am\nconfident we can see it in any number of future policy proposals.\nIn the meantime, let’s join together to strengthen the financial\ncapability of our citizens. The Federal Reserve is ready, willing, and\nable to partner with you. Thank you. I look forward to hearing your\nideas and I hope you find the next two days informative and\ninspirational.\n1.

Like the Center for Community Solutions, my Bank\nconducts research to inform policy actions that will benefit our\narea’s residents. And, as a member of the Federal Reserve’s Federal\nOpen Market Committee, or FOMC, I take the results of my Bank’s\nresearch, as well as information from our interactions with\ncommunity leaders, businesspeople, and others in this area, and I\nbring those perspectives to the national level as I help formulate our\nnation’s monetary policy. So I truly value opportunities like this one,\nto discuss issues that are important to the future economic growth\nand development of Northeast Ohio. In addition, as a former United\nWay board chair, I am very supportive of the partnership between\nUnited Way and the Center for Community Solutions; it’s another link\nin the chain that connects all of us who are working to improve the\nquality of life for our neighbors.\nI was very interested to see that the July issue of the Center for\nCommunity Solutions’ “Common Ground” publication discussed labor\nforce participation, unemployment, and educational attainment in\nCuyahoga County. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland has been\nlooking at these very same issues affecting labor markets locally and\nnationally. In fact, labor markets remain the most troublesome\naspect of the weak economic recovery. Unemployment is still too\nhigh and has been that way for too long. And too many people have\nbeen suffering lengthy durations of unemployment, to the point\nwhere our labor markets may be sustaining long-run damage.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130807.cfm[4/29/2014 1:31:45 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Outlook: What Matters Nationally and Locally :: August 7, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSo in my comments today, I will describe the labor market recovery\nwe are experiencing nationally and in Northeast Ohio. Then, because\nI am especially concerned about developments in Northeast Ohio, I\nwill highlight some factors that can lead to long-term economic\nprosperity for our region. As always, the views expressed here are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nLet me start on a positive note. We are four years into a slow\nrecovery, and while it is easy to miss the progress that the economy\nis making, there really has been some progress. In recent months, we\nhave seen clearer signs of a more sustained recovery in the US labor\nmarket. On average over the past year, 187,000 jobs have been\nadded to the economy each month.1 That indicates to me that the\npace of recovery in the labor market has picked up from the prior 12\nmonths, when monthly jobs gains averaged fewer than 100,000. The\nunemployment rate has declined since last fall from about 8 percent\nthen to 7.4 percent today. I take these recent improvements in the\nlabor market as evidence that the economy is on firmer footing.\nEven so, we still have a way to go before the labor market is fully\nrecovered. As a country, we have about 2 million fewer people\nworking today than were working at the start of the Great Recession\nin December 2007, and the labor force has continued to grow. That\nleaves 11.5 million Americans unemployed—and in addition, we have\nmore than 8 million people who are underemployed. The number of\npeople who have been out of work for more than a year reached an\nall-time high in the recession, and it still stands at 3.1 million. This is\nparticularly worrisome because the longer people are without work,\nthe more their skills atrophy.\nIn this challenging economic environment, the Federal Reserve has\nbeen taking unprecedented actions to support the economy. The\nFOMC’s goals, which were set by the US Congress, are to promote\nmaximum employment and price stability-these are referred to as\nthe “dual mandate.” This means the FOMC wants as many Americans\nas possible who want jobs to have jobs. At the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Cleveland, we estimate that maximum employment will be\nreached when the unemployment rate is 6 percent. The FOMC also\naims to keep inflation low and stable and has established 2 percent\nas our inflation objective over the longer term.\nRight now, with unemployment at 7.4 percent and inflation at 1.3\npercent, it is clear that the economy remains well short of maximum\nemployment and that inflation is below our objective.2 Under these\nconditions, a highly accommodative monetary policy remains\nappropriate.\nLast fall, the FOMC initiated a third round of asset purchases. In this\nprogram, which is often referred to as “QE3,” we are purchasing $85\nbillion of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities per\nmonth. This policy was designed to drive some near-term momentum\nin the economy with the specific goal of achieving a substantial\nimprovement in the outlook for the labor market.\nLabor market data comes in every month and is subject to different\ninterpretations. In my view, there has been meaningful improvement\nin both current labor market conditions and in the outlook for the\nlabor market since the FOMC launched the current asset purchase\nprogram. Employment growth has been stronger than I was\nexpecting, and the unemployment rate today is more than half a\npercent lower than I projected it to be last September.\nIn light of this progress, and if the labor market remains on the\nstronger path that it has followed since last fall, then I would be\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130807.cfm[4/29/2014 1:31:45 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Outlook: What Matters Nationally and Locally :: August 7, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nprepared to scale back the monthly pace of asset purchases.\nThis is not to say that the labor market is fully recovered; it is not.\nSo even when the asset purchase program is scaled back, the Federal\nReserve will remain committed to supporting employment growth and\nprice stability. The FOMC has said it intends to maintain a high\ndegree of monetary accommodation for a considerable time after the\nasset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.\nWe intend to hold short-term interest rates low to support economic\ngrowth until the economy is closer to full employment, as long as\ninflation stays well behaved. These are, of course, the FOMC’s\nlonger-term objectives for the national economy.\nSo how have we fared here in Northeast Ohio in this recovery? There\nare important distinctions between the short-term progress we are\nseeing in the recovery and the longer-term economic objectives that\nwe should be pursuing. In my 10 years as president of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, I have seen how short-run issues can drag\ninto longer-run problems, and how a preoccupation with the present\ncan sometimes cause us to overlook or disregard actions that would\nbenefit future generations.\nLike other regions, Northeast Ohio lost a lot of jobs in the recession\nand is still trying to recover those lost jobs. But it may surprise you\nto hear that our area actually weathered the Great Recession better\nthan many other parts of the country. The region’s unemployment\nrate has generally remained lower than the national unemployment\nrate during the recovery. The Cleveland metro area unemployment\nrate was about half a percentage point below the national\nunemployment rate as of June 2013.\nThere have been a variety of major hiring efforts announced in our\nregion and—for a change—some of those announcements have been in\nmanufacturing. These announcements, plus the possibility of bringing\nwell-paying manufacturing jobs back to the United States from\noffshore, have helped to brighten attitudes about our region’s future\nprospects.\nIn addition, residents of our region have made progress on a key\nmeasure— per capita income growth, or growth in the average\nincome level of our area’s residents. From the end of the recession,\nthe recovery in per capita personal income growth in the region, and\nin Ohio as a whole, has been above real per capita income growth for\nthe nation.\nThese are all reasons to feel hopeful, but the numbers I have just\ncited do not paint a complete picture of the region’s economic\nprospects. In particular, the numbers neglect some long-run issues\naffecting this region. For instance, the region has about 8 percent\nfewer workers today than it had in 2000. This employment loss is\nlinked closely to the job cuts in manufacturing.\nThe decline in manufacturing employment before the Great Recession\nwas not unique to Northeast Ohio. It occurred throughout the United\nStates. High-technology metropolitan areas like San Jose and San\nFrancisco, California, also suffered large losses in manufacturing\nemployment, as did southern metropolitan areas such as Dallas and\nAtlanta. In other words, the overall US economy took a hit from the\ndecline in manufacturing employment. The difference between\nNortheast Ohio and many other areas of the country reflects two\nfactors: first, manufacturing jobs were a larger share of our\neconomy; and second, our economy did not have strong job growth in\nother sectors outside of manufacturing. So even though\nmanufacturing is currently experiencing a cyclical rebound, it would\nbe risky to rely heavily on the manufacturing sector to provide\nsignificant employment growth in the long run.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130807.cfm[4/29/2014 1:31:45 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Outlook: What Matters Nationally and Locally :: August 7, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNortheast Ohio has underperformed the nation in two other important\nlonger-term trends: population growth and income growth. In the\n1970 census, the Cleveland metro area had the 12th largest\npopulation in the nation; as of 2012, it stands at 29. Also in 1970, the\nCleveland metro area had a per capita income that was about 7\npercent higher than the national average for metropolitan areas. In\nthe most recent income data, 2011, the Cleveland metro area is\nabout 2 percent below the national average. Weak income growth\nmakes the region less attractive to residents and employers, even\nwhen the short-term economic performance is pretty good.\nThis is not to say that no progress has been made. Northeast Ohio has\nmade considerable progress in reinventing our region, but we are still\na “work-in-progress.” In some ways, regions are always under\npressure to reinvent themselves, so there will always be a sense that\nour region is a “work-in-progress.” Here in Northeast Ohio, I believe\nthere are steps we can take and must take to move our region onto a\npath of economic and job growth that is more in line with our\npotential.\nThe economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland have\ngrouped metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, into brain hubs and\nmanufacturing centers.3 Brain hubs are places where you find\nconcentrations of workers in knowledge jobs. A knowledge job relies\non human capital, innovation, and ideas. By comparison,\nmanufacturing centers have high concentrations of workers that\nproduce physical goods. Brain hubs are important because they have\ngenerally seen the largest increases in employment and per capita\nincome since 1980. Manufacturing centers are certainly capable of\ncreating job growth. But in recent decades, regions with the highest\nconcentrations of knowledge workers have grown much faster.\nAs it happens, the country as a whole has become much more tilted\ntoward knowledge jobs.4 In 1990, the ratio of knowledge jobs to\nmanufacturing jobs was about 1-to-1. Today, the ratio has more than\ndoubled to 2.5 knowledge jobs for every one manufacturing job.\nMost of the MSAs in my Federal Reserve District, which covers Ohio,\nwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle\nof West Virginia, are manufacturing centers. However, some cities in\nmy District, such as Columbus and Pittsburgh, are brain hubs, since\nthey have a significantly higher-than-average number of knowledge\njobs to manufacturing jobs. The ratio of knowledge-to-manufacturing\njobs in Pittsburgh is almost 3-to-1, and in Columbus it is 3.7-to-1. In\ncontrast, Cleveland today averages 1.8 knowledge jobs for every\nmanufacturing job. Cleveland has actually lost ground in the number\nof knowledge jobs compared to the number of manufacturing jobs in\nour area since 1990, meaning knowledge jobs are not being created\nfast enough to keep up with the nation as a whole. And it’s not just\nCleveland. All the metro areas in Northeast Ohio have a lower-thanaverage ratio of knowledge jobs to manufacturing jobs.\nWhile we are mostly used to thinking of Pittsburgh as a sports rival, I\nthink there are some valuable lessons Cleveland could learn from\nPittsburgh. In the late 1970s, Pittsburgh was primarily known as the\ncenter of steel manufacturing in the United States. It had a large\nblue-collar workforce, and Pittsburgh was not a metropolitan area\nthat could boast of having a particularly educated workforce. The\nclosing of steel mills in Pittsburgh in the early 1980s represented an\nenormous regional shock. Unemployment in the Pittsburgh area\nremained above 10 percent for three years. It took decades for\nPittsburgh to reinvent itself, but it has, and continues to do so. What\nI find particularly striking about Pittsburgh is how its younger groups\nof workers have become highly educated. Pittsburgh now ranks near\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130807.cfm[4/29/2014 1:31:45 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Outlook: What Matters Nationally and Locally :: August 7, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nthe top of metropolitan areas in the country in the share of young\nworkers with college degrees.5\nThe news here in our area is not all bad: Cleveland has seen\nimprovements in the skills of younger workers. Many are “skilling up”\nto increase their employability. However, to make more progress on\nthe workforce challenges facing Northeast Ohio, we will have to\nencourage our younger citizens to pursue more education at every\nlevel, including four-year college degrees, associate degrees,\ntechnical certificates, and apprenticeships. While college degrees are\na good indicator of future economic growth in a region, not every\nyoung person can gain from pursuing an advanced degree, and so,\nother avenues for building useful skills should be encouraged.\nI do not want to leave the impression that this massive skilling up\nwill mean that we will need to write off entire industries, such as\nmanufacturing. I am certain that manufacturing will have a long\nfuture in Northeast Ohio; but manufacturing is unlikely to drive\nsignificant employment growth for any region of the country and the\noccupations currently being hired in manufacturing require higher\nskills than in years past.\nOver time, regions with skilled labor pools will draw employers who\nneed skilled workers; in turn, more skilled workers are drawn to\nthose areas. Over a period of decades, Pittsburgh successfully\nnavigated the transition from losing manufacturing jobs to becoming\na brain hub. By working to develop a critical mass of highly skilled\nworkers and innovative companies, we can become a brain hub right\nhere in Northeast Ohio.\nWhether we are considering the nation as a whole, or contemplating\nthe future of Northeast Ohio, economic policies are working in both\nshort- and long-run ways to counter one of the harshest periods in\nour nation’s economic history. Here in Northeast Ohio, we are\nkeeping up with the national recovery in the short run, but we still\nneed to do more to ensure our long-term economic prosperity. There\nare no quick fixes, and a long-lasting solution will require great\ncommitment, patience, and endurance. For the past several years, I\nhave been championing the results of a landmark Cleveland Fed\nstudy. It found that regions with higher levels of education and\ninnovation see higher rates of income growth. That is no less true\ntoday than it was when I first said it years ago.\nI encourage you, as leaders who care about our area’s future, to\ncontinue investing in human capital. In doing so, we can ensure that\nour area’s workforce is educated and innovative, and we can attract\nnew companies and good jobs to our area. By focusing on building a\nskilled workforce over the long run, we can make Northeast Ohio a\nregion that is ready and able to meet the opportunities of the\ntwenty-first century.\n1.

It is also a pleasure, and an honor,\nfor the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to sponsor this conference\nwith the Department of the Treasury's Office of Financial Research. I\nwould also like to thank the Federal Reserve Board of Governors'\nOffice of Financial Stability Policy and Research for their support in\nhosting this event. I recognize that we are all here because of our\ncommon interest in, and concern for, preserving the stability of our\nnation's financial system. Partnerships like this among the regulatory\nagencies will enhance our ability to be successful in maintaining\nfinancial stability over the long term.\nAs I thought about my remarks for today, I reflected on the parallels\nbetween the evolution of monetary policy toward greater\ntransparency over the last two decades and the evolution of financial\nstability policy toward greater transparency following the most recent\nfinancial crisis. I cannot help but acknowledge that there are also\nparallels between the loss of credibility that monetary policymakers\nfaced in the 1970s and the situation that financial regulators faced\nfollowing the most recent financial crisis. Both situations triggered a\nprocess of credibility-rebuilding that required greater transparency.\nToday, we all recognize the critical role that transparency has come\nto play in conducting monetary policy. Going forward, transparency\ncan also play a critical role in conducting financial stability policy. In\nthe aftermath of the Great Recession, the Dodd-Frank Act gave\nfinancial regulators greater authority to address issues that could lead\nto financial system instability. Financial regulators and supervisors\nshould use transparency as a means to more effectively identify,\ncommunicate, and mitigate risks to the financial system. In my\nremarks today, I will briefly review the evolution of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee's (FOMC) efforts to increase transparency. I will\nthen discuss how greater transparency can promote financial\nstability, and I will suggest additional steps regulators could take to\nincrease transparency. Of course, the views I express today are my\nown, and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nAs president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and a\nparticipant on the FOMC, I see similarities in how the FOMC has\nimplemented greater transparency in conducting monetary policy,\nand how regulators can utilize greater transparency in conducting\nfinancial stability policy. Specifically, the FOMC has greatly increased\nour communications on two fronts: first, in the information we share\nwith the public about our monetary policy decisions; and second, in\nthe expectations we set for the policy actions that we will take over\ntime and how we expect those actions to affect economic conditions\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank o f Cleveland\nCleveland Fed and OFR Conference\non Financial Stability Analysis\nBoard of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, Washington, D.C\n\nMay 31, 2013\n\nConference Site\n\nPart 1:\n\n0:00 / 9:44\n\nYau\n\n0:00 / 9:25\n\nYou\n\nPart 2:\n\n^> )\n\nPart 3:\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130531 .cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:10 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Stability: Lessons from Monetary Policy :: May 31, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCongress established maximum employment and stable prices as the\ngoals for monetary policy. This dual mandate is not specific;\nhowever, over time, the FOMC has come to recognize that making\nour goals more explicit can help us to achieve those goals. Today,\nthe FOMC states that the longer-run inflation goal most consistent\nwith its price stability mandate is 2 percent. The FOMC also\ncommunicates the central tendency of FOMC participants' estimates\nof the longer-run rate of unemployment that is consistent with\nmaximum employment, which currently ranges from 5.2 to 6 percent.\nIn the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established the statutory objective\nof promoting the financial stability of the United States. This\nmandate is also non-specific; nevertheless, I believe it will become\nmore meaningful if financial regulators make it more explicit over\ntime.\nWhen I joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 30 years ago,\ncentral bankers around the world were close-mouthed about\nmonetary policy actions. Central bankers believed there was limited\npotential benefit and considerable risk to greater transparency. The\nconventional wisdom was that making information about monetary\npolicy actions more transparent risked negative market reaction.\nFurthermore, policymakers believed that making information about\nlikely FOMC policy actions more transparent might limit the\nCommittee's ability to change course if different policy actions\nbecame warranted. In time, however, central bankers recognized the\nimportant role that expectations play in financial markets, and began\nto rely more heavily on forward guidance to improve the\neffectiveness of monetary policy.\nThe FOMC's first effort toward greater transparency came almost 20\nyears ago, in February of 1994. At that time, the FOMC issued a brief,\nfour-sentence post-meeting statement that announced a change in\nmonetary policy, but provided scant details. In the last decade, the\ntrend toward greater transparency accelerated. The FOMC now uses\nseveral communications strategies, ranging from being more precise\nabout the economic conditions we are trying to achieve to explaining\nthe factors that will influence future policy actions.\nOver the past two decades, the evolution of the FOMC's\ncommunications has made our monetary policy more effective by\nproviding more information about the Committee’s future actions.\nFinancial markets adjust more quickly and smoothly to new\ninformation when market participants understand the FOMC's goals\nand likely actions. More transparency has not created significant\nproblems for the FOMC; quite the contrary, more transparency has\nled to more effective monetary policy. For the same reasons, I\nbelieve that providing enhanced information about financial firms and\nclearer expectations for the future actions of financial regulators can\nalso make our financial stability policies more effective.\nI believe we would all agree that the recent financial crisis\ndeveloped, in large part, due to both a lack of information\ntransparency, and a lack of regulatory transparency. By \"information\ntransparency,\" I mean transparency of information about individual\nfirms and the financial system. By \"regulatory transparency,\" I mean\ntransparency related to the actions of regulators. Regulators play an\nimportant role in promoting both information and regulatory\ntransparency. Information transparency should reveal the risks in\nfinancial firms and markets, and regulatory transparency should\ncommunicate how supervisors will respond to situations that threaten\nthe financial system.\nDuring the financial crisis, information transparency and regulatory\ntransparency were not optimal. The risks associated with various\nfinancial instruments were unclear. The extent to which specific\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130531 .cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:10 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Stability: Lessons from Monetary Policy :: May 31, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nfinancial institutions held risky assets was unclear. The ability of\nsupervisors to assess and communicate the status of individual firms\nand the potential impact of those firms on the financial system was\nunclear, and the actions that supervisors and other government\nentities would take if those firms endangered the financial system\nwere unclear. In the absence of clarity, market participants assumed\nthe worst, and took actions that in many cases exacerbated the\nsituation, pushing the financial system towards collapse.\nA well-functioning financial system relies on accurate information\nabout the condition of each participant. Investors must have the\ninformation they need to effectively monitor financial institutions\nand to withhold funding from those that engage in excessively risky\nactivities. The goal of information transparency and regulatory\ntransparency is to increase market discipline. Greater market\ndiscipline enhances the likelihood that financial institutions—and,\nwhere appropriate, their uninsured creditors—bear the costs of taking\non excessive risk. Banking supervisors cannot be expected to know\nabout, and prevent, everything that could go wrong; neither can\nfinancial markets. However, supervisors and markets will be better\nable to limit risks to the financial system and support overall\nfinancial stability when they have access to accurate information.\nSince the financial crisis, progress has been made toward both\ngreater information transparency about financial firms, and greater\nregulatory transparency about supervisors' actions. The stress tests of\nlarge, complex bank holding companies, and the associated\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), provide a great\nillustration of information and regulatory transparency. The stress\ntests began in early 2009 as the Supervisory Capital Assessment\nProgram (SCAP). SCAP restored confidence in individual banks and in\nthe financial system overall by providing information on how much\ncapital the largest US banks would need in a macroeconomic stress\nscenario. SCAP also demonstrated the commitment of regulators to\nforce firms that were short of capital to either raise capital from\nprivate sources or take equity from the US Treasury.\nThe decision to publicly release the results of individual banks as part\nof the original SCAP drew strong resistance from people inside and\noutside of the Federal Reserve. Some of my own staff expressed\ndoubts that the public would be well served by seeing the results for\nspecific banks. However, releasing the results proved to be a success\non two levels. First, SCAP broke new ground for information\ntransparency by disclosing which firms needed additional capital and\nhow much more capital they needed. And second, the stress tests\nbroke new ground in regulatory transparency by showing that\nregulators would enforce capital requirements and impose\nconsequences for firms that fell short of those requirements. SCAP\ncalmed the markets by increasing confidence in both the financial\ninstitutions and in the supervisory process.\nSince then, the stress test has become embedded in the CCAR. CCAR\nis designed to ensure that bank holding companies have good capital\nplans and good capital planning processes in place. With CCAR, the\nFederal Reserve indicates whether a firm's capital plan is approved,\nand discloses projected loan losses, income, and capital levels under\na severely adverse stress scenario. The benefit of transparency\nregarding stress tests and CCAR is that the public understands which\ninstitutions are meeting the Federal Reserve's standards, and the\ninstitutions understand and must bear the penalties for not meeting\nthe standards—penalties that are imposed by the regulators, as well\nas from the markets.\nAnother example of where regulators are making progress in terms of\ninformation transparency and regulatory transparency is with the\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130531.cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:10 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Stability: Lessons from Monetary Policy :: May 31, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nresolution plans required by the Dodd-Frank Act. These plans, which\nare commonly known as living wills, detail the steps to be taken by\nsystemically important financial firms in the event of their failure.\nThe living wills are intended to limit the impact of one firm's failure\non the entire financial system. Last year, 11 systemically important\nfinancial institutions submitted living wills to the Federal Reserve and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Both of these agencies are\nworking with those institutions to ensure that the living wills will\nactually enable the orderly and rapid resolution of the firm in the\nevent of its failure. A portion of each firm's living will has been made\npublic, enhancing information transparency.\nImportantly, the regulators are continuing to strengthen the process.\nFollowing their review of the initial resolution plans, the Federal\nReserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have\ndeveloped instructions for the firms to detail the information that\nshould be included in their 2013 resolution plan submissions. In\nparticular, the supervisors have asked the firms to detail the\nobstacles to executing the resolution plans under the Bankruptcy\nCode. In my view, it is crucial that the public comes to see the living\nwills as credible resolution plans, and transparency can be of great\nassistance in that regard.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee has had decades of experience\nin refining its approach to fulfilling its dual mandate. By comparison,\nthe Federal Reserve and other financial regulators are in the early\nstages of crafting a comprehensive approach to fulfilling the mandate\nof ensuring financial stability. With the passage of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, Congress has redesigned the financial landscape. Some rules\nhave been implemented while others have yet to be written. The\nFederal Reserve and other regulators are just beginning to navigate\nthis landscape of new laws and new rules on a range of subjects,\nfrom capital and liquidity of financial companies, to the oversight of\nnonfinancial entities that have the potential to destabilize financial\nmarkets. Regulators need to finish getting the rules in place. Then,\nthey need to demonstrate that they have the ability, and the will, to\nuse these new tools to address financial system stability. In the\nmeantime, I would urge some patience as we lay the foundation for a\ncomprehensive framework for supporting financial stability.\nGoing forward, the Federal Reserve and other regulators will\ncontinue to take steps to improve information transparency and\nregulatory transparency in order to enhance the stability of our\nfinancial system. One way to improve information transparency is\nthrough broadening the stress tests. Systemically important non­\nbanks will be subject to stress tests, once those institutions are\nidentified. Also, stress tests could be broadened to explicitly consider\nthe effects of a bank’s stress on its most important counterparties.\nThis would be especially useful if many banks each rely on the same\nsmall set of counterparties for certain kinds of transactions, as was\nthe case with AIG and credit default swap contracts in the most\nrecent financial crisis.\nAnother way to improve information transparency is to provide the\npublic with more information about the quality of bank assets. For\nexample, regulators could require disclosure of material information\non a firm ’s portfolio risk structure, such as the geographic\ndistribution of the firm's loans. Market participants and banking\nsupervisors would likely view the risk profile of an institution with 90\npercent of its construction loans concentrated in either depressed or\noverheated real estate markets differently from the risk profile of an\ninstitution with its construction loans distributed across the country.\nRegulators could also require the disclosure of the distribution of\nFICO scores in a bank’s consumer loan portfolio. By requiring banks to\nmake such disclosures, banking supervisors can promote information\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130531.cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:10 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Stability: Lessons from Monetary Policy :: May 31, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ntransparency on individual firms. These disclosures also would\nreinforce regulatory transparency related to the actions regulators\nwill take to address certain bank portfolio concentrations.\nGreater regulatory transparency also can result from supervisors and\nregulators being more forceful and proactive in carrying out our\nexpanded responsibilities. For example, in 2010, the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) imposed tougher rules on money market\nfunds to bolster their solvency. However, some do not think these\nsteps are sufficient to safeguard financial stability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act gives the Financial Stability Oversight Council\n(FSOC) the authority to provide for more stringent regulations by\nrecommending that the SEC apply new or heightened standards or\nsafeguards. And, in fact, in an effort to address threats money market\nfunds can pose to the financial system, the FSOC is considering\nwhether to formally recommend that the SEC proceed with structural\nreforms of money market mutual funds, and has asked for public\ncomments on several options designed to address the issue. In the\ninterest of full and transparent disclosure, I should note that I, and\neach of the other 11 Federal Reserve Bank Presidents, co-signed a\nletter recently in support of the FSOC's efforts to address the risks to\nfinancial system stability that are posed by money market funds.\nRegardless of the final resolution, this new process enables the\nregulatory community, acting as a whole, to take action.\nAnother way to enhance regulatory transparency is to keep pushing\nforward in the area of living wills. As I mentioned earlier, the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC have published living wills for 11 systemically\nimportant financial institutions. However, it is not clear to me that\nmarket participants have reached the point where they trust that the\nliving wills, in concert with the Bankruptcy Code and the Dodd-Frank\nAct's Orderly Liquidation Authority, can be relied upon for safely\nliquidating a firm in acute financial stress. Furthermore, even though\nthe FSOC has designated eight financial market utilities as\nsystemically important, no non-bank firm has been named to that\nlist, and subsequently, none has been required to create a living will.\nI think that successfully addressing the \"Too Big To Fail\" problem\nrequires the establishment of a credible resolution process, one that\nappears capable of safely managing the failure of systemically\nimportant financial institutions in times of distress. Achieving this\ncredibility will, in turn, require a fair amount of informational and\nregulatory transparency. This is hard work, I know, but the gains\nfrom success are likely to be substantial.\nI'd like to end my remarks where I began, with monetary policy. As a\nparticipant on of the FOMC, I have learned that transparency,\npracticed consistently, promotes accountability; and accountability\nleads to credibility. Credibility is crucial for financial firms and for\nsupervisors, just as it is for the monetary authority. Credibility\naccumulates when there is public confidence and market confidence\nthat rules are clear and are being followed—by the supervisors as\nwell as by the financial firms. Access to accurate information about\nfinancial firms and about the actions regulators will take is a key\nfactor in promoting transparency, and transparency promotes\nfinancial stability. In a healthy information environment like the one\nI am describing, both market forces and banking supervisors will have\ngreater scope to discipline firms. Constructively used, transparency\ncan enhance the ability of supervisors to achieve their goals. Over\ntime, as we navigate the new financial services landscape, I hope\nthat the benefits from increased transparency that I have seen at\nwork in monetary policy will become increasingly evident in financial\nstability policy.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130531.cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:10 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Stability: Lessons from Monetary Policy :: May 31, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130531.cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:10 PM]\n\n\f"

Yes, I’m an immigrant. And\ntoday, I’m honored to serve on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) and as President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland. My story is not unique.

And while\nnot everyone’s path will lead to the presidency of a Federal Reserve\nBank, or being the CEO of a large organization, the journey you\nbegan at UT, which has led to this day, has put you on the road to\nyour own success story.\nToday I’d like to share with you my journey from Italian immigrant to\nFederal Reserve Bank President. Along the way, I have learned to\nfollow a few guidelines that I’ll call my “rules of the road to\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130505.cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:29 PM]\n\n_\n_\ni .. yt t\n\n. iia\n\n\fUniversity of Toledo Commencement :: May 5, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nsuccess.” My first rule of the road is to get comfortable with being\nuncomfortable. As a five-year-old girl, in a new country, and a new\nschool, and unable to speak English, I was destined to grow into\nsomeone who is comfortable being uncomfortable. So many of my\nmost memorable personal experiences have been new and unfamiliar,\nwhich can lead to uncertainty and discomfort. I’m sure most, if not\nall of you, have a few butterflies in your stomachs today. That’s a\ngood thing! Get used to it! I have learned that getting comfortable\nwith being uncomfortable is the only way to learn and grow.\nMy parents set a fantastic example for how to embrace uncertainty\nand change when, in their thirties, they gave up everything\ncomfortable and familiar, and immigrated to the United States. They\nhad no idea what awaited us, but my parents took a risk because\nthey wanted their children to have better opportunities. My parents\ncouldn’t guide me in how to fit in at school, or how to dress for my\nnew job at the Federal Reserve when I graduated from college, but\ntheir bravery taught me not to fear the unknown or the\nuncomfortable. To this day, when I find myself being uncomfortable,\nI just tell myself, “It’s okay. This is a good thing. You are growing as\na person through this experience.” I have learned that you must push\nthrough fear of the unknown in order to achieve real success.\nIn fact, throughout my career, it was only when I was willing to take\nrisks and stretch myself that I made great strides and was truly\nrewarded. I was pushed way outside my comfort zone in the early\n1990s when the CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nshocked me by telling me that the Bank’s Board of Directors wanted\nme to interview for the Chief Operating Officer position - which is\nthe second-highest-ranking official at the Bank. I had no operations\nexperience and I had managed only about 15 people up to that point.\nAs Chief Operating Officer, I would be charged with leading about\n1500 employees at four locations.\nI was fortunate to have a mentor to turn to for advice. Karen Horn\nwas my former boss and she was the first female president of a\nFederal Reserve Bank. I confided in her that I did not think I could do\nthe job. Her response was, “Get the job first, then figure out how to\ndo it.” Despite my nerves, I accepted the job and the challenge. My\nadvice to you is essentially the same that Karen gave me: embrace\nthe opportunities that come your way. Raise your hand for the tough\nassignments. Most often, you will step up to the challenge and find\nsuccess. In fact, I’ll go a step further and tell you to look for\nopportunities to get outside your comfort zone.\nAny time you try something new, it feels uncomfortable at first. But,\nthe more you work at it, the more comfortable you become. Which\nbrings me to my second rule of the road: there is just no substitute\nfor hard work. Even the most brilliant and talented people have to\nput in time and effort to be good at what they do, no matter how\neasy they make it look.\nEarlier this year, I celebrated my 30th anniversary with the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland and 10 years as a participant on the\nFOMC. You might think that with all those years of experience, my\njob would be a piece of cake. But instead, I still find myself working\nharder and learning more than at any other time in my career. During\nthe past five years, our economy has been through the worst\nfinancial crisis and recession since the Great Depression. At the\nheight of the financial crisis, my colleagues and I put in long hours of\nresearch, debate and Sunday evening conference calls to develop\npolicies that stabilized financial markets and helped our economy\nregain its strength. Even today, we continue to make decisions for\nwhich there is little or no history to guide us. It can be\nuncomfortable and it takes a lot of work to come to the right\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130505.cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:29 PM]\n\n\fUniversity of Toledo Commencement :: May 5, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ndecisions. Because I’m truly passionate about what I do, for me it\ndoesn’t really feel like hard work.\nWhich brings me to my third rule: know your strengths and passions.\nIn other words, know what you’re good at, and know what you love\nto do. By playing to your strengths, you best position yourself for\nsuccess.\nWhen I sat in my seat on graduation day, one thing I knew was that I\nwas passionate about our country and its government. I had helped\nmy parents study for their citizenship tests when I was in the third\ngrade because my English was much better than theirs. In the\nprocess, I learned a lot about this country and became fascinated by\nour government. I became determined to work in Washington, D.C.,\nin the public sector. I also knew that I loved economics - and I was\npretty good at it. So on the day I graduated from the University of\nAkron, I walked off the stage, diploma in hand, drove to the airport,\nand got on a plane to Washington, D.C. My first job was as a research\nassistant for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. On my first day\nof work, I was given a tour of the building, including the Board Room\nwhere the Federal Open Market Committee meets. I was impressed\nwith the huge mahogany table in the center of the room and thought\nto myself that I would love to sit at that table someday. That dream\ncame true when I became President of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland in 2003, and now I have an assigned seat at that\ntable. Today, I am still working for the Federal Reserve, doing a job\nthat combines my passion and my strengths. It’s a job that interests\nme and challenges me every day.\nI set my personal career goals very early in life. As you sit here\ntoday, you may have no idea what you want to do with the rest of\nyour life. That’s okay, but I urge you to take time to identify your\nstrengths. For example, think about whether you enjoy working alone\nor in a group, and whether you consider yourself a math whiz or a\nwordsmith. Are you highly analytical or more emotional? Do you\nconsider yourself introverted or extroverted? All of these traits can\nfactor into successful career decisions. Once you’ve figured out what\nyou are good at and what you like doing, you can put your talents\nand passions to work in your career and personal life, and if you do, I\nguarantee that you will find success. As a former five-year-old\nimmigrant girl who didn’t speak English, and who now sets monetary\npolicy for our country, I can tell you that it is possible to achieve\ngreat things from humble beginnings when you utilize your talents\nand follow your passions.\nWith my own humble beginnings in mind, my final rule is that you\nmust give respect in order to earn respect. As a child, I watched my\nparents struggle to learn a new way of life in America. When we\narrived in this country, they didn’t speak English and they didn’t\nunderstand the culture. I can remember many times when they were\nnot treated with the respect they deserved, and I will never forget\nhow terrible that made them feel. The gift that grew out of that\nchallenging time is that it has made me keenly aware that showing\nrespect is vitally important to becoming a successful individual and\nleader. You can never take full measure of someone by just their\nappearance, occupation, or education. The truth is that we are all on\na journey. Everyone whose path you cross is traveling on their own\njourney. Respect that they have stories to tell and know that you can\nlearn from everyone you meet.\nSo to conclude, your education does not end today. You will find that\nlife is an education. In the words of American philosopher John\nDewey, “Education is not preparation for life; education is life\nitself.” I hope that as you move on to the next road in your life’s\njourney, you w on’t let yourself get comfortable. I urge you to\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130505.cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:29 PM]\n\n\fUniversity of Toledo Commencement :: May 5, 2013 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nembrace uncertainty and accept the bumps in the road as part of an\ninteresting life. Keep working hard, follow your passions, and give\nrespect to get respect. The experiences you have along the way will\nserve as your continuing education, helping you grow in your career\nand as a person. So whatever road you take, remember that it\ndoesn’t matter where you’ve been; what matters is where you are\ngoing. Graduating from the University of Toledo is an important\nmilestone on the journey that will lead to your American success\nstory.\nThank you for the privilege of sharing this very important day with\nyou. I wish you all much success and happiness.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2013/Pianalto_20130505.cfm[4/29/2014 1:32:29 PM]\n\n\f"

One is Neighborhood\nHousing Services’ (NHS) commitment to promote sustainable\nhomeownership. Another is the Federal Reserve's commitment to\nfoster the availability of credit and banking services in low- and\nmoderate-income communities. These are worthy goals in both good\ntimes and bad.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNeighborhood Housing Services of\nGreater Cleveland Annual Luncheon\nCleveland, OH\nFebruary 8, 2008\n\nAs all of us know only too well, one of the most pressing issues facing\nour nation and our local communities here in Northeast Ohio is the\nrapid deterioration in the housing sector. The housing slump, and its\nspillover into the financial markets, is the largest factor behind the\ncurrent economic slowdown. Our financial markets have been\nunsettled since last August by the impact of mortgage-related losses\non financial institutions. Many lenders are tightening their standards\nand lowering their risk profiles, which is affecting spending in the\noverall economy.\nIn Ohio, more than 20 percent of the subprime adjustable-rate\nmortgages have fallen into delinquency. Foreclosure rates have\nreached a 30-year high, and the once-healthy markets on the coasts\nare rapidly catching up with us.\nMost people I talk to these days are asking me two questions about\nthe current housing situation: How did it happen and what have we\nlearned? Those are the questions I would like to address in my\nremarks today.\nI will begin by sharing my views on how financial innovation has\nreshaped the mortgage market over the past few decades. Then I will\ntalk about the promises and pitfalls of that innovation and about how\nthe current situation in the mortgage market has unfolded. Finally, I\nwill describe ideas that have been proposed to protect consumers\nwhile preserving the availability of mortgage credit.\nPlease understand that my remarks today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nFinancial Innovation and the Mortgage\nRevolution\nFinancial innovation has truly revolutionized the way we finance our\nhomes. Just a few decades ago, when many of us were buying our\nfirst homes, the mortgage process was much different than the one\nthat exists today. Our mortgages came with fixed rates and we had\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080208.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:13 PM]\n\n\fReflections on the Mortgage Market :: February 8, 2008 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nto come up with a 20 percent down payment. Our local mortgage\nlender originated, funded, and serviced the loan. That lender funded\nthe loan mainly with deposits and held the loan until we paid it off.\nWhat a difference a decade or two makes. Today, different parties\noriginate, package, guarantee, and service loans. Investment banks\ncan slice and dice mortgages into risk categories, package them into\nmortgage-backed securities, and sell them to investors around the\nworld. As a result, huge sums of money have flowed into the U.S.\nhousing market during the past several years. At the end of 1995,\ninvestors owned $194 billion worth of home mortgages packaged as\nmortgage-backed securities. Ten years later, that number had\nskyrocketed by about tenfold, to $1.6 trillion.\nPartly as a result of these financial innovations and partly as a result\nof the lowest interest rates in a generation, loans to increasingly\nriskier borrowers were funded. As this happened, the door of\nhomeownership was swung open to millions of households for the first\ntime. Homeownership rates increased by an amazing 4 percentage\npoints within one decade - up to about 69 percent in 2006.\nUnfortunately for many people, the dream of homeownership has\nbeen tarnished by an explosion of defaults and foreclosures. Ongoing\nproblems in the subprime market have spilled over into\nneighborhoods, the broader financial markets, and our economy. In\nthe fourth quarter of last year, the nation's homeownership rate\ndeclined back to its 2002 level.\nI have seen the devastation of some of Cleveland's neighborhoods,\nand I am especially dismayed that so much of the good work resulting\nfrom the partnerships between banks and community-based\norganizations has been undermined by these problems.\n\nPromises and Pitfalls of Innovation\nWhat went wrong? Unfortunately, the recent housing boom, which\nseemed like a surefire win for lenders and borrowers, also masked\nsome critical flaws in the global mortgage-financing system.\nLet’s look at some basic assumptions of this system. For the system\nto work smoothly, a vast network of participants - brokers,\nappraisers, lenders, rating agencies, insurers, and investors - all must\nmanage their risks. To do this, they must make assumptions about\nthe performance of individual loans under various economic\nscenarios. They must also make assumptions about the performance\nof the financial markets as a whole when circumstances change.\nWhen financial instruments are new and complex, assumptions about\nrisk and about how borrowers will perform under duress have not yet\nbeen stress-tested. When home prices are rising and interest rates\nare falling, loan losses are expected to be low. But when home prices\nare falling and interest rates are rising, loan losses often turn out to\nbe much higher than anticipated.\nThe seemingly flawless functioning of the system during the housing\nboom may have led people to underestimate the risks they were\nfacing. Lenders assumed that brokers and appraisers would practice\ndue diligence in evaluating the borrowers and their properties.\nInvestors, in turn, assumed that lenders would work only with\nreputable brokers and that ratings agencies could accurately measure\nrisk.\nWe also know that some mortgage brokers clearly did not have the\nbest interests of their borrowers at heart. In boom times, it was easy\nto concentrate on generating fee income through high volumes rather\nthan focusing on whether certain borrowers were truly ready to\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080208.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:13 PM]\n\n\fReflections on the Mortgage Market :: February 8, 2008 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nbecome homeowners.\nFor their part, some borrowers who had sudden access to easy\nmortgage credit failed to realize the heavy risks they were taking on\nwith subprime, adjustable-rate mortgages that would reset to much\nhigher rates. Expecting that home prices would continue to rise and\nthat mortgage rates would remain stable, borrowers thought they\ncould quickly refinance themselves out of trouble.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, we see the pitfalls that lay just below\nall of these faulty assumptions. As the housing market stopped\nappreciating, marginal borrowers and speculators were caught short.\nIt was not long before many homeowners lost either the ability or\nthe incentive to keep their loan payments current.\nWe now realize that at some point, for many of the players in the\nmortgage market, optimism turned into euphoria, calculated risktaking turned into over-reaching, and healthy doses of skepticism\nturned into overconfidence. Today, we are left with the damage that\nhas been caused by faulty assumptions and bad choices.\n\nWhere Do We Go from Here?\nClearly, there is much work to do. A comprehensive approach is\nneeded to address the problems we are now facing in the mortgage\nmarket. Providers of financial services must promote a greater\nunderstanding of the terms of the products and services they offer.\nHomeowners must take responsibility for understanding their financial\ntransactions and increasing their financial literacy. And regulators\nalso have a critical role to play. Agencies must review and enforce\nrelevant laws and rules to ensure they evolve along with the\ncomplexity and pace of change in the financial services industry.\nAs you may know, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem recently proposed some comprehensive new rules under the\nHome Ownership and Equity Protection Act - or HOEPA. The intent is\nto protect consumers against abusive practices while preserving the\navailability of mortgage credit. The amendments were developed\nfollowing a series of public hearings and outreach efforts.\nSome of the rules would extend new protections to virtually all\nsubprime borrowers and to other borrowers who qualify for high priced loans. Specifically, these rules include four key protections:\nThey prohibit creditors from engaging in a pattern or practice of\nlending without considering the borrower's ability to pay.\nThey require creditors to verify the income and assets they rely on to\nmake loans.\nThey restrict the use of prepayment penalties.\nAnd they require creditors to establish escrow accounts for insurance\nand taxes.\nThe Board also proposed rules that apply to most mortgages,\nincluding prime, to increase transparency and competition in the\nmarket, and to protect borrowers from certain misleading and\ndeceptive practices. These new rules will apply to all mortgage\nlenders and will give consumers the opportunity to redress wrongs\nthrough civil actions.\nThe proposed HOEPA rules are an important first step to help restore\nconfidence in our mortgage market. To ensure that these rules are as\nrobust as possible, the Board of Governors is looking for comments by\nApril 8th. As always, your ideas are welcomed.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080208.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:13 PM]\n\n\fReflections on the Mortgage Market :: February 8, 2008 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nOf course, attacking the housing and mortgage problems we are\nfacing today is a complex matter and requires multiple strategies on\nboth the public and private level. States are strengthening their\nlicensing standards, and financial institutions are taking steps to\nimprove their lending practices. The Federal Reserve has launched a\npilot project to collaborate with other state and federal regulatory\nagencies to conduct consumer-protection compliance reviews of\nnonbank lenders and other industry participants. Ultimately, the\neffectiveness of all of these efforts depends on diligent enforcement.\nGoing forward, it will be important to safeguard the interests of\nconsumers while allowing lenders to continue to serve their\ncommunities. We must be careful not to create an environment\nwhere lenders are reluctant to serve their subprime customers. We\nwant to encourage responsible lenders to stay in the market and\nwork in partnership with organizations like NeighborWorks America\nand local affiliates like NHS. Just recently, Congress recognized your\nexpertise by selecting NeighborWorks America to administer a large\nNational Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling program to help struggling\nhomeowners.\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, we share your belief that\ngood pre-purchase counseling combined with the right loan products\nresult in successful borrowers. And, like you, we remain convinced\nthat successful homeownership is still the cornerstone of community\nrevitalization. The partnerships between the banks and organizations\nrepresented here today are a testament to the imagination and\ndetermination of Clevelanders.\n\nConclusion\nThere is no denying that we are going through some very difficult\ntimes right now. The challenges facing our region, in particular, are\nvery personal to me. I grew up in Northeast Ohio, I went to school\nhere, and I have spent most of my working life here. Like you, I want\neveryone to have the opportunity to realize his or her own version of\nthe American dream.\nThere will come a time when we will turn the corner on this difficult\nperiod. As long as we regulate wisely and do not suffocate our credit\nmarkets, the very real hardships of adjustment will fade, and we will\nall benefit from the new practices that emerge.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080208.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:13 PM]\n\n\f"

As business leaders, you may have already adjusted your\nbusiness plan and set your capital budgets to achieve the goals you\nhave set for your companies. For Federal Reserve monetary\npolicymakers, our “goals” are straightforward. We have a dual\nmandate from Congress - price stability and maximum employment but Congress has given the Federal Reserve independence in choosing\nour so-called business plan on how to achieve these two objectives.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAssociation for Corporate Growth\nCleveland, OH\nJanuary 17, 2008\n\nThe data we get on the economy are backward-looking - meaning\nthat they give us information about the economy at some point in the\npast. But monetary policy is forward-looking, meaning that whatever\npolicy decision the Federal Reserve makes affects economic growth\nand inflation in the future. So effective policymaking requires that\nwe make the most informed assessment possible about where the\neconomy is heading over the next several months, quarters, and even\nyears.\nFor some of you, establishing your business plan is an ongoing, rather\nthan an annual, exercise. Certainly that is the case for the Federal\nReserve. We make policy decisions based on continually updated\neconomic projections. Perhaps new data reveal that the economic\nlandscape was different than we saw it when we made a previous\ndecision. Or perhaps we see that the economy is approaching hurdles\nwe had not anticipated. Making economic projections is a difficult,\nbut nevertheless an essential, part of the policymaking process.\nThis morning, I want to spend some time talking with you about the\nFederal Reserve’s economic projections and my current views on the\nstate of the economy. I will begin by describing the recent decision\nby the Federal Reserve to release our economic projections more\nfrequently and the role that economic projections play as\ncommunication devices. Next, I will discuss the process I use to make\nmy own economic projections, and I will conclude with my current\nviews on the economy.\nPlease understand that the opinions I express today are my own. I do\nnot presume to speak for any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nI. Economic Projections as Communication\nDevices\nSo let me begin my remarks by describing the changes the Federal\nReserve has made in releasing our economic projections and the role\nthey play as communication devices.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:32 PM]\n\n\fA Policymaker’s Perspective on the Economic Outlook :: January 17, 2008 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nFor most of our history, the Federal Reserve did not announce any\npolicy moves, choosing instead to let the world guess at our policies\nby carefully reading the financial market indicators. But gone are the\ndays when central banks find it advantageous to operate in secret.\nOver time, and especially since 1994, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (or FOMC), the Federal Reserve’s policymaking group, has\ntaken a series of steps to become more transparent. These days, the\npublic can see a press statement on the Board of Governors’ website\nsoon after the FOMC meets, and can read the full minutes of that\nmeeting within just three weeks.\nThis past November, Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the\nFederal Reserve is taking another step forward. We are now releasing\nour economic projections more frequently, and we are expanding\ntheir content. We are releasing our economic projections four times a\nyear instead of just twice a year, which will give you more timely\nupdates on how we see the economic environment unfolding. These\nprojections are a compilation of the individual forecasts made by\nFederal Reserve governors and Reserve Bank presidents based on\ntheir own assessments of the appropriate policy required to achieve\nour dual mandate.\nWe are providing projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment\nrate, and two measures of inflation--overall inflation and “core”\ninflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components.\nWe have also extended the forecast horizon from two years to three\nyears so you can get a better sense of where we think the economy\nand inflation are headed in the medium term.\nIn addition to providing more information about the economic\noutlook, we are also including a detailed narrative of the major\ninfluences shaping our projections. The narrative discloses the range\nof opinion among Committee participants and provides some\nmeasures of how we assess the uncertainties in our projections. All of\nthis information is intended to provide you with a better\nunderstanding of the path the Federal Reserve expects the economy\nto follow on our way to achieving our dual mandate of price stability\nand maximum employment.\nI believe that these enhanced economic projections will bring a\nnumber of benefits. First, the Federal Reserve is accountable to the\npublic, and the more effectively we explain our decisions - and the\nrationale behind them - the better we are able to maintain our\ndemocratic legitimacy. Second, clarity about our policy objectives\nand strategy may help anchor the public’s long-term inflation\nexpectations and improve overall economic performance. With\ninflation expectations anchored, I believe that we will actually gain\nadded flexibility to address near-term problems, such as the recent\nturbulence in the financial markets, without risking our credibility.\nThird, greater public understanding of what we are trying to\naccomplish and how we plan to do it should lead to better decision­\nmaking by households, businesses, and financial market participants.\n\nII. The Process of Making Economic\nProjections\nNow I’d like to take a few moments to share with you the process I\nuse to make my own economic projections. At the next FOMC\nmeeting, at the end of this month, I will submit my economic\nprojections for 2008, 2009, and 2010. Here is how I am approaching\nthat task.\nI begin with a data-driven model of the economy. This so-called\n“structural” model is a collection of mathematical equations that\nrepresent the major sectors of our economy and the most important\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:32 PM]\n\n\fA Policymaker’s Perspective on the Economic Outlook :: January 17, 2008 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nforces that influence those sectors.\nFor example, when energy prices rise or fall significantly, I need to\nknow how these changes are likely to affect consumer spending. And\nby extension, I would like to know how changes in consumer spending\nwill affect business capital spending plans, industrial production,\nunderlying price pressures, and so on. These models are an absolutely\nessential part of the projection because they bring a strict discipline\nto the process. They keep track of a huge number of\ninterrelationships and ensure that, in the end, I have accounted for\nall of the major forces that are influencing the economy. In short,\nthe model helps me ensure that everything adds up.\nData-driven models are a necessary starting point for my projection,\nbut they are only a starting point. For all of their analytical\nsophistication, economic models are really just abstractions. Even the\nbest of them is a simplification of a very complex world. Let me\ndescribe just three of their shortcomings that I need to keep in mind\nwhen making a projection.\nFirst, economic models are usually based on backward-looking data\nthat are subject to measurement error. For example, as I speak with\nyou this morning, the most recent GDP estimate I have is for the\nthird quarter of last year, and it has been revised higher and higher\nwith each passing month. I have monthly data on certain sectors of\nthe economy, of course, but each of these snapshots gives me only a\nlimited and blurry view of the overall economic picture.\nSecond, economic models require a host of assumptions that are\nobviously imperfect. For instance, I know my economic projection\ndepends on the behavior of things like the cost of energy and the\nwealth of households. But while I must make certain informed\nguesses about the outlook for oil prices and the performance of the\nstock market, I really can’t know these important influences with\nmuch certainty when I plug them into my economic model.\nThird, every model is tied to historical events that may not perfectly\nreflect our current economic situation. This weakness is especially a\nproblem when I think about the important role that expectations play\nin the economy and how people form their expectations. For\nexample, how is the public, especially financial market participants,\ninterpreting the incoming information today compared to the last\ntime we faced a similar set of economic circumstances? Is confidence\nabout the future affecting household spending and saving decisions\ndifferently this time? And what is the public expecting in terms of\neconomic policy adjustments versus some previous period?\nBecause of these shortcomings, I choose to temper the economic\nprojection from my model with a good dose of judgment. I use the\neconomic insights of economists - and we have many very good ones\nat the Bank - but I also take full advantage of a broad collection of\nbusiness contacts. Each business leader has a unique perspective on\nthe economy, and together their perspectives paint a vivid picture.\nBusiness leaders know what is happening right now and, equally\nimportant, they can describe the plans they are making for the\nfuture.\nI have been asking the business community a lot of questions lately questions about issues like consumer spending patterns, the strength\nof their order books and inventories, and any plans they have made\nto add to their payrolls.\nI am also considering some pivotal assumptions underlying the\noutlook. One question is whether the recent rise in oil prices is likely\nto continue. Another is how the dollar’s performance is affecting\npricing power. Yet another question is whether the stresses in the\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:32 PM]\n\n\fA Policymaker’s Perspective on the Economic Outlook :: January 17, 2008 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nfinancial sector are disrupting the normal saving and lending\nchannels.\nFinally, there are all kinds of ’’expectations” issues that I need to\nsort through. I need a sense of how households are incorporating\nlower housing values into their spending and saving decisions. I need\na sense of how the prospect for slower consumer spending, and\nperhaps slower economic growth, is likely to change the business\nappetite for investment. And I need a sense of how financial markets\nare reappraising risk and how that is affecting the cost and\navailability of credit.\nAs you can imagine, I make a lot of phone calls before I make my\neconomic projection. Then I go back to my economic model and\nadjust it based on what I have learned. Of course, conditioning\neconomic models to incorporate the judgment of experts without\nviolating the integrity of the model is often more art than science.\nBut it is important to try to strike a proper balance between the best\nof statistical science and the best of expert opinion to get as clear an\neconomic roadmap as possible.\nThat said, there is obviously much room for improvement in the\nprocess. Even the very best of economic forecasts is not particularly\nreliable. To be specific, the confidence interval around a one-yearahead real GDP forecast is about 2.4 percentage points. That can\nspan the difference between an economy that is marching forward\nand one that is teetering on a precipice. And it’s the “teetering on a\nprecipice” that I’d really like to have some forewarning about!\nThe experience of forecasting around the time of the last recession\nillustrates my point. In December 2000, the predominant view among\nforecasters was that real GDP would expand at a 3 percent pace in\n2001. The actual growth rate turned out to be only V of a percent.\nThe economy actually began to contract in March 2001, but we did\nnot have confirmation that the economy was contracting until\nNovember 2001 - just as the economy was climbing out of recession.\nAs I said earlier, economic statistics are released with a lag and are\noften revised substantially over time. Obviously, having such an\nimperfect understanding of how the economy is unfolding greatly\ncomplicates our ability to make accurate near-term projections.\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, we are always working to\nimprove our modeling process. We are researching how to better\nunderstand business and household expectations for the economy,\ninflation, and the likely path of monetary policy. We are rethinking\nthe way we interpret survey data of households, and we are\nimproving the ways we pull market sentiment from the financial\ndata.\nOur economists are studying the sources and shifts in productivity\nthat pin down our economic potential. And we are working on the\ndevelopment of new models that account for how economic\ninteractions change over time on the basis of expectations.1 In recent\nyears, economists have been able to make these very complicated\nmodels more relevant to the policy process, and the models may\nsoon find their way into my economic projections. But I don’t think\nI’ll be pitching my Rolodex of business contacts anytime soon.\n\nIII. My Views on the Economy\nSo that’s the process of making projections. With all of that as\nbackground, how am I thinking about the economy this morning? Of\ncourse, I know that our economy is confronting a number of\nchallenges as the new year begins. The residential real estate market\nstill appears to be in freefall. In addition, oil prices have risen, and\nhousing and equity prices have fallen. These factors are restraining\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:32 PM]\n\n\fA Policymaker’s Perspective on the Economic Outlook :: January 17, 2008 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nthe economy beyond the housing sector.\nDirectly and indirectly, the negative influence of housing on overall\neconomic performance could affect the outlook for some time. We\nare also seeing a related slowing in consumer spending, perhaps in\nresponse to reduced household wealth. Tightened credit market\nconditions could also hinder economic growth this year for both\nbusinesses and consumers. A weak December employment report,\ncombined with a falloff in retail spending and flat industrial\nproduction, supports my view that the economy has shifted to a\nlower growth track. Although I expect that the restraining influences\nto growth will diminish over time, and that the economy will gain\nfirmer traction later this year and into 2009, I am concerned about\nthe downside risks to that outlook.\nEven as economic growth was slowing, inflation at year-end was\nclearly elevated. Rising energy prices were a big part of the increase\nin overall inflation, and some of those costs were passing through to\nthe core inflation measures as well. So, too, the falling dollar seems\nto have boosted import prices. But I continue to believe that the\neconomy’s inflation trend will move lower over the forecast horizon\nas the growth rate of the economy slows and the influence of energy\nand import prices diminishes.\nRisks remain to my inflation outlook, including the risk of losing the\npublic’s confidence in the Federal Reserve’s commitment to price\nstability. I will continue to closely monitor the inflation situation,\nincluding the behavior of inflation expectations.\nMy FOMC colleagues and I will be discussing the outlook for the\neconomy in less than two weeks. Needless to say, the economic and\nfinancial environment has been very fluid lately, creating the need to\nbe highly flexible in responding to changes to the outlook and\nassociated risks.\nI would like to thank Michael Bryan, vice president and economist at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, for his insights in the\ndevelopment of these remarks.\n1 These models are called Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium\nModels.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2008/Pianalto_20080117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:03:32 PM]\n\n\f"

At the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, we\nhave spent time researching the factors that determine the\ndifferences we see in regional economic growth. This morning, I\nwould like to share some of those findings and explain why\ninvestments in innovation and human capital are important keys to\nour region's long-run prosperity.\nI will begin by giving you a brief perspective on the national\neconomy. Next, I will describe some of the longer-term challenges\nwe have been facing here in Ohio. Finally, I will discuss the\nimportance of innovation and human capital to our region's future.\nPlease understand that my remarks are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nI. The National Economy\nPerhaps the best way for me to begin my discussion of the national\neconomy is to take you back to September 18. On that day, the\nFederal Open Market Committee met and decided to cut its target\nfor the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. This meeting, as you\nknow, followed a volatile month in the financial markets.\nThere was concern that the turbulence in the financial markets could\nslow economic activity in coming months. The risks that spillover\neffects from housing could lead to slower gains in employment,\nincome, and consumer spending had increased. The risks that\nbusinesses might scale back their capital spending next year in\nresponse to these factors had also increased. The inflation situation\nseemed to have improved slightly, although some inflation risks\nremained and continued to warrant close monitoring.\nGiven these conditions, the Committee indicated that the uncertainty\nsurrounding the economic outlook had increased. The Committee also\nemphasized that future policy actions would depend on how\neconomic prospects were affected by evolving market developments\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20071018.cfm[4/29/2014 2:05:38 PM]\n\n\fNational and Regional Economic Conditions :: October 18, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nand by other factors.\nSince our September 18 meeting, the housing sector has remained\nvery weak, but output and employment in other sectors appear to be\nholding up. Inflation and inflation expectations continue to be\nmoderate and anchored. The strains in financial markets that were so\nevident and worrisome in mid-September appear to have lessened\nsomewhat. During the past few weeks, as market participants have\ngained a better understanding of their financial positions and the\npositions of others, financial markets have become more stable. The\nFederal Open Market Committee meets again on October 30th and\n31st, and we will once more assess developments and act as needed\nto foster price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.\n\nII. Longer-term Trends in the Ohio Economy\nWhile the FOMC's policies are national in scope, meaning that we take\npolicy actions based on what is best for the country as a whole - we\nare also well aware that different regions of the country face their\nown special circumstances and challenges.\nHere in Ohio, while we are confronting many of the problems that are\nevident in the national economy, we are also challenged by longerterm structural issues.\nLet's look at how these longer-term issues have evolved. If I were to\nstep back in time, say to the late 1950s, I would be standing here\ntelling you that the Ohio economy was the 5th largest among the 50\nstates, that we were among the top three manufacturing states in\nthe country, and that our economy was adding good jobs - that is,\nwell-paid manufacturing jobs. I would have proudly stated how the\ninvestments we were making in physical capital - our steel mills,\nautomotive plants, and highway infrastructure - had placed Ohio at\nthe center of the U.S. economy.\nAnd I probably would have painted a pretty rosy picture of our\neconomy going forward. I think my speech would have made us all\nfeel good, and we could have patted ourselves on the back and\nheaded home.\nUnfortunately, as we all know, today Ohio's economy is facing some\nchallenges. And although we might not have known back in the 1950s\nthe specific challenges our economy would face, our region should\nhave expected to be challenged in new ways. The fact is that the\nforces of economic change always require us to adapt. This process is\nsometimes referred to as creative destruction.\nWhat do I mean by creative destruction? Well, this phrase is credited\nto a Harvard economist named Joseph Schumpeter. It describes a\nprocess by which market economies evolve. Technological change\nand innovation constantly create new opportunities and challenges in\nthe economy. Some firms embrace the change and thrive, while\nothers struggle and may ultimately fail. In our capitalist economy,\nthis is a fundamental part of the competitive process. It helps move\nresources from less-productive to more-productive uses.\nThe dynamics of creative destruction play out across almost all\nsectors of our economy. The churning of firms also creates a churning\nin the labor markets. Here in Ohio, we have roughly 5.5 million\nworkers. In each quarter of the year, roughly 300,000 jobs are\ndestroyed, but in each quarter, roughly 300,000 new jobs are\ncreated.\nBut even with all of this churning, Ohio's labor market is less dynamic\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20071018.cfm[4/29/2014 2:05:38 PM]\n\n\fNational and Regional Economic Conditions :: October 18, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nthan the nation as a whole. That is, at the national level, roughly 7\npercent more jobs are created each quarter than are lost. Many\nOhioans tend to blame our weaker employment growth on the job\nlosses in our traditional manufacturing industries. However, Ohio is\nnot losing jobs at a faster rate than the rest of the country. Our\nproblem is not unusually high job destruction. Instead, it is our weak\njob creation, especially in the number of jobs created through new\nbusiness formation\nThis weakness is also mirrored in statistics on income. Whether we\nlook at median household income or per-capita personal income,\nOhio's income growth has trailed the nation over the past several\nyears. This lack of income growth reflects, in part, the weak labor\nmarket and the lower proportion of high-skilled jobs in our economy.\nCreative destruction is often painful, especially for workers with skills\nin low demand. But the process is central to a well-functioning\nmarket economy, and it will persist in the future. So, while it may be\nnatural for us to miss the good old days, we really ought to be more\nconcerned about missing out on the best of tomorrow.\nHow, then, can Ohio get on the right path and get our economy\nexpanding at rates seen in other parts of the country? To answer this\nquestion, we need to understand the factors that determine how a\nregion grows.\n\nIII. The Importance of Innovation and Human\nCapital\nWhile a number of factors may explain differences in regional\neconomic performance, our research at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland shows that over the long run, there are two key drivers of\nregional economic growth - innovation and human capital.\n\nInnovation\nLet me begin with innovation - and I want to be specific about that\nword. In an economist's view, innovation does not simply mean\nchange or creativity. In the context of economic growth, innovation\nis technological change or a business process improvement that\nmakes people more productive.\nInnovation comes in all forms, and it often becomes embedded in the\ntools or capital we use - like computers and cell phones. Other\ntimes, it is much closer to pure knowledge, such as mapping the\nhuman genome. At a very general level, innovation reflects our\naccumulation of knowledge about the production of goods and\nservices.\nSociety generates innovation through both commercial and publicly\nfunded research and development, but the vast majority of R&D is\nfinanced and carried out by private firms. The structure of our\neconomy creates incentives for firms to take risks and to undertake\ninnovative activities. The payoffs to a new blockbuster drug, a new\ncomputer program, or a new medical device can be substantial.\nWe know that innovation will be commercialized more readily in\nregions where entrepreneurship and business formation are\nencouraged. And our research shows that regions where such\ninnovative activity prospers through commercialization have a real\nadvantage. Specifically, states that generate a greater amount of\ninnovation through patenting of inventions show greater per-capita\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20071018.cfm[4/29/2014 2:05:38 PM]\n\n\fNational and Regional Economic Conditions :: October 18, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nincome growth.\nHistorically, Ohio has been a relatively innovative state, and this has\nboosted our long-term growth. However, our advantage in innovation\nhas been diminishing over time. Back in the 1950s, Ohio was\nproducing almost 50 percent more patents per capita than the nation\nas a whole. Today, we produce patents at a rate very similar to the\nrest of the nation.\n\nHuman Capital\nThe second key factor driving regional economic growth is human\ncapital. While innovation is the accumulation of knowledge that\nmakes people more productive, human capital is actually the\nwellspring of innovation. Human capital represents the knowledge\nand skills that workers, managers and entrepreneurs acquire through\nschool, on-the-job training, and informal channels.\nThe willingness and opportunity to build human capital is the great\nequalizer in our society. And, in turn, societies themselves benefit\nfrom the knowledge and skills that individuals accumulate. Research\nshows that states with greater amounts of human capital, as\nreflected in the education levels of their workforces, grow\nsignificantly faster than states with less-educated workforces.\nThis result, of course, is linked to the innovation story I told earlier.\nRegions that accumulate greater amounts of knowledge have an\nadvantage in creating new products and ideas. Cities like Boston,\nSeattle, and San Jose, which have recently been at the forefront of\nknowledge creation and innovation, have exceedingly well-educated\nworkforces. And it is the ability of these regions to continue to\nattract, develop, and retain their skilled workforces that will drive\nfurther growth.\nUnfortunately, Ohio's education levels are below average, and this\nhas held back our rate of per-capita income growth. This is\nespecially true in terms of the share of our population with a college\ndegree. Even though Ohio is the 7th largest economy in the nation\ntoday, we rank 38th out of the 50 states in terms of adults with a\ncollege degree. This is unacceptable, and we need to do better.\nNew information technologies have increased the demand for highly\nskilled, more educated workers. This growing demand for highly\nskilled workers has also increased their relative wages. In 1975, a\ncollege graduate earned about 19 percent more than someone with a\nhigh school diploma, but today, that differential has risen to 63\npercent. This represents a phenomenon known as skill-biased\ntechnological change, and it is one explanation for the significant\nincrease in earnings inequality we have experienced in our nation\nover the past 30 years.\nWhat is most troublesome about the rise in earnings inequality is not\nsimply that workers at the top of wage distribution have done better,\nbut that those at the lowest part of the income distribution have\nmade such little progress in terms of real wage growth. Workers with\nhigh school diplomas or less have actually seen their real wages\ndecline over the past several decades.\nThe problem is that the skills that come with a high-school education\nare increasingly inadequate to do the work of the jobs available\ntoday. This is only likely to become more true over time. The\ntechnological changes we have witnessed in recent years require that\npeople deepen their own human capital in order to stay employable.\nMore education is required not only so individuals can take advantage\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20071018.cfm[4/29/2014 2:05:38 PM]\n\n\fNational and Regional Economic Conditions :: October 18, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nof new technologies, but also so that they are in a position to\ngenerate more of these innovations in the future. These are the keys\nto our region's economic future.\n\nConclusion\nFor Ohio to flourish over the long term, we need to create an\neconomic climate that encourages innovative endeavors and fosters\ninvestments in human capital.\nThose individuals and those regions that invest most effectively in\neducation will be more readily able to adapt to the economic shocks\nthat are bound to occur. It may be that the returns on the\ninvestments we make in education are not specifically tied to what\nwe learn, but rather in enhancing our ability to learn. And it is our\nability to learn and create that allows us to innovate and to respond\nto the changes in the economy that, while uncertain in nature and\ntiming, are certain to come.\nI am confident in our region's resourcefulness, and I know that we\nwill remain committed to building an economic future that will be as\nenriching as our past. All of you play an important role in this\nprocess.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20071018.cfm[4/29/2014 2:05:38 PM]\n\n\f"

We know that people on the financial margins just didn't\nhave all that many borrowing options a generation ago.\nWith the benefit of legislation like the Community Reinvestment Act,\nwhich we will hear more about this morning, access to credit and\ncapital has gradually improved. Now, people at all ends of the\nfinancial spectrum have more opportunity to become homeowners\nthan they did 30 years ago. In the past few years, the U.S.\nhomeownership rate has reached its highest level in history - nearly\n70 percent.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2007 Community Development Policy\nSummit\nCleveland, OH\nJune 22, 2007\n\nBut clearly, not all of the news is positive. Much of yesterday's\nagenda focused on home foreclosures-a topic that has been getting\nquite of bit of attention lately, and I think deservedly so. From our\ncommunities to Congress, there is considerable concern about how\nthe increasing numbers of home foreclosures are affecting borrowers\nand neighborhoods. Unfortunately, this problem hits very close to\nhome. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Ohio had the highest foreclosure\nrate of any state in the nation. We know that Cuyahoga County itself\nhas been particularly hard hit. It is unfortunate that at a time when\nmany people are rediscovering the hidden potential of our urban\nneighborhoods, the current trend in foreclosures might compromise\nsome of the real progress that has been made.\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, we care about this\nproblem. Some of you here this morning have participated in\nmeetings we have held over the past few years with community\nleaders, bankers, academics, regulators, and other policymakers. Our\ndiscussions have reinforced the idea that the housing market is very\ncomplex, with many participants and many competing interests.\nAnd that leads me to my message this morning: Within this\nincreasingly complex mortgage market, policymakers must preserve\nthe benefits of financial innovation while protecting consumers from\nunfair and abusive practices.\nObviously, this is a broad topic, and I will only be able to touch on a\nfew related factors this morning. First, I will discuss some of the\nbenefits and challenges brought by legal changes and financial\ninnovation. Then I will describe how information problems in the\nmarket have led to some unintended consequences. Finally, I will\nexplain why curing the ills in mortgage markets will require a\ncomprehensive approach. Please understand that the Federal Reserve\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/ForJhe_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Piamlto_20070622.cfmt4/29/2014 2:05:50 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Innovation: Benefits and Challenges :: June 22, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBanks are not rule-makers; that authority rests with the Board of\nGovernors in Washington.\n\nThe Impact of Legal Changes and Financial\nInnovation\nToday's mortgage markets have been shaped by legal changes and\nfinancial innovation. Over the past few decades, a series of legal\nchanges has led to the removal of state interest-rate caps and the\nintroduction of variable interest rates and balloon payments. While\nthese changes have provided more payment options and broader\naccess to homeownership, they have also resulted in a very complex\nmarket, which brings its own challenges. For example, adjustablerate mortgages are more complex instruments than fixed-rate\nmortgages and can sometimes be more difficult for consumers to\nunderstand.\nFinancial innovation has been a major driver of change as well.\nInnovation allows markets to craft specialized mortgage contracts and\nto transfer risk. For example, many mortgages are now pooled,\nrepackaged and sold as mortgage-backed securities. Compare this to\nthe days when a borrower just walked into a bank branch, signed up\nfor a loan, and knew that the same bank would hold the loan to its\nfull maturity.\nFinancial innovation has clearly benefited consumers by driving down\ncosts. Since 1985, initial fees for conventional mortgage loans have\nfallen from roughly 2.5 percent of the loan balance to about 0.5\npercent.1 Another big advantage is choice. A few decades ago,\npeople were offered just one or two different mortgage products,\nbut now they can choose from among multiple instruments and\npayback structures. Finally, consumers benefit from faster loan\ndecisions today.\nThe combination of legal changes and financial innovation has\nbrought a big increase in the number of players in the mortgage\nmarket - including brokers, underwriters, servicers, and rating\nagencies. This evolution allows for more specialization and a greater\nvolume of lending. But it also brings new challenges in terms of\nconflicting incentives. For example, because a mortgage broker is\ntypically compensated only when a loan is made, he has an incentive\nto approve the loan. However, this incentive may conflict with the\ninterests of the potential borrower, who may not be able to afford\nthe loan. This incentive may even conflict with the interests of the\nlender, who is looking for repayment of the loan principal, rather\nthan just the loan origination.\nConflicting incentives and greater complexity are just two of the\nchallenges that go along with the many benefits of legal changes and\nfinancial innovation.\n\nInformation Problems in Mortgage Markets\nAnother challenge is posed by information problems in the mortgage\nmarkets, which can lead to unintended consequences. These\nproblems can exist between borrowers and lenders, or they can arise\nfrom incomplete information about what is happening in mortgage\nmarkets more broadly.\nOne information problem we have seen between borrowers and\nlenders is an imperfect estimation of borrowers' ability to repay\nadjustable-rate loans. The Mortgage Bankers Association has reported\nthat in both the prime and subprime markets, the share of\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:05:50 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Innovation: Benefits and Challenges :: June 22, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nadjustable-rate loans entering foreclosure was more than two-and-ahalf times the share of fixed-rate loans entering foreclosure in the\nfourth quarter of 2006.\nThe difference in foreclosure rates between these two types of\ninstruments is striking. It suggests that some borrowers and\noriginators may have misunderstood or miscalculated the increases in\ninterest rates that could occur with adjustable-rate mortgages.\nWe know that information problems can run the spectrum from\nsimple miscalculations to withholding of information to outright\nfraud. Let's consider a case of withholding information. On one side,\nborrowers may have a better idea about the risks they face in\nrepaying their debt than creditors do. As a result, borrowers may\nhave a disincentive to fully reveal this information because it may\njeopardize their ability to obtain the loan.\nOn the other side, lenders may have an information advantage as\nwell. Because they generally have superior knowledge of financial\ninstruments and markets, lenders may not reveal certain information\nto borrowers that would reduce the profitability of the loan. For\nexample, a lender might recommend a near-prime or subprime loan\nwhen a borrower could in fact qualify for a prime loan. This\ninformation advantage can cross the line into outright fraud if\nunscrupulous lenders mislead borrowers about the actual cost of a\nloan, with the goal of stripping equity from a home. In other cases,\nborrowers or originators may misrepresent the borrower's income in\norder to secure a loan.\nUnfortunately, we cannot be sure how prevalent any of these\npractices may be. This brings me to another, broader kind of\ninformation problem - incomplete information about what is taking\nplace in the various segments of the mortgage market itself.\nCertainly we receive useful information from trade associations,\nprivate data vendors, and government agencies, but many people are\nunaware that data reporting results differ widely among these\nsources. Consequently, our picture is incomplete. For example, there\nis no standard definition of a subprime loan, and there is no single,\ndefinitive source for foreclosure data. Right now, much of the\nforeclosure data is being reported in the context of anecdotal\nevidence.\nWhile anecdotal evidence helps us identify factors that correlate with\nforeclosures, it does not permit us to determine to what extent each\nfactor actually causes the foreclosure problem. Foreclosure rates may\nvary depending on local economic conditions, state laws,\nunderwriting practices, and the personal situations of borrowers, such\nas family illness or job loss. Understanding the mix of factors and\ntheir contribution to the problem is critical to identifying the right\npolicy prescriptions.\n\nResponse to Mortgage Market Problems\nRequires a Comprehensive Approach\nJust as there is no single cause of the problems we are seeing in the\nmortgage market, I am convinced that there is no single solution or\n\"silver bullet\" that will cure them. Curing the ills in the mortgage\nmarkets will require a comprehensive approach, and each player in\nthe financial arena has a role to play.\nFirst, consumers must take responsibility for understanding their\nfinancial transactions and indeed, for increasing their own basic\nfinancial literacy. Beyond simply weighing the relative costs of\nsimilar products and setting up a household budget, consumers should\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/ForJhe_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Piamlto_20070622xfmt4/29/2014 2:05:50 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Innovation: Benefits and Challenges :: June 22, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nunderstand the importance of setting longer-term financial goals and\ndeveloping a plan to meet those goals.\nSecond, financial services providers, including mortgage brokers,\nshould continue to promote greater understanding of the terms of the\nproducts and services they offer. They should clarify information\nabout the financial products being offered, including the potential\nramifications over both the short term and the long term. Only then\ncan consumers make a truly informed decision about the financial\ninstruments they are considering.\nFinally, regulators have a critical role to play. Many agencies are\ninvolved at both the federal and state level. These agencies must\ncontinually review the relevant laws governing financial markets to\nensure these regulations evolve along with the complexity and pace\nof change in the financial services industry. Some positive actions are\nalready taking place. For example, the federal banking regulatory\nagencies have recently proposed additional guidance regarding\nsubprime mortgage lending. This guidance outlines expectations for\nsound risk management, control processes, underwriting standards for\nadjustable-rate mortgages, and clear customer communications.\nAt the Federal Reserve, the Board of Governors is carefully\nconsidering how it might further use its rulemaking authority under\nthe Home Ownership Equity Protection Act to curb abusive lending\npractices without discouraging responsible subprime lending. In fact,\na public hearing was held in Washington just last week. The Board is\nalso reviewing disclosures under the Truth-in-Lending Act to ensure\nthat lenders provide consumers with the right information at the\nright time during the mortgage-selection process.\nOf course, it is not enough just to monitor laws and regulations - they\nmust be effectively enforced. Responsibility for enforcing the rules is\nshared among the five federal regulators of depository institutions,\nthe Federal Trade Commission, and state authorities. The Federal\nReserve is committed to working closely with these other regulators\nto ensure the laws protecting consumers are effectively enforced.\nFinally, any new laws, regulations, or guidelines should be developed\nwith the thought of aligning appropriate incentives with the desired\nbehaviors of the affected parties. Without this alignment, we can\nexpect to see unintended outcomes, such as a restriction of credit for\notherwise creditworthy borrowers.\n\nConclusion\nAs we consider these issues, I think it is important to keep in mind\nthe overall outcome we are trying to achieve, which is the efficient\nand effective flow of credit and capital. We must strive to ensure\ncontinued access to our financial markets while protecting consumers\nand communities against unfair and abusive practices. Fully\nunderstanding all of the factors behind the problems we face in the\nmortgage market, without curtailing financial innovation, is an\nimportant means to that end.\n\n1 Source: Federal Housing Finance Board.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:05:50 PM]\n\n\fFinancial Innovation: Benefits and Challenges :: June 22, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070622.cfml4/29/2014 2:05:50 PM]\n\n\f"

It is\nclear to me that we all share many of the same concerns, and\nimportantly, we share the same priority - price stability.\nFor the European Central Bank, price stability is the sole objective.\nFor the Federal Reserve, price stability is one pillar of our dual\nmandate, the other being maximum sustainable economic growth.\nProducing price stability is the surest way to enable the economy to\ngrow at its maximum sustainable rate.\n\nSandra Pianalto\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nConference: GIC Abroad in Ireland\nDublin, ireland\nJune 11, 2007\n\nFor the past two decades, central banks around the world have done\nan impressive job of achieving price stability. Despite our past\nsuccesses, however, we must always stand ready to deal with\nchallenges that could eventually confront us.\nRecently in the United States, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open\nMarket Committee has described our core rate of inflation as being\nuncomfortably high and has stressed the importance of further\nmoderation in inflation. We have held our federal funds rate target at\n5.25 percent for nearly a year, and we have stated that our\npredominant concern is \"the risk that inflation will fail to moderate\nas expected.\"\nIn my remarks this morning, I will first explain why maintaining price\nstability requires keeping inflation expectations low and secure.\nSecond, I will describe some inflationary risks that may become\nsignificant down the road. Finally, I will discuss why, in the face of\nthese risks, central banks' ability to maintain price stability will\ndepend on the clarity and transparency of their communications.\nPlease note that my comments today are my own. I do not presume\nto speak for any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nI. Why Maintaining Price Stability Requires More than Just Keeping\nInflation Low\nA few years ago, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan\nstated that \"price stability is best thought of as an environment in\nwhich inflation is so low and stable over time that it does not\nmaterially enter into the decisions of households and firms.\"1 This is a\nfairly common definition of price stability, and it has two essential\ncharacteristics. First, actual inflation must remain low and stable,\nand second, people must have every confidence that inflation will\nremain low and stable. This second characteristic may not get as\nmuch emphasis as it deserves. Price stability is more than keeping\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070611.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:03 PM]\n\n\fIs Price Stability Attainable? :: June 11, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ninflation in check - it also means keeping inflation expectations in\ncheck.\nOf course, actions speak louder than words, and ultimately, the\npublic will judge a central bank's resolve to keep inflation low and\nstable by whether it actually delivers low and stable inflation.\nExpectations can become unglued under some circumstances, even if\nthe current inflation measures appear contained. From time to time,\nthere are pressures on a central bank to \"buy\" relief from economic\ntroubles with artificially low short-term interest rates. The public\nunderstands these pressures, of course, and if they believe that their\ncentral bank will yield to the pressures, inflation expectations can\nrise. Also problematic is that inflation uncertainty can rise. Both of\nthese outcomes impose costs on the economy by misdirecting how\nresources are allocated. Most notably, long-term interest rates move\nhigher than they otherwise would, interfering with saving and\ninvestment decisions.\nCentral bankers face an unpleasant dilemma when inflation\nexpectations become unanchored. Central banks could validate these\nexpectations of rising inflation by actually delivering higher inflation,\nbut that outcome would be contrary to our policy objective.\nAlternatively, central banks could pursue policies that generate lower\ninflation than the public expected. This, in my opinion, is the correct\ncourse, but there can be costs in terms of lower short-term growth costs that would not be incurred if expectations had remained\naligned with the central bank's inflation goal in the first place.\nThe past quarter-century has brought\ncentral banks. But the credibility test\ncurrents are not so favorable. History\ncentral bankers, so if we are prudent,\nchallenges to price stability that may\n\nrelatively good times for\ncomes when the economic\nhas not always been kind to\nwe must prepare for the\nstill lie ahead of us.\n\nII. Potential Inflationary Risks Down the Road\nNow let me describe some potential risks that I believe could\nchallenge central banks down the road. Although there are many such\nrisks, this morning I will focus on three familiar risks: relative price\nshocks, extraordinary liquidity crises, and fiscal imbalances. Please\nnote that I do not regard these risks as imminent, but rather as\nrepresentative of the risks that central banks face from time to time.\nThe first inflationary risk can occur when large and persistent\nrelative price shocks temporarily ripple through the inflation data.\nThe obvious example is energy prices, although we see such changes\nin commodity prices more generally. These price pressures are\ntemporary and so do not represent changes in the inflation trend.\nStill, a central bank cannot ignore them if it hopes to maintain\ncredibility for delivering low and stable inflation.\nSince 2005, the three- to five-year moving average of U.S. inflation\nhas hovered around 3 percent.2 This is above where I would like to\nsee the trend settle in the longer run. The reality of rising oil and\ncommodity prices is evident, and my Federal Reserve colleagues and I\nhave been clear that we believe the impact of these influences will\ndissipate over time. But until our beliefs are validated by the data,\nthere is a risk that the public's trust could erode and inflation\nexpectations could move higher.\nThe second inflationary risk that central banks should be prepared for\ncould come about when responding to extraordinary liquidity crises.\nThis is an important lesson learned from experience. Just consider a\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/ForJhe_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070611.cfmt4/29/2014 2:06:03 PM]\n\n\fIs Price Stability Attainable? :: June 11, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nfew examples of what the world's major central banks have dealt\nwith in the past few decades: the U.S. stock-market crash of 1987,\nthe Asian currency crisis in 1997, and the collapse of the Brazilian\nreal in 1999.\nCentral banks have often provided liquidity in times of large-scale\nfinancial stress, and I think this is the appropriate response. But in\nany given case, there are still questions of how much to intervene,\nand for how long. How those questions are answered can have longerterm consequences for inflation expectations.\nIf central banks remove liquidity too quickly following a crisis,\nfinancial markets might not fully stabilize. However, if central banks\nmaintain an accommodative policy too long after a crisis has passed and the demand for liquidity has diminished - then inflation\nexpectations can come unglued and future inflation can take root.\nWe live in an era of financial innovation and increasingly integrated\nfinancial markets. Clearly, these changes have fostered a more\nsecure economic environment and have improved the wealthgenerating capacity of the global economy. But great change rarely\nproceeds without challenges. We need to explore how best to meet\nthose challenges in ways that will preserve the public's confidence in\nour commitment to price stability.\nThe final inflationary risk I want to emphasize is fiscal imbalances - in\nboth the United States and Europe.\nIn the 1970s, economists Tom Sargent and Neil Wallace gave us a\nlesson in \"unpleasant monetarist arithmetic.\" They noted that fiscal\nimbalances provide a temptation to inflate away the value of the\ngovernment's debt, and this possibility may become embedded in\ninflation expectations. Those lessons are even more relevant when an\nimportant share of a nation's debt is held abroad. The political cost of\ninflating away debt is lower when that debt is held by predominantly\nby foreigners.\nUnless the fiscal problem is addressed through explicit fiscal policies\nor changes in national saving rates, creditors might reasonably\nconclude that debtor governments will resort to inflationary policies.\nUltimately, however, central banks cannot control either fiscal policy\nadjustments or private consumption decisions. If fiscal dynamics don't\nimprove, central bankers could once again face the difficult challenge\nof maintaining price stability in a world where expectations are\nmoving in the wrong direction.\n\nIII. The Importance of Clear Communications\nSo what assurances can central banks provide to secure inflation\nexpectations in the face of these risks? Here, I believe, we are still\nlearning. We actually know very little about how the public forms its\nexpectations and the specifics about how best to secure them. In\nfact, just last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland held a\njoint conference with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas to better\nunderstand inflation expectations. Central banks from 22 countries\nwere represented, underscoring the universal interest in this topic.\nWhat seems clear enough is that without guidance from the central\nbank, the public is left to guess about future inflation based only on\nthe central bank's history. Clearly, history alone could be insufficient\nto hold expectations stable in times of crisis.3 And so central banks\nare developing strategies to provide that guidance.\nSuppose I asked you to describe the most important ways central\nbanks have changed in the past quarter-century. What would you say?\nFirst, I think you would say we have shown a much greater vigilance\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/ForJhe_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070611.cfmt4/29/2014 2:06:03 PM]\n\n\fIs Price Stability Attainable? :: June 11, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nagainst inflation. But second on that list, I think, would be that\ncentral banks today spend a lot of time communicating - about the\neconomy, about their policy objectives, and about the risks to\nachieving those objectives.\nIn the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee issues a\npress release immediately following our meetings, with minutes of\neach meeting released only a few weeks afterward. I can assure you\nthat every word and every nuance in our communications are\ncarefully considered. It is essential that the public understand our\ninterpretation of the economic situation and that they support our\npolicies. In a very real sense, our communications have become a\npart of the policy process, because we understand that influencing\ninflation expectations is an important dimension of monetary policy.\nSome central banks hold regular press conferences. And, of course,\nsome have established explicit numerical objectives - or inflation\ntargets - and publish economic projections that clearly show what\nthey are aiming at and how they expect to get there. Our different\napproaches are, in part, a result of our different histories and\ngovernance structures. But also, I think, central banks are still\ndeveloping \"best practices\" for securing inflation expectations in the\nface of unknown future risks.\nHowever, differences in tactics should not be confused with\ndifferences in intent. I believe that my colleagues - and indeed, most\ncentral bankers today - are working to achieve the same end. We are\nall trying to create an environment in which inflation is so low and\nstable that it does not influence the decisions that households and\nbusinesses would otherwise make.\n\nConclusion\nAt the present time, inflation expectations appear to be wellanchored. But we cannot afford to be complacent. However, I\ncontinue to be optimistic that central bankers will successfully meet\nthe challenges that lie ahead.\n\n[1] Alan Greenspan, \"Transparency in Monetary Policy,\" Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Review, July/August 2002, p. 6.\n[2] These figures are measured by the Consumer Price Index.\n[3] This issue is discussed at length by Ben Bernanke in \"Central Bank\nTalk and Monetary Policy,\" address to the Japan Society, October 7,\n2004.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070611.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:03 PM]\n\n\f"

I am also privileged to\nreceive this honorary degree.\nJohn Carroll University has been a cornerstone of academic progress\nfor more than 120 years, and you have certainly given our community\nand indeed our country a long list of distinguished leaders. I\ncommend you, Reverend Niehoff, for your extraordinary leadership\nand for fighting to provide educational opportunities to every\ndeserving student, regardless of family income. You are truly\nadvancing the American dream.\n\nSandra Pianalto\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nJohn Carroll University\nCleveland, Ohio\nMay 20, 2007\n\nThere is only one way to begin my remarks today and that is to say,\nCongratulations!\nCongratulations, first, to the parents and families of these wonderful\nyoung adults. I know that you have made a lot of sacrifices to make\nthis event possible - in terms of your time, your energy, and your\npocketbook. You have done a great job and you should be very proud.\nCongratulations, also, to the many talented professors and advisors\nwho have given so much of themselves to inspire these fine students.\nI know that you share in the pride we all feel today, and your efforts\nwill resonate for years to come.\nFinally, congratulations also to the graduates. I can assure you, that\nfrom a purely economic point of view, by getting this fine education,\nyou have enhanced your earning power. You have given yourself the\nbest possible start to a successful career and you have also\naccomplished something that only 30 percent of the adults in this\ncountry achieve.\nBut as great as your accomplishment is, many of the best lessons\nyou'll learn about how to succeed won't come from your formal\neducation at all. They will come from unexpected places. Some will\ncome from your families. Some will come from your friends. Some\nwill come from the workplace you will soon be entering. And maybe,\na couple of lessons will come from commencement speakers.\nSo today, I want to share with you some of the lessons I have\nlearned.\nThe first lesson is: Embrace uncertainty and change.\nI am sure that some of you are ready to head out into the world with\ncomplete confidence. However, for most of you, I suspect that\nconfidence is mixed with some anxiety. You are leaving behind your\nfriends, your professors and advisors, and the world you know, and\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070520.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:16 PM]\n\n\fCommencement Address :: May 20, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nmoving into unfamiliar territory - and you are not sure how you will\ndo.\nLet me assure you that I had butterflies in my stomach at my own\ncommencement. I walked across the stage, my diploma in hand, and\nheaded immediately to the airport to catch a plane to Washington,\nD.C., to interview for what became my first professional job, as a\nresearch assistant at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nI didn't realize back then that I was thoroughly unprepared. Not\nacademically, but in almost every other way. The truth was, I had no\nimmediate role models for the kind of life I was about to lead. My\nparents not only had never gone to college, they had only the\nequivalent of an elementary school education. They brought my\nfamily to America when I was five years old from a small village in\nthe Italian Dolomites called Valli del Pasubio.\nIt wasn't always easy, growing up in a family that didn't speak the\nlanguage and understand the culture of this country. But although my\nlack of know-how was sometimes painful, I can see now that in many\nways, it was the best possible preparation for success. Because so\nmany of my experiences were new, I was never able to be\ncomplacent.\nAnd my parents, who couldn't tell me how to fit in at school or at\nwork, set a fantastic example for how to embrace uncertainty and\nchange. In their thirties, they gave up everything comfortable and\nfamiliar and came to the United States, just so their children could\nhave opportunities that weren't available to us in Italy at that time.\nWhat sets America apart is the incredible adaptability of its people.\nHistory shows that economic progress resembles climbing a ladder,\nwhere each rung of the ladder is an innovation or a new stage in our\neconomic development. If we are not willing to let go of the rung\nwe're holding on to - even though it involves fear and loss as we\nabandon what is familiar and what is supporting us today - and reach\nfor the next rung, we cannot hope to reach greater heights. This is\ntrue for individual lives as well as for entire economies. We have to\nbe willing to accept butterflies in our stomach as the price of future\nprosperity.\nSo I urge you to embrace what you're feeling today - uncertainty,\nworry - and to accept it as a fact of an interesting life.\nWhich brings me to my second lesson: Never, ever stop learning.\nWherever your journey may take you from here, you will always need\nto learn more as your life and career unfold.\nThe good news for today's graduates is that not only have you earned\nyour degree, but more important, through the education you have\nreceived at John Carroll, you have learned how to learn. You have\nlaid the foundation for a lifetime of learning.\nIn my parents' generation, many people joined a company and stayed\nthere for their entire career. In my generation, the average person\nwill change jobs several times. I certainly did. Your generation may\nvery well wind up changing occupations several times. After all, many\nof the most interesting careers today - such as web designer or\nnanotech specialist - barely existed 10 years ago. And 10 years from\nnow, the most exciting jobs may well be in fields we cannot yet\nimagine.\nIn a world of constant change and incredible competition from all\ncorners of the globe, the truly successful people will be the ones who\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070520.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:16 PM]\n\n\fCommencement Address :: May 20, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ncontinue learning throughout their lives - both formally and\ninformally.\nI see this even at the top of the success ladder, with the CEOs I\nmeet. A generation ago, company leaders were supposed to know\neverything about their businesses, and they told everyone what to do\nand how to do it. They could never admit that they didn't know\nsomething. Today, it's just not possible to know everything - and if\nyou tried, you would look foolish. So today's successful CEOs\ndistinguish themselves by asking penetrating questions. And the best\nof them take every opportunity to learn.\nYou can learn something worthwhile from every experience. Even in\nthe most boring meeting - and trust me, I sit in on more than my\nshare - I try to learn at least one new thing from someone in that\nroom. The great thing about this habit is that it forces me to look at\nall people as potentially interesting. So I urge you to simply decide to\npay attention, and you will be amazed at the information you\nacquire.\nYou will meet a lot of people in your career who will not be able to\nhold a candle to you in terms of education or accomplishment. But\neach of them has some area of expertise that could prove very\nvaluable to you - if only you take the time to talk with them.\nThis leads me to the third lesson I want to share with you: To earn\nrespect, you have to give it.\nPerhaps some of you are like me, a first-generation college graduate,\nso you know firsthand not to disrespect the person who rings up your\ngroceries in a store or cleans your home or office.\nOr perhaps you have participated in John Carroll's social justice\nmissions, or simply listened carefully here, since justice and fairness\npermeate this university's teachings. In any case, you have surely\nlearned that the things that divide people - the way they look, the\nway they talk, and how much they own - are dwarfed by our common\nhumanity.\nHold onto this insight, because it can make your life richer.\nI have become a Federal Reserve Bank president, and I sit at the\npolicy table with Chairman Ben Bernanke, in large part because I\nhave always understood that everyone deserves to be treated with\nrespect. That recognition has allowed me to become a leader who\ncan draw out the best from the people I am lucky enough to lead.\nI watched my parents struggling with a new way of life. But I\nunderstood that they deserved respect - and my sense of justice was\nroused when it wasn't offered to them. They could not speak English\nvery well, but they were extremely successful. They accomplished\nwhat they intended to - they made it possible for their children to\nflourish.\nYou can never take full measure of someone's potential simply by\nlooking at them, or even by looking at their college transcript - which\nto some of you, may be a source of comfort. You can't always see the\ninner energy and talents of the person who scrubs floors or takes\nyour change at a store. And the children of those individuals may\nwell be powers to be reckoned with tomorrow.\nI hope you leave here determined to seek out the best in every\nperson you meet. It will not only identify you as a leader - it will also\ngive you a much richer and more enjoyable life.\nMy fourth lesson is: Define success for yourself. It's the only way to\nbe happy.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070520.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:16 PM]\n\n\fCommencement Address :: May 20, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nI can tell you that I get up every morning excited to go to my job. My\nfather got out of bed with just as much enthusiasm to go pour\nconcrete on a hot summer day. He was enthusiastic about his work\nbecause he was providing for his family, and that was what was\nimportant to him - that was his measure of success. My father taught\nme that to find satisfaction in your work, you must define your own\nsense of purpose.\nLife is short. So don't waste it trying to live up to someone else's\nmeasure of success. Define success in your own way.\nMaybe you will decide you want to try your luck in a distant place,\nthe way my parents did, abandoning the warm comfort of the culture\nand people you know.\nMaybe you will give up a job with a prestigious company in order to\nlaunch a start-up, or help to rebuild New Orleans, or turn a vacant\nlot into an urban garden.\nMaybe you will work obsessively for years to create lighter batteries\nfor electric cars, or a better curriculum for fourth graders, or more\nbeautiful clay pots.\nWhatever adventure is calling out to you, I hope you will choose to\nmeet your own expectations, instead of someone else's. Because if\nyou don't find your own reasons for working hard, the rewards will\ndisappoint you. So do the work you feel most passionate about - and\nmake sure that your definition of success is as broad as your dreams.\nLet me leave you with one final lesson: As important as work is work alone doesn't make a life. It is crucial to maintain a sensible\nbalance between your work and personal life.\nI'm not really sure who came up with this metaphor, but it has\nalways helped me. Imagine that in one hand you hold a rubber ball\nand in the other hand you hold a beautiful fragile glass ball. The\nrubber ball represents your work life. The fragile glass ball represents\nyour personal life - your family, your health, your friends.\nWhat happens if you drop the rubber ball? It will bounce. Someone\nwill pick it up for you, or it will just stay put until you are able to\npick it up again.\nBut if you drop the glass ball, it may smash into a million pieces. If\nyou are lucky, it will only crack - but either way, it will never be the\nsame again.\nDon't allow your justifiable concern with your career to cause you to\ndrop the precious ball that represents your family, your friends, and\nyour health.\nI want to end today by wishing you, our graduates, not just a\nsuccessful career, but a successful life. Take a few risks - bounce\nthat rubber ball if you need to. Learn from everyone you meet. Be\nkind. And be happy. Do these simple things, and we will all be\nastonished by what you accomplish.\nThank you and congratulations!\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070520.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:16 PM]\n\n\f"

In the United States, our Treasury Department takes the\nlead on exchange-rate policy. The Federal Reserve is responsible for\nachieving price stability and promoting maximum sustainable\neconomic growth. So my remarks today will not be a commentary on\nexchange-rate policies. Instead, I will focus on international reserve\ncurrencies. Specifically, I will discuss the characteristics of\ninternational reserve currencies and the benefits that a country - or\na region such as the Eurozone - can enjoy if its currency fulfills that\nrole. I will conclude with comments on why global currency\ncompetition provides an incentive for central banks to pursue and\npreserve price stability.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nComenius European Banking and\nFinancial Forum\nCzech National Bank - Praque, Czech\nRepublic\nMarch 27, 2007\n\nMy remarks today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the\nviews of any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Changes in Official Reserve Currencies\nI would like to begin by sharing a few statistics that will help convey\na sense of recent changes in official reserve currencies. Although my\ncomments pertain to official reserves - that is, assets held by central\nbanks, such as foreign government securities - many of my points can\nbe applied more broadly to private uses.\nSince the early 1990s, the world has witnessed a pronounced increase\nin the accumulation of foreign-exchange holdings. Almost all of this\nincrease has been concentrated among developing countries. Foreignexchange reserves have more than doubled as a share of developing\ncountries' international trade in the past 15 years and, moreover, the\ncomposition of these reserves has changed1\n\nWe have only limited information on the currency composition of\nthose reserves, but the data and anecdotal evidence indicate that\ndeveloping countries are adding euros to their portfolios faster than\nthey are adding dollars. At the end of 2001, developing countries held\n70 percent of their foreign-exchange reserves in dollar-denominated\nassets, but by 2006, this share had fallen to 60 percent. Valuation\nadjustments stemming from the dollar's depreciation since 2001\naccount for some of the decline in the dollar share, but not all of it.\nThe evidence suggests that the share of euros held in countries'\nreserve portfolios has increased. This appears to be consistent with\nthe widening of the European Union and the prospective growth of\nthe euro area. The euro now accounts for slightly less than 30\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070327.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:29 PM]\n\n\fThe Internationalization of National Currencies :: March 27, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\npercent of developing countries' portfolios, and it is the second-most\nwidely used international reserve currency. The British pound and\nJapanese yen remain well behind.\n\nThe Characteristics of International Reserve\nCurrencies\nWith this background in mind, let me turn to the general\ncharacteristics that define international reserve currencies.\nFor any currency to serve as an international reserve currency, three\nfeatures seem especially important: First, the currency must be\nwidely used in international transactions. Second, it has to be linked\nto deep and open financial markets. Finally, people need to have\nconfidence that the purchasing power of that currency will remain\nfairly stable2\n\nIt is easy to understand why countries with a large share of global\ntrade, or with large and active financial markets, would be more\nlikely to have their currency adopted as a global reserve asset. The\nlarger a particular nation's role is in international trade, the more\ncost-effective it will be for other countries to settle their\ninternational payments in that nation's currency.\nThese benefits are reinforced when funds expressed in the currency\ncan be moved efficiently from savers to businesses and\nentrepreneurs. This will happen when financial markets are safe,\ntrading volumes are high, and capital controls are kept to a\nminimum.\nA country will find its markets attractive destinations for global\nfinancial activity when its rules promote transparency and adequate\nrisk management. Those rules should seek to achieve the goals of\nsafety and soundness in the most efficient way. Thus, a wellfunctioning regulatory and supervisory environment is especially\nimportant in promoting the use of a nation's currency in international\ntransactions.\nOnce a currency is widely used for official and private transactions\naround the globe, and once it is widely held as a reserve currency,\nits use is likely to continue. However, that situation can change. If a\nmonetary authority fails to sustain confidence in the future value of\nits currency, participants in the global market will eventually find\nsubstitutes for the currency. One of the consequences of globalization\nis that substitutes do exist for any currency if policymakers allow its\npurchasing power to deteriorate.\n\nThe Benefits of Providing a Reserve Currency\nLet me briefly describe some of the benefits of providing an\ninternational reserve currency.\nThe United States benefits from the fact that the largest share of\nworld currency reserves are held in dollar-denominated assets.\nAmong these benefits is our ability to borrow from the rest of the\nworld at a low interest rate. Between 1980 and 2005, for example,\nthe income paid to foreigners who owned U.S. assets was 4.9 percent\non average. However, the income paid to Americans who owned\nforeign assets was 6.3 percent. In other words, the United States\neffectively borrowed at a discount of 1 / percent.\nSome people have argued that this spread partly reflects the fact\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/ForJhe_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070327xfmt4/29/2014 2:06:29 PM]\n\n\fThe Internationalization of National Currencies :: March 27, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nthat the United States tends to borrow from the rest of the world in\nthe form of safe, relatively short-term government debt, and much\nof U.S. lending to the rest of the world is in the form of foreign\ndirect investment or riskier, long-term debt. While there is truth to\nthis claim, I think that most people would agree that at least part of\nthe difference in returns on investment reflects a willingness by\nforeigners to pay a liquidity premium to hold assets denominated in\nU.S. dollars.\nAnother benefit of providing a reserve currency is more subtle. The\nconvenience of having others adopt your currency almost certainly\nbenefits your own citizens. When the world uses your currency, there\nare no intermediate steps between you and your trading partners\nwhen you trade on global markets. This makes life easier for\ndomestic businesses and consumers. It also may make it desirable for\nothers to utilize the financial markets and institutions of the reservecurrency country. As a result, those markets gain added breadth and\ndepth.\nThese benefits make it desirable for the world to choose your\ncurrency as an international reserve asset. Nations, then, will find it\ndesirable to pursue policies that make that outcome more likely.\n\nCurrency Competition\nThe willingness of individuals and governments to hold a particular\ninternational currency depends on how they view the stability of that\ncurrency's long-run purchasing power. A potential loss of purchasing\npower can erode the economic benefits associated with using any\nparticular currency for international trade. When viable alternatives\nexist, individuals and governments will gravitate toward the currency\nwith the most stable purchasing power.\nIn a Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland report, we took note of the\nfact that, in the current global environment, the market share of any\ninternational currency is \"contestable,\" or subject to challenge3. As a\nresult, substitutes are readily available for any currency that is losing\nits value too rapidly.\nIn a similar manner, Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner\nrecently argued that \"globalization, deregulation, and financial\ninnovation.have fostered currency competition that has led to\nimproved central bank performance and, hence, the recent conquest\nof worldwide inflation.4\" I agree with him. Monetary authorities have\na role to play in maintaining market share in a competitive\nenvironment by keeping inflation low and stable.\nAn important point in this regard was made a few years back by\nformer Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer5. Governor Meyer\nnoted that competition among currencies is not a zero-sum game. If\nbetter monetary and fiscal policies are developed by defending\nchallenges to any particular currency's role in the international\neconomy, then everyone stands to gain. Currency competition is\ntherefore useful; it creates a win-win situation, and is to be\nwelcomed.\nI truly believe that a nation or region benefits when its currency\nbecomes an international reserve currency. To sustain that status,\nthe monetary authority must show that it will remain committed to\nprotecting the purchasing power of its currency. Global competition\nfor international reserve currencies gives central banks an added\nincentive to pursue that goal.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070327.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:29 PM]\n\n\fThe Internationalization of National Currencies :: March 27, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nEnd Notes\n\n[1] Unless otherwise indicated, the reserve data come from the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).

As a Federal Reserve Bank\npresident and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, I\nspend a lot of time speaking to various audiences, both in my home\ndistrict and across the nation.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSouthwest Florida Speakers Assembly\nBonita Springs, Florida\nFebruary 9, 2007\n\nBut no matter where I go, I find that most people want to know more\nabout the Federal Reserve and what we do. Our organization seems\nto be somewhat of a mystery. So today, I hope to dispel some of that\nmystery for you. I will begin with some background on the basic\nstructure and operations of the Federal Reserve. Then I will offer\nsome perspective on economic growth. Finally, I will say a few words\nabout the inflation outlook.\nOf course, my remarks today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect the views of any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System: Structure and\nOperations\nLet me begin, then, with a brief overview of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, our nation's central bank. Congress created the Federal\nReserve System in 1913 and charged it with maintaining a safe,\nstable, and flexible monetary and financial system. To accomplish\nthis, we perform many functions, such as regulating and supervising\nbanks and providing financial services to commercial banks and the\nU.S. Treasury. The function that gets the most public attention,\nhowever, is monetary policy.\nFor a central bank, we have a decentralized structure. It consists of a\nseven-member Board of Governors, who are appointed by the\nPresident and located in Washington, D.C., and the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks located across the country. We often like to say that\nthe 12 Reserve Banks are private entities with a public purpose. Each\nbank is relatively autonomous, with its own charter and board of\ndirectors. In contrast with the members of the Board of Governors,\nthe Reserve Bank presidents are not political appointees.\nI lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. My district includes all\nof Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern\npanhandle of West Virginia. Bonita Springs is part of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Atlanta's district, which encompasses our nation's\nsoutheastern region. Our districts seem to have at least one\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070209.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:41 PM]\n\n\fA Policymaker’s Perspective on Monetary Policy and the Economy :: February 9, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nimportant thing in common - thousands of residents from my region\nspend the winter months in your region!\nReserve Bank presidents spend a lot of time learning about and\nunderstanding economic developments in our districts. This\nknowledge supplements national economic data and sometimes even\nalerts us to economic developments before they appear in the\nnational data. In that sense, we bring a regional voice to national\nmonetary-policy deliberations.\nConsistent with our decentralized structure, the Federal Reserve\narrives at its monetary policy decisions through the consensus of a\ncommittee. That committee is the Federal Open Market Committee,\nor FOMC. I serve on the FOMC, along with the seven Federal Reserve\ngovernors and the 11 other Reserve Bank presidents. Ben Bernanke is\nour chairman, and we meet in Washington, generally eight times a\nyear.\nThe Federal Reserve's decentralized structure also reflects and\nreinforces our independence. Monetary policy decisions are made\nwithout the direct input or the immediate approval of the other\nbranches of government. This helps keep monetary policy\nindependent of political pressures and influence. Nevertheless, we\nare independent within the government - not of the government.\nUltimately, we are accountable to Congress for achieving two\nobjectives: price stability and maximum sustainable economic\ngrowth.\nYou might wonder how monetary policy can attain these two\nobjectives at the same time. To be sure, these objectives can\nsometimes conflict, but over the long term, they are complementary.\nUltimately, the Federal Reserve promotes economic growth at its\nmaximum sustainable rate by maintaining a low and stable rate of\ninflation.\nThe FOMC sets a federal funds rate target as a guide for\nimplementing monetary policy. The federal funds rate is the interest\nrate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans of\nreserves. The FOMC essentially sets this rate, and by raising or\nlowering it, we contract and expand money and credit conditions in\nthe economy. If we do this job well, we affect economic activity and\ninflation in a way that achieves our two objectives.\nI make monetary policy sound like a fairly straightforward,\nmechanical exercise: Just set the federal funds rate target to\nmaximum sustainable economic growth and low inflation, and stand\nback. But, as you may well imagine, it's not quite that simple.\nAround the FOMC table, we literally spend hours discussing the latest\neconomic statistics and sharing our views on business and financial\nconditions, both here and abroad. Monetary policy decisions benefit\nfrom this kind of give-and-take, because economic growth is a\ncomplex and dynamic process.\n\nThe Long and Short of Economic Growth\nLet me take a few moments, then, to offer some perspective on\neconomic growth and the role that monetary policy plays. As a\nmonetary policymaker, it is helpful for me to try to distinguish\nbetween the long-term factors that affect our potential growth and\nthe short-term factors that create business-cycle fluctuations.\nLet's consider the long-term growth factors first. Generally speaking,\ntwo main factors - labor force growth and productivity - determine\nour nation's long-term potential for economic growth. When the\nworkforce grows, so too does our economic output. Likewise, when\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070209.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:41 PM]\n\n\fA Policymaker’s Perspective on Monetary Policy and the Economy :: February 9, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nour workforce is more productive, we can generate more goods and\nservices.\nDuring the second half of the 1990s, for example, labor force\nparticipation-that is, the share of the working-age population who\nchoose to be in the labor force - reached a record high. This trend\nhelped to elevate our nation's rate of economic growth. Over the\nnext few decades, though, I expect the labor force to grow more\nslowly, lowering our economic growth rate somewhat. Our population\nis aging, the baby boom generation is beginning to head into\nretirement, and the youngest adults are waiting longer to join the\nworkforce, primarily because they are spending more time continuing\ntheir education.\nThe second factor that influences our long-term potential for\neconomic growth is productivity. Many things, including scientific\ndiscovery, technological innovation, educational attainment, and\ninvestment patterns, affect productivity\nDuring the second half of the 1990s, an investment boom in\ninformation technology nearly doubled our rate of productivity\ngrowth. Combined with the rapid pace of growth in the labor force,\nproductivity gains helped the economy expand at nearly a 4 percent\npace during those years - well above average.\nMonetary policy was not divorced from this process. Obviously, the\nFederal Reserve cannot directly affect factors such as population\ngrowth and scientific discovery. But the investment boom that\ncontributed to our productivity growth benefited from confidence\nthat the Federal Reserve would keep inflation low and stable for\nyears to come. Low and stable inflation helps to foster low interest\nrates, which in turn encourage investment.\nMy opinion is more than just theoretical. We have seen that countries\nwith persistently high and variable rates of inflation eventually suffer\na decline in long-term economic growth. When inflation persists,\npeople become uncertain about future prices and costs. Instead of\nmaking investments in activities that encourage economic growth and\nemployment, they put their funds into things like land or\ncommodities to protect the value of their existing wealth. Over the\nlong run, we have seen that high and variable inflation distorts\npeople's economic decisions, lowers productivity, and typically\nreduces economic growth.\nSo we know that labor force and productivity growth determine our\nlong-term economic growth trend. But we also know that unexpected\nevents can temporarily push the economy off its longer-term path.\nOne recent example is the terrible tornadoes that your neighbors to\nthe north experienced last week. This natural disaster devastated\nhuman lives and the economic health of the communities that were\nhit.\nOn a larger scale, disasters like Hurricane Katrina can affect the\neconomic growth of the entire country for months afterward. I vividly\nrecall the FOMC meeting that occurred right after Katrina hit. All of\nus sat spellbound as we listened to Jack Guynn, who was president of\nthe Atlanta Reserve Bank at the time, give us a firsthand account of\nthe devastation on the Gulf Coast. At that time, nobody could really\npredict the extent of either the human toll or the damage to our\nenergy infrastructure. I can assure you that we all were very\nconcerned.\nOf course, it is not only natural disasters that can cause businesscycle fluctuations. Many other short-term factors - such as oil price\nhikes and financial market disruptions - can also cause economic\nshocks\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070209.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:41 PM]\n\n\fA Policymaker’s Perspective on Monetary Policy and the Economy :: February 9, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBy far, the most pronounced economic shock of the past year was a\ncontraction in the nation's housing market. The downturn in this\nsector has clearly pulled economic growth below its long-term\npotential.\nOf course, here in Lee County, you are well aware that the housing\nmarket has fizzled. Home prices here rose about 30 percent in 2005,\nmeeting or even exceeding the pace of price appreciation in other\nhot markets like Phoenix, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.\nNationally, rates of home appreciation have fallen since then. This is\ntrue in Lee County as well, where home prices have generally\nexperienced lower rates of appreciation rather than outright\ndeclines. And even though home building slowed significantly last\nyear, it was still the second strongest on record in Lee County.\nSome observers think that the worst of the national housing\ncontraction is behind us. That view may be premature, but the\nrecent data are encouraging. Home sales no longer seem to be\nfalling, and inventories of unsold homes have dropped a bit. And\neven though new homes under construction fell sharply last year\nfollowing several years of strong growth, most economists expect\nfurther declines to become less steep. Some industries, such as\nconstruction and home building supplies, have clearly felt the brunt\nof the housing market contraction, but by and large, we have seen\nlittle spillover to other sectors of the economy.\nUnfortunately, the FOMC can do very little to directly soften the\nhousing contraction. The supply and demand for housing must\neventually come into balance on its own. In fact, monetary policy has\nnever been successful at completely smoothing out short-term,\nbusiness-cycle fluctuations. We simply cannot fine-tune the\neconomy. One reason is that our economic data are always\nincomplete and do not paint a full picture of current conditions. For\nexample, we did not receive an estimate of the economy's growth in\nthe fourth quarter of 2006 until last week. And that number still\nremains an estimate, because it is based on preliminary and\nincomplete data.\nAnother reason we cannot fine-tune the economy is that, in the\nwords of the late economist Milton Friedman, monetary policy affects\nthe economy only with \"long and variable lags.\" This means that a\nchange in policy today can take many months before it begins to\naffect spending and prices, and perhaps years before its full impact\nis felt. As a result, the FOMC must always be looking well ahead when\nformulating monetary policy. And, although we are pretty good\nforecasters as forecasting goes, economic forecasting is not an exact\nscience.\nI don't mean to imply that monetary policymakers ignore short-term\neconomic fluctuations. We don't. Indeed, we calibrate our policy\nactions to have the best possible overall effect on short-term and\nlong-term economic conditions. But supply and demand factors in the\neconomy must ultimately adjust on their own. Our role is to provide a\nstable environment that enables these short-term imbalances to work\nthemselves out in the least disruptive manner. We do that by keeping\ninflation low and stable.\n\nA Word about Inflation\nNow let me say a few words about the inflation outlook. During the\npast few years, inflation has been high and quite volatile, largely due\nto fluctuating energy prices. Headline inflation rates rose to over 4\npercent in the third quarter of 2005.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070209.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:41 PM]\n\n\fA Policymaker’s Perspective on Monetary Policy and the Economy :: February 9, 2007 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGenerally speaking, brief periods of elevated inflation do not pose\nimmediate threats to economic growth. However, if inflation rates\nremain high for a prolonged period of time, people might reasonably\nbelieve that inflation has permanently shifted higher, and adjust\ntheir behavior accordingly. If that happens, the whole inflation\nenvironment could change for the worse - distorting investment\ndecisions, reducing productivity, and affecting economic growth.\nWe have not seen evidence of this. Measures of inflation expectations\nhave remained fairly stable even as actual inflation rates have moved\nhigher and become more volatile. Financial market participants\nappear to be confident that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy\nwill keep inflation contained.\nSince June 2004, the FOMC has moved the federal funds rate target\nup from 1 percent to 5-1/4 percent, where it stands today. We did\nthat in a steady sequence of 17 consecutive, quarter-point\nadjustments. At our past five meetings, we have decided not to\nchange the federal funds rate target. Holding the rate steady is giving\nus time to assess the full impact of our previous rate increases on\neconomic conditions and inflation.\nThe most recent inflation statistics have improved. The core\nConsumer Price Index - which excludes food and energy items - rose\nby about 2-1/2 percent last year. However, during the last three\nmonths of the year, this index increased at an annual rate of only\nabout 1-1/2 percent. I regard this movement as an encouraging sign,\nbut I am not yet convinced that the inflation trend is shifting down.\nThe national inflation picture has been clouded in the past few years\nby large swings in energy, commodity, and housing prices. As these\nmarkets normalize, and as we gain a clearer picture of the underlying\ninflation trend, we may see that some inflation risks remain. In that\ncase, some additional policy firming may be needed - depending, of\ncourse, on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.\n\nConclusion\nI remain convinced that low and stable inflation rates will help us\nprosper as a nation. I hope that my remarks today have helped to\ndispel some of the mystery surrounding the Federal Reserve and that\nI have helped you to better understand our commitment to price\nstability and maximum sustainable growth.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070209.cfm[4/29/2014 2:06:41 PM]\n\n\f"

This is the third year\nthat our Bank has sponsored a conference on education. Some of you\nmay be asking: Why is a Federal Reserve Bank, which is engaged in\nsetting national monetary policy, focusing on education? After all, the\nFederal Reserve's objectives for monetary policy are price stability\nand maximum sustainable economic growth.\nLet me share my enthusiasm for studying the connection between\neducation and economic growth. As president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, I serve the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which\nincludes Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky and the\npanhandle of West Virginia. After I was named president in early\n2003, I spent a lot of time meeting with business leaders throughout\nthe District. I found that my conversations with them were\ndominated by concerns about the economic challenges we were\nfacing as a region.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nConference on Universities,\nInnovation, and Economic Growth\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNovember 17, 2006\n\nAlthough the national economy was recovering from the recession,\nour District was not recovering at the same pace. Indeed, our District\nis still lagging the nation, especially in terms of employment growth.\nNationally, employment growth has rebounded. Nearly 3 1/2 million\nnet jobs have been created since the business cycle peak.\nIn the Fourth District states, however, employment has yet to return\nto its pre-recession levels. Indeed, we are still down by about 36,000\nnet jobs. This disappointing economic performance has caused our\nBank to devote more research to the factors that drive economic\ngrowth.\nEconomists at our Bank have been studying this aspect of the\neconomy for several years now. Recently, they have concluded that\ndifferences in state income levels over the past 75 years can be\nexplained mostly by two factors: innovation and education. In simple\nterms, those states that enhance their knowledge base are the ones\nthat are likely to prosper in the future.\nFor example, states that have a high degree of inventiveness - which\nis measured by the number of patents per resident - can gain\neconomic dividends that last for generations. The same is true for\neducation - residents of states that have a large share of highly\neducated graduates can produce significantly higher incomes.\nHere in Ohio, we are lagging the national average in terms of our\nlevel of educational attainment, and our advantage in patent\ncreation is not as large as it used to be. The hard truth is that having\na strong traditional manufacturing base no longer guarantees the\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:17 PM]\n\n\fUniversities, Innovation, and Economic Growth :: November 17, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nprosperity it once did. I don't mean to say that we should leave\nmanufacturing behind - it still provides a lot of value. However, a\nstate can improve its relative economic position by focusing on\ncompanies - including manufacturing companies -- that invest in new\nand innovative technologies.\nThe second way to make major gains is by investing in education. It is\ninteresting to note that Kentucky has made a lot of inroads in\neducation over the past generation. The state still has a low overall\nrate of educational attainment, but the numbers are moving higher.\nWith those gains, Kentuckians have also seen an improvement in their\nper capita incomes. Our keynote speaker today, Dr. Lee Todd, will\ntell us a bit about this story from his perspective as the president of\nthe University of Kentucky.\nOverall, our research shows that states with the highest share of\ncollege-educated adults - states like Massachusetts, Connecticut and\nColorado - have higher income levels. So it is in our best interest, no\nmatter where we live, to build up our \"stocks of knowledge\" through\ninnovation and education.\nHistory also gives us some interesting perspectives on what drives\nincome growth. It may be hard to imagine, but for nearly all of\nrecorded history there was virtually no per capita income growth.\nZero. Before the 19th century, the rate of population growth pretty\nmuch offset any gains from technology.\nThen came the Industrial Revolution, which ushered in a period of\nunprecedented innovation, invention, and income growth. Since\n1890, per capita income has risen by 10 times in the United States\nalone - from $5,000 to $50,000, measured in year 2000 dollars. Many\nexperts believe that the accumulation of knowledge and skills - or\nhuman capital - made the big difference in the success of the\nIndustrial Revolution.\nThe more skilled the population, the faster is the rate of innovation.\nSkilled labor then becomes more valuable and commands higher\nearnings. Higher earnings, in turn, create incentives for people to\nacquire more skills, or more human capital. Economists refer to this\nprocess as endogenous growth. It simply means that more innovation\nleads to higher skill accumulation, which leads to more innovation,\nand so on.\nUniversities truly stand at the crossroads of education and innovation.\nThey contribute to the process by educating their students - who are\nthen better prepared to innovate and work with new technologies\nand business practices -- and by conducting basic research.\nHowever, universities can play additional roles - seeking patents and\nthen selling or licensing the technology, incubating new businesses,\nsetting up faculty members in operating companies, helping to take\ncompanies public, and so on. Universities can even cooperate with\nlocal governments and private companies in their neighborhoods to\ncoordinate office space, transportation, housing, and retail space.\nIn yesterday's paper about technology transfer, Gerald Marschke and\nhis co-authors studied the diffusion of technology by looking at U.S.\npatent data. Essentially, they found that from the mid-1980s to the\nlate 1990s, industry increasingly turned to inventors who had\nuniversity research experience. The authors interpret this trend as\nevidence of growth in the influence of university research on\nindustrial innovation.\nSo we know that universities support economic growth by educating\nstudents, conducting basic and applied research, and fostering the\nformation of new business ventures. Do universities need to build a\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:17 PM]\n\n\fUniversities, Innovation, and Economic Growth :: November 17, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ncritical mass of activity in each of these activities in order to be\nsuccessful? And if they do, how big is big enough? Some of the\nexperts you will hear from today will share their ideas on how to get\nthere from where we stand now.\nWe should also ask ourselves what role public policy should play in\npromoting innovation and education. At a basic level, public support\nof universities makes a great deal of sense, since there is so much\npotential for society as a whole to benefit.\nThis support for universities can be directed in various ways. The\nwish list is long. Parents of university students want lower tuition,\nmore course offerings, and more connections between students and\nfaculty members. Faculty members want more time for basic research\nand may not be interested in commercial applications. Business\nleaders want greater access to university faculty and facilities for\ncommercial purposes. Local economic development agencies want to\nleverage the university presence for neighborhood development.\nClearly, universities cannot be all things to all people. Making the\nappropriate choices can be difficult for universities, because\ngovernments and communities have limited funds to support those\nchoices. The more we know about how universities can affect growth,\nthe better the choices we are likely to make.\nFor example, should government incentives encourage universities to\nincubate businesses that could become larger companies, or should\ngovernment incentives be focused more on basic research? Would\nsociety be better served if universities owned and managed their\npatents, or if universities sold their patents to others? After all,\nprivate companies conduct research, develop new products, and\ncreate new businesses. In what areas should universities compete\nwith the private business sector and in what areas should they\ncooperate? Until we have more concrete answers to these questions,\npublic policymakers should be mindful that their actions could\nimpede the process of innovation and human capital development.\nBesides the factors that lead to greater innovation, we would also\nlike to know how knowledge and technology spread throughout\nsociety at large. Suppose that innovation increases in settings with\nmore face-to-face contact, meaning that we should expect more\ninnovation in locations with large research centers. If so, perhaps\ngovernment should favor a smaller number of large research-intensive\nuniversities. In this case, what happens to people who do not live in\nthese locations? Are there ways to enhance the ability of these\npopulations to learn through publications and the Internet? Answers\nto many of the questions I have posed this morning can help promote\nboth regional growth and growth for the entire economy.\nToday, we plan to build on yesterday's session by hearing from a\ndistinguished group of people who make business or public policy\ndecisions every day that require an understanding of the relationships\nbetween universities, innovation, and economic development.\nThese experts cover the waterfront, from managing networks of\nfederal research labs, to running a large, flagship state university, to\ncoordinating tech transfer and economic development at two\nneighboring universities. Other experts lead new business\ndevelopment inside a Fortune 100 company and direct science and\ntechnology policy in one of our fastest-growing states. We will also\nhear from a panel of venture capitalists.\nBy the end of the day, I expect that we will begin to see a\ncomprehensive and realistic picture of what it takes to transform\nideas into bankable companies that contribute to regional prosperity.\nWe hope this information will be beneficial in helping our region\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:17 PM]\n\n\fUniversities, Innovation, and Economic Growth :: November 17, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\naddress its challenges.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:17 PM]\n\n\f"

I will begin with some perspectives on\nthe goals and direction of monetary policy. Then I will describe how\nwe as a nation are transitioning to a slower pace of economic\ngrowth. Finally, I will talk about some of the risks that I see to our\neconomic outlook.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Address: Pittsburgh Business\nTimes 2006 CFO of the Year Awards\nPittsburgh, PA\nNovember 6, 2006\n\nThe Goals and Direction of Monetary Policy\nLet me begin, then, with some background on monetary\npolicymaking. We routinely hear and read in the financial media\nabout decisions that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC,\nmakes, but I find that few people know very much about the FOMC\nand how it operates. This Committee is the policymaking body of the\nFederal Reserve - the group that sets the direction for short-term\ninterest rates. The FOMC consists of the seven members of the Board\nof Governors, plus the 12 Reserve Bank presidents. We meet eight\ntimes a year in Washington.\nThe FOMC's objectives are to maintain price stability - meaning a low\nand stable rate of inflation over the long term - and to promote\nmaximum sustainable economic growth.\nWe use the federal funds rate - that is, the interest rate at which\nbanks lend money to other banks overnight - as our main policy\ntool. By adjusting the target for this rate, we are trying to make\nsure that the financial system accommodates the economy's needs for\nmoney and credit. It is a delicate balance. Adding too much money\nand credit might cause the demand for goods to increase faster than\ntheir supply, which will eventually generate inflation. Adding too\nlittle money and credit can slow demand relative to supply and\nultimately depress prices.\nIn judging where to set the target for the federal funds rate, we\nevaluate many aspects of the economic environment. Of course,\ncurrent conditions in the economy play an important role. But\nbeyond how the economy is performing now, we must also look\nforward, because where we set the funds rate today affects the\nperformance of the economy and inflation in the future.\nIn fact, setting the federal funds rate target is a little like throwing a\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061106.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:33 PM]\n\n\fMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook :: November 6, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nforward pass in a football game. Any good quarterback knows that\nyou cannot just throw the ball to where the receiver is when you see\nhim. You have to throw the ball to where you think he will be by\nthe time the ball gets downfield. So it is with setting the federal\nfunds rate. It is not just where the economy is positioned today that\nmatters, but also where we think it is headed. That's a little free\nadvice for Ben Roethlisberger.\nEnough about football - I am more knowledgeable about monetary\npolicy. Let's consider the FOMC's recent policy moves for a moment.\nIn June of 2004, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate for the first\ntime in almost four years. At that time, we did not know by how\nmuch we would need to raise the funds rate - that would depend on\nhow the economy evolved. But we knew it had to go considerably\nhigher to avoid the risk of inflation taking hold. So, in a series of 17\nquarter-point adjustments over a two-year period, the FOMC has\nbrought the federal funds rate from a low of 1 percent to 5-1/4\npercent, where it stands today.\nAt our last three meetings, we decided to leave the federal funds\nrate target unchanged. Holding the rate steady is giving us time to\nassess the full impact of our 17 rate increases and to see how\neconomic conditions unfold over the near term.\n\nTransitioning to a Slower Pace of Economic\nGrowth\nSo how do I see economic conditions unfolding? In a\nnutshell, I see the economy growing at a slower pace than it did over\nthe past few years, but as I will explain, I don't think we should be\noverly concerned about this somewhat slower pace of growth.\nWhen I think about changes in economic activity, I tend to\nseparate them into two categories: those that reflect short-term\nchanges in supply or demand, and those that reflect longer-term\nsupply or demand factors. The economy's performance at any\nparticular time reflects a combination of these short-term and\nlonger-term developments.\nIdentifying the longer-term factors - and assessing how they\nmay be changing - can give us a baseline for estimating longer-term\neconomic growth. Two of the most important forces in our economy\nthat affect longer-term growth are the number of people working\nand how productive they are. In simple terms, these two factors\nalone determine how much an economy can produce. When the\nworkforce grows, so too does our economic output. Likewise, when\nwe are more productive, we can generate more goods and services.\nTake the second half of the 1990s. Innovations in information\ntechnology generated gains in productivity that were a full\npercentage point greater than they had been over the previous two\ndecades. At the same time, labor force participation - the share of\nthe working-age population who choose to be in the labor force - was\nat an all-time high. The result was the \"roaring '90s,\" when the\neconomy grew much faster than its average rate during the post­\nWorld War II period.\nAlthough we can expect productivity growth to remain strong\nthroughout this decade, growth in our workforce has started to slow\na bit. Our population is aging, and the baby boom generation is\nincreasingly heading into retirement. I know that this development is\na concern here in Allegheny County, whose population has the\nsecond-highest average age of any large county nationwide.\nThe point is that we cannot take the economic boom that we saw at\nthe end of the 1990s as an appropriate guide for what to expect in\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061106.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:33 PM]\n\n\fMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook :: November 6, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nthe years to come. As our population ages, we should expect a\nsomewhat slower baseline rate of economic growth going forward. If\nthe labor force grows more slowly, output should grow more slowly as\nwell. This would not mean that the economy is performing poorly,\nbut that there are structural limitations to how rapidly it can expand.\nSo what about the short-term fluctuations in economic activity I\nmentioned? How should we think about these in the context of the\neconomic outlook? These are changes in economic activity that\ntemporarily push the economy off its baseline growth path. They can\nappear in the form of booms or busts.\nThe housing sector is a perfect example. The United States enjoyed a\nhousing boom over the past few years, with more than 7 million new\nhomes built since 2000. This resulted in the highest homeownership\nrates in history. During the past year, however, home building has\nfallen off sharply, with a particularly steep decline in the third\nquarter. The supply of unsold homes on the market has risen to\nlevels we have not seen in more than 10 years.\nThe housing boom lifted economic growth above its baseline in the\nearly part of the decade, but the housing slump we are experiencing\nnow is pushing economic growth below that baseline over the near\nterm. For this reason, and as a result of the longer-term factors I\noutlined earlier, I expect the economy to grow at a more moderate\npace over the next few years than we saw in the past couple of\nyears.\n\nTwo Risks to the Outlook: Housing and\nInflation\nStill, there are risks to this scenario. The first risk is that the\nweakness in housing will spill over to other sectors of the economy.\nThe second risk is that inflation will remain too high.\n\nHousing\nLet me speak to the housing risk first. Most of the data suggest that\ninvestment in new housing will remain weak at least through 2007.\nSurveys tend to confirm this outlook. Both consumers and builders\nreport much less confidence in the housing markets than they did a\nyear ago.\nNevertheless, we need to remember that the current decline in home\nbuilding follows a dramatic increase in recent years. In other words,\nthe downturn is coming off a very high base. Still, I recognize the\npossibility that this situation could get worse before it gets better. If\nfurther declines in the housing sector are abrupt, and if home prices\nfall sharply, we could see spillover effects in other parts of the\neconomy. One obvious area that could be affected is consumer\nspending.\nWhy could consumer spending be affected? During the late 1990s and\nearly 2000s, homeowners often tapped into the appreciating value of\ntheir houses by refinancing and taking out home equity lines of\ncredit. Some homeowners also may have felt wealthier, saving less\nand spending more than usual. If home prices continue to fall, as\nthey have begun to do recently, we may see this reflected in weaker\nconsumer spending. This concern might be a little less pronounced\nfor those of us in western Pennsylvania and Ohio, where, in general,\nour home values have appreciated by only about half as much as the\nnational average.\nFortunately, despite the housing risks I have described, other sectors\nof the economy still look pretty good. For the most part, consumers\nare still buying things. Businesses are still investing in new plants and\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061106.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:33 PM]\n\n\fMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook :: November 6, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\noffice buildings. And foreign economic activity also remains strong,\nwhich provides an additional source of demand for our goods and\nservices. Certainly the tone in labor markets has been very positive\nlately. Continued hiring suggests a high level of business confidence\nabout economic growth next year.\nThink of it this way. We seem to have two economies at\nwork - the housing economy, which is experiencing a very large\nadjustment, and the \"everything else\" economy, which is performing\nfairly well.\n\nInflation\nThe second risk to the economic outlook is the notable\nincrease in inflation we have seen over the past few years.\nUnlike the housing contraction, the current elevated inflation rate\ndoes not pose an immediate threat to economic growth. However, if\nthe inflation rate fails to move lower, people might believe that\ninflation has permanently shifted higher, and then adjust their\nbehavior accordingly. If that happened, the whole inflation\nenvironment could change for the worse - distorting investment,\nreducing productivity growth, and affecting economic growth in the\nlong-run.\nHow did inflation become a risk? How did inflation move from about\n1 percent in 2003 to roughly 3 percent this year? In large part, the\nanswer can be traced to the rapid increase in energy prices we have\nexperienced. Oil prices are more than three times what they were in\nearly 2002, rising from roughly $20 a barrel then to nearly $70 a\nbarrel in recent months.\nOil prices have recently moderated somewhat, bringing down the\n\"headline\" rate of inflation - what is commonly referred to as the\nConsumer Price Index. However, core consumer price inflation which excludes energy and food items - remains at a higher level\nthan I would like. The reason for this is that the production of almost\neverything we use requires energy. The continuing price increases\noutside the energy sector are partly a reflection of prior increases in\nenergy and commodity prices being passed through to the prices of\nother goods and services. We still don't know how these increases\nwill work their way through the system.\nBut there is some good news. Consumer and business expectations\nabout inflation have remained fairly stable, despite the run-up in\ninflation over the past couple of years. We have many measures of\ninflation expectations to look at, but they all generally suggest that\nlong-term inflation expectations are holding steady. This suggests\nthat financial markets believe that the Federal Reserve's monetary\npolicy will bring the trend in inflation back down.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum things up, I expect the economy to weather the recent\nchallenges in the housing market. Of course, we are not entirely out\nof the woods with respect to the housing risk, but I do not expect\nconditions in the housing market to spill over into the broader\neconomy in a meaningful way. I fully expect the economy to\ncontinue to grow at a moderate, but sustainable, pace.\nThe inflation outlook is a slightly different story. I do not\nbelieve that inflation will accelerate further. In fact, I expect some\nslowing in the rate of inflation as recent energy price changes and\nthe effects of monetary policy actions work through the economy.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061106.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:33 PM]\n\n\fMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook :: November 6, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBut some risk remains that inflation will not recede into a range\nconsistent with the FOMC's price stability objective. In that event, it\nis possible that some additional monetary policy restraint would be\nrequired.\nI hope that my remarks here tonight have helped to shed some light\non the monetary policy issues you have been reading and hearing\nabout.

I will start by\ndiscussing our structure and some of our functions. Then I will share\nmy perspective on being a national monetary policymaker on the\nFederal Open Market Committee. Finally, I will share a few thoughts\non the economy here in Northeast Ohio and some of the challenges\nwe are facing.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nJohn Carroll University\nCleveland, OH\nOctober 5, 2006\n\nI. A Brief Overview of the Federal Reserve\nSystem\nLet me begin, then, with a little \"Fed 101.\" As you know, the Federal\nReserve is our nation's central bank. It plays a unique role in our\neconomy, and it has a unique structure that draws from both the\npublic and private sectors.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was created by an act of Congress in 1913 and\ncharged with creating a safe, stable, and more flexible monetary and\nfinancial system. These responsibilities are carried out by 12 regional\nReserve banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne of the Federal Reserve's great strengths is this decentralized\nstructure. The public aspect of the System is represented by the\nseven governors on the Federal Reserve Board, who are appointed by\nthe President of the United States to 14-year terms.\n\nThe private aspect of the System is represented by the 12 regional\nReserve Banks. Each of these Banks has its own charter and is\ngoverned by an independent board of directors, under the general\noversight of the Board of Governors.\n\nI lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. My district-the Fourth\nDistrict-includes all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky,\nand the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Cleveland is our\nheadquarters, and we also have branch offices in Pittsburgh and\nCincinnati.\nLike the other 11 Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland cooperates with the Board of Governors in supervising\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nbanks in our respective regions. We also conduct research on\nnational and regional economic conditions; we provide financial\nservices to banks and the U.S. Treasury; and we are a resource for\npeople and organizations that are involved in community economic\ndevelopment.\n\nEach Reserve Bank works to understand the unique\ncharacteristics of its District. By better understanding the forces that\nshape our regional economies, we can better develop sound monetary\npolicy for the nation.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the group\nthat is responsible for setting monetary policy. As president of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, I serve on this Committee, along\nwith the eleven other Reserve Bank presidents and the seven\nmembers of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\nThe FOMC has a dual mandate from Congress: first, to maintain price\nstability over the long term-that is, to keep inflation under controland second, to promote maximum sustainable economic growth. We\nseek to achieve these objectives by influencing interest rates and the\nmoney supply.\n\nThe main monetary policy tool we use is targeting the federal funds\nrate-that is, the interest rate that banks charge each other for\novernight loans. Changes in this rate, in turn, affect a host of other\nshort-term interest rates and economic variables.\n\nII. My Role as a Federal Reserve Policymaker\nNow I would like to give you more of an insider's perspective on my\nrole as a Federal Reserve policymaker. It is a fascinating process,\nand one that I find challenging and energizing.\n\nThe FOMC meets in Washington, D.C., generally eight times a year.\nMost of our meetings last for a single day, although the Committee\nhas been scheduling some two-day meetings to discuss special\ntopics.\n\nI happen to be a voting member on the FOMC this year. I rotate that\nresponsibility with the president of the Chicago Reserve Bank every\nother year. But whether or not I vote during a particular year, I\nparticipate fully in the policy discussions at every meeting.\nAs you can imagine, I put a lot of work into my role as a\nFederal Reserve policymaker. I constantly review the latest national\nand international economic statistics. Economists throughout the\nFederal Reserve System pore over the data, conduct research, and\ncreate models to project economic activity. A big part of my\npreparation for the FOMC meetings essentially involves sifting through\nthe different explanations that might lie behind the national\nstatistics.\n\nVery often, the official data that are available are just not current\nenough for a forward-looking enterprise like monetary policy. So to\nprepare for FOMC meetings, I must rely not only on my team of\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\neconomists-as talented as they are-but also on people in the\ncommunity. Input from businesspeople and consumers provides me\nwith reliable information on the economy far ahead of when the\nofficial statistics are released.\n\nYou might think of the statistical data that we gather on the\neconomy as being like the readout on your car's dashboard: All of the\ninformation is meant to tell you what is happening to your car, but it\ntypically does not tell you why it is happening. When the oil light on\nyour car's dashboard comes on, you know that the oil level is\nprobably low, but you don't know why. Maybe there's a leak, or\nmaybe your mechanic left the cap off the reservoir. To find out, you\nhave to look under the hood.\n\nMeeting with people is my way of looking under the economy's hood.\nThe conversations enable me to understand the why behind the\nwhat. They help me judge which of the various explanations being\noffered for the condition of the national economy is most reasonable.\n\nI take these stories and lessons I learn from them to Washington.\nThey allow me to attach reality-not to mention human faces and\nvoices-to what would otherwise be seemingly sterile statistics. This\ninformation plays a key role in shaping our national policy decisions.\n\nA typical FOMC meeting begins with the Board of Governors' staff\npresenting their projections for the domestic and international\neconomy. Each participant at the table can ask the staff questions\nabout the projections. Then we have what is known as a \"go-round,\"\nwhere each FOMC participant provides comments on the economy\nand the economic outlook. As part of their commentary, the 12\nFederal Reserve Bank presidents present their views on economic\ndevelopments in their respective regions.\n\nAfter the discussion about the current economic situation and\noutlook, the Committee members turn their attention to policy. To\nframe that conversation, the Board of Governors' staff suggests a few\npolicy alternatives, and then the Committee members offer their\nview. We vote on our decision, which is formally called a \"policy\ndirective,\" and then discuss how best to explain it to the public. We\nrelease our decision to the public at about 2:15 in the afternoon.\n\nA more complete summary of the meeting is provided in the meeting\nminutes, which are released three weeks following each meeting.\nFull meeting transcripts are made available after five years.\n\nAfter hearing my short description, it may sound as if the FOMC\nmeetings are very rigid and formal affairs, but I want to emphasize\nthat there is always a great deal of interaction and collegiality\naround the table. I think of the meetings not so much as discreet\nevents, but rather as part of an ongoing dialogue and debate. Over\nthe course of time, we have some complex and fascinating\ndiscussions that help to inform all of our thinking.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nAlthough the process itself is fairly straightforward, the judgments\nassociated with monetary policy are not always as obvious as they\nmight appear. Economic conditions can be unpredictable, and we are\nunder no illusion that we are perfect forecasters. To paraphrase\nformer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, we are essentially\nrisk managers. We need to make policy choices that stand the best\nchance of moving us toward our objectives, given our imperfect\nunderstanding of the changing environment around us.\n\nI mentioned earlier that the FOMC's objectives are price stability and\nmaximum sustainable economic growth. As a practical measure, we\nlook at the growth rate of a number of \"core\" inflation measures to\nassess price stability in the short- to medium run. As you may know,\ncore measures of inflation strip out some of the more volatile\ncomponents of the price indexes, such as food and energy.\n\nFor maximum sustainable economic growth, we try to support the\nexpansion of gross domestic product, or GDP, near its \"potential.\"\nThe tricky part is that the economy's potential growth rate can\nchange over time. Some changes are temporary ones-such as when\nwe have energy price shocks. But some changes are more\npermanent-for instance, when new technological advances lead to\nmajor upward shifts in productivity, or when changes in the trend of\nlabor force participation affect the labor supply. These changes\nmake it difficult to measure potential GDP reliably.\n\nAlthough we have more than one objective, I believe that in the long\nrun, maintaining price stability is the unique contribution that the\nFederal Reserve can make to promoting maximum sustainable\neconomic growth. In many, if not most, cases this is true in the short\nrun as well. The bottom line is that you cannot achieve long-run\ngrowth without price stability.\n\nThose are the basics of the Federal Reserve and monetary policy. I\nwant to emphasize that although monetary policy is national in\nscope-meaning that the FOMC makes decisions based on what is best\nfor the country as a whole-we are well aware that different regions\nof the country face their own special circumstances and challenges.\n\nAs we saw last year, some regions, like the Gulf Coast, can face\nsudden and catastrophic changes, while others, like our region, are\nin the process of responding to longer-term structural changes.\n\nIII. Economic Transition in Northeast Ohio\nI would now like to take a few minutes to discuss the economic\nchallenges that we are currently facing in Northeast Ohio. More than\nfour million people live in the 15 counties that make up Northeast\nOhio. After a century of relying on the heaviest types of traditional\nindustry-coal, steel, autos, rubber, and electrical equipment-we have\nbeen deeply affected by global trends, including rapidly changing\ntechnology and increased international trade.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nDeep currents of change have swept over our industrial landscape.\nEconomists call this process \"creative destruction.\" Creative\ndestruction is a natural, and indeed a necessary, part of our\neconomic development. As familiar industries of the past are\nreplaced by the innovative technologies that will shape our future,\nresources are redirected to wherever they are most productive.\nCapital and creative energy will flow toward the new goods, services,\nand processes that will deliver the greatest value, and jobs will\neventually follow.\n\nOf course, creative destruction can be an uncomfortable process, but\nin reality it is the absence of this ebb and flow that should concern\nus. There is some evidence to suggest that a weak level of creative\ndestruction can help explain why employment and economic growth\nhave been less robust in our region than in other parts of the\ncountry. Here in Ohio, we have had a lower rate of job creation than\nthe nation over the past few decades, as you might guess. But you\nmight also be surprised to hear that we have also had a lower rate of\njob destruction.\n\nDuring the past few years, Ohio's rate of job destruction has been\nmoving up, closer to the national average. This may be a promising\nsign that Ohio's labor market is moving toward a more dynamic state.\nHowever, we still need to see rates of job creation move higher\nbefore our state's economy becomes dynamic enough to sustain\nhealthy growth.\nWhat can be done to encourage a more dynamic economy?\nOne critical thing we need to do is to improve the levels of\neducational achievement in Ohio. A growing body of research\nsuggests that education is a key component of an area's economic\ngrowth prospects. This is not hard to understand, especially in a\nglobal economy which seems to put an increasing premium on highly\nskilled workers.\n\nWhat is perhaps surprising, however, is that this is not a recent\nphenomenon or an outgrowth of the computer age. As a matter of\nfact, in a recent research project, economists at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland considered a number of factors that might explain\ndifferences in the relative income levels among the states in our\ncountry. They found that the best predictor of a state's relative\nincome position is its so-called \"stock of productive knowledge,\" as\nmeasured by levels of educational attainment and patents, and that\nthis has been the best predictor since the 1940s.\n\nBack then, differences in high-school graduation rates were a key\ndriver of differences in income levels across the states, and Ohio\nranked 19th in the country in high school completion. We also\ntended to produce significantly more patents per person than the\nnational average-about one and a half times more. Since the 1960s,\nhowever, Ohio's patents per person have declined to about the\nnational average.\n\nOhio also does not fare very well in the measure of educational\nattainment that matters most today-college graduation rates. In this\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ncategory, Ohio ranks 39th out of the 50 states in the share of its\nresidents who have earned baccalaureate degrees. Not surprisingly,\njust as Ohio's patent production and educational attainment have\nfailed to keep pace with most of the country, Ohio's per capita\nincome-which was once above the national average-has also not kept\npace with the national average for more than two decades now.\n\nIt is very interesting to know that some of the challenges we are\nfacing in Ohio are very similar to those facing policymakers in Italy.\nEven today, in 2006, only about 11 percent of Italians hold college\ndegrees. Italian officials I have met with said that they were envious\nof the education attainment in our country, where about 28 percent\nof the adult population has a college degree.\n\nAll of us want to build a sound foundation for future economic\nprosperity. I believe that one of the most promising ways to do that\nis to create a civic culture that supports education. I am proud to be\na part of a statewide group -- the Ohio Business Alliance for Higher\nEducation and the Economy - that is working to increase the strategic\nrole of our colleges and universities in contributing to Ohio's\neconomic growth.\n\nAs we look ahead, our prospects for building a stronger regional\neconomy will depend on our commitment to invest in intellectual\ncapital. The knowledge base of our students and the technological\nskills of our workers will be critical for our future prosperity. I am\nconvinced that the investments we make in education today-if other\nconditions are right-will serve as a springboard for economic growth\ntomorrow.\n\nI am confident that our region has a solid foundation for future\ngrowth for several reasons:\nWe have a wealth of established companies and a promising array of\nemerging technology firms.\nWe have a large concentration of financial expertise and legal talent.\nWe have fine public and private universities, such as John Carroll,\nand an outstanding health-care sector.\nWe have outstanding natural and cultural resources.\nMost important, we have talented, committed people who enjoy\nliving and working here.\n\nConclusion\nI hope that I have offered you a bit more insight on the Federal\nReserve System, the Federal Open Market Committee and the\nNortheast Ohio economy.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\f"

Economists throughout\nthe Federal Reserve System pore over the data, conduct research,\nand create models to project economic activity. But I also rely on\nconversations I have with business leaders to get a better sense of\nhow you see economic conditions and the prospects for business going\nforward.\n\nCopper Development Association,\nGlobal Market Trends Conference\nWyndham Drake Hote, Oak Brook,\nIllinois\nSeptember 8, 2006\n\nFor example, last month, right before the Federal Open Market\nCommittee meeting, one of the CEOs of a very large manufacturing\nfirm in my District called to tell me about a manufacturing trade\nassociation meeting he had just attended. He said that rising copper\nprices dominated the discussions at that meeting. He told me that\nfrom the perspective of those in attendance, the rise in copper prices\nwas not totally demand driven - other factors were driving up copper\nprices.\nUnderstanding why the prices of commodities, like copper, increase\nor decrease is one of the many pieces of the puzzle that we as\npolicymakers try to fit together to help us figure out how the\neconomy and inflation will perform in the future.\nAs I am sure you are well aware, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or FOMC, decided to keep the federal funds rate target\nunchanged at our last meeting on August 8. Although I cannot speak\nfor any of my colleagues on the Committee, let me explain what was\nbehind my decision to support a pause at that meeting.\nAlthough the elevated inflation numbers concerned me, and indeed\nthey still do, the overall pace of economic activity - especially\nhousing activity - had begun to moderate, and the full effect of the\nFOMC's previous rate increases had not yet been felt. I viewed the\npause as appropriate to give me the chance to accumulate more\ninformation before judging whether additional policy firming would\nbe needed.\nAnother important element in my thinking was the stability of\ninflation expectations. I will quote directly from the minutes of the\nAugust 8 meeting here: \"Following 17 consecutive policy firming\nactions, members generally saw limited risk in deferring further\npolicy tightening that might prove necessary, as long as inflation\nexpectations remained contained.\"\nI put special emphasis on inflation expectations because that is the\ntopic I would like to discuss with you this morning. In particular, I\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nwant to explain why it is vitally important that the central bank - the\nFederal Reserve - anchor inflation expectations in order to best\npromote sustainable economic growth.\nI will begin by explaining how inflation - which Congress has\nmandated the Federal Reserve to control - is conceptually different\nfrom relative price increases. Then I will talk about why keeping\ninflation expectations anchored is so important to our nation's\nprosperity. Finally, I will describe some of the measures I use to\ngauge inflation expectations and why it is important to continue to\nlearn more about inflation expectations.\n\nI. What Is Inflation and How Is It Different\nfrom a Relative Price Increase?\nLet me begin by making a crucial distinction - between inflation and\na relative price increase.1 People often see price increases in some\nof the items they buy and assume that a period of inflation has\nbegun. However, inflation is a condition that affects all prices, not\njust the price of particular goods or services.\nConsider copper prices. As of yesterday, copper prices were roughly\nseven times higher than they were in 1965. Now, I might conclude\nthat the resource costs of obtaining copper are now seven times\nhigher than they were forty-some years ago. But we all know that's\nnot true.\nThe truth is that, despite large swings up and down, the relative\nprice of copper - that is, its price relative to the average of all prices\n- tended to fall for much of the period from the mid-1970s through\n2001.2 Over the past several years, the relative price of copper has\nshot up, of course, but even with this sharp increase, the relative\nprice is nowhere near seven times its 1965 level.\nCopper prices have not risen that much more than all prices, on\naverage. The fact is that all prices, on average, have risen five-fold\nin the past forty years. This five-fold increase in all prices is inflation.\nChanges in relative prices--that is, the prices of individual items\nrelative to the average of all prices--are quite different from\ninflation. Changes in relative prices reflect changes in the supply and\ndemand conditions in specific markets. Sometimes we experience\nsuch a large and persistent relative price change that it temporarily\nripples through the inflation data. The obvious example is energy\nprices.\nToday, energy prices are greatly increasing the costs faced by\nvirtually every business and household in our country. Purchasing the\nsame amount of gasoline or heating oil as we did a couple of years\nago requires us either to earn more, save less, or purchase fewer\nnon-energy items. Adjusting to higher energy prices requires us to\nmake real sacrifices. The Federal Reserve cannot offset these costs\nbecause we do not create oil.3\nNevertheless, the Federal Reserve can still control inflation over the\nmedium to longer term. How can we control the average price level\nover time? To paraphrase a famous economist, Irving Fisher, the\naverage price level doesn't rise because of the goods; it rises because\nof the money.4 Simply put, if growth in money exceeds its demand,\nits purchasing power will depreciate. This is inflation. It affects all\nprices and wages, and ultimately it has only one origin, the central\nbank. This is because the central bank is solely responsible for\n5\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nmanaging the nation's money supply.\nI think most people recognize the importance of allowing individual\nprices to move up and down relative to one another. At the same\ntime, I think that most people would agree that allowing the value of\nour money to depreciate over time is bad for economic prosperity.\nBut just what is it about inflation that is so costly? How is it that\ninflation uses up precious resources?6 Well, it turns out that the\nlasting harm to our economy comes when a sustained period of\ninflation changes inflation expectations. This, in turn, affects the\ndecisions that households and businesses make. Let me turn to that\ntopic in more detail.\n\nII. Why Anchoring Inflation Expectations Is\nImportant to Prosperity\nBack in 1968, Milton Friedman warned economists and policymakers\nnot to try to stimulate economic growth at the cost of \"just a little\nmore\" inflation.7 He predicted that people would come to anticipate\nthat little bit of extra inflation, and then would change their\nbehavior in various ways. The end result would be slower economic\ngrowth and ever-higher inflation. In effect, Friedman was warning\npolicymakers not to treat inflation as a static concept, but to\nappreciate the interdependence between inflation and inflation\nexpectations.\nUnfortunately, the economic events of the 1970s bear out Friedman's\nwarning. Households and businesses did adjust their behavior to\nminimize the costs they faced from rising inflation. And once\ninflation expectations became unglued, we watched with dismay as\nthe costs arising from inflation expectations took a huge toll on our\nresources. The economy spiraled into \"stagflation\" - an environment\nof worsening economic performance and higher inflation.\nLet's consider some of the ways that rising inflation expectations can\nhinder economic performance. For example, we know that people\nwho fear higher inflation often choose to put their wealth into real\nassets, such as land, or gold, or silver, or copper.8 They do this not\nso much as a traditional business investment, but as a hedge against\na rising price level. So as the expectation of inflation grows, these\nasset prices will likely reflect two things: the value of the asset in\nproduction and its value as an inflation hedge. This alters the flow of\nour scarce resources from their best use.\nOf course, this is just one example of the damage that an inflationary\npsychology inflicts on our economy. When people begin to anticipate\na decline in the purchasing power of their dollars, they will take\nmany actions to protect themselves. They will use their time and\nwealth to try to minimize the amount of money they hold because\nthat money is slowly losing its purchasing power. Inflation also raises\nthe effective tax rate that people pay on income they earn from\ninvesting and saving. This, in turn, induces people to forgo\ninvestments and discourages them from saving.\nInflation also makes it difficult for borrowers and lenders, who now\nmust evaluate the future purchasing power of money, not just the\nreal terms of a contract. The costs associated with making these\npredictions rise with inflation because higher levels of inflation are\ngenerally more volatile and more difficult to predict. As inflation\nbecomes more unpredictable, lenders demand insurance against this\nrisk in the form of higher interest rates. This makes long-term\ncontracts, particularly financial contracts, more costly than they\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nwould be if inflation weren't a concern.\nPeople can also make costly mistakes as they try to distinguish\nbetween changes in relative prices and inflation. If inflation is highly\nunpredictable, entrepreneurs may assume that all price changes are\nthe result of the inflationary policies of the central bank, and ignore\nsome important relative price signals telling them to adjust their\nbusiness plans.\nAll of the actions that people take to guard against inflation consume\nprecious resources that would be used more productively in a world\nwhere people didn't have to worry about inflation. These are the\ncosts that that a central bank must keep in check if our economy is\nto achieve its full potential.\n\nIII. The Measurement and Theory of Inflation\nExpectations\nWell, it's one thing to understand that you want to keep inflation\nexpectations in check, but it is an entirely different matter knowing\nwhen, in fact, they are in check. Let me explain some of the ways we\nattempt to measure inflation expectations.\nWe can look for changes in inflationary sentiment in a variety of\nindicators. Asset markets give us some indirect measures. For\nexample, we can track the price movements of any number of\ninvestment goods, such as metals and other commodities, or real\nestate, or any tangible asset that investors might see as a \"safe\nhaven\" from inflation.\nWe can also monitor the behavior of long-term interest rates relative\nto short-term rates, otherwise known as \"the yield curve.\" A\nsteepening of the yield curve - that is, a rise in long-term rates\nrelative to short-term rates - might signal that bond buyers are\ndemanding some protection against inflation.9\nA relatively new and very promising measurement comes from\nTreasury Inflation Indexed Securities, commonly known as TIPS.\nThese securities give the investor a fixed real return because their\nprincipal and interest payments are tied to the Consumer Price\nIndex. Because regular Treasury securities are not tied to the CPI, we\ncan compare the rate of return between TIPS and regular Treasury\nsecurities to infer how much inflation investors might expect to see\nover different time horizons - for example, over the next 5 to 10\nyears.\nThe problem with financial market indicators is that asset prices\nrespond to any number of risks, not just inflation.10 In a world that is\nalways confronting and evaluating risks, disentangling the inflation\nrisk from all the other risks is a very imperfect science. Nevertheless,\nfinancial market indicators are proving to be a useful yardstick for\nmonitoring inflation expectations.11\nYou might think that a better way to gauge inflation expectations\nwould be to simply ask people their views on inflation. In fact, there\nis a survey that does just that. Once a month, the University of\nMichigan interviews about 500 households around the nation, asking\npeople how much they think prices will rise in the next 12 months\nand over the next 5 to 10 years. Here, too, there are some problems\nwith interpreting the raw data. For one thing, households' beliefs\nabout future inflation are typically much higher than the actual\ninflation rate.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAlso, in v e stig a tio n s in to th e su rv ey d a t a h av e re v e a le d so m e\nfa s c in a tin g p a tte r n s .

And as\nwe learn more about how inflation expectations are formed, we can\ndo our job as monetary policymakers even better.\n\n[1] A discussion of these issues can be found in Bryan, Michael F., \"Is\nIt More Expensive, Or Does It Just Cost More Money?\" Economic\nCommentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, May 15, 2002.\n\n[2] Based on the CPI.\n[3] There may be indirect costs that the central bank can help ease.\nFor example, if oil prices rise and, as a result, labor productivity\nfalls, there will be downward pressure on wages. If wages are\ndownwardly \"sticky,\" unemployment may result and the creation of a\nrising price level might allow \"real\" wages to adjust and alleviate the\nunemployment. These are not the direct costs of higher oil prices,\nhowever.\n\n[4] \"[By inflation w]e mean the .movement which would have been\nbrought about if the 'changes on the side of money', . changes which\ntend to affect all prices equally, had been the only changes\noperating and there had been no forces present 'on the side of the\nthings' tending to change their prices relatively to one another.\"\nIrving Fisher, 1922.\n[5] Appreciating this distinction helps one better understand ideas\nlike \"core\" inflation, which are useful metrics for the central bank,\nand perhaps only the central bank, to monitor. These core inflation\nmeasures, most commonly constructed as an aggregate price statistic\nless food and energy prices, attempt to strip away the most volatile\nof the relative price movements that may temporarily cause the\naggregate price measure to fluctuate in a way that is not\nsymptomatic of a persistent change in the purchasing power of\nmoney.\n[6] A recent summary of these costs can be found in Anderson,\nRichard G., \"Inflation's Economic Cost: How Large? How Certain?\" The\nRegional Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, July 2006.\n[7] Friedman, Milton, \"The Role of Monetary Policy,\" American\nEconomic Review, vol. 58, no. 1, March 1968, pp. 1-17.\n[8] It may also be that the process by which inflation is transmitted\nto all prices begins with basic commodities like copper. Indeed, there\nis some evidence that commodity prices tend to lead inflation at the\nretail level, although the statistical strength of this relationship is not\nespecially strong. For example, see Furlong, Fred, and Robert\nIngenito, \"Commodity Prices and Inflation,\" Economic Review, Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco, 1996 (no. 2).\n[9] Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke discusses the link\nbetween monetary policy and the yield curve in \"Reflections on the\nYield Curve and Monetary Policy,\" speech before the Economic Club\nof New York, March 20, 2006.\n[10] For a discussion of monetary policy and the behavior of asset\nprices, including the pitfalls of policy based on the behavior of asset\nprices, I recommend Kohn, Donald L., \"Monetary Policy and Asset\nPrices,\" Speech delivered at a European Central Bank Colloquium in\nhonor of Otmar Issing, March 16, 2006.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n[11] Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland suggests that\nthe risk premium in the TIPS market is likely to fluctuate and\ncomplicate an accurate interpretation of the inflationary sentiment\ncoming from financial markets. See Carlstrom, Charles T., and\nTimothy S. Fuerst, \"Expected Inflation and TIPS,\" Economic\nCommentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, November 2004.\n[12] See Bryan, Michael F. and Stefan Palmqvist, \"Testing Near­\nRationality Using Detailed Survey Data,\" Working Paper, Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, 05-02.\n[13] See Bryan, Michael F. and Guhan Venkatu, \"The Demographics of\nInflation Opinion Surveys,\" Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, October 15, 2001, and \"The Curiously Different\nInflation Perspectives of Men and Woman,\" Economic Commentary,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, November 2001.\n[14] A large number of recent papers have described various ways the\nformation of inflation expectations may affect the conduct of the\ncentral bank. Two examples are: Ball, Laurence, N. Gregory Mankiw,\nand Ricardo Reis, \"Monetary Policy for Inattentive Economies,\"\nJournal of Monetary Economics 52, May 2005, and Orphanides,\nAthanasios, and John C.

While\ncommunity development is a topic that may be less visible in the\nfinancial press, it is one that is equally meaningful to all of us here.\nThe work that you do - whether in banking, community outreach,\npublic policymaking, teaching, or research - reflects a dedication to\nbettering the lives of others.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCom m unity Development Policy\nSummit\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nJune 22, 2006\n\nWe are here today and tomorrow to examine concentrated poverty that is, poverty that affects more than 40 percent of people living in\na particular region or city - through the lens of community\ndevelopment. I think we can all agree that community reinvestment\ninitiatives have done a great deal to help low- to moderate-income\nfamilies over the past generation. But we know that there is still a\nlong way to go.\n\nIt took a recent catastrophe - Hurricane Katrina - to refocus our\nnation's attention on poverty. The disaster in New Orleans last year\nreminded us that even in twenty-first-century America, some people\nstill have limited access to bank accounts, permanent homes, and\ntransportation. Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath have compelled\nthe public and our policymakers to recognize the enormity of poverty\nin America and to explore public policy solutions to this enduring\nproblem.\n\nIn approaching this policy summit, you may be wondering: What is\nthe Federal Reserve System's connection to concentrated poverty?\nWhy does the Cleveland Fed care about this issue?\n\nThe fact is that we are committed to the goals of community\ndevelopment. Our Community Affairs program helps us fulfill one of\nour important public policy mandates - to enforce fair-lending\nregulations that protect consumers in the financial marketplace. We\nalso believe that understanding the issues behind concentrated\npoverty will help us better assess overall economic performance.\n\nI will begin my remarks with an overview of the Federal Reserve's role\nin community development. Next, I will describe more broadly some\nof the progress made over the past few decades and some of the\ncontinuing challenges we all face in addressing poverty. Finally, I will\nshare my thoughts on why I think this type of policy summit can help\nlead to positive change.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\fThe Challenge of Concentrated Poverty :: June 22, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nPlease note that the views I express today are mine alone. I do not\npresume to speak for any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nI. The Federal Reserve and Its Role in\nCommunity Development\nLet me begin with some background on the Federal Reserve System\nand how our work relates to the overall area of public policy that you\nare interested in: community development.\n\nYou are all probably familiar with the Federal Reserve's role in setting\nour nation's monetary policy. The 12 Reserve Banks also provide\nfinancial services to banks and the U.S. Treasury, cooperate with the\nBoard of Governors to supervise banks, and conduct economic\nresearch.\n\nOver the past few decades, the Federal Reserve has pursued a broad\nrange of research involving patterns of wealth and poverty. We want\nto better understand how concentrated poverty affects market\nefficiency and economic growth. We know that most people who are\ntrapped in poverty cannot participate fully in the labor market or the\nfinancial system. So there is good reason, just from a macroeconomic\nviewpoint, for the Federal Reserve to analyze these issues.\n\nBut our involvement actually reaches much further. As part of our\nresponsibilities to promote fair and equal access to credit and to\nprotect the rights of consumers, the Federal Reserve has become\ninvolved in community development, especially as the nation's fairlending laws have evolved over the past few decades.\n\nCongress gave the Federal Reserve a substantial role in the regulation\nof lending practices through the Truth in Lending Act of 1968. This\nlaw was designed to protect consumers in credit transactions by\nrequiring lenders to disclose the terms of credit and the costs\nassociated with borrowing money. As the civil rights movement\ngained momentum across the nation, Congress quickly moved beyond\ngeneral consumer protection laws into various antidiscrimination\nlending laws.\n\nBefore these laws were enacted, there was a growing concern that\naccess to credit was not being provided on a fair and equal basis. But\nnow an array of federal and state fair-lending laws have been\nenacted to safeguard consumers' rights in our financial system,\nincluding in home-mortgage lending. In fact, the Federal Reserve has\nrecently intensified its focus on data derived from the Home\nMortgage Disclosure Act of 1975.\n\nAnother important law is the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977,\nwhich we all know as CRA. The Federal Reserve has had a role not\nonly in writing and enforcing the regulations associated with this\nlegislation, but also in studying its effects over time. In fact, Glenn\nCanner and Robert Avery at the Board of Governors have reported\nthat since the law was enacted, banks have greatly increased their\npresence in low- to moderate-income communities and have\nintroduced products and services tailored to these markets - while\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\fThe Challenge of Concentrated Poverty :: June 22, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nstill making a profit.\n\nOver the years, community reinvestment strategies have certainly\nbenefited people in these markets. By establishing banking\nrelationships, people gain a building block of economic success:\naccess to credit. Of course, access to credit - by itself - is certainly\nnot a solution to poverty. But the wise use of credit enables\nindividuals and families to accumulate wealth, make sound\ninvestments, and avoid costly financial mistakes.\n\nIn light of all of these initiatives, the Federal Reserve has taken a\nleadership role in supporting community development. Each of the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks has a strong Community Affairs office. This\nfunction has grown to encompass applied research, public programs,\noutreach, and public education in \"best practices\" for community\ndevelopment practitioners - all with the goal of improving conditions\nin low- to moderate-income communities. Our policy summit today is\npart of that education and outreach effort.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Community Affairs offices are also working with\nthe Board of Governors on a multiyear project focusing on\nconcentrated poverty and its effect on community development. The\ngroup is now collecting data, studying trends, and investigating the\noutward migration of concentrated urban poverty. We hope to bring\nnew insights to the public policy debate over the coming years.\n\nII. Addressing Poverty: What Has Been\nAccomplished - What Remains to Be Done\nSo here we are in 2006, nearly 40 years after the fair-lending laws\nfirst made their appearance. What has been accomplished in reducing\npoverty over the past generation, and what still remains to be done?\n\nBy the late 1990s, poverty rates had fallen close to their historical\nlows. However, census data indicate that overall poverty has actually\ninched higher from 1999 to 2004. You will hear more about that\ntrend this afternoon. We also know that income inequality has\nworsened, and there are increasing concerns that income mobility one of the cornerstones of the American dream - is decreasing. And\nalthough concentrated poverty appears to have declined somewhat in\nrecent years, part of that decline was caused by the geographic\ndispersion of poor people rather than by an actual reduction of\npoverty itself.\n\nRecent economic research has also verified what we have all been\nreading and observing lately - Americans with weaker job-market\nskills have not benefited as much from the growing U.S. economy as\nhave other Americans with higher-level skills. Economists call this\n\"skill-biased technical change.\" People who lack the skills needed to\nkeep up with changes in technology cannot take full advantage of the\nbenefits of the growing sectors of the economy. If lower-skilled\nAmericans fall further behind, the result will be increased income\ninequality and, ultimately, greater poverty.\n\nDespite these trends, we can learn from some recent experiences\nthat will help us focus on the most promising places to expend our\nenergies to combat poverty. Through the Federal Reserve's research\nand outreach, we have been learning where different approaches can\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\fThe Challenge of Concentrated Poverty :: June 22, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nlead to better outcomes.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, our research staff has\nhelped us to understand that human capital is every bit as important\nas physical capital in driving innovation and income growth. That has\nled our Bank to sponsor forums on the economics of educational\nattainment and to conduct studies on the links among education,\ninnovation, investment, and economic performance.\n\nOur Bank has also taken part in new research that aims to find a more\ncomprehensive measure of economic trends in Northeast Ohio. This is\nthe \"Dashboard Indicators\" project, which collects detailed\ninformation about the economic performance of the region, including\npoverty rates, to better focus regional economic development\nefforts. You will hear more about this project in just a few minutes.\n\nData will be critical in any effort to overcome concentrated poverty.\nChairman Ben Bernanke expressed this idea well in a recent speech:\n\"Both government policymakers and community-development\norganizations need the 'reality check' that hard data can provide. To\nknow whether our policies and programs are delivering the desired\nresults, we need to be able to measure inputs and outcomes,\nprogram by program and community by community. Better\ninformation increases accountability and promotes good governance\nin both the public and the nonprofit sectors.\"\n\nI could not agree more with the Chairman's comments. And indeed,\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System, we have been taking an\nactive role to uncover the hard data that will lead us to the priorities\nof better accountability and better outcomes.\n\nIII. How This Policy Summit Can Lead to\nPositive Change\nWe know the questions that must be answered: How can we\nstrengthen workforce skills? How can we reduce income inequality\nand help promote the American ideal of income mobility?\n\nAnswers to those questions can begin to emerge from policy\nconferences like this one. I am proud that the Federal Reserve can\nserve as a facilitator for your analysis and collaboration.\n\nOur conference agenda has brought together experts from across the\nnation who can explore the complex details of concentrated poverty,\nand who can suggest ways to overcome it. We are privileged to have\nwith us as our keynote speaker Dr. William Julius Wilson - a\nnationally recognized expert on urban poverty - who will discuss\nsome of the root causes of poverty.\n\nIn your discussions here, both today and tomorrow, I encourage you\nto be bold in your thinking, to challenge assumptions, to envision not\nwhat has been but what could be.\n\nSome will say that the problem of concentrated poverty is\ninsurmountable. Confronting the dilemmas of wealth and poverty\nmay, indeed, be the one of the most difficult challenges of our\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\fThe Challenge of Concentrated Poverty :: June 22, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ngeneration. But let's step back and ask ourselves: What kind of\nsociety will we leave to the next generation? One that is rigidly\nstratified by economic class? Or one that allows for income mobility,\npermitting individuals and families to rise as far and as fast as their\nown talents will take them?\n\nEven when the policy answers to these problems are identified,\nmobilizing the public to pursue them will require tremendous efforts.\nYet throughout our history, each generation has faced challenges\ninvolving such fundamental social questions.\n\nA great American lawmaker of the nineteenth century, Daniel\nWebster, once reminded the nation of the task ahead: \"Let us\ndevelop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its\ninstitutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also,\nin our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be\nremembered.\"\n\nWebster's comments are just as relevant for us today. In our day and\ngeneration, our nation enjoys material wealth in a measure that\nAmericans have never before known. However, we know that not\neveryone shares those advantages. There is no better time for bright,\ntalented, and motivated people to dig in - to grapple with the\nenduring issue of poverty amid plenty - and to fulfill a task that will\ntruly be \"worthy to be remembered.\"\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\f"

The projections are reviewed\nwith the Committee, and we use this time on the agenda to raise\nquestions about the projections and discuss issues associated with\nthem.\nNext, we discuss what we have been hearing from business leaders in\nour respective districts about international, national and regional\nbusiness conditions. In FOMC meetings, we have what we call a \"go\n'round.\" We literally go around the conference table, with each of the\n19 members offering his or her viewpoint on economic conditions and\nthe economic outlook.\nAfter each member has spoken, it is time to consider policy options,\nwhich are outlined for the Committee members in advance, in a\ndocument called the Blue Book. Then it is time for a second \"go\n'round,\" with members stating their views on which policy option\nshould be adopted. If it is obvious that members generally agree, this\n\"go 'round\" can be fairly brief. Otherwise, a more in-depth discussion\ntakes place.\nWhen we feel that we have enough information to make a decision\non monetary policy, we proceed with a vote. Then we publish a\npublic statement about our decision, summarizing what we did and\nwhy. Three weeks later, we publish the minutes of our meeting.\nToday, market watchers are focused on what we will decide to do\nlater this month with our main policy instrument - the target for the\nfederal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks\nlend each other money overnight. Movements in this rate have a\npowerful, if indirect, effect on the interest rates that have an impact\non you and other consumers - on loans for cars, home mortgages, and\nbusiness finance.\nThe FOMC has a dual mandate: first, to maintain price stability over\nthe long term, and, second, to promote maximum sustainable\neconomic growth. Ultimately, we want the public to be confident\nthat inflation will remain low and stable over time, and that the\neconomy will continue to expand.\n\nII. How Economic Performance Influences\nMonetary Policy\nNow let me explain how we go about deciding where to set the\ntarget for the federal funds rate. Our national economy today is in\nreasonably good condition. But in order to set policy appropriately,\nwe have to analyze not just where we are now, but also how we got\nhere and where it looks like we're heading.\nSo, how did the current business cycle unfold, and how did the FOMC\nrespond? The economic downturn that began in 2001 called for a\nsignificantly lower federal funds rate. In light of weakening economic\ngrowth, falling market interest rates, and a general increase in\nperceived risks in the global economic outlook, the FOMC reduced\nthe federal funds rate from 61V percent to 1V percent by late 2002 a level that had not been seen since 1961.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nIn early 2003, in addition to maintaining an accommodative monetary\npolicy to support the economic expansion, the FOMC also became\nconcerned with the possible emergence of an unwelcome disinflation.\nIn response, in June 2003, we lowered the federal funds rate one\nmore time, to the historically low level of 1 percent.\nStarting in mid-2004, as the threat of unwelcome disinflation passed,\nand as economic conditions began to normalize, it made sense to\nbegin the process of removing our policy accommodation. We\naccomplished that by raising our target for the federal funds rate.\nWe did not know, at the time, how high we would have to raise the\nfederal funds rate target. But we knew that the direction had to be\nconsiderably northwards. Step by step, in a series of 16 quarter-point\nadjustments, the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate to where it\nis today - 5 percent.\nLooking at the nation's current economic situation, do the data\nsuggest that we have adjusted the federal funds rate appropriately?\nHow are we doing in achieving our objectives of sustainable economic\ngrowth and price stability?\nLet's start by looking at economic growth. After a weak fourth\nquarter in 2005, mainly due to significant energy-price shocks and\ndevastating hurricanes, the economy bounced back quite strongly in\nthe first quarter of this year. Looking ahead, most forecasters are\nexpecting economic growth to be about 3 percent for the second half\nof this year and for 2007. These growth rates, while consistent with a\nhealthy economy, are lower than what we experienced for most of\n2004 and 2005.\nThe sectors of the economy that will support our economic growth\nthis year are expected to be somewhat different from those that\nprevailed in the past few years. The housing market, after several\nyears of strong expansion, is already showing signs of cooling off this\nyear. Consumer sentiment has been deteriorating, according to the\nlatest survey responses, and recent data show signs that consumer\nspending is softening from its strong first-quarter performance.\nConsumers have sustained their spending during the past several\nyears, in part, by cashing out some of their home-equity dollars. This\nextra source of financing is likely to slow down in a softening housing\nmarket. Fortunately, though, I expect to see enough employment and\nincome growth coming out of the labor market to keep consumer\nspending advancing at a moderate rate.\nOn the business side, I look for capital spending to continue to\nexpand at a decent pace again this year. Stronger economic growth\nabroad will also boost American exports. These two sectors - business\nspending and exports - are likely to mitigate the effects of a\nslowdown in the consumer and housing sectors.\nIn summary, as the year progresses, I anticipate that the pace of\neconomic expansion will slow from its rapid rate of growth in the\nfirst quarter. Nevertheless, I believe that we are on track to achieve\nour objective of sustainable economic growth.\nWhat about our objective of price stability? Inflation rates can be\naffected by all kinds of unusual events in the short term, especially\nlarge swings in energy prices. Of course, all of us are painfully aware\nof the huge increases we have seen in energy prices. We feel it every\ntime we fill up our gas tanks. Americans are complaining that the\nenergy-price increases have hit them hard - and they're right. The\nprice of a barrel of oil has gone from about $20 in 2002 to roughly\n$70 today.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPrice pressures are also being felt across an array of other\ncommodities, goods and services. As a result, the core rate of\ninflation has also been edging up lately. The Consumer Price Index\nhas increased by 3.5 percent during the past year. The so-called core\nrate - that is, the CPI excluding food and energy - hasn't risen as\nmuch: It rose slightly more than 2 percent during the past year. But\nthe core CPI has increased at an annualized rate of more than 3\npercent during the past three months. This inflation picture, if\nsustained, exceeds my comfort level.\nFortunately, the public is, for the most part, looking at this\ndisappointing inflation news as a transitory development. Measures of\nlong-term inflation expectations have been mixed lately, but, on the\nwhole, I regard them as remaining contained. The FOMC's challenge is\nto make sure that they stay contained.\nThe recent news on inflation troubles me, but the news has not come\nas a complete surprise. Last year I began to anticipate that we might\nconfront some disappointing inflation data in the first half of this\nyear, although I was not expecting quite as much inflation as we\nhave seen. Still, I have been expecting price pressures to diminish.\nThis juncture in the policymaking process is the most difficult. There\nis, after all, a time lag between monetary-policy actions and their\nultimate effect on inflation. That is, even though the recently\nreported inflation numbers have been edging upward, I think that the\ncurrent 5 percent level of the federal funds rate is near a point that\nis consistent with a gradual improvement in the inflation outlook.\nOf course, my current inflation outlook depends on the rest of the\neconomy developing along the lines of my broader forecast.\nSpecifically, I expect a flattening-out of energy prices, a cooling\nhousing market, continued strong productivity growth, and a\nmoderation in the overall pace of economic activity.\n\nIII. Communications in Monetary Policy\nBy now, it should be clear that setting monetary policy consists of\nseveral forward-looking elements - forecasts, inflation expectations,\nand the lagged effects of current and recent policy actions, to name\njust a few. Communications also play an important role in the entire\nenterprise of policymaking, especially in light of these forwardlooking factors.\nOur communications not only inform the public of our interest rate\nactions, but also provide a context for understanding why the actions\nwere taken, and, more broadly, help the public to form expectations\nabout future economic and inflation conditions. For the FOMC to\nanchor the public's inflation expectations - which I have argued is\nessential to meeting our objectives of sustainable economic growth\nand price stability - our policy decisions and communications must\ngive the public confidence that we will produce low inflation over\nthe long run.\nThe FOMC does not have long experience with frequent and detailed\nmonetary policy communications. The Committee only began its\ncurrent practice of immediately announcing its policy decisions in\n1994. In a previous speech, I characterized the period since then as\none in which the FOMC started learning how to talk.\nTo me, that process is in some sense like a person learning how to\nwalk through a dark room without knowing where the furniture is.\nYou move very slowly, feeling your way. Sometimes you discover\nyou're a bit off course. You may stumble, but you learn to adapt and\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nmove toward your destination. From my perspective, changes in the\nCommittee's communications process since 1994 reflect an institution\nthat is becoming more comfortable with greater transparency.\nLet me give you an example of how our more recent communications\nhave evolved. Recall the episode that I mentioned earlier in my\nremarks, about our concern over unwelcome disinflation in 2003 and\nearly 2004. To address that particular problem, the Committee\nexplained that it expected to maintain its low federal funds rate for\na considerable period. This language guided market participants to\nexpect no policy changes for a while.\nAs the threat of unwelcome disinflation passed, the language was\ngradually modified, eventually to be replaced by language suggesting\nthat the accommodative policy could be removed at a measured\npace. This phrase signaled that the funds rate would rise, but that it\nwould be rise slowly and predictably.\nThat language was altered once again last December, in an important\nway. Rather than repeating that accommodation could be removed at\na measured pace, the Committee said that some further measured\nfirming might be required. This change indicated, for the first time,\nthat the Committee was focused on the risks of higher inflation. In\nJanuary, the word \"measured\" was eliminated, signaling that the\ntiming and magnitude of future actions would be less certain.\nAs our experience demonstrates, communicating to markets is\ncomplicated because incoming data can affect not only how we\nevaluate current economic conditions, but also our view of where the\neconomy is heading. Also, FOMC members may not all interpret the\ndata in the same way at the same time.\nThe minutes of our meetings, including the last one, indicate that\nthere can be differences of opinion. Although these differences lead\nto better policy decisions over time, they add to the challenge we\nface as a Committee in communicating with the public.\nSo, what are financial markets expecting? Well, as you may know,\nthere is a market that deals with federal funds futures, and at the\nmoment, market participants place much higher odds on another 25basis-point rate hike than on a pause at the FOMC's meeting later this\nmonth.\nHowever, before the next FOMC meeting, more information on both\nprices and real economic activity will be available. Even if those\nnumbers fail to change my outlook for inflation and economic\ngrowth, they may push my assessment of risks in one direction or\nanother. New data, including statements from FOMC members, could\nalso shift the odds that market participants place on the FOMC's\nupcoming decisions, in much the same way as they have during the\npast few weeks.\nIt is important to emphasize that a good communication policy does\nnot mean that the public will always be able to anticipate what the\nFOMC will do next. Sometimes the economic situation is simply too\nfluid to admit such certainty.\nWhat good communications can do is help people appreciate the\nCommittee's objectives, understand how policymakers are thinking\nabout the prospects for meeting those objectives, and consider how\nnew information might affect policy choices.\nI hope that my remarks have given you a better understanding of how\nI think about economic conditions and the challenges we are facing\nas monetary policymakers.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\f"
