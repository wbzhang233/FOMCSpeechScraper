        "content": "The National and Regional Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe African American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania\nAnnual Business Luncheon\nPittsburgh, PA\nNovember 30, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Doris Carson Williams and members of the African American Chamber of Commerce of Western\nPennsylvania for inviting me to speak today about the economy and monetary policy. As you may know,\nin addition to being president and CEO of the Chamber, Doris chairs the board of the Pittsburgh Branch\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Doris for her service\nto my organization and to the country. In her role as chair, Doris brings us a wealth of information on the\nregional economy, information she has gathered from the entrepreneurs and other contacts in the region. I\nam sure that many of you provide Doris with insights into how your businesses and communities are\nfaring, so I’d like to also thank you for your service.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed represents the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which comprises western\nPennsylvania, as well as the state of Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West\nVirginia. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I make it a point to bring the economic information we have\ngarnered throughout the District from business, consumer, and labor contacts to meetings of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The\nregional information, along with economic and financial data and analysis, plays an important part in the\nFOMC’s setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals of maximum employment\nand price stability.\n\nIndeed, the regional structure of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for more than 100 years.\nCongress established the Fed in 1913 to operate in the public interest to promote the health of the U.S.\neconomy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed as a decentralized central bank, independent\nwithin the government but not independent from the government. The Fed’s design balances publicsector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country and overseen\nby the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This design allows monetary policy decisions to take\n\n\f2\ninto account the diversity of the American economy and its people. The regional structure also helps us\nto carry out our other responsibilities. In addition to setting national monetary policy, the Fed is also\nresponsible for supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions, promoting the\nstability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the nation’s payments system and\nproviding certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying effective community\ndevelopment policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nToday, I would like to focus on our monetary policy role by discussing my outlook for both the national\nand regional economy and my views on monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion is now in its eighth year, and considerable progress has been and continues to be\nmade on both parts of the Fed’s statutory goals of full employment and price stability. In my view, the\nunderlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. Growth has been moderate,\nand although the quarterly pattern has had its share of ups and downs, the economy has been resilient to a\nnumber of shocks throughout the expansion. One of those shocks, the sharp decline in energy prices\nbetween mid-2014 through the end of 2015, was a major negative for the energy-producing sector and its\nsuppliers in this region and elsewhere. Still, the economy and, in particular, employment growth\npersevered.\n\nAll forecasts carry risk, and sometimes, it is difficult to extract the signal about where the economy is\nheaded from noisy economic and financial market data. With these usual caveats in mind, my modal\nforecast is that over the next couple of years, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above\nits longer-run trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will move further\n\n\f3\nbelow its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will return to the\nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\n\nEconomic growth\nAfter a slow first half, U.S. output growth picked up in the third quarter. Consumer spending, which\nmakes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, has been the driver of growth and I expect that to continue.\nImproving household balance sheets, growth in personal income, low borrowing rates, and low oil prices\nhave all supported consumer spending.\n\nSmoothing through the monthly volatility in housing sales, starts, and permits indicates that the housing\nsector is gradually improving. I expect activity in the sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\nThe gradual nature of the housing recovery likely reflects a mixture of supply and demand factors.\nBuilders report that they are having trouble finding qualified workers in some of the construction trades,\nand they are avoiding over-building, having learned from the housing boom and crash. Mortgage rates\nare low, but households are being careful not to take on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and\nbanks are lending, but to those with good credit quality.\n\nIn contrast to consumer spending and housing, manufacturing has been restrained and business fixed\ninvestment has been weak. As I mentioned earlier, part of the weakness in investment reflects the impact\nthat the earlier sharp drop in oil prices had on the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers. In\nwestern Pennsylvania, steel production, which supplies the energy sector, has been down and firms tied to\nthe energy sector have had to cut jobs and curtail investment plans. On a positive note, oil prices have\nstabilized and are up somewhat this year, and we have started to see a pickup in oil drilling activity. The\nrelatively slow growth of our trading partners, which has led to an appreciation in the value of the dollar,\nhas also weighed on manufacturing and investment at firms that are reliant on exporting goods. But even\noutside of the energy- and trade-related sectors, business investment has been soft despite generally\naccommodative financial conditions. Some firms seem to be using the low interest rate environment to\n\n\f4\nbuy back stock rather than to expand plant and equipment spending. More generally, there just seems to\nbe a sense of caution on the part of businesses.\n\nI do expect investment to begin to pick up with economic growth, which would be welcome because a\nstronger pace of capital spending would help raise labor productivity growth from recent low levels. This\nis important because structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth rate of\noutput and of living standards. And a key determinant of productivity growth is investment in physical\nand human capital. Labor productivity growth has risen at an annual rate of a little above a half of a\npercent over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical; some of it reflects longer-run\ndemographics, including the aging of the population, and some of it likely reflects difficulties measuring\nproductivity in the service sector, including intellectual property and information technology. It is\ndifficult to forecast productivity growth, so the recent softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer\nlasting and reflect a structural issue. If it’s the latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy\nmay be lower than the 2 percent growth I’ve been assuming.\n\nSmall businesses\nI do not need to tell this audience about the important role that small and new businesses play in the U.S.\neconomy. The vast majority of firms in the U.S. are small businesses; in fact, three-quarters of U.S.\nbusinesses have fewer than 10 employees. So while it is true that large and mature businesses employ the\nmost people, still, over a quarter of U.S. private-sector jobs are at firms with fewer than 50 employees,\nand over half are at firms with fewer than 500 employees.1 Digging deeper into the data, economist John\nHaltiwanger and his co-authors have documented the important role played, in particular, by young firms.\nThis group includes new firms, which are almost all small to begin with. Their research shows that young\nfirms disproportionately contribute to both overall job creation and job destruction in the U.S. economy,\n1\n\nData from Supplemental Tables F and G of the National Business Employment Dynamics Data, U.S. Bureau of\nLabor Statistics indicate that as of 2016Q1, 28 percent of private-sector employment (20.5 million jobs) was at firms\nwith fewer than 50 employees, and 95 percent of firms have fewer than 50 employees. These tables and others are\navailable at http://www.bls.gov/bdm/bdmfirmsize.htm.\n\n\f5\nand on average, over the 1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3\npercent of total employment per year.2 More recent data show that since the Great Recession, this share\nhas fallen to around 2 percent,3 which brings up a cautionary note about our economy.\n\nAn enviable aspect of the U.S. economy around the globe is our spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship,\nease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility. Small and young businesses have played an\nimportant role in the dynamics of the U.S. economy. This dynamism has contributed to economic growth\nand well-being in the U.S. It allows resources to be reallocated from less-productive to more-productive\nbusinesses and allows workers to move up the career ladder, resulting in higher productivity growth and\nrising incomes.\n\nBut research by Haltiwanger and others has shown that the degree of dynamism in the U.S. economy has\nbeen declining for some time. As indicated above, the start-up rate has been declining, and since 2000,\nkey innovative sectors like high-tech have seen a sharp slowing in the rate of start-ups.4\nThe decline in business and labor market dynamism may be contributing to the slowdown we’ve seen in\nproductivity growth.5\n\nTo better understand one factor important to start-ups and small firms, for the past three years, the Federal\nReserve has conducted a survey on small-business credit. In 2015, seven Reserve Banks, including the\nCleveland Fed, collaborated on the survey, gathering responses from over 5,400 firms with fewer than\n\n2\n\nSee John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Who Creates Jobs? Small Versus Large Versus\nYoung,” Review of Economics and Statistics 95 (May 2013), pp. 347-361.\n3\n\nAuthor’s calculations based on the firm age table from the Business Dynamics Statistics, Firm Characteristics Data\nTables, U.S. Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data_firm.html).\n4\n\nSee John Haltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” paper\nwritten for the Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth conference, August 2015.\n5\n\nHaltiwanger (2015), p. 9.\n\n\f6\n500 employees and located in 26 states.6 The 2015 results indicate that among the more than 3,400\nemployer firms – those small businesses employing at least one person in addition to the owner – both\nfirm performance, in terms of the share reporting profitability and revenue growth, and financing success\nimproved over the previous year. Slightly less than 50 percent of surveyed employer firms applied for\ncredit and about half of those received all the credit they sought. Among the firms receiving less credit\nthan they wanted, micro-businesses (those firms with less than $100,000 in annual revenue) and start-ups\nhad somewhat less success in gaining credit approval. The differential in credit approval by revenue and\nage of firm may appropriately reflect the risks entailed in lending to these types of firms. Nonetheless, it\ndoes point out that the availability of credit is one of the challenges smaller and younger firms are facing\nas they try to grow, and that appropriate access to credit will remain a key attribute of an innovative\neconomy.\n\nAs this brief overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But\noverall, economic growth has proven to be resilient, and I expect growth over the next two years to be at\nor slightly above a trend of around 2 percent. The pace of growth, while lower than in other expansions,\nhas been sufficient to generate significant and sustained progress in labor markets.\n\nLabor markets\nIn fact, since the employment trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 15 million\njobs, about a 10 percent increase. The national unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage\npoints from its peak of 10 percent in late 2009. In addition, other gauges of the under-utilization of labor\nhave improved significantly. These include the broader measures of unemployment that track the number\nof part-time workers who would rather work full time and the number of people who have been\ndiscouraged from looking for a job.\n6\n\nSee “2015 Small Business Credit Survey: Report on Employer Firms,” Federal Reserve Banks of New York,\nAtlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis, March 2016. Other information about the\nsurvey is available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/community-development/small-business/about-the-joint-smallbusiness-credit-survey/2015-joint-small-business-credit-survey.aspx.\n\n\f7\nSo far this year, firms have added slightly more than 1.8 million payroll jobs, or around 180,000 jobs per\nmonth. That’s well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from 75,000 to 120,000\nper month depending on what one assumes about labor force participation. Demographic factors,\nincluding the aging of our population, have resulted in a downward trend in labor force participation,\nwhich is one of the reasons trend employment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago.\n\nAs labor market progress has been made, we have been hearing increasingly from our labor and business\ncontacts across a broad set of industries that firms are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in\nhigh-skilled occupations and in lower-skilled jobs, and that they are responding by raising wages. Now\nthose anecdotal reports are showing through to the wage data where measures such as the employment\ncost index and average hourly earnings are accelerating moderately from year-ago levels.\n\nI expect to see the labor market continue to tighten somewhat over the next couple of years. Although\npayroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace given the progress that’s already been\nmade, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the\nunemployment rate to stay below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\nSo in my view, we have met the maximum employment part of our monetary policy dual mandate; that is,\nmaximum employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can achieve.\n\nIn saying that, I certainly do not want to underestimate the difficulty in finding work that many people\nhave had and some continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced by\ndifferent demographic groups in the U.S. Technological advances and globalization are changing the\nnature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. While the overall economy will\nbenefit from these forces, many individuals and some regions are adversely affected by these structural\ntrends. Government policies and programs, and public-private partnerships, can and should be brought to\nbear to help people and communities make the transition.\n\n\f8\nA promising start is being taken right here in Pittsburgh to help ensure that people are developing the\nskills that will be needed in the workforce of the future, and that those providing the education and\ntraining understand what those jobs will be. Earlier this year, the Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment published an in-depth analysis of the expected supply and demand for labor in the\nPittsburgh region over the next decade and made a number of recommendations to help the region prepare\nfor the coming changes.7 One recommended initiative would create a digital career awareness hub to help\nteachers and students in kindergarten through high school better match curriculum offerings and choices\nto the skill sets in demand in the future. Another would create a digital jobs database to make it easier to\nmatch those with particular skills to employers currently in need of those skills. A further\nrecommendation is to focus resources on high-growth “opportunity occupations,” positions that pay\nhigher than the median wage but don’t require a bachelor’s degree. This diverse group of occupations\nincludes certain jobs in health care, transportation, and bookkeeping.8\n\nThe Federal Reserve, through its Community Development function, has a role to play in easing these\ntypes of transitions. Our objective analysis can help in evaluating the pros and cons of various policies\nand programs, and provide guidance on how to best scale-up those programs found to be most effective.\nAlthough I don’t believe monetary policy is the right tool for solving the longer-run workforce\ndevelopment issues facing our economy, I do believe monetary policy can positively contribute by\nfostering conditions to ensure that the economy achieves an economic expansion that endures. This\neconomic stability will help those demographic groups – minorities, older workers, and lower-income\npeople – who are disproportionately harmed by economic downturns.\n\n7\n\n“Inflection Point: Supply, Demand and the Future of Work in the Pittsburgh Region,” report prepared by Burning\nGlass Technologies and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning with Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment, May 2016.\n8\n\nResearch by the Federal Reserve suggests that even in opportunity occupations, employers are demanding higher\nlevels of skills than they did in the past, both technical skills and so-called soft skills such as being able to handle\nambiguity and to effectively communicate. See “Identifying Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest\nMetropolitan Economies,” Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta, September 2015.\n\n\f9\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s\ntarget of 2 percent for a while, but it has picked up over the past year and I believe the conditions are in\nplace for a return to 2 percent over the next couple of years. As the drags from earlier declines in oil\nprices and non-petroleum imports have dissipated, year-over-year headline inflation measures have\nmoved up, from the very low levels recorded last year to over 1 percent in recent months. To get a better\nsense of the underlying trend in inflation, economists often look at measures that smooth through or strip\nout some of the more volatile components. These include core PCE inflation and trimmed-mean PCE\ninflation, which are gradually nearing the 2 percent goal, as well as core CPI inflation and median CPI\ninflation, which are now over 2 percent. Indeed, the Cleveland Fed median CPI measure has been above\n2-1/4 percent all year, and near 2-1/2 percent for the past several months.9\n\nWhat people think inflation will be over the long run – what economists call inflation expectations – is an\nimportant factor that influences the path inflation actually takes. If people are confident that the Fed will\nset monetary policy to achieve 2 percent inflation over the long run – in other words, if longer-run\ninflation expectations are stable – then they will look through shocks that temporarily raise or lower\ninflation when they make financial or business decisions. This helps inflation move back toward the\ntarget after the effect of the shock dissipates. To assess whether inflation expectations are stable, we look\nat a number of different measures and indicators. Some are based on surveys of consumers and of\nprofessional forecasters; others are based on financial market data. The Cleveland Fed’s expectations\nmeasure of five-year inflation, five years from now, which combines survey and market data, has been\nstable this year, in a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent.10 After dipping earlier in the year, other measures have\nrisen in recent weeks. Based on the various measures, in my view, long-run inflation expectations have\nbeen reasonably stable. This, along with evidence that inflation is moving up, the continued strength in\n9\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-anddata/median-cpi.aspx.\n10\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations measure is available at https://clevelandfed.org/ourresearch/indicators-and-data/inflation-expectations.aspx.\n\n\f10\nthe labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend all suggest that inflation is on a\npath of returning to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years.\n\nRegional growth and labor markets\nAs I mentioned at the start of my talk, assessing regional economic conditions plays an important role in\nsetting national monetary policy, so let me spend a few minutes discussing the Pittsburgh-area economy.\nThe Pittsburgh region has undergone the type of regional economic transformation I discussed earlier,\nmoving from an economy that was dependent largely on steel, coal mining, and heavy industry, to one\nthat has diversified into health care, education, financial services, and technology.11 This is a promising\ndevelopment because we have seen that regions that remain dependent on one particular industry have\nfared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their industrial bases and adapt to the\nchanging economy.\n\nThe path of the economic expansion in Pittsburgh reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks\nthat have hit the economy during the expansion. The Great Recession took its toll on the region, as it did\nin the rest of the nation, and the region is also sharing in the benefits of the expansion. Indeed, Pittsburgh\nwas an early achiever in the recovery.\n\nIn 2012, Pittsburgh was one of the first major U.S. metropolitan areas to see payroll jobs move back up to\npre-Great Recession levels. The U.S. as a whole didn’t achieve this milestone until mid-2014, and\nPennsylvania, not until 2015. But since 2012, job growth in Pittsburgh has been relatively flat, while jobs\nin Pennsylvania and the U.S. have been expanding. A similar story can be told about Pittsburgh’s\n\n11\n\nPittsburgh has a higher share of employment in the service-producing sector than does the U.S., and this share has\nrisen over time, from about 71 percent of employment in the 1990s to about 77 percent today. The comparable\nshares in the U.S. are 64 percent and 71 percent, respectively. The share of employment in the education and health\nservices component of services in Pittsburgh is higher than in the U.S., and it has shown considerable growth over\ntime. In Pittsburgh, this share rose from 17 percent in the 1990s to 21 percent today. The comparable shares in the\nU.S. are 11 percent and 16 percent, respectively. (Author’s calculations using payroll employment data from the\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\n\n\f11\nunemployment rate. After falling sharply from a peak of over 8 percent in 2010 to under 5 percent early\nthis year, the unemployment rate has moved up to 6 percent, about a percentage point higher than the\nnational level.\n\nSome of the recent weakness in the regional labor markets is related to the earlier drop in energy prices.\nThe Marcellus region is now the most important shale-based source of natural gas in the U.S., accounting\nfor about 40 percent of domestic natural gas from shale sources. As a result, among the 50 states,\nPennsylvania is now the second-largest producer of natural gas behind Texas. But while the region\ngained as the natural gas industry developed, the recent contraction in the industry has been a negative.\nOver 2014 and 2015, both natural gas prices and the number of active rigs in the Marcellus region were\ncut in half, resulting in considerable job losses and lower earnings. This year, natural gas prices have\nbegun to increase, and since the summer, the number of active rigs has picked up as well. Although\nAllegheny County is less exposed to the natural gas sector than other parts of the Marcellus region, it felt\nthe spillovers of lower energy prices, as well as slower global growth, both of which put a considerable\ndrag on the steel industry. Here, too, the modest rise in oil prices this year has been a positive\ndevelopment.\n\nAnother positive is the region’s well-educated workforce. Among the 100 largest metropolitan areas,\nPittsburgh ranks in the top half in terms of the percentage of its population holding a bachelor’s degree or\nhigher, and among people aged 25 to 34, its ranking rises to 12th out of 100.12 This bodes well because\nwhen it comes to the economic well-being of entire regions, many studies have documented the\nimportance of investments in human capital.13 As a home to strong universities and a well-educated\n\n12\n\nAccording to the 2015 data from the American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau, Tables B15001 and\nB15002, for the U.S. as a whole, about 31 percent of the population and about 34 percent of the population aged 25\nto 34 hold a bachelor’s degree or higher; for Pittsburgh, the comparable numbers are 33 percent and 46 percent,\nrespectively.\n13\n\nFor example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, education levels were consistently one\nof the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth. See “Altered States: A Perspective on 75\nYears of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005 Annual Report.\n\n\f12\nworkforce, Pittsburgh is already attracting and sustaining many of the businesses of the future. No doubt,\nthis made Pittsburgh an excellent choice to host this October’s White House Frontiers Conference on the\nfuture of innovation both in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nIn addition to a quality workforce, research shows that effective leadership can make a big difference in\nhow regional economies navigate the type of transition Pittsburgh has accomplished. I commend the\nAfrican American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania for its leadership in the region.\n\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy. All participants on the\nFOMC share the same objective – setting monetary policy to promote our longer-run goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. In setting monetary policy, we assess the realized progress the economy\nhas made on our goals and our expectation of further progress based on the economic outlook over the\nmedium run and the risks to the outlook.\n\nIn my view, economic developments have corroborated the Committee’s medium-run outlook that labor\nmarkets will continue to show strength, that growth will rebound to a pace at or slightly above trend, and\nthat inflation will gradually rise to our 2 percent target. We have seen sustained improvement in the labor\nmarket, which, in my view, is now basically at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary\npolicy can do, and inflation has been moving up closer to our goal. I view the risks to the outlook as\nbroadly balanced.\n\nThe current target range for our policy rate, the federal funds rate, is 1/4 to 1/2 percent, which is quite\naccommodative. When the Committee met in early November, it assessed that the case for moving the\npolicy rate up had continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further\nevidence of continued progress toward the dual-mandate objectives. I, and one of my colleagues,\ndissented from that decision, preferring to see a 25-basis-point rise.\n\n\f13\nI view a small step up in interest rates as appropriate, not because I want to curtail the expansion, but\nbecause I believe it will help prolong the expansion. We know that monetary policy affects the economy\nwith long and variable lags, so policy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. The\nlesson that policy should be forward looking is based on the history of poor outcomes when that strategy\nhasn’t been followed and we’ve fallen far behind the curve. If we delay too long and then find ourselves\nin a situation where the labor market becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and\nwe have to move rates up steeply, we could risk a recession, a bad outcome that disproportionately harms\nthe more vulnerable parts of our society. Delaying for too long might also induce investors to search for\nyield, raising risks to financial stability. I do not think we are behind the curve yet, but I think the risks to\nmacroeconomic stability and to financial stability will grow over time should we fail to take appropriate\naction given where we are on our goals and the current low level of our policy rate. I view another\nincrease in interest rates as a prudent step to take.\n\nI anticipate that a gradual upward path of policy is likely to be appropriate given economic developments.\nThat means that the policy rate won’t be moving up at each meeting and that policy will remain\naccommodative for some time, continuing to lend support to the economic expansion going forward. It\nwill allow us to recalibrate policy over time as we gain more insight into the underlying structural aspects\nof the post-crisis economy and as the economy evolves.\n\nConclusion\nBetween now and when the FOMC next meets in December, I will continue to assess economic and\nfinancial conditions to see if any change is warranted in my medium-run outlook. My colleagues on the\nFOMC will be doing that too, and, in December, the FOMC will provide a new set of forecasts\nsummarizing our current views on the economy and monetary policy. I look forward to the meeting, and\nI commend Chair Janet Yellen for fostering an atmosphere of serious deliberation and the free exchange\nof ideas in FOMC meetings. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe the history\n\n\f14\nof the Fed has shown that better policy decisions are made when a diversity of information and views is\nconsidered.\n\nSometimes I’m asked whether the FOMC routinely coordinates our monetary policy actions with those of\nother countries. The answer is no – we set our monetary policy to promote our goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability in the U.S.14 But we operate in a global economy and there are ties among\neconomies and financial markets, so we must consider economic and financial developments abroad to\nthe extent they affect the outlook for the U.S. economy. For example, weak growth abroad has been a\ndrag on our economy because it has meant weaker U.S. export growth. Similarly, the appreciation in the\nvalue of the dollar that began in mid-2014 put downward pressure on inflation by holding down import\nprices. So these developments factored into our assessment of appropriate monetary policy. U.S. fiscal\npolicy is also part of the economic environment. The prospects for some changes to fiscal and other\neconomic policies, such as infrastructure spending, tax code changes, immigration policy, and trade\npolicy, have likely increased. But the form any policy change will take, the timing of passage, and the\ntiming and size of the impacts are very uncertain at this point. When we gauge the effects of any\nforthcoming fiscal and other economic policy changes on the outlook for growth, employment, and\ninflation, the devil will be in the details.\n\nAs we gain more clarity about the policies that might be forthcoming, the FOMC will assess their effects,\nas well as the implications of economic and financial developments, on the medium-run economic\noutlook and appropriate monetary policy. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set course and we will\ncontinue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess the situation. As an FOMC\n14\n\nAn exception is that during times of extreme stress in financial markets, central banks have coordinated action to\npromote orderly market functioning. For example, during the financial crisis, the Fed, Bank of Canada, Bank of\nEngland, European Central Bank (ECB), and Swiss National Bank issued a joint statement announcing certain\nactions being taken to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets, including the authorization of\ntemporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines). (See the press release dated December 12, 2007:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20071212a.htm.) Another example was the\nannouncement of a reciprocal swap line between the Fed and the ECB after the terrorist attacks on 9/11.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nShadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting\nNew York, NY\nOctober 7, 2016\n\n\f1\nVoltaire: Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.\n\nIntroduction\nI thank Mickey Levy and the Shadow Open Market Committee for inviting me to speak today. I have\nknown many of the Shadow Committee’s members for quite a long time – longer than I care to admit!\nOver the years, I have learned much from the position papers and conferences put together by this serious\ngroup of economists. I share their view that the active exchange of diverse ideas and careful deliberations\nultimately result in better policy decisions.\n\nToday, I would like to share my perspective as someone who has participated in some of those policy\ndecisions. I will comment on how I approach monetary policymaking in an uncertain world, review the\ntypes of uncertainty policymakers and economists need to deal with, and provide some recommendations\nfor improving monetary policy communications. Of course, the views I’ll present today are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nMonetary Policy Communications\nI believe monetary policy should be set based on the outlook for the economy over the medium run\nbecause this is the time horizon over which monetary policy can affect the economy. I focus on\nunderlying fundamentals in determining that medium-run outlook, and I have cautioned against overreacting to short-term fluctuations in the economic and financial data.1 I believe credible policy\ncommunications play a key role in policymaking. It has been well established that when the public has a\nclearer understanding about how monetary policy is likely to change as economic conditions evolve –\nwhether those changes in conditions are anticipated or not – monetary policy is more effective.\nPolicymakers can improve the public’s understanding by being clear about the goals of monetary policy,\n\n1\n\nSee Mester (April 1, 2016).\n\n\f2\nthose aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can’t influence, and the economic information that\ninfluences their forecasts and policy decisions, as well as by striving to be systematic in their policy\nresponses to changes in economic conditions that influence the outlook. When the public has a clearer\nunderstanding of the strategy monetary policymakers follow in normal times, not only will they be able to\nmake better financial and employment decisions, they will also understand when nonstandard monetary\npolicy action is required in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has taken many steps over time to improve its policy communications. Recent\nenhancements include the Chair’s press briefings four times a year, the Summary of Economic\nProjections, and the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which established an\nexplicit numerical goal for inflation.\n\nSo CNBC’s August Fed survey of market economists, fund managers, and strategists revealed to my mind\nsome pretty troubling news. Nearly half of the respondents reported that they believe current Federal\nReserve policy is mostly influenced by the current data, while less than 40 percent said they think it’s\ninfluenced by the medium-run outlook, and the rest were unsure. Sixty percent said they thought the Fed\ndoesn’t have a framework for deciding when to adjust policy, while only about a quarter of the\nrespondents said they think we do.\n\nThese results suggest to me that our policy communications could benefit from further enhancements.\nRecently, the FOMC has been describing its policymaking approach as being “data dependent.”\nUnfortunately, I believe there is some confusion about what the Fed actually means by “data dependent.”\nThis phrase has provided a transition from a period of explicit forward guidance, which was used as a\npolicy tool during the recession and early in the recovery, back to more normal policymaking times.2 But\nthis transition has posed somewhat of a challenge for FOMC communications. After the Great Inflation\n2\n\nSee Mester (November 20, 2014) for an overview of the use and evolution of forward guidance during the Great\nRecession and its aftermath.\n\n\f3\nof the 1970s, the FOMC became more predictable and systematic in how it reacted to changes in\neconomic activity and inflation.3 So the public had a pretty good sense of the Fed’s so-called reaction\nfunction and explicit forward guidance was rarely used. But the Great Recession required the Fed to\nbehave in a way quite distinct from its past behavior, and consequently, there is less understanding today\nabout how policymakers are likely to react to incoming economic information. Another factor\ncomplicating communication is that market participants prefer more explicit statements and less\nuncertainty. Thus, they may interpret the forecasts of the economy and the appropriate policy path as\nhaving more certitude than they actually do, which creates some communications issues when the\nforecasts and policy path change.\n\nThe concept of “data dependence” was meant to reinforce the idea that the economy is dynamic and will\nbe hit by economic disturbances that can’t be known in advance. Some shocks will result in an\naccumulation of economic information that changes the medium-run outlook for the economy and the\nrisks around the outlook in a way to which monetary policy will want to respond. But some of these\nshocks will not materially change the outlook or policymakers’ view of appropriate policy.\nUnfortunately, referring to policy as “data-dependent” could be giving the wrong impression that policy is\ndriven by short-run movements in a couple of different data reports. It may even suggest that policysetting is unsystematic in that the salient data reports may be viewed as changing from meeting to\nmeeting. We seem to find ourselves in a situation where market participants and commentators view any\none monthly or quarterly data release as the definitive piece of evidence that will result in either a policy\naction or no action.\n\nTypes of Uncertainty\nI mentioned that market participants tend to like certainty. But that applies more broadly – in many\nsituations, people prefer certainty. But the world is an uncertain place, and I think policymakers should\n3\n\nSee Taylor (2012).\n\n\f4\nfind a better way to acknowledge and convey that uncertainty. The 18th century French philosopher\nVoltaire said, “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.” In other words,\nwe might prefer to live in a world with more certainty, but we don’t. And to pretend we do live in such a\nworld is absurd – it can lead to bad outcomes.\n\nIn terms of economics and monetary policymaking, uncertainty comes into play in a number of ways. For\nexample, price stability and monetary policy are intimately linked, but setting monetary policy to achieve\nprice stability is not trivial. There is uncertainty around our measures and forecasts of inflation and about\nthe transmission of monetary policy to inflation. Recently, economists have been focusing on the\nuncertainty surrounding the underlying structural aspects of the economy, such as the longer-run levels of\nthe unemployment rate, trend output growth, structural productivity growth, and equilibrium interest\nrates, and their implications for monetary policy. As former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan\npointed out: “... uncertainty is not just a pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the\ndefining characteristic of that landscape.”4\n\nData uncertainty\nOne type of uncertainty economists and policymakers need to confront is data uncertainty. The U.S.\nstatistical agencies provide excellent service using best-practice techniques to gather large volumes of\nhigh-quality data on numerous aspects of the economy. But even the highest quality data are inevitably\nmeasured with some error and are sometimes subject to revision as more information is gathered. For\nexample, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 90 percent confidence interval due to sampling\nerror for the monthly change in nonfarm payroll employment is about plus or minus 115,000 jobs.5 Of\ncourse, users of the data know this, but we tend to ignore this issue. Charles Manski has written\n\n4\n5\n\nSee Greenspan (2004).\n\nThe surveys are also affected by nonsampling errors, including data collection errors or variation in response rates.\nSee Technical Notes in “The Employment Situation – August 2016,” Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of\nLabor.\n\n\f5\nextensively on what he calls the problem of “incredible certitude.”6 Downplaying the fact that the official\nstatistics are measured with error can lead less sophisticated users of the data to believe they are more\nprecisely measured than they actually are. Manski points out that the idea that economists, policymakers,\nand the statistical agencies should do much more to convey the sense of error around the statistics is not a\nnew idea. It was strongly encouraged more than 50 years ago by Oskar Morgenstern, a founder of the\nfield of game theory.7\n\nThings have improved since then. Revisions in some of the data reports, like GDP growth and\nemployment, routinely get media coverage, and a body of research investigating the implications of data\nrevisions for forecasting, structural modeling, and policy is growing.8 Still, it seems likely that the\nimprecision in some of the data and the difficulties in forecasting are not fully appreciated. This comes to\nlight every month in the days leading up to the release of the monthly employment report. Economists\nare polled to see what they expect the monthly number to be, and then when the report is released, the\nfinancial press often reports the number as good if it exceeds the consensus estimate or bad if it is weaker\nthan the consensus. Little attention is paid to the dispersion in the economists’ estimates in the first place,\nto the fact that the number in the release is measured with some error, or to the fact that even a job growth\nnumber that comes in less than analysts expected could be strong enough to put further downward\npressure on the unemployment rate.\nData revisions complicate making monetary policy in real time.9 PCE inflation, the measure the Fed uses\nfor its inflation goal, is subject to revision. For example, FOMC transcripts and minutes show that in\n\n6\n\nSee Manski (2011 and 2015).\n\n7\n\nSee Morgenstern (1950 and1963).\n\n8\n\nSee Croushore (2011) for a review of the literature on real-time data analysis.\n\n9\n\nAs discussed by Croushore (2011), the largest revision ever recorded for quarterly GDP growth was for the fourth\nquarter of 2008. The first release was made in January 2009 and showed GDP declining 3.8 percent at an annual\nrate. Just a month later, this number was revised down by 2.4 percentage points, to minus 6.2 percent, confirming\nthe extent of the worst recession since the Great Depression. In the third monthly release in March 2009, the number\nwas revised up a bit to minus 5.4 percent. With the benchmark revisions since then, the reading is now minus 8.2\n\n\f6\nearly 2002, policymakers were concerned about a drop in inflation. Ultimately, much of this drop was\nrevised away. Someone reading the transcripts today not knowing that the data were subsequently revised\ncould be quite confused by the discussion.\n\nMeasurement issues also affect some of the important constructs in macroeconomic models. In a number\nof papers, Athanasios Orphanides has laid out a convincing case that mismeasurement of slack and other\nunobservables like the natural rate of interest led to monetary policy mistakes that contributed to the Great\nInflation of the 1970s. He argues that these mismeasured concepts continue to unduly influence monetary\npolicy today and can lead to poor policy decisions that induce undesirable fluctuations in the\neconomy.10, 11\n\nModel uncertainty\nEconomists and policymakers also need to confront model uncertainty.12 Even if we were all to agree on\none model of the economy – a heroic assumption to be sure – the parameters governing how economic\nagents interact with one another would be estimated from the data and would not be precisely known. So\nthere would be uncertainty around forecasts derived from the model and the appropriate policy stance\nbased on the model, even if we knew with certainty what shocks were going to hit the economy in the\nfuture.\n\nOf course, the situation is even more complicated because economists don’t agree on a single model or a\nsingle set of assumptions within a general class of models. Often, there are competing models or different\npercent. (Data are available in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Real-Time Data Set for\nMacroeconomists.)\n10\n\nSee, for example, Orphanides and Van Norden (2005) and Orphanides (2015).\n\n11\n\nA thorny issue related to data uncertainty is uncertainty about the nature of the shocks hitting the economy. For\nexample, to understand the implications of incoming data on jobs, one needs to understand the nature of the factors\naffecting recent employment growth – are they demand-side factors like growth in output or supply-side factors like\na mismatch between skills available and skills in demand?\n12\n\nDennis (2005) presents a useful nontechnical summary of some of the types of uncertainty confronting monetary\npolicymakers.\n\n\f7\nsets of assumptions that are consistent with the observable data.13 Before the financial crisis, we may\nhave convinced ourselves that we could rely on representative agent models, linearized around a steady\nstate, with one interest rate. But the nature of the financial crisis pointed out the inadequacies of these\nmodels for understanding the interplay between the real economy and financial markets. The good news\nis that macroeconomic models are being developed that include more than just a rudimentary financial\nsector, and policymakers at the Fed and elsewhere are broadening the set of models we routinely\nconsult.14 Nonetheless, while our usual models can give us a pretty good sense of the employment and\ninflation costs of a change in monetary policy, we are still less able to quantify the financial stability costs\nand benefits of particular monetary policy paths. So we need to remain humble, and continue to examine\nthe economy’s performance to assess these costs and benefits.\n\nAddressing Uncertainty in Theory and Practice\nEconomists and forecasters have developed several techniques to handle uncertainty. Bayesian\nestimation techniques are commonly used in macroeconomic modeling to handle parameter uncertainty.\nGiven the model and the available data, these Bayesian methods yield probability distributions of\nforecasts that reflect both uncertainty about the future evolution of the economy and uncertainty about the\nparameters of the model. Model uncertainty is more difficult to address. But if we know the set of\nrelevant models and can write them down, then Bayesian techniques can also be used to address model\nuncertainty. In particular, Bayesian techniques can be used to average across multiple models, based on\n13\n\nManski (2011) calls different assumptions generating different projections “dueling certitudes.” He posits a “Law\nof Decreasing Credibility: The credibility of inference decreases with the strength of the assumptions maintained.”\nStrong assumptions can yield more definitive conclusions, but if the assumptions are questionable, then those\ndefinitive conclusions will be questionable as well.\n14\n\nThe FOMC has been expanding the models it routinely examines as a part of the policymaking process. These\ninclude the Board of Governors staff’s large-scale FRB/US model and two smaller-scale dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium (DSGE) models called EDO and SIGMA, as well as various models maintained and utilized at the\nFederal Reserve Banks. See the discussion of the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing research on DSGE models in\nthe Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 21-22, 2011. Academic researchers are now building\nmodel archives to aid in the systematic comparison of empirical results and policy implications across a large set of\neconomic models as an aid to policy analysis. One such archive, The Macroeconomic Model Data Base (MMB),\nheaded by Volker Wieland of Goethe University Frankfurt, currently includes 61 models. See The Macroeconomic\nModel Data Base (MMB) web page at www.macromodelbase.com for more information on the database; for a\ndiscussion of the approach, see Wieland, Cwik, Müller, Schmidt, and Wolters (2012).\n\n\f8\nthe models’ relative abilities to fit the data. In this model-averaging approach, appropriate policy would\nbe the policy that performs well on average across the set of models but is not necessarily the best policy\nin any one particular model.15 A related literature studies setting policy using simple rules that are robust\nacross a variety of model and economic circumstances.16\n\nIn some cases, it may not be easy to write down all the models that could characterize the economy or\nassociate probabilities to various outcomes. Nobel Laureates Tom Sargent and Lars Hansen have\ndeveloped a robust-control approach that can address model uncertainty and misspecification even in\nthese circumstances. Their approach confronts head-on the fact that models are only an approximation to\nreality and they show the benefit of choosing the policy that produces the best outcome in the worst-case\nscenario across models. The policymaker doesn’t necessarily expect the worst, but she should plan\nagainst it because doing so will lead to acceptable performance across a wide array of circumstances.17\n\nFrom a practical policymaking standpoint, I find that looking at forecasts from several models gives me a\nbetter sense not only of the most likely forecast but also the risks around the forecast. I don’t believe we\nare at the state of knowledge where a single policy rule can be used to set policy because no rule works\nwell enough across a variety of economic models and in a variety of economic circumstances. But I do\nfind it useful to look at the outcomes of an array of simple, robust monetary policy rules as a benchmark\nagainst which to assess current policy. The Cleveland Fed website now publishes the outcomes of seven\nsimple monetary policy rules based on three publicly available forecasts.18\n\n15\n\nBernanke (2007) discusses these techniques in an accessible way. See Waggoner and Zha (2012) for an\napplication.\n16\n\nSee, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2002 and 2007).\n\n17\n\nSee Sargent (1998) and Hansen and Sargent (2007 and 2011). As discussed in Hansen and Sargent (2001),\nBrunner and Meltzer (1967) were early proponents of using a min-max strategy for handling model ambiguity.\n18\n\nSee “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. In addition to posting current\noutcomes for the set of rules, the web page includes a tool that allows the user to customize the rules and the\nforecasted inputs into the rules to generate alternative policy paths.\n\n\f9\nDespite the diversity across the outcomes, I find that the rules provide some discipline in systematically\nrelating incoming data to policy decisions: if the current policy stance is quite different from what the\nrules suggest, one must carefully consider the factors that support that deviation. One caveat of looking at\nthe outcomes of several models and several rules is that you want to be consistent about it. You must\nguard against changing which model or rule you favor merely because it happens to produce results that\nconfirm your intuition or preferred policy stance at the time.\n\nIn terms of policy responses to uncertainty, some results in the literature suggest that when policymakers\nconfront more uncertainty either in their data or models, they should be more cautious in acting, that is, be\nmore inertial in their responses.19 However, subsequent research has shown that this is not generally true.\nFor example, Sargent (1998) points out that caution does not necessarily mean doing less. When there’s\nuncertainty, it might be better in some cases for policymakers to act more aggressively, not less, because\naggressive and preemptive action can prevent the worst-case outcomes from actually coming about.20\nAnother factor that can affect whether the policymaker should be inertial or not is the public’s\nunderstanding of the policymaker’s reaction function and the policymaker’s commitment to following\nthat reaction function. For example, if the policymaker hasn’t effectively communicated, retaining a very\naccommodative monetary policy stance might be interpreted as signaling a gloomy economic outlook\nrather than as a preemptive move against downside risk.21 This points out the importance of clear\ncommunications, the starting point for this talk and where I’d like to conclude.\n\n19\n\nAoki (2003) studied the optimal policy response when data are measured with error and concluded that the degree\nof response to a variable in the policy rule should be less the higher the variable’s measurement error. Brainard\n(1967) studied optimal policy in response to a shock when there is uncertainty about the effect of policy on the\neconomy and concluded that policy should respond less when there is uncertainty than when there is no uncertainty.\nThis result has been shown not to be general across models.\n20\n\nGiannoni (2002 and 2007) shows policymakers averse to uncertainty will react more strongly to fluctuations in\ninflation and the output gap than if there were no uncertainty. They would put more weight on stabilizing inflation\nand the output gap and less weight on stabilizing the nominal interest rate.\n21\n\nSee Woodford (2012).\n\n\f10\nThree Recommendations for Monetary Policy Communications\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but I think we would clarify things for the public by acknowledging\nuncertainty and focusing attention on the medium-run outlook rather than on short-run fluctuations in the\ndata. Let me offer three recommendations that I believe would improve FOMC communications.\n\nFirst, the FOMC should publish confidence bands around the projections in the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP). Four times a year, the FOMC summarizes Committee participants’ projections of\noutput growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the associated appropriate policy path. For the past\nyear, we have also been providing the median projections across the participants for each variable.\nAlthough it is a topic of discussion, the FOMC does not publish error bands around these projections.22 I\nbelieve we could improve our communications if we did.23 Confidence bands are a standard part of\nforecasting, illustrating that the future is inherently uncertain. The confidence bands would give the\npublic a better sense of the normal type of forecast variation one should expect to see, so they could better\nunderstand some of the risks around the forecast and subsequent changes in the forecast. The confidence\nbands would also be a helpful reminder to policymakers to remain humble about our ability to know the\nfuture with much certainty.\n\nAlthough the public at-large may not be aware of it, the Committee does publish a summary table of the\naverage historical errors of projections from 1996 through 2015 made by various private and government\nforecasters. We can apply historical errors to the median FOMC projections to get an approximate,\nsymmetric 70 percent confidence interval for each variable, as illustrated in Figures 1-4.24\n\n22\n\nSee Minutes of the FOMC Meeting of January 26-27, 2016.\n\n23\n\nThe Bank of Canada, Bank of England, European Central Bank, Norges Bank, and the Riksbank all publish a\nforecast with error bands as part of their communications; in some cases, it is the policymakers’ forecast, and in\nother cases, it is a staff forecast.\n24\n\nBecause the September SEP has not yet been published, in the figures, the confidence bands for GDP growth, the\nunemployment rate, and inflation are constructed using the average historical projection errors in Table 2 in the June\nSEP, and the confidence band for the fed funds rate is constructed using the band illustrated in Chair Yellen’s\nspeech in Jackson Hole in August (Yellen, 2016).\n\n\f11\n\nAs you can see in Figure 3, the error band around the inflation forecast one or two years out is about 1\npercentage point. Keeping those confidence bands in mind helps one to judge progress toward our policy\ngoals. In addition, the figure clearly shows that even though the dispersion across FOMC participants\noften gets media attention, it is actually quite narrow when compared with the confidence band around the\ninflation forecast.\n\nThe federal funds rate path differs from the other variables in the SEP because policymakers choose the\npath. But because there is uncertainty around each participant’s projections of growth, the unemployment\nrate, and inflation, there is also uncertainty around the appropriate policy path. Providing a confidence\nband would help remind people that the median policy path in the SEP is not meant to be a firm\ncommitment on the part of the FOMC. Instead, policy should be expected to respond to changes in\neconomic and financial conditions that materially affect the medium-run outlook. As you can see in\nFigure 4, the range of reasonable outcomes for the policy path is actually quite wide, and considerably\nwider than some of the variation we’ve seen in the SEP policy path over time, even though those shifts\nhave often drawn considerable media attention.\n\nMy second recommendation is that the FOMC present a forecast that could serve as the benchmark for\nunderstanding the FOMC’s policy actions and post-meeting statements. The median paths in the SEP are\na step in that direction, but the variables are not linked. So, for example, there is no guarantee that\nsomeone projecting the median inflation path would necessarily be projecting the median output path.\nPublishing a benchmark forecast – with error bands – as do many other central banks would make it\nsomewhat easier to explain how the economic outlook is dependent on the future path of monetary policy.\nIn 2012, the FOMC experimented with developing a forecast representing the consensus of the\n\n\f12\nCommittee.25 It proved difficult to reach a consensus on a consensus forecast, but I think we should\ncontinue to pursue this.26 In the meantime, we should consider publishing the staff’s forecast.\nPolicymakers need not agree with the staff’s forecast, but they could use it as a benchmark against which\nto explain how and why their forecasts may differ.\n\nMy third recommendation pertains to our post-meeting FOMC statement. While it continues to serve the\nCommittee well, I believe the statement could do more to dissuade people from thinking short term, and\nto illuminate that policy is being formulated based on the medium-run outlook, the risks around the\noutlook, and the progress on our policy goals. The statement is an important part of FOMC\ncommunications, providing information on the mapping from economic conditions to the outlook, and\nthen to policy actions. The current formulation of the statement does highlight factors that are important\nin that reaction function, namely, the medium-run outlook for inflation, resource utilization, and inflation\nexpectations. But the first paragraph in the statement tends to concentrate on changes in economic\nconditions since the last FOMC meeting, which can spur a short-run focus. The facts in the paragraph are\nalways true – investment has been soft, unemployment is little changed, employment growth has been\nsolid, on average, and so on. But we could improve the public’s understanding of our monetary policy\nstrategy if we provided more interpretation of those facts – namely, our assessment of how recent changes\nin economic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks around that\noutlook, and therefore the appropriate policy path. We could also strive for more consistency about the\nconditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy so that the public would get a better\nsense of the Committee’s reaction function over time.\n\n25\n\nSee the minutes from the July, September, and October 2012 FOMC meetings\n(www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm#11655).\n26\n\nHetzel (2016) provides one proposal for how this might be implemented.\n\n\f13\n\nConclusion\nUncertainty is the norm, not the exception. I believe it will serve both the public and the FOMC well if\nwe more explicitly acknowledge this uncertainty. Doing so will help the public evaluate whether changes\nin economic conditions or in the outlook are significant or not. It will help them see that the economy\noften evolves differently than the modal forecast, and that it is better to focus on the medium run than on\nshort-run fluctuations in the data. It will give them a better sense of what policymakers mean when they\nsay their policy is data-dependent. My suggestions here are simple ones, but I believe they are consistent\nwith the evolutionary changes the FOMC has been making on its journey to increased transparency.\nAlthough policy communications will likely always remain somewhat of a challenge, I believe striving\nfor even clearer communications is worth the effort.\n\n\f14\nReferences\nAoki, Kosuke, “On the Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Noisy Indicators,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 50, April 2003, pp. 501-523.\nBernanke, Ben S., “Monetary Policy under Uncertainty,” remarks at the 32nd Annual Economic Policy\nConference, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, October 19, 2007.\nBrainard, William C., “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” American Economic Review: Papers\nand Proceedings 57, May 1967, pp. 411-425.\nBrunner, Karl, and Allan H.

        "content": "The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGreater Cleveland Partnership Middle-Market Forum\nCleveland, OH\nSeptember 28, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Since my arrival in Cleveland\nover two years ago, I have seen first-hand the important role that the Greater Cleveland Partnership plays\nin supporting the growth of our regional economy and I am very proud to serve on its board. Of course,\nas president of one of the country’s 12 Federal Reserve Banks I have a keen interest in our regional\neconomy. As we gather in the lobby of this historic building, it is hard not to think back to a time more\nthan 100 years ago and applaud the Congressmen – yes, they were all men back then – who came up with\nsuch an ingenious design for our Federal Reserve System. Congress established the Fed in 1913 as a\ndecentralized central bank, independent within the government but not independent from the government.\nThe Fed’s design balances public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street\nconcerns. I believe the design has served the country well by allowing monetary policy decisions to take\ninto account the diversity of the American economy and its people.\n\nAs president of the Cleveland Fed, I make it a point to bring the economic information we have garnered\nfrom business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the District to meetings of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The\ninsightful regional perspectives provided by our directors, advisory council members, and other regional\ncontacts, along with economic and financial data and analysis, all play an important part in the Fed’s\nsetting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price\nstability. I commend Chair Janet Yellen for fostering an atmosphere of serious deliberation and the free\nexchange of ideas in FOMC meetings. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe\nthe history of this institution has shown that better policy decisions are made when a diversity of\ninformation and views is considered.\n\nSome of that diversity was on display when the FOMC met last week and decided to maintain its policy\nrate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. I, along with two of my colleagues, dissented from that consensus decision in\n\n\f2\nfavor of moving the federal funds rate up by 25 basis points. The reason I believe a gradual upward path\nof policy continues to be appropriate and that I favored taking another step on that path in September is\nbecause of the realized progress the economy has made on our monetary policy goals and my expectation\nof further progress. That expectation is based on my outlook for the economy. So today, I would like to\ndiscuss my outlook for both the national and regional economy and my views on monetary policy. Of\ncourse, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. Household balance\nsheets have improved greatly since the recession and households feel confident enough to be borrowing\nagain. We have seen sustained progress in the labor market and wages are gradually beginning to\naccelerate. Oil prices remain low, and while the decline in energy prices has been a considerable negative\nfor the energy-producing sector, it has benefited households and the many businesses that consume\nenergy. The underlying strength in the economy is demonstrated by the resiliency it has shown through a\nnumber of bumps along the road of expansion. Some of the recent bumps include the gyrations in\nfinancial markets at the beginning of the year, the slowdown in growth in China, economic weakness in\nEurope, the large appreciation of the dollar between mid-2014 and the start of this year, and the\nuncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union.\n\nAll forecasts carry risk, and sometimes it is difficult to extract the signal about where the economy is\nheaded from noisy economic and financial market data. With those usual caveats, my modal forecast is\nthat over the next couple of years, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longerrun trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will move further below its\nlonger-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually\nreturn to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\n\n\f3\nEconomic growth\nU.S. output growth in the first half of the year was quite slow, coming in at only around 1 percent. Much\nof that sluggishness was due to a decline in business inventories, and so GDP growth underestimated the\nunderlying strength in demand. Based on incoming data, growth is poised to rebound in the second half\nof the year. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, has been a driver of\ngrowth and I expect that to continue. Improving household balance sheets, growth in personal income,\nlow borrowing rates, and low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending.\n\nThe housing sector is gradually improving and I expect activity in the sector will continue to expand at a\nsustainable pace. The monthly home sales numbers have been volatile from month-to-month, reflecting a\nmixture of supply and demand factors. Builders have been telling us that they are having trouble finding\nqualified workers in some of the construction trades and they are cautiously avoiding over-building,\nhaving learned from the housing boom and crash. Mortgage rates are low, but households are being\ncareful not to take on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending but to those with\ngood credit quality.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak, and this weakness is somewhat of a\npuzzle. Given the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014, it’s not surprising that firms in the drilling and\nmining sector, their suppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector were hurt. We\nhave seen the effects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production, which supplies the\nenergy industry, has been down and other firms tied to energy have cut jobs and reduced investment. But\neven outside of the energy sector, business investment has been soft despite generally accommodative\nfinancial conditions. Manufacturing firms are telling us they are investing, but mainly to sustain current\noperations rather than to expand. Some of the softness in investment reflects weak demand outside of the\nU.S., which has hurt U.S. exports. Other firms seem to be using the low interest rate environment to buy\n\n\f4\nback stock rather than to expand plant and equipment spending. More generally, there just seems to be a\nsense of caution on the part of firms.\n\nI expect investment to begin to pick up with economic growth. But the weakness in investment and the\nassociated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of the U.S. economy.\nStructural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output and increases in\nliving standards. And a key determinant of productivity growth is investment in physical and human\ncapital. Labor productivity growth has risen at an annual rate of only one-half percent over the past five\nyears. Part of this weakness is cyclical; some of it reflects longer-run demographics, including the aging\nof the population, and some of it likely reflects difficulties measuring productivity in the service sector,\nincluding intellectual property and information technology. It is difficult to forecast productivity growth,\nso the recent softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it’s\nthe latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth\nI’ve been assuming.\n\nMonetary policy cannot affect these longer-term structural aspects of the economy, but it needs to\nconsider them. For example, in an economy with lower trend growth and productivity, the average level\nof interest rates that balances supply and demand – what economists call the neutral rate of interest – will\nbe lower. But just because monetary policy can’t move the trend growth rate higher doesn’t mean there\naren’t other steps the country can take to address these longer-run issues: policies that encourage\ninvestments in technology and human capital, tax and regulatory changes, and longer-run fiscal policy\nshould all be under consideration.\n\nAs this brief overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But\noverall, economic growth has proven to be resilient and I expect growth over the next two years to be at\n\n\f5\nor slightly above a trend of around 2 percent. The pace of growth, while lower than in other expansions,\nhas been sufficient to generate significant and sustained progress in labor markets.\n\nLabor markets\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about\n10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its\npeak of 10 percent in late 2009. The past two years have also seen significant improvements in other\ngauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time workers who\nwould rather work full-time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job.\n\nSo far this year, firms have added over 1.4 million payroll jobs, an average of about 180,000 jobs per\nmonth. That’s well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from 75,000 to 120,000\nper month. We are increasingly hearing from businesses across a broad set of industries that they are\nhaving trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skilled occupations and in lower-skilled jobs. And\nwe are now beginning to see firms respond by raising wages.\n\nI expect to see the labor market continue to tighten. Although payroll job growth is projected to slow a\nbit from the current pace given the progress that’s been made, it will be sufficient to put further\ndownward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below 5 percent\nover the next two years.\n\nI do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession\nand slow recovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment\nsituation faced by different demographic groups in the U.S. Technological advances and globalization are\nchanging the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs.\n\n\f6\nI recently visited Hazard, Kentucky, a part of the Cleveland District in the heart of Appalachia. I spoke\nwith some coal miners who were graduating from an electrical-fiber optic lineman training program at the\nHazard Community and Technical College. 1 All 28 graduates had jobs lined up or were entertaining\nseveral job offers. Although this is just one program, it does demonstrate that progress can be made in\naddressing the longer-run workforce development issues our country faces.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, through its Community Development function, has a role to play in easing such\nregional transitions. By objective analysis, we can help measure the scope of the problems communities\nin transition face, determine how best to scale up small, effective programs, and evaluate the pros and\ncons of alternative approaches and policies.\n\nMonetary policy has an important role to play in fostering conditions to ensure that the economy achieves\nan enduring economic expansion. This economic stability will help those demographic groups –\nminorities, older workers, lower-income people – who are disproportionately harmed by economic\ndownturns. But monetary policy cannot directly affect longer-run workforce development problems, and\nfrom the vantage point of our dual-mandated goals, I believe we are at maximum employment.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s\ntarget of 2 percent for quite a while, but it has picked up over the past year. I believe the conditions are in\nplace for a gradual increase in inflation back to 2 percent over the next couple of years. The current low\ninflation rate partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the price of oil and other commodities, as\nwell as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down import prices. As these effects have worked\n1\n\nThe program is part of Kentucky’s Hiring Our Miners Everyday, or H.O.M.E., program, which is housed within\nthe Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program and is funded by an emergency grant from the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor.\n\n\f7\nthemselves through, headline PCE and CPI inflation, measured year-over-year, have moved up from the\nvery low levels recorded last year to around 1 percent in recent months. To get a better sense of the\nunderlying trend in inflation, economists often look at other measures of inflation that smooth through or\nstrip out some of the more volatile components. These include core PCE inflation and trimmed-mean\nPCE inflation, which are both at 1.6 percent and gradually nearing the 2 percent goal, as well as core CPI\ninflation and median CPI inflation, which are now over 2 percent. Indeed, the Cleveland Fed median CPI\nmeasure has been above 2-1/4 percent all year, and at or above 2-1/2 percent for the past four months. 2\n\nStable long-run inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. We look at a\nnumber of different indicators of inflation expectations. Some are based on surveys of consumers and of\nprofessional forecasters; others are based on financial market data. The Cleveland Fed’s expectations\nmeasure of five-year inflation, five years from now, which combines survey and market data, has been\nstable this year, in a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent. 3\n\nReasonably stable long-run inflation expectations, evidence that inflation is moving up, continued\nstrength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend all suggest that inflation\nis on a path of gradually returning to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years.\n\nRegional growth and labor markets\nBefore I turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy, let me talk about our\nregional economy. The Cleveland District comprises all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern\nKentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Our regional economy is quite diverse, but the\n\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-anddata/median-cpi.aspx.\n3\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations measure is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicatorsand-data/inflation-expectations.aspx.\n\n\f8\npath of economic expansion here and the outlook are similar to the nation’s. To be sure, our region tends\nto be more dependent on manufacturing than other parts of the country. For example, manufacturing\naccounts for 15 percent of private-sector jobs in Ohio compared to about 10 percent in the U.S. as a\nwhole. So the region has borne the brunt of the weakness in manufacturing. Similarly, the region had\nenjoyed the benefits of a sharp increase in production and employment in the oil and gas extraction sector\nas new technologies were brought to bear, but the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014 has resulted in a\nsignificant slowdown in natural gas and oil exploration in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, which\ninclude northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The weakness in the energy sector is expected to\npersist somewhat longer, and the longer-term shift away from coal as a source of energy will have lasting\neffects on the coal-producing parts of the region that have not diversified their economies. 4\n\nOn the other hand, the region has benefited from the strength in auto sales, construction, and the service\nsector, including health and education. We are seeing a modest pickup in regional manufacturing,\nparticularly in firms that are more focused on domestic markets and the auto sector. The auto industry\nrepresents a significant share of manufacturing in Ohio and Kentucky, and over the past few years,\nDistrict auto plants have produced about 17 percent of the nation’s autos and light trucks. As auto sales\nhave risen to record levels, regional production has risen as well. Our contacts in the District’s auto\nsector remain optimistic, even though the record sales pace is leveling off.\n\nHousing markets in the region have shown improvement over time. During the housing boom, we didn’t\nsee the sharp increases in home prices experienced in other parts of the country. But we did suffer from\n\n4\n\nFor further discussion of trends in the energy, steel, and auto sectors in the Cleveland Federal Reserve District, see\nMark E. Schweitzer, Robert Sadowski, and Christopher Vecchio, “Three Trends Influencing the Region’s Growth,”\nForefront, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, January 15, 2016, available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/forefront/ff-v6n03/ff-20160115-v6n03-threetrends-influencing-the-regions-growth.aspx.\n\n\f9\nthe housing bust with a large number of foreclosures and vacant properties. The situation has improved.\nResidential real estate prices in Ohio are now increasing in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range, with the usual\nvariation across local markets. And according to the Cleveland Fed’s Community Stabilization Index,\ncommunities across the Fourth District experienced increased housing market stability in 2015, with\nmortgage delinquencies and foreclosure rates down. 5 Residential builders tell us they are optimistic that\nregional housing markets will continue to strengthen.\n\nLike the nation, our region has seen considerable improvement in labor markets since the start of the\nrecovery. In Ohio, the unemployment rate peaked at 11 percent in December 2009, and is now down to\n4.7 percent. This is near the national average and quite a bit lower than the near 6 percent average Ohio\nexperienced during the last expansion. Since the start of the recovery, Ohio has had a net gain of a half\nmillion jobs, and payrolls have now surpassed their previous peak by more than 1 percent. People have\nbeen reentering the work force, and over the past year, payroll employment has risen nearly 1-1/2 percent\nin Ohio – a net addition of 78,000 jobs. Job growth here is somewhat slower than the national pace of\n1-3/4 percent, but we are doing considerably better than during the previous expansion, when\nemployment in Ohio was essentially flat.\n\nThis is all good news. But like the nation, the regional economy also faces longer-run challenges\nregarding investments in human and physical capital, as well as low levels of population growth and\nbusiness formation. These challenges will need to be addressed if we are to remain a region with a\nhealthy economy.\n\n5\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s Community Stabilization Index is a composite index that provides a relative measure of local\nhousing market conditions at the ZIP code level, with a particular focus on recovery potential. It is available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/community-development/community-stabilization-index.aspx.\n\n\f10\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy by first laying some groundwork. The theory and practice of central\nbanking provides several lessons for monetary policymakers. First, policymakers should be forwardlooking because monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags. This means policy\nactions need to be taken before our policy goals are fully met, based on the economic outlook over the\nmedium run and the risks around that outlook. Second, policymakers should strive to be consistent in\nhow they respond to economic conditions and to effectively communicate the rationale for their decisions.\nThis helps the public form expectations about the future path of policy and raises public confidence in the\npolicy itself. Third, policymakers should always remain humble about what they know about the\neconomy and how monetary policy can affect it. There is uncertainty around the outlook, around the\nmonetary policy transmission mechanism, and around underlying structural aspects of the economy, such\nas the longer-run levels of the unemployment rate, trend output growth, structural productivity growth,\nand equilibrium interest rates. Policymakers need to recognize that it is possible for the structure of the\neconomy to change, but they should not throw out all that’s been learned from past experience or be led\nastray by thinking this time is completely different.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, last week, the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at\n1/4 to 1/2 percent. In the Committee’s view, the case for an interest rate increase has strengthened but it\ndecided for the time being to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward the dual-mandate\nobjectives. According to the new projections, FOMC participants continue to anticipate that a gradual\nupward path of the policy rate will be appropriate over the next three years. But the consensus view was\nthat it was better not to take the next step on that path in September.\n\nI, and two of my FOMC colleagues, dissented from that decision, preferring to see a 25-basis-point\nincrease in September. All participants on the FOMC share the same objective – setting monetary policy\n\n\f11\nto promote our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability – even if we disagree from\ntime to time on the best way to achieve those goals.\n\nIn my view, economic developments have corroborated the Committee’s medium-run outlook that labor\nmarkets will continue to show strength, that growth will rebound to a pace at or slightly above trend, and\nthat inflation will gradually rise to our 2 percent target. We have seen sustained improvement in the labor\nmarket, which is now basically at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do,\nand inflation has moved up over the past year. The risks that have concerned the Committee, including\nthe volatility in financial markets at the start of the year, economic weakness abroad, and the aftermath of\nthe U.K. vote to leave the European Union, have subsided, and the economic expansion has proved to be\nresilient.\n\nI view another small step on the gradual upward path as appropriate, not because I want to curtail the\nexpansion, but because I believe gradually moving rates up as we continue to make progress on our goals\nwill help prolong the expansion. It is also consistent with the policy communications we have been\nissuing for quite a while. I note that the gradual path I’m anticipating means that policy will remain\naccommodative for some time, continuing to lend support to the economic expansion going forward. The\ngradual path will also allow us to recalibrate policy over time as we gain more insights into the underlying\nstructural aspects of the post-crisis economy.\n\nNow, one can always say it’s better to wait for more information before making a move, and a cautious\napproach has served us well so far during the expansion. But there are also risks to delaying for too long.\nIf we continue to delay even as we make further progress on our inflation goal and labor markets continue\nto tighten, we risk having to undertake a considerably steeper policy path later on. Such a strategy is\ninconsistent with what we have been communicating; it risks confusing the public about our policy\nrationale and undercutting the credibility of Fed communications. This would cause problems for future\n\n\f12\npolicymaking. In addition, if we delay too long and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor\nmarket becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up\nsteeply, we could risk a recession, a bad outcome that history tells us disproportionately harms the more\nvulnerable parts of our society. I think we also have to recognize that if we fail to exit gracefully from the\nnontraditional policy actions we took in the aftermath of the crisis – actions I thought were necessary and\neffective – we could jeopardize their use in the future, should the need arise again.\n\nFor these reasons, I favor taking the next step on the gradual path of rising interest rates. The lesson that\npolicy should be forward looking is based on the history of poor outcomes when that strategy hasn’t been\nfollowed. In the face of evidence that the economy is on track to meet our goals over the medium run,\nsometimes being prudent means moving the policy rate up.\n\nConclusion\nTwo years ago in one of my first media interviews after becoming president of the Cleveland Fed, I was\nasked where I saw myself on the avian spectrum – would I be a dove, who would tend to favor low\ninterest rates, or a hawk, who would tend to favor higher interest rates. My answer was that I’d prefer not\nbe thought of as either; instead, my hope was to be viewed as an owl. Of course, that’s not up to me to\ndecide – being thought of as an owl is my aspiration. But what I can do and will continue to do is explain\nto the public my view of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and the rationale for my policy\ndecisions. I view this as an essential part of Fed communications so that the public can hold us\naccountable for our policy decisions. I hope that you and our other regional contacts will continue to\ngenerously provide the Cleveland Fed with your perspectives on the regional economy. This regional\ninformation plays an important role in helping us to set national monetary policy in pursuit of the Federal\nReserve’s longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the public.\n\n\f"

I appreciate this opportunity not only to enjoy the beautiful\nbluegrass scenery but also to gather firsthand information about economic conditions in this part of the\ncountry.

The Federal Reserve System, established by Congress more than 100 years ago, was\ndesigned in a way to ensure that the Fed’s decisions about monetary policy take into account this very\ndiversity. We recognize that our policy decisions affect Main Streets and communities all across the\ncountry. As the president of a Federal Reserve Bank, I make it a point to bring the economic information\nwe have garnered from business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the District to meetings of the\nFederal Open Market Committee. That’s the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The\ninsightful regional perspectives that our contacts provide, along with economic and financial data and\nanalysis, all play an important part in the Fed’s setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our\nstatutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhile most people associate the Federal Reserve with monetary policy, the Fed has had an interest in\ncommunity development issues for quite a long time. In 1981, the Fed created its Community Affairs\nfunction to provide technical training and support to depository institutions to bolster their compliance\n\n\f2\nwith the Community Reinvestment Act, a law that promotes equitable access to credit for all individuals\nand neighborhoods.\n\nFrom this targeted beginning, the Federal Reserve’s work in the area of community development has\nevolved and expanded, much as the nature of community development in general has changed over time.\nAs people in this room know, access to credit is but one factor – albeit an important one – in determining\nthe economic vitality of households and neighborhoods. Today, the Fed’s community development\nfunction is active in research and outreach concerning housing markets, workforce development,\neducation, health, and small business lending, among other issues.\n\nWhile the focus may have changed over time, one thing that hasn’t changed is the Federal Reserve’s\ncommitment to helping to identify effective policies and best practices for promoting economic progress\nin low- and moderate-income communities. The Cleveland Fed very much values the relationships we\nhave built with key philanthropic, government, and other organizations working on programs aimed at\nimproving the economic outcomes of people in eastern Kentucky. Those relationships were instrumental\nin informing our analysis of some of the community development efforts I’ll discuss today. I want you to\nknow that the Cleveland Fed’s work is just part of the initiatives taking place at the 12 Federal Reserve\nBanks across the country. For example, the Minneapolis Fed has established a Center for Indian Country\nDevelopment to forge partnerships between the Fed and other organizations to study business, housing,\nand educational issues affecting Native American communities. The Dallas Fed’s Colonia project is\nexamining infrastructure, housing, and economic opportunity efforts in the neighborhoods along the U.S.Mexico border. And the St. Louis Fed’s Delta Communities Initiative is working with distressed\ncommunities across the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta regions.\n\nThere are many other examples, but today I will focus on approaches and programs that are helping to\nmake a difference in regions like eastern Kentucky, regions that are undergoing significant economic\n\n\f3\ntransitions. Before I continue, let me note that the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEastern Kentucky in Transition\nEastern Kentucky, comprising 31 counties, has been facing economic challenges for some time. In 1964,\nPresident Lyndon Johnson knelt on the front porch of a Martin County family’s cabin as part of his\nadministration’s “War on Poverty” tour. A photograph of that meeting became an icon in the country’s\neffort to eradicate poverty.1 As discussed in two recent Cleveland Fed articles, while some progress has\nbeen made, the challenges remain substantial.2 In the 1960s, about 60 percent of families in eastern\nKentucky lived below the poverty line. Today that percentage has fallen to around 25 percent, but that is\nstill about twice as high as the national average and 9 percentage points higher than the rest of Kentucky.\nIn fiscal year 2016, the Appalachian Regional Commission has designated 26 of the 31 counties in eastern\nKentucky as distressed.3\n\nThe sources of eastern Kentucky’s difficulties are familiar to all of you. Over the past decade or so,\neastern Kentucky has lost more than 13,000 jobs; about half of those were jobs in coal mining. The\ndecline in employment has affected the regional economy in a number of ways. Coal miners earn nearly\ndouble the average annual income in eastern Kentucky: about $73,000 per year compared to $36,000 per\nyear. So the loss of those jobs has meant a sizable drop in local spending power. In addition, tax\nrevenues derived from the coal industry have fallen sharply as the level of coal production has fallen. For\n1\n\nThe photograph was reproduced in the Cleveland Fed’s 2006 Annual Report essay (see Mark Schweitzer and Peter\nRupert, “Understanding the Persistence of Poverty”) and in a joint report profiling 16 high-poverty communities,\nincluding Martin County, Kentucky, issued by the Federal Reserve and the Brookings Institution (see “The Enduring\nChallenge of Concentrated Poverty in America,” A Joint Project of the Community Affairs Offices of the Federal\nReserve System and the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, October 2008).\n2\n\nMatt Klesta documents economic trends in eastern Kentucky in “Eastern Kentucky: A Region in Flux,” Forefront,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, March 2, 2016, and “Comings and Goings in Eastern Kentucky,” Forefront,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, August 1, 2016.\n3\n\nSee ARC-Designated Distressed Counties, Fiscal Year 2016.\n\n\f4\nexample, the coal severance tax in Kentucky has dropped 40 percent in just the past three years. The\nweakened economy has exacerbated some social issues in the region. Eastern Kentucky has experienced\nthe pain of the country’s opioid epidemic. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, over the period 2000 to 2014, the age-adjusted death rate from drug overdoses more than\ndoubled, with opioids being the main driver of these deaths.4 According to this sad metric, in 2014,\nKentucky’s death rate from this cause was the fourth highest among the 50 states.\n\nThe economic challenges in eastern Kentucky are also reflected in population trends. While the rest of\nKentucky has gained population since 1980, population in eastern Kentucky has been fairly flat and has\neven begun to decline over the past five years as the coal industry has contracted. Deaths are now\noutpacing births, and net migration in eastern Kentucky has shifted from an inflow of around 1,300\npeople a year on average from 1995 to 2011 to an outflow of about 1,100 people a year on average since\nthen.5\n\n4\n\nSee Rose A. Rudd, Noah Aleshire, Jon E. Zibbell, and R. Matthew Gladden, “Increases in Drug and Opioid\nOverdose Deaths – United States, 2000-2014,” Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 64, pp. 1378-1382 (January\n1, 2016).\n5\n\nThese are Internal Revenue Service Migration data. See the August 1, 2016 article by Klesta referenced earlier.\n\n\f5\nFactors Supporting Regional Transformation\nEastern Kentucky is not alone in facing economic challenges, many of which arise from the\ntransformation being driven by technological change and globalization. In the Fourth Federal Reserve\nDistrict, regions that have been dependent on one particular industry like heavy manufacturing or oil have\nfared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their industrial bases and adapt to the\nchanging economy. Research and analysis by Federal Reserve staff and others have identified a number\nof specific factors that support regional economic transitions. The three I will discuss today are:\nleadership and collaboration, a skilled workforce, and infrastructure.\n\nLeadership and Collaboration\nEffective leadership can make a big difference in how regional economies navigate transitions. The\nBoston Fed examined small and mid-sized cities that lost manufacturing employment and found that\n“resurgent cities,” meaning those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree\nof leadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private\ncitizens, corporations, and government.6 But the researchers also found that to have an effect on\neconomic outcomes, leadership and collaboration must be part of long-lasting campaigns. There are no\nshortcuts or easy fixes.\n\nFortunately, we are seeing some encouraging signs of leadership and collaboration in eastern Kentucky.\nThis summit is a great example of a broad cross-section of funders coming together to support economic\ntransitions. The Kentucky Philanthropy Initiative is aligned with the Appalachia Funders Network and\nthe Appalachian Regional Commission, both of which are active partners of the Cleveland Fed, as well as\nthe Richmond and Atlanta Feds, whose Districts encompass parts of central Appalachia. In fact, Federal\n6\n\n“Reinvigorating Springfield’s Economy: Lessons from Resurgent Cities,” Public Policy Discussion Paper No. 096, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 1, 2009.\n\n\f6\nReserve staff members participate in four workgroups operated by the Appalachia Funders Network\nrelated to health, food systems, strengthening community capacity, and energy and natural resources. Our\nstaff members are actively engaged with our regional partners to aid in data analysis when possible and to\nfoster leadership connections and information sharing.\n\nLeadership and collaboration also affect the success of employers in recruiting newly trained workers into\ntheir industries. Cleveland Fed analysts undertook case studies of five sector-based initiatives across the\nFourth District.7 These sectors were health care in western Pennsylvania, information technology (IT) in\nnortheastern Ohio, advanced manufacturing in central Ohio, marine mechanics in northwestern Ohio, and\ncoal mining in eastern Kentucky. Four of these five initiatives provide direct training to workers, while\nthe IT initiative is focused on increasing and enhancing the pipeline of IT talent through deep employer\nengagement with educational institutions at all levels. The analysts found that successful programs\ninvolve employers who are actively and substantively engaged: they provide advice on curricula, directly\ninteract with students, and tend to come from the highest ranks of their organizations so that they are free\nto speak on behalf of the employers. The case studies also showed that relationships and trust among\nemployers and partners are important drivers of success. Trust is necessary because, in many cases, the\nemployers are competitors; sustained relationships among the many partners are important because they\ngive the initiatives time to evolve and grow.\n\nMany of you are probably familiar with an initiative called Shaping Our Appalachian Region, or SOAR.\nThis effort bears many of the leadership and collaboration qualities that are critical to supporting\neconomic transitions.8 Since its inception in 2013, SOAR has embarked on building a set of working\ncommittees that allow individuals and institutions to join together to steer the course of economic\n7\n\n“Addressing Employment Needs through Sector Partnerships: Case Studies from across the Federal Reserve’s\nFourth District,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, August 15, 2016.\n8\n\nSee http://www.soar-ky.org/ for more information.\n\n\f7\nrevitalization in the region. The leadership and collaboration displayed by SOAR are straight out of the\nresurgent cities’ playbook: the leaders involved in SOAR recognize that it is in their own best interest to\nsupport economic rebirth and that collaboration is essential because the process of economic transition is\nnecessarily complex. By providing an easy-to-access venue for eastern Kentucky’s organizations,\nbusinesses, civic leaders, and private citizens to come together and plan for a stronger economic future,\nSOAR also provides the essential foundation to effect change. One concrete example of success is the\nnew associate’s degree program in broadband technology at Big Sandy Community and Technical\nCollege. This is the first such program in Kentucky and only the third in the country. According to the\ncollege’s president, the program came about in large part because of the coordinated work of SOAR,\nKentucky public officials, and One East Kentucky, a nine-county regional organization comprising\nprivate businesses and local chambers of commerce.9\n\nA Skilled Workforce\nOne of the areas SOAR is targeting is workforce development, and wisely so. Just as investments in\nphysical capital, such as plants, equipment, and software, can make businesses more productive, so can\ninvestments in human capital – educational and training programs – that allow people to become and\nremain productive members of the modern labor force.\n\nWhen it comes to the economic well-being of entire regions, many studies have documented the\nimportance of investments in human capital. For example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a\n75-year period, education levels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each state’s per\n\n9\n\nSee “Board of Regents Approves Broadband Technology Degree Program at BSCTC,” Big Sandy News and\nEvents, March 11, 2016. The Kentucky Community and Technical College Board of Regents approved this new\nprogram in March 2016. The program will be divided into three tracks: broadband technician, broadband\ntelecommunications equipment installer, and broadband design and applications.\n\n\f8\ncapita income growth10 and that counties with higher levels of high school graduates tend to have lower\npoverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.11 A study by a Philadelphia Fed researcher\nfound that resilient regions, that is, regions that have been able to avoid persistent declines in population\nover the long run, tend to have a more educated population and a more diverse industry mix.12\n\nThe benefits of investing in human capital are also evident at the individual level. For individuals, better\neducation is correlated with lower levels of unemployment and higher wages. For example, at the\nnational level, the current unemployment rate for those with a college degree is 2.5 percent, compared to\n5.0 percent for those with a high school diploma, and 6.3 percent for those who didn’t graduate from high\nschool. The difference in wages between those with a college degree and those without, the so-called\nskill premium, has widened substantially over time, more than doubling since the 1970s. And over a\nlifetime, in present value terms, a college graduate can expect to earn nearly twice as much as a high\nschool graduate.13\n\nMost studies have tended to focus on the benefits of a college education because that’s where the data are\nmore readily available. But other approaches to workforce development are also needed. Technological\nchange and globalization have been changing the nature of the jobs available in the U.S. Those workers\nwho have been displaced from their current occupations, for example, coal miners and assembly line\nworkers, often need to retrain for the modern economy. Apprenticeships, certificate programs, and onthe-job training can all potentially play an important role in getting people back into productive jobs.\n10\n\n“Altered States: A Perspective on 75 Years of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005\nAnnual Report.\n11\n\nMark Schweitzer and Peter Rupert, “Understanding the Persistence of Poverty,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland 2006 Annual Report.\n12\n\nJeffrey Lin, “Regional Resilience,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper No. 13-1, December 17,\n2012.\n13\n\nKartik Athreya and Janice Eberly, “The College Premium, College Noncompletion, and Human Capital\nInvestment,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Working Paper 13-02R, February 2015.\n\n\f9\n\nThe Registered Apprenticeship program is administered by the Employment and Training\nAdministration’s Office of Apprenticeship within the U.S. Department of Labor, in conjunction with\nState Apprenticeship Agencies. The apprenticeship programs offer structured on-the-job training\ncombined with related technical instruction tailored to industry needs in a variety of occupations,\nincluding electricians, plumbers, truck drivers, and child care workers. One study of the program\ncovering 10 states, including Kentucky, found that the program has been highly effective in generating\nhigher incomes for participants in a cost-effective way.14 In the ninth year after enrollment, the average\nperson who had participated in the program was earning almost $6,000 more in annual salary than similar\nnonparticipants, and the difference in lifetime earnings amounted to about $98,000. These differences\nwere even greater for those who completed the apprenticeship programs. For Kentucky, data limitations\nprecluded looking at earnings in the ninth year after enrollment, but in the sixth year after enrollment, the\naverage participant in Kentucky was earning over $5,700 more per year than the average nonparticipant.\nThe study also concluded that the estimated social benefits of the program exceeded the social costs.15 In\nsum, the study’s evidence suggested that effective apprenticeships not only lead to higher earnings, but\nalso help people stay employed longer.\n\nWhile it is important to help people already in the labor force transition to other occupations in high\ndemand, it is also important to start training people still in school so that they can develop the skills for\nthe jobs of the future and to make sure that those providing that education and training understand what\n14\n\nMathematica Policy Research, “An Effectiveness Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis of Registered\nApprenticeship (RA) in 10 States,” Final Report July 25, 2012. The 10 states included in the study were Florida,\nGeorgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.\n15\n\nThe potential benefits considered included the increased productivity of a worker trained through the program and\ntheir reduced use of government support programs, including unemployment insurance, welfare, and food stamps.\nThe costs included the costs of administering the program at the federal and state levels, as well as the costs of\ncommunity colleges providing supportive technical training. Under a baseline scenario, the study estimated that\nover the career of an apprentice, the estimated social benefits would exceed the costs by about $124,000. Under\nmore conservative assumptions, the study estimated these net social benefits at about $49,000. See Mathematica\nPolicy Research, 2012.\n\n\f10\nthe jobs in demand will be. The Allegheny Conference on Community Development commissioned an\nin-depth analysis of the supply and demand for labor in the Pittsburgh region over the next decade.16 The\nresulting report made a number of recommendations to help prepare employers, current and future\nworkers, educators, and civic leaders for the coming changes. One initiative would create a digital career\nawareness hub for students and teachers in kindergarten through high school to better match curriculum to\nthe skill sets in demand in the future. Another would create a digital jobs database to make it easier to\nmatch those with particular skills to employers currently needing those skills. A further recommendation\nis to focus resources on high-growth “opportunity occupations,” positions that pay higher than the median\nwage but don’t require a bachelor’s degree. This diverse group of occupations includes certain jobs in\nhealth care, transportation, and bookkeeping. Research by the Federal Reserve suggests that even in\nopportunity occupations, employers are demanding higher levels of skills than they did in the past, so\naligning skill development with these types of jobs will need to be a priority.17 And it’s important to note\nthat not all the necessary skills are technical ones.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s case studies of sector-based training programs that I mentioned earlier found that\neven if a jobseeker meets the technical skill requirements for a position, lacking the necessary “soft skills”\ncan be a significant barrier to employment. By their very nature, soft skills, such as the ability to work in\nteams and effective communication, are difficult to measure, but studies are now examining the role of\ncharacteristics like persistence and other personality traits as they relate to labor market outcomes.18 The\nACT WorkKeys test attempts to measure foundational and “soft skills,” and Kentucky is using it as a\nmetric to help evaluate whether a community has the infrastructure and workforce sought by employers.\n16\n\n“Inflection Point: Supply, Demand and the Future of Work in the Pittsburgh Region,” report prepared by Burning\nGlass Technologies and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning with Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment, May 2016.\n17\n\n“Identifying Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies,” Federal Reserve Banks\nof Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta, September 2015.\n18\n\nPaul Tough discusses some of the research in How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of\nCharacter, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: New York, 2012.\n\n\f11\n\nAmong Kentucky’s most successful retraining efforts is the Hiring Our Miners Everyday, or H.O.M.E.,\nprogram. Housed within the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program , H.O.M.E. is funded\nby an emergency grant from the U.S. Department of Labor and, as its name implies, helps miners and\ntheir families affected by the decline in the coal industry. H.O.M.E. appreciates that displaced miners are\nfar from unskilled; rather they need the opportunity to hone their skills for different industries. For\nexample, the H.O.M.E. program puts out-of-work miners through a course to prepare them for work as\nelectrical utility linemen, a job that not only pays well, but also provides much-needed fiber optic lines to\nrural areas. As a result of this program, eastern Kentucky may be able to keep a share of its skilled\nworkforce in the region, thereby helping the local economy to grow. H.O.M.E. is also an example of\ncommunity leadership and collaboration in action, as it brings together a wide range of entities and\ninterlocking relationships, from the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce to Hazard Community and\nTechnical College. An important next step will be for the partners to undertake a focused evaluation of\nthe program so that we can all learn which specific strategies work and why they work, and which\nstrategies are less effective and therefore less deserving of continued investment.\n\nInfrastructure\nThe final factor I’ll discuss today that’s been found to help in revitalizing distressed communities is\ninvestment in infrastructure. In fact, infrastructure is a critical component of economies of all sizes. The\nAppalachian Development Highway System, started in 1965, is a key piece of eastern Kentucky’s\ninfrastructure. This system includes 3,000-plus miles of highways across 13 states and was designed for\nthe express purpose of linking otherwise isolated and distressed areas of Appalachia to the Interstate\n\n\f12\nHighway System. Several studies have documented that economic activity is higher in places connected\nby the highway.19\n\nOf course, in 2016, the regional infrastructure needs of vibrant businesses and households have expanded\nto include not only the physical highway but also the digital highway. Broadband internet access has\nbecome a necessity in our connected world. A recent report issued by Cornell University found that\nnonmetropolitan counties that have had a high rate of broadband adoption have also experienced higher\ngrowth in median household income and lower rates of job loss than similarly situated counties that have\nhad low broadband adoption.20 A 2013 federal government report on broadband access and adoption\nfound that adoption rates vary by household income levels: fewer than half of households with incomes\nbelow $25,000 a year use broadband at home, compared with over 90 percent of households with annual\nincomes exceeding $100,000.21 There is also wide disparity in broadband access, especially access to\nhigh-speed broadband, between rural and urban areas, putting the growth prospects of rural areas at a\ndisadvantage. Eastern Kentucky stands to benefit from KentuckyWired, a statewide effort to bring\nbroadband access to underserved areas in the state.\n\nI note that the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) provides a significant opportunity to boost programs\nlike this aimed at closing the digital divide. Recent revisions to the CRA rules recognize that a reliable\ncommunications infrastructure, such as broadband internet service, can help to revitalize or stabilize\nunderserved nonmetropolitan, middle-income areas. So depository institutions will now receive credit for\n\n19\n\nSome of these studies are summarized in “Appalachian Development Highway System Economic Analysis Study:\nSynthesis of Findings to Date,” a study prepared for the Appalachian Regional Commission by the Economic\nDevelopment Research Group, Inc., May 2016.\n20\n\nBrian Whitacre, Roberto Gallardo, and Sharon Strover, “Broadband’s Contribution to Economic Health in Rural\nAreas,” Issue Number 64, Research and Policy Brief Series, Community and Regional Development Institute,\nDepartment of Development Sociology, Cornell University, February 2015.\n21\n\nSee “Four Years of Broadband Growth,” Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Economic\nCouncil, The White House, Washington, D.C., June 2013.\n\n\f13\ninvesting in this infrastructure for the purposes of meeting the CRA requirement of serving the needs of\nlow- and moderate-income communities.22\n\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by noting that the economy has made significant strides in coming back from the Great\nRecession. The unemployment rates in both the nation and in eastern Kentucky are down about 5\npercentage points since their respective peaks during the recession. Accommodative monetary policy has\nprovided important support to the economy on this cyclical journey, helping to promote improving labor\nmarkets. But we need to recognize that the labor market outcomes for people in eastern Kentucky are\nbelow the national average and there continue to be longer-run challenges in regions like eastern\nKentucky that are undergoing economic transformation. Technological advances and globalization are\nchanging the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. To raise our shared\nstandard of living and to make us more competitive in the global economy, the U.S. needs to ensure that\npeople can enter and remain productive members of the transforming economy.\n\nYou may have heard that, last week, I and several other Federal Reserve System leaders met with\nrepresentatives from the Center for Popular Democracy’s Fed Up Campaign in a public forum held before\nthe Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It was a productive exchange of views about\nhow to solve some of the labor market challenges still afflicting certain communities and demographic\ngroups. Like the Fed Up Campaign, I believe these are important challenges that the country needs to\naddress, but unlike the Fed Up Campaign, I do not believe that at this point in the business cycle, the\ncurrent very low level of interest rates is an effective solution to these longer-run issues. But the good\nnews is that the programs I discussed today and many of the other efforts underway can make a real\n\n22\n\nSee page 485111, “Community Reinvestment Act; Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community\nReinvestment; Guidance,” Federal Register, vol. 81, no. 142, Monday, July 25, 2016, Rules and Regulations.\n\n\f14\ndifference to the people and communities in transition. To be sure, these programs are but a small part of\nthe overall strategy needed to support economic transitions. Laying the foundation for sustained\neconomic growth is neither a quick nor an easy task. It involves many different players working together\nwith perseverance. I commend this audience for undertaking this effort. As members of the Kentucky\nPhilanthropy Initiative and related charities, you provide leadership and foster collaboration, key\ningredients to the revitalization and resiliency of our regions.\n\nLike the KPI, the Federal Reserve takes seriously its role as a convener. Bringing together people to\nshare their different perspectives and experiences can ultimately lead to more effective economic policies.\nI have spoken many times about how the diversity of views expressed around the FOMC table helps the\nFed make better monetary policy. I believe the same is true for public policies aimed at addressing the\nchallenges faced in community development. KPI performs an invaluable service by pulling together\npeople and groups to support grant making and to promote public-private partnerships targeting the\nregion’s persistent challenges. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland looks forward to our continued\ncollaboration with you in those efforts.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAustralian Business Economists\nSydney, Australia\nJuly 13, 2016\n\nThese remarks are an update of remarks that I made at the European Economics and Financial Centre’s\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar in London, U.K. on July 1, 2016.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Australian Business Economists for the kind invitation to be with you today, and I would like\nto say g’day to you all. I started coming to Australia about 30 years ago with my husband, who grew up\nin Canberra. I have to admit, I have not yet acquired a taste for Vegemite – my tastes run more toward\nlamingtons and Anzac biscuits – but Australians are so welcoming that it is always a pleasure to be Down\nUnder.\n\nAs an economist and policymaker, I appreciate hearing the perspectives of market and business\neconomists. Just as the different views expressed by my colleagues around the monetary policy table help\nto inform my own policy views, the insights of economists like you help to shape my own economic\noutlook. The chance to hear perspectives from this side of the Pacific is particularly welcome at this time\nbecause we live in a global economy. Today, I will focus my remarks on the U.S. economy and monetary\npolicy. To help put the discussion into context, I will start with a brief overview of the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I should note that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFederal Reserve Structure and Governance\nThe Federal Reserve System, established by Congress in 1913, is a decentralized central bank. It is\nindependent within the government but not independent from the government. The structure is one of\nbalance. Congress designed the Federal Reserve System to alleviate concerns that it would become\ndominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. The design includes\nrepresentation from the rest of the nation, balancing public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall\nStreet and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in\nWashington that oversees those Banks. The governors, who serve the public, are appointed by the\n\n\f2\npresident of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, the upper house of Congress. Governors\nserve staggered 14-year terms, which span several terms of the president and members of Congress. The\nlength of the term is intended to insulate the governors from short-term political influence and allows\nthem to take a longer-run perspective when setting monetary and financial regulatory policy. The\nchairman and vice chairman of the Board of Governors are chosen by the president and confirmed by the\nSenate from among the sitting governors for four-year terms. They can be reappointed until their terms as\ngovernors expire.\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks also operate in the public interest. They are distributed around the country in\nlocations that were the centers of economic activity back when the Fed was established.1 Each Reserve\nBank has a nine-member board of directors who are chosen in a nonpolitical process. Three directors\nrepresent banks and six are nonbankers who represent business, agricultural, industrial, and public\ninterests in the Districts they serve. The nonbank directors are responsible for choosing the Bank’s\npresident, who is subject to approval by the Fed’s Board of Governors. This structure may seem pretty\ncomplicated, but it actually works quite well. Before the Fed was established, there were two earlier\nattempts at central banks in the U.S. Each lasted only 20 years. In contrast, the Federal Reserve recently\nmarked its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, was established in 1934 and is the body within the\nFederal Reserve System responsible for setting monetary policy. The FOMC holds eight regularly\nscheduled meetings a year in Washington. This 12-member Committee is made up of the seven members\nof the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents\nwho serve on a rotating basis. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I vote every other year, as does the\n1\n\nSome Reserve Banks also have Branches. For example, the Cleveland Fed has a Branch in Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, and a Branch in Cincinnati, Ohio. Each Branch of a Reserve Bank has a board of directors of\nbetween three and seven members.\n\n\f3\nChicago Fed president. The other presidents vote every third year. I note, though, that presidents who\nhappen not to be voting members at the moment still participate in FOMC meetings. Thus, by design, the\ndiscussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the\ncountry. This information helps inform our setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of the goals\ngiven to us by the U.S. Congress. These monetary policy goals, often called the Fed’s dual mandate, are\nprice stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nOur last FOMC meeting was held in mid-June and our next meeting will be two weeks from now. As is\nalways the case, during this intermeeting period, Fed policymakers are evaluating economic\ndevelopments and assessing the outlook. Of course, the anticipated consequences of the recent decision\nby U.K. voters to exit the European Union will need to be part of that assessment. This is a developing\nstory, and how it plays out will ultimately determine its implications for the global economy and\nmonetary policy. For the U.S. economy, while the risks and uncertainty surrounding the outlook have\nincreased in the wake of the U.K. vote, FOMC members will be taking the time up to our July meeting to\ncontinue to evaluate whether conditions in the aftermath of the decision and other economic and financial\ndevelopments will necessitate a material change in the modal outlook.\n\nIn thinking about the economic outlook, I try to stay focused on underlying fundamentals because they\ndetermine the outlook for the economy over the medium run, the time horizon over which monetary\npolicy can affect the economy. In my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the U.S. economic\nexpansion remain sound. These include accommodative monetary policy, household balance sheets that\nhave improved greatly since the recession, continued progress in the labor market, a more resilient\nbanking system, and low oil prices. There are risks around all forecasts, but my modal forecast has been\nthat over the next two years the U.S. economy will continue to expand at a pace slightly above its longerrun trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will remain slightly under\n\n\f4\nits longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually\nreturn to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Of course, even in the best of times, without the\nincreased uncertainty of our current situation, there is some variation in growth and other economic\nindicators over time. The trick is to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from economic\nand financial market information that can often be quite noisy.\n\nEconomic growth\nWe’ve seen this kind of variability in the quarterly measures of U.S. GDP growth. Growth in the first\nquarter of the year slowed, although less so than originally estimated. Incoming information suggests that\nwe are seeing a rebound of growth in the second quarter. This is very similar to the pattern we saw in\n2014 and 2015. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output in the U.S., has\naccelerated in recent months. The continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in\npersonal income, low borrowing rates, and relatively low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending.\nIn the U.S., the drop in gasoline prices by almost $1 per gallon between 2014 and 2015 saved the average\nhousehold about $700. Although gasoline prices have moved up in the past couple of months, the U.S.\nEnergy Information Administration now forecasts that the average price of gasoline will be down again\nthis year, resulting in another $200 in cost savings for the average household. Some of those savings\nhave been spent. For example, we’ve seen high levels of auto sales for the past two years. Some\nhouseholds likely saved part of the windfall instead of spending it, or used it to pay down debt. Either\nway, stronger household balance sheets will help support future consumption spending.\n\nThe U.S. housing sector has been gradually recovering for some time. In the aftermath of the housing\ncrash, house prices in the U.S. began rising again in mid-2011, and for the past two years, they have been\nincreasing at a 5 to 6 percent annual rate. At the aggregate level, homeowners lost an unprecedented $7\ntrillion in real estate equity during the housing crash, but the increases in house prices have allowed\nhomeowners to recover nearly all of that. Sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of home sales\n\n\f5\nin the U.S., are now back near the levels seen before the housing bubble run-up in the early to mid-2000s.\nI am using the pre-bubble level as my benchmark because we shouldn’t want to see the housing market\nreturn to bubble proportions. Other parts of the housing sector haven’t yet fully recovered. Construction\nand sales of new homes have been rising at a gradual pace, but they are not back up to their pre-bubble\nlevels. Starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer\nrun, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn’t kept up with demand. In addition, the type of\nhousing being built has shifted. Over the past five years, increases in multifamily housing starts have\nsignificantly outpaced increases in single-family starts. This may reflect a shift in preferences toward\nmore urban living, but it likely also reflects the desire on the part of some people who lived through the\ncrisis to rent rather than own. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on\nmore mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. My\nassessment of conditions is that the recovery in housing should continue at a moderate pace.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak. While the sharp drop in oil prices since\nmid-2014 benefited consumers and many businesses, firms in the drilling and mining sector, their\nsuppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector have been hurt. We have seen the\neffects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production has been down and firms tied to\nenergy have had to cut jobs and reduce investment. But even outside of the energy sector, business\ninvestment has been soft despite generally accommodative financial conditions. Manufacturers have been\ninvesting but mainly to maintain current operations rather than to expand. Part of the softness in\ninvestment reflects weakness in demand outside of the U.S., which has hurt U.S. exports.\n\nIndeed, firms exposed to U.S. trade have had to operate in a very challenging environment. The nominal\nvalue of the U.S. dollar has appreciated about 19 percent on a broad trade-weighted basis since mid-2014.\nThis has placed a significant drag on manufacturing output and export growth. But the slowdown in the\nrate of appreciation in recent months was starting to diminish the drag on growth from net exports.\n\n\f6\n\nOf course, global growth, commodity price changes, and currency fluctuations are not necessarily\nindependent events. For example, a portion of the more than 50 percent decline in oil prices since mid2014 likely reflects expectations of weaker growth in China and other countries, although supply factors\nhave likely played a greater role. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar since mid-2014 has reflected\nexpectations that real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as\nprojected real interest rate differentials between the U.S. and other economies. We have to be careful not\nto think of these shocks as independent events and merely sum their effects. We live in an interconnected\nglobal economy. Changes in prices and currency values are one way economies reach a new equilibrium\nafter a shock.\n\nWhile I would expect investment to begin to pick up as overall economic growth expands, the weakness\nin investment and the associated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of\nthe U.S. economy. Structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output\nand increases in living standards. And investment in capital, including human capital, is a key\ndeterminant of productivity growth. In the U.S., labor productivity growth has risen at only a half of a\npercent annual rate over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical: weak investment during the\nrecession and early part of the expansion contributed to slow productivity growth over this five-year\nperiod. But the weakness in investment and the slow productivity growth have persisted in the U.S. and\nin several other countries. Productivity growth is very difficult to forecast, so the softness may reverse\nitself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it’s the latter, then the longer-run growth\nrate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth I’ve been assuming.\n\nAs this overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But overall,\neconomic growth has proven to be resilient and at a pace slightly above trend. The pace has been\nsufficient to generate significant progress in labor markets.\n\n\f7\n\nLabor markets\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about\n10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its\npeak of 10 percent in late 2009. Over the past two years, there have also been significant improvements\nin other gauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time\nworkers who would rather work full-time and the number of people who have only been looking for work\nsporadically or have been discouraged from looking at all because they don’t think they will find a job.\nIncreasingly, we are hearing from businesses that they are having trouble finding qualified workers.\nEarly on, such reports were concentrated in high-skilled occupations but now they are expanding to\ninclude lower-skilled jobs in a broader set of industries.\n\nThere has been some month-to-month variation in recent employment reports for the U.S. Payroll growth\nslowed considerably in May, raising the question of whether we were at the start of a reversal from the\nconsiderable progress that’s been made in labor markets, or whether the weak reading was the type of\ntransitory change we typically see during expansions. Hiring rebounded in June, alleviating that concern.\n\nBased on my read of the available data, I believe the U.S. labor market remains sound and that we’ll\ncontinue to see further improvements in the job market, although the pace of improvement will\nnecessarily slow given the progress that’s already been made. It’s important to put monthly jobs reports\ninto context. One thing we have learned is that we shouldn’t take too much signal from one or two\nmonthly reports. Payroll growth has slowed several times during this expansion, only to pick up again.\nIn addition, we should expect to see some slowdown in the pace of job growth as the economy nears full\nemployment. Over the past three months U.S. firms added an average of 147,000 jobs per month. That\npace exceeds the 75,000 to 120,000 per month range of trend employment growth estimates from various\n\n\f8\nmodels that take into account the aging of the population and other demographic factors affecting labor\nforce participation. So it is enough to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nOther incoming data remain consistent with an improving labor market. Claims for unemployment\ninsurance are low. The rates of job openings and hiring are high. The quit rate is also high, suggesting\nthat workers are confident enough to be looking for better jobs. The unemployment rate is low, and while\nthe labor force participation rate has varied from month to month, averaging through the recent variability\nwe see that the level of the participation rate is consistent with estimates of its longer-run downward\ntrend. Another positive is that there are signs in the data and from anecdotal reports that wages may be\naccelerating.\n\nAll of this suggests to me that labor market progress will continue. At the same time, I do not want to\nunderestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession and slow\nrecovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced\nby different demographic groups in the U.S. The deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and\nexacerbated longer-run workforce development issues affecting U.S. labor markets. Technological\nadvances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform\nthose jobs. I believe that government programs and private-public partnerships, including educational\nassistance, retraining programs, and apprenticeships, can be effective in addressing these long-run labor\nforce challenges and should be brought to bear. On the other hand, I do not believe that monetary policy\nwould be effective in addressing these longer-run problems. So from the standpoint of what monetary\npolicy can do, I believe the economy is basically at maximum employment, one part of the Fed’s dual\nmandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s\n\n\f9\ngoal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the\nprice of oil and other commodities, which began in mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar,\nwhich has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S.2\n\nThe most recent inflation data have been encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the\nFOMC. Inflation measures have gradually risen as the effects of previous declines in oil prices and dollar\nappreciation have begun to fade. Headline PCE and CPI inflation, as measured by the year-over-year\nchanges in the underlying indices, have moved up from the very low levels recorded last year and have\nbeen stable around 1 percent in recent months. The core inflation measures, which omit food and energy\nprices because they tend to be volatile, have also been moving up and are above the headline numbers.\nAnother gauge of underlying inflation, the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate, rose to over 2.5\npercent in May, its highest level in over seven years.3\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. Even in the face of\nsizable declines in energy prices, inflation expectations have been relatively stable in my view. At this\npoint I expect them to remain reasonably well anchored, but I am monitoring readings carefully. There\nare various measures of inflation expectations. Survey-based measures have tended to be more stable\nthan those based on market data. Inflation compensation, as distinct from expectations, is the difference\nin yields between nominal U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities. Inflation\ncompensation has fallen by more than the survey measures of expectations, but various models suggest\nthat the movement more likely reflects changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than\n2\n\nAccording to dynamic simulations of the Federal Reserve Board staff’s SIGMA model, a 10 percent rise in the real\nvalue of the dollar affects core inflation via import prices fairly quickly, resulting in a drop of about 0.5 percent in\ncore inflation a year after the shock, which partially reverses over the subsequent year. A shock to the value of the\ndollar also tends to reduce GDP with a lag, and the model indicates that this would put additional downward\npressure on inflation. See Chart 5 in Stanley Fischer, “U.S. Inflation Developments,” remarks at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, WY, August 29, 2015.\n3\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-anddata/median-cpi.aspx.\n\n\f10\nchanges in inflation expectations. Over a period of heightened market volatility and safe-haven flows into\nU.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based\nmeasure of inflation compensation than from the survey measures. The Cleveland Fed’s model of\ninflation expectations provides somewhat of a compromise by incorporating survey measures, as well as\nmarket data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps. Its measure of 5-year inflation, 5 years from\nnow has been stable, at about 1.9 percent, in recent months.4\n\nGiven these readings on inflation and inflation expectations, so long as the real side of the economy\ncontinues to perform as expected, I anticipate that inflation will continue to gradually move back to our\ngoal of 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn setting monetary policy, the FOMC assesses both realized and expected progress on our statutory\nlonger-run goals of price stability and maximum employment. That assessment encompasses a wide\nrange of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators,\nas well as the information FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions.\n\nAt its June meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½\npercent. The FOMC indicated that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, it\nanticipates further improvements in the economy. This was reflected in the Summary of Economic\nProjections also released at the June meeting. The median projection among the FOMC participants\nshows growth at about 2 percent over the next three years, consistent with the median estimate of longerrun trend growth; the unemployment rate coming down a bit from current levels and remaining under the\n\n4\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations measure is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicatorsand-data/inflation-expectations.aspx.\n\n\f11\nmedian longer-run estimate of 4.8 percent through 2018; and inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent\nby the end of 2018.\n\nIn June, the FOMC also indicated that economic developments will likely warrant only gradual increases\nin the fed funds rate. Of course, the timing of those rate increases and the overall slope of that gradual\npath will depend on how the economy, the economic outlook, and the risks evolve.\n\nIndeed, in the June projections, the median fed funds rate path of appropriate policy was somewhat\nshallower than in the last set of projections in March – partly reflecting somewhat slower growth\nprojected for this year, and partly reflecting a lower estimate of the fed funds rate over the longer run.\n\nI supported the decision not to change rates in June. My support did not reflect a fundamental change to\nmy outlook. The progress being made on our policy goals and the outlook suggest that a gradual upward\npath of interest rates continued to be appropriate. A gradual path means that monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against\ndownside risks. As I said, I believe that the progress in labor markets has been good and will continue,\nand I view the inflation data as supportive of a gradual return to target. Now, some might argue that in an\nabundance of caution, we should wait for clarity on these issues, and I agree that there are risks to acting\ntoo soon. But there are also risks to forestalling rate increases for too long when we are continuing to\nmake cumulative progress on our policy goals. Waiting too long increases risks to financial stability and\nraises the chance that we would have to move more aggressively in the future, which poses its own set of\nrisks to the outlook. I believe waiting too long also jeopardizes our future ability to use the nontraditional\nmonetary policy tools that the Fed developed to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and\ndeep recession. If we fail to gracefully navigate back toward a more normal policy stance at the\nappropriate time, then I believe there is a non-negligible chance that these tools will essentially be off the\ntable because the public will have deemed them as ultimately ineffective. This is a risk to the outlook\n\n\f12\nshould we ever find ourselves in a situation of needing such tools in the future. Of course, such a risk is\nhard to measure and is not one we typically consider. But we live in atypical times, and we need to take\nthe whole set of risks into account when assessing appropriate policy.\n\nSo why, then, did I think it appropriate not to raise rates in June? The reason was timing. There was\nconsiderable uncertainty about the outcome of the upcoming U.K. referendum on membership in the\nEuropean Union. The vote was being held a week after the June FOMC meeting. It was clear there was\ngoing to be volatility in financial markets surrounding the vote. If the vote favored exit, there was the\npotential of disruption in markets. Given that I do not think U.S. monetary policy is behind the curve yet,\nI saw little cost in waiting to take the next step.\n\nAfter the U.K. Referendum\nIt is an understatement to say that market volatility increased on the outcome of the U.K. referendum. We\nare now in a world of heightened economic and political uncertainty, and I expect we will be living with\nuncertainty for a while as the U.K. and Europe establish the terms of their new relationship.\n\nWhen a shock like this hits financial markets, the first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is\nsufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets to continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of\nextreme volatility, and to assure the public that we are prepared to act as necessary. The Bank of\nEngland, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 countries, and several other\nindividual central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal\nReserve, put out statements indicating that they stand ready to use established liquidity tools to support\nmarket functioning.5 Central banks are monitoring the situation for possible contagion across financial\n\n5\n\nSee the following statements released on June 24, 2016: Statement from the Bank of England; Statement from the\nGovernor of the Bank of England Following the E.U. Referendum Result; Statement of G-7 Finance Ministers and\nCentral Bank Governors; ECB is Closely Monitoring Financial Markets; Statement by Minister Aso and Governor\n\n\f13\nmarkets. The considerable efforts undertaken by policymakers in response to the global financial crisis to\nincrease the resiliency of the financial system, including higher capital and liquidity requirements, mean\nthat financial institutions are now in considerably better shape to withstand short-run volatility while\ncontinuing to extend credit to households and businesses. Despite the volatility, markets have generally\nbeen functioning in an orderly manner. Investors have been moving funds to safe-haven assets, which has\nled to lower yields on U.S. Treasuries and appreciation of the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen against the\nU.K. pound. Reflecting concerns about where U.K. property values may settle, some commercial real\nestate funds in the U.K. have suspended redemptions. Central banks are continuing to monitor financial\nmarket developments closely.\n\nUltimately, global economies will adjust to the new trading and labor relationships negotiated between\nthe U.K. and Europe. Economists continue to evaluate what the magnitude of the effects on the global\neconomy will be. This will depend on how the situation evolves, so the evaluation will take some time to\nfully develop. In the U.S., in determining whether a material change in our medium-run economic\noutlook is needed, monetary policymakers are assessing the consequences of the U.K. referendum in the\ncontext of other economic and financial developments. While the U.K. represents about 4 percent of\nworld output and global trade, London is one of the major financial centers of the world. About 4 percent\nof U.S. exports go to the U.K., which is a relatively small share, but the financial ties between our two\ncountries are larger. Barring any major disruption in financial and banking markets, one of the main\nmechanisms through which the exit decision could affect the U.S. economy is through dollar appreciation,\nwhich, depending on its persistence and magnitude, could dampen U.S. export growth and cause a delay\nin the return of inflation to 2 percent. Slower growth outside of the U.S. would also lower demand for\n\nKuroda on the U.K.’s Decision to Leave the E.U.; and The Federal Reserve is Carefully Monitoring Developments\nin Global Financial Markets.\n\n\f14\nU.S. exports. But it is important to remember that exports make up only about 12 percent of U.S. output;\nso whatever the reduction in export growth, it would mean a smaller reduction in overall GDP growth.\n\nHeightened and persistent uncertainty is another factor that can affect the economy. When the exit\ndecision was announced, investors moved away from risk assets. Higher credit spreads and lower equity\nprices, coupled with continued uncertainty, could put firms and households in a wait-and-see mode,\nreducing economic activity for a time. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has highlighted the\ndampening effect uncertainty could have on economic performance in the U.K. and steps have been taken\nthere to ease credit conditions. These include reducing the countercyclical capital requirements for banks\nand encouraging banks to continue lending to households and businesses.6\n\nAs I said, it is too soon to judge the full magnitude of such effects. However, despite the uncertainty,\nbetween now and our meeting later this month, FOMC policymakers will continue to evaluate the full set\nof economic and financial developments to judge whether the medium-run U.S. economic outlook has\nbeen meaningfully affected and whether that changes our assessment of appropriate U.S. monetary policy\ngoing forward. Monetary policymakers cannot let the lack of economic clarity distract us from our\nimportant mission. We must continue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess\nthe situation. As an FOMC member, I will remain focused on and committed to setting monetary policy\nto promote the Federal Reserve’s longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the\nbenefit of the public.\n\n6\n\nSee, Mark Carney, “Uncertainty, the Economy and Policy,” Bank of England, June 30, 2016; Mark Carney,\n“Financial Stability Report Press Conference, Opening Remarks by the Governor,” July 5, 2016; and “Joint\nStatement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, and Main British Banks and Building Society on\nMaintaining Support for Households and Businesses,” July 5, 2016.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Sydney Banking and Financial Stability Conference\nUniversity of Sydney\nSydney, Australia\nJuly 12, 2016\n\nThese remarks are based on remarks that I made at the Sveriges Riksbank Conference on Rethinking the\nCentral Bank’s Mandate in Stockholm, Sweden, on June 4, 2016.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the University of Sydney for inviting me to participate in today’s conference on banking and\nfinancial stability. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, economists and policymakers all over the world\nhave been evaluating the factors that led to the crisis, assessing what could have been done to prevent, or\nat least limit, the damage, and considering what can and should be done to reduce the probability and\nimpact of future disruptions to financial stability. To its credit and understanding the importance of the\nfinancial system to a vital economy, Australia began undertaking thoughtful, periodic reviews of its\nfinancial system and regulatory structure well before the crisis. Based on the recommendations coming\nout of these inquiries, Australian policymakers implemented changes to address the evolving nature of the\nfinancial services landscape.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to learn more about the financial stability efforts underway here and to\nprovide a perspective from the other side of the Pacific. Today, I will focus my remarks on the\nconnections between monetary policy and financial stability. To help put the discussion into context, I\nwill start with a brief overview of the U.S. financial system regulatory structure as it pertains to financial\nstability. I should note that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe U.S. Financial System Regulatory Structure and Financial Stability\nIt is probably an understatement to say that the financial system regulatory structure in the U.S. is\ncomplex. In part, its complexity reflects the wide array of institutions that provide financial services,\nhelping to support an $18 trillion economy. Banks, a category that includes commercial banks, savings\nand loans, and credit unions, provide only about a third of the credit in the U.S. Other providers include\ninsurance companies; mutual funds; pension funds; government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie\n\n\f2\nMae and Freddie Mac, which issue mortgage-backed securities; and other non banks including brokerdealers, finance companies, and mortgage real estate investment trusts.1\n\nThese diverse financial institutions are able to provide valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity\nservices to businesses and households because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged\ncompared with nonfinancial businesses. But this risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic\nproblems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and\nimpose significant economic costs.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which\ncontributed to a buildup in financial imbalances and systemic risk. In response to the crisis, the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in 2010. Provisions in the\nact aim to foster financial stability in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of a financial crisis, and\nsecond, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system.\nUnder Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies in the U.S. were directed\nto augment their traditional microprudential approach, which promotes the safety and soundness of\nindividual institutions, with a macroprudential approach in which examiners and supervisors take a\nhorizontal view of risk across institutions rather than looking at only one institution at a time. Although\nthere is still more to be done, U.S. regulators continue to make progress in developing tools to implement\nthe macroprudential approach and to monitor the risks over the business and financial cycles.\n\nIn the U.S., the application of these tools is complicated by the complexity of the regulatory structure\nitself. At the federal level, there are multiple financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the\n1\n\nSee Fischer (2015).\n\n\f3\nNational Credit Union Association, the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency. There are financial system regulators at the state level as well. In many cases,\nthe regulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by instrument.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to promote coordination\nand information sharing across these financial system regulators. The 10 voting members of the FSOC\ninclude the heads of the nine federal regulatory entities I just mentioned, and an independent member\nwith insurance expertise, who is appointed by the president of the U.S. An important power of the FSOC\nis its ability to designate nonbanks as systemically important, bringing them under more banking-type\nsupervision and regulation. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has the responsibility\nfor supervising systemically important financial institutions, including these FSOC-designated nonbank\nfinancial companies, large bank holding companies, and the U.S. operations of certain foreign banking\norganizations.\n\nThe complexity of the financial system makes monitoring risks more complicated. The Office of\nFinancial Research, established under Dodd-Frank, is collecting data to aid in this task. The Federal\nReserve has also developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, which is helping us to better\nidentify changes in conditions over time. Financial stability surveillance is receiving regular attention at\nmeetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body within the Federal Reserve that is\nresponsible for setting monetary policy.2 One might ask why that’s the case given that financial stability\n\n2\n\nThis framework, which is described in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013), involves tracking a standard set of\nfinancial system vulnerabilities, including the pricing of risk, leverage, maturity and liquidity transformation, and\ninterconnectedness and complexity. Recognizing the complex nature of the U.S. financial system, Federal Reserve\nstaff track these risks across four broad areas of the financial system: asset markets, the banking sector, shadow\nbanks, and the nonfinancial sector.\n\n\f4\nis not an explicit part of the FOMC’s monetary policy mandate. It is because the goals of monetary\npolicy and financial stability are interconnected.\n\nThe Nexus Between Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\nIn my view, a central bank should care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of\nthe real economy. Volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a\ndynamic economy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something the monetary policy\nauthority should respond to. Indeed, to the extent that the word “stability” gives the impression that the\nfinancial system is static, we may want to adopt the language used in the United Kingdom and speak\nabout financial system resiliency, that is, the financial system’s ability to continue to provide the core\nfinancial services of intermediation, risk management, and payments in the face of the inevitable shocks\nthat will hit a dynamic economy.3\n\nMonetary policy mainly works through its ability to affect current and expected future interest rates;\nhowever, in certain circumstances, it also has the ability to affect risk-taking by investors and financial\ninstitutions, and thereby is linked to financial stability.4 I believe that, in general, the goals of monetary\npolicy and financial stability are complementary. For example, price stability helps businesses,\nhouseholds, and financial institutions make better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial\nsystem. And a stable financial system allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy\nthroughout the economy. I view this complementarity as similar to the complementarity between the two\nmonetary policy goals that the U.S. Congress has given to the FOMC, namely, price stability and\nmaximum employment.\n\n3\n\nSee Tucker (2015).\n\n4\n\nSee Adrian and Shin (2011) for a review of the literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.\n\n\f5\nBut during the financial crisis we learned that financial imbalances can build up even in a low-inflation\nenvironment, so that while price stability may promote financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition.\nWe also learned that financial instability can arise from nonbanks and from institutions that are solvent\nand not necessarily highly leveraged.5\n\nA large body of research has aided our understanding about how systemic risk can build up and propagate\nthrough the economy. Well before the financial crisis, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) did seminal work on\nthe important role collateral plays in lending markets. In their model, because borrowers cannot be forced\nto repay, all lending is collateralized. When the economy is performing well, the value of the collateral\nincreases, which supports further borrowing and higher output. But when a negative shock hits the\neconomy and output declines, collateral values also fall, which means borrowing falls, which depresses\noutput even further. Thus, the collateral constraint is a mechanism that amplifies and propagates the\neffects of temporary shocks on the economy.\n\nBrunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) build on the Kiyotaki and Moore model. In their model, an economic\nboom increases bank capital levels high enough so that credit is amply available to borrowers. This\nlowers the volatility of both output and asset prices. The lower volatility induces banks to increase their\nleverage and lend even more, so much so that the system is now vulnerable to a negative shock. Gorton\nand Ordoñez (2014) examine how private market activities generate endogenous accumulations of and\nsubsequent collapses in leverage. These models illustrate that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by\nthe choices of the model’s decision makers, and varies across the cycle.\n\n5\n\nFeroli, Kashyap, Schoenholtz, and Shin (2014) focus on market “tantrums,” which they define as periods in which\nrisk premiums inherent in market interest rates fluctuate widely. Using data on inflows and outflows to open-end\nmutual funds, they conclude that market tantrums can arise independently of the degree of leverage in the system.\n\n\f6\nDuring the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission\nof monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. In those circumstances, the actions taken to\nimplement monetary policy can also affect financial stability. The FOMC has acknowledged that\nnonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of very\nlow interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and by\nspurring risk-taking in a search for yield.6 Empirical work is beginning to document this effect. For\nexample, Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) use data on 23 million bank loans from the\nSpanish credit registry and find that a lower overnight policy rate induces low-capitalized banks to lend\nmore to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized banks, direct\nevidence of monetary policy’s effect on risk-taking.7\n\nThus, while I believe that, in most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are\ncomplementary, we need to recognize that, at times, actions taken to foster financial stability and those\ntaken to promote our monetary policy goals might be in conflict, at least in the short run. In the U.K., the\nFinancial Services Act recognizes this potential tradeoff and explicitly says that the Financial Policy\nCommittee (FPC) is not authorized to act in a way that it feels is “likely to have a significant adverse\neffect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the\nmedium or long term.”8\n\nIn deciding whether to take action against a growing imbalance, policymakers need to balance the\nexpected improvement in future economic conditions against the potential cost of unduly limiting credit\n\n6\n\nThe Board of Governors discusses developments related to financial stability in its monetary policy report to\nCongress. For example, see Board of Governors (2016), p. 20.\n7\n\nJiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) separately identify how a change in the monetary policy rate affects\nthe demand for credit and the volume and composition of credit supplied, in particular, the supply to riskier\nborrowers.\n8\n\nSee Section 9c(4) of the U.K.’s Financial Services Act 2012.\n\n\f7\nextension. Too high a resiliency standard will thwart risk-taking and innovation, which will undermine\nlonger-run economic growth. In setting the standard, we need to come to some common understanding\nabout the amount of growth and prosperity we are willing to give up in order to lower the risk to financial\nstability. In the U.S., people who are 80 years old have lived through two major financial crises (the\nGreat Depression and the 2008 crisis). Is that too many? Would we rather lower the probability of such\nan event to one every 1,000 years? What would we be willing to give up to do that?\n\nThat may be a premature question at this point. There are likely things that can be done and that are being\ndone to lower the risk to financial stability without much cost in terms of longer-run growth. If we think\nof there being a risk-return frontier relating financial stability risk to the economic return that a wellfunctioning financial system can provide, then it isn’t hard to imagine that we were operating at a point\nwell interior to that frontier in the run-up to the crisis, and that the improvements being made in our\nfinancial regulatory and supervisory regime are moving us toward the frontier without sacrificing growth.\n\nMacroprudential Tools\nTo foster the resiliency of the financial system, regulators in the U.S. and throughout the world are\ndeveloping macroprudential tools aimed at lowering the probability that instability will arise and to limit\nthe damage when financial shocks do arise. Some tools focus on building up the structural resiliency of\nthe financial system throughout the business cycle. In my view, these structural resiliency tools are the\nmost promising. They include the Basel III risk-based capital requirements, minimum liquidity\nrequirements, central clearing for derivatives, and bank stress tests. Living-will resolution plans and the\nOrderly Liquidation Authority, which is housed at the FDIC, are intended to make it easier for regulators\nand policymakers to allow large complex financial institutions to fail.\n\nIn addition to structural tools, there are countercyclical tools that aim to mitigate the systemic risk that can\nbuild up over the business cycle. These include the countercyclical capital buffer and the capital\n\n\f8\nconservation buffer.9 Other possible cyclical tools, not yet established in the U.S. but used in other\ncountries, include loan-to-value ratio limits and debt-to-income ratio limits that vary over the cycle and\nwhich have been targeted to particular sectors like housing credit or household credit.10\n\nThe performance of the set of macroprudential tools is largely untested. Cross-country studies find mixed\nresults, with the effectiveness of the tools varying with economic circumstances and the types of shocks\nhitting the financial sector.11 In the U.S., the need to coordinate countercyclical macroprudential policy\nactions across multiple regulators adds a complication to effectively using such tools in a timely way.\n\nCurrently, policymakers in the U.K. are putting one of the countercyclical tools to the test. The\nuncertainty arising from U.K. voters’ decision to exit the European Union has the potential to dampen\neconomic performance in the U.K. In response, policymakers there have taken steps to ease credit\nconditions. One such step, taken by the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), is a\nreduction in the countercyclical capital buffer rate for banks to zero percent from half of a percent of\nbanks’ U.K. exposures, with the expectation that the zero percent rate will be maintained until at least\n\n9\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer allows regulators to increase risk-based capital requirements when credit growth\nis judged to be excessive and leading to rising systemic risk. The capital conservation buffer ensures that banks\nraise capital above regulatory minimums in good times so that when they cover losses in bad times, their capital\nratio will stay at or above the regulatory minimum.\n10\n\nFor example, Canada tightened loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits on mortgage lending over the 2009 to\n2012 period (Krznar and Morsink, 2014). Beginning in 2010, Israel also implemented a package of macroprudential\ntools to restrict the supply of housing credit (Fischer, 2014). Spain introduced dynamic loan-loss provisioning in\n2000. This method builds up reserves during good economic times according to the historical losses experienced by\nthe asset classes held in the bank’s portfolio. This buffer is then available to absorb losses in bad times (Balla and\nMcKenna, 2009).\n11\n\nFor example, a study by economists at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) examined the effectiveness of\nmacroprudential tools in reducing systemic risk in 49 countries. The authors concluded that many of the most\nfrequently used tools were effective in reducing the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage, but the effectiveness\ndepended on the type of shock hitting the financial sector. (See Lin, Columba, Costa, Kongsamut, Otani, Saiyid,\nWezel, and We, 2011.) Another study published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) examined 57\ncountries over a span of up to three decades and found that imposing maximum debt-service-to-income ratios can\nlimit the buildup of credit in housing markets, but maximum loan-to-value ratios were less effective, and\ninstruments like reserve and liquidity requirements focused on the supply of credit had little impact on housing\nmarkets. (See Kuttner and Shim, 2016.)\n\n\f9\nJune 2017.12 This is a reduction in regulatory capital buffers by 5.7 billion pounds, which the FPC\nestimates will raise banks’ capacity to lend by as much as 150 billion pounds, or the equivalent of about\n$260 billion AUD, or about $190 billion USD. Usually, when one thinks about the use of the\ncountercyclical tools it is to mitigate building financial stability risk by tightening credit conditions, but\nhere is an example of the use of a macroprudential tool to ease credit conditions in support of monetary\npolicy goals – an illustration of the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability policy.\n\nLessons from Monetary Policy for Financial Stability Policy\nAnother connection between the two stems from hard-won lessons learned from years of monetary\npolicy-setting, lessons that can now be productively applied to financial stability policy-setting. Let me\ndiscuss two of these lessons. First, to the extent possible, policymakers should take a systematic approach\nin applying financial stability policy rather than relying on discretion. The financial crisis underscored\nthe important role of incentives in financial markets – not only the incentives of financial institutions but\nalso those of regulators and policymakers. Time-inconsistency problems and moral hazard issues are\nimportant factors that need to be considered when designing a framework for implementing financial\nstability policy. These types of problems argue for taking a systematic approach to such policymaking.\n\nThe benefits of systematic monetary policy are well established. When monetary policymakers respond\nin a systematic fashion to incoming information, the public will have a better sense of how policymakers\nare likely to react to economic developments – whether those developments are anticipated or\nunanticipated – so their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment\nhelps the public make better financial and economic decisions, thereby making monetary policy more\neffective.\n12\n\nAnother step was taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in encouraging banks to continue lending to\nhouseholds and businesses. See Carney (June 20, 2016 and July 5, 2016) and Joint Statement from the Chancellor\nof the Exchequer and Banks (July 5, 2016).\n\n\f10\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which\npolicymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. Being\nsystematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems in monetary policy, whereby policymakers\nmay favor the short run over the long run. Note that by systematic policy I do not mean that monetary\npolicy will be set mechanically by a policy rule or that policymakers need to be prescient about the types\nof shocks that will hit the economy. Rather, I mean that policy will react in a systematic fashion to\neconomic developments that change the economic outlook.\n\nA systematic approach to financial stability policy is perhaps even more important than in the case of\nmonetary policy because of the important role played by incentives. The crisis shined a bright light on\nsignificant moral hazard problems that exist in financial markets. A financial stability policymaker that is\nsystematic in how it applies its tools to promote stability will likely help tame some of the moral hazard\nproblems and also some of the time-inconsistency problems to which the regulators themselves are\nsubject.\n\nAn important tool in this regard is the resolution of insolvent financial institutions. Without a credible\nresolution method, during the crisis in the face of serious distress at a large financial firm, governments\nfaced a dilemma: either rescue the firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and\nrisk causing a cascade of other failures. The fact that policymakers had to make these decisions in the\nheat of the moment using their best judgment based on limited information didn’t help. Without a\ncredible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that even well-intentioned policymakers will be\nbiased toward bailouts. A resolution method that can be applied systematically can help alleviate this\nproblem. The living-will resolution plans and Orderly Liquidation Authority in the U.S. are promising,\nbut still untested, tools in a process that will allow large firms to fail. This, in turn, provides incentives\n\n\f11\nfor these large, systemically important institutions to reorganize themselves in a way that reduces the risk\nthey pose to the financial system.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has become more systematic in monitoring risks across the financial\nsystem. Coupling that monitoring with the application of a resiliency standard across the entire financial\nservices landscape, including the so-called shadow banking system that was less-heavily regulated in the\npast, would limit regulatory arbitrage. As the financial crisis made clear, taking an action that pushes risk\nfrom one set of institutions to another doesn’t eliminate the risk, it just moves it around, potentially to a\npart of the financial system where the risk is more difficult to monitor and control.13\n\nI acknowledge that this broad application of the resiliency standard across the financial system may be\nparticularly difficult in the U.S. with its complex regulatory structure. Still, we can devise ways to make\nthe macroprudential tools more systematic and less discretionary. Regulators could agree in advance on\nthe contingencies under which the cyclical macroprudential tools would be invoked, rather than waiting\nuntil the risks escalated before starting the process to coordinate action. For example, we can write down\na formula for a countercyclical buffer, and we can define an explicit trigger for contingent convertible\nbonds. Knowing that such policies will be systematically applied and what will trigger them may induce\nfinancial market participants to limit the buildup of risks in the first place.\n\nAnother lesson we’ve learned from setting monetary policy – or perhaps, we are still learning it – is the\nimportance of transparency and clear communication. In my view, to be effective, macroprudential\npolicy actions must be communicated in a clear way to avoid creating a conflict with or causing confusion\n13\n\nApplication of a resiliency standard would allow the type of supervision to vary appropriately by the nature of the\nsystemic risk associated with each part of the financial system. As discussed in Mester (2015), this is a component\nof the regime for financial stability advocated by Paul Tucker (2015). Several of the macroprudential tools are\nfocused on those institutions that have been deemed systemically important, including the capital surcharge for\nglobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and the U.S. stress tests for banks with more than $50 billion in\nassets.\n\n\f12\nover actions taken to foster monetary policy goals. Transparency and clear communication are hallmarks\nof best-practice monetary policymaking. Clear communication helps align the public’s policy\nexpectations, which makes monetary policy more effective. Transparency is necessary so that the public\nand elected officials have the ability to hold monetary policymakers accountable for their decisions. The\nFederal Reserve has been given independence in setting monetary policy, which has been well\ndocumented as yielding more effective policy and better economic outcomes. But accountability must go\nhand-in-hand with independence. So the Federal Reserve regularly communicates the basis for its policy\ndecisions.\n\nA parallel can be drawn with financial stability policy. Although, in some cases, prudential supervisory\ninformation should be kept private, as a general principle, I think financial stability policymakers should\nstrive for greater transparency and more disclosure. Similarly, they should require more disclosure from\nfinancial firms so that creditors and other market participants can exert market discipline.\n\nOf course, clear communication is easier said than done. Three aspects make this even harder for\nfinancial stability policy than for monetary policy. First, the framework and tools of financial stability\npolicy are new. It will take considerable effort on the part of the financial stability policymakers to\nexplain the tools they are using and the rationale for their policy decisions. However, such\ncommunication is necessary so that the public understands when an action is being taken because of\nconcerns about financial stability rather than concerns about monetary policy goals. This would be\nparticularly true when the monetary policy authority is also responsible for taking financial stability\nactions, and if monetary policy were the tool used to address the financial stability concerns. It is worth\nconsidering whether separating decisions about financial stability from decisions about monetary policy\n\n\f13\nwithin the central bank, perhaps by having separate committees as in the U.K., could aid communication\nand decision-making.14\n\nA second complication in effective communication of financial stability policy is timing. If effective\nmonetary policy means taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, then effective financial\nstability policy might mean taking away the punch bowl before the guests have even arrived because the\nseeds of financial instability are sown much earlier and action must be taken earlier as well. If the need\nfor monetary policy to be forward looking is a difficult concept for the public to grasp, the need for\nfinancial stability policy to act well before there are clear signs of instability may be even more difficult\nto explain.\n\nYet a third complication in effective communication is the complexity of the financial regulatory regime\nitself.15 In my view, a sometimes overlooked lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can\ncomplicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Given the scope and everchanging nature of the financial system, regulatory complexity is, to a certain extent, unavoidable. But\nthe tradeoffs should be recognized. For example, it is reasonable to require banks to hold higher levels of\ncapital against higher-risk assets, but a system of risk weights that is overly granular and complex would\nbe counterproductive. In practice, too much complexity would make it harder for regulators to assess\ncompliance and to determine whether institutions were engaging in some practices merely as a way to\nhide risk and lower their capital requirements. If regulators have made the rules so complex that they\ncannot assess compliance, then, in practice, there are no consequences for firms that fail to meet the\nstandards. Complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the monitors. It might be worth exploring\n\n14\n15\n\nKohn (2015) discusses the benefits of such separation.\n\nHaldane and Madouros (2012) discuss the benefits of a less complex financial regulatory structure and argue that\nthe complexity of the financial landscape does not call for a complex financial regulatory structure, but just the\nopposite.\n\n\f14\nwhether we would be better off with a much simpler macro- and microprudential supervisory structure,\none that is easier to implement and simpler to govern and that is approximately right across various\neconomic models and states of the world even if it is never optimal in any particular model or state.\n\nOf course, we aren’t in that simpler regime. So the question is, given the current financial structure in the\nU.S., how should policy respond to emerging financial stability risks and what role should monetary\npolicy play?\n\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability Risks\nI do not believe financial stability should be added to the Fed’s statutory monetary policy goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. But U.S. monetary policymakers need to remain cognizant of the\nlinkages between financial stability and our monetary policy goals. In my view, the first line of defense\nagainst financial instability involves the tools that will make the structure of the financial system less\nprone to crisis. These structural resiliency tools include higher capital standards (including a minimum\nnon-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards), liquidity standards, stress tests,\nliving wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically important bank and nonbank financial\ninstitutions. Much work has been done to develop these structural resiliency tools, and I believe the\nsystem is in a better position to handle shocks now than it was before the financial crisis.\n\nCountercyclical macroprudential tools, such as limits on loan-to-value ratios in particular markets, are\nworth further study, but at this point, I am not convinced that we have enough knowledge and experience\nwith them to use them effectively in the U.S. That consideration leads me to think that we should set\nstandards for the structural resiliency tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more\nconfidence in the countercyclical tools.\n\n\f15\nWhat about using monetary policy to combat heightened financial stability risks? As I’ve discussed,\nmonetary policy and financial stability goals and actions are interrelated. Very loose monetary policy\nincreases the likelihood that financial instabilities will develop, thereby increasing the likelihood that\nmacroprudential policy tools will be needed. Tight macroprudential policy can tighten financial\nconditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that a monetary policy response will be\nneeded.\n\nThat said, in my view, U.S monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and\nmaximum employment, and financial stability should not be added as a third objective for monetary\npolicy. First, it isn’t clear that monetary policy would be very effective against emerging financial\nstability risks. While interest rates affect the fundamental value of assets, it is not clear that they affect\nthe speculative or bubble portion; the impact may depend on the underlying nature of the financial\nimbalance.16 Second, monetary policy tends to be a blunt instrument, so any benefits of using it to stem\nfinancial imbalances, mispricing of assets, or excessive leverage need to be weighed against the economic\ncosts in terms of price stability and employment. Svensson (2016) brings some metrics to the question\nand concludes that the costs outweigh the benefits.17\n\nWhile I don’t believe financial stability should be part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate, monetary\npolicymakers need to be aware of the linkages between our monetary policy actions and financial\nstability. In the case of the housing market, which precipitated the last crisis, policymakers\nunderestimated the breadth and depth of the negative impact this would have on the rest of the economy\n16\n17\n\nFor example, in the Gali (2014) model, raising interest rates to combat a bubble can actually inflate it.\n\nThe benefit of “leaning against the wind,” that is, running monetary policy tighter than it otherwise would be in\norder to stem emerging financial instabilities, is a reduction in the probability of entering into a financial crisis. The\ncost is worse economic conditions today and higher economic costs should the economy enter into a crisis. By\nSvensson’s (2016) metrics, these costs outweigh the small reduction in the probability of a crisis. One caveat about\nSvensson’s analysis is that it is based on a log-linear model, but we know that financial crises involve extreme states\nand nonlinearities.\n\n\f16\nand financial system. To the extent that we misjudged the impact, there is a larger potential gain to\ncarefully monitoring financial market conditions, implementing the structural macroprudential tools, and\nbeing open to taking offsetting action should imbalances develop.18\n\nIf our macroprudential tools proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks continued to grow, I\nbelieve monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. However, in this case, the blurring\nbetween financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to\nfinancial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also\nbe in jeopardy. Which brings me back to my original point: in most cases, the goals of price stability,\nmaximum employment, and financial stability are complementary.\n\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by noting that in his 2015 presidential address to the American Finance Association,\nLuigi Zingales (2015) posed the question, “Does Finance Benefit Society?” While academics, and, I\nbelieve, central bankers, typically say “yes,” a recent survey indicates that the average American is much\nless certain.19 I am hopeful that the considerable efforts underway across the globe will change that. I\nbelieve it is our responsibility to ensure that we create and maintain a financial system that the public\nviews as being beneficial, and one that truly is.\n\n18\n\nPeek, Rosengren, and Tootell’s (2015) textural analysis of the transcripts of FOMC meetings from 1982 through\n2009 suggests that the FOMC does consider financial stability when setting monetary policy.\n19\n\nZingales (2015) cites the Chicago Booth-Kellogg School Financial Trust Index survey of a representative sample\nof about 1,000 American households, conducted by Social Science Research Solutions. Forty-eight percent of\nrespondents to the December 2014 survey said that the U.S. financial system hurts the U.S. economy, while only 34\npercent said that it benefits the U.S. economy.\n\n\f17\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring.” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series (FEDS) paper 2013-21, Divisions of Research and Statistics and\nMonetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board, March 2013.\nAdrian, Tobias, and Hyun Song Shin, “Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics,” in Handbook\nof Monetary Economics, Vol. 3a, ed. by B.

        "content": "The U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe European Economics and Financial Centre\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\nLondon, U.K.\nJuly 1, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the European Economics and Financial Centre for the invitation to speak to this distinguished\naudience, in this venerable venue, at this historically significant time. I will focus my remarks today on\nthe other side of the pond – in particular, the U.S. economy and monetary policy. But as you know, we\nlive in a global world, and so we are monitoring very closely what is happening on this side of the pond\nand assessing the implications for the economic outlook and monetary policy on my side of the pond.\nBefore I begin, I should note that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe consequences of last week’s decision by U.K. voters to exit the European Union are on everyone’s\nmind. This is a developing story, and how it plays out will ultimately determine its implications for the\nglobal economy and monetary policy. For the U.S. economy, while the risks and uncertainty surrounding\nthe outlook have increased, it is too early to judge whether conditions in the aftermath of the decision will\nnecessitate a material change in the modal outlook. In structuring my remarks today, I think it would be\nhelpful to first discuss my views on the U.S. economy prior to the vote. These were the views I carried\ninto the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting two weeks ago and that helped inform the\neconomic projections I submitted as part of the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).\nI will then discuss the potential ramifications of the U.K.’s exit decision for the U.S. economic outlook.\n\nIn thinking about the economic outlook, I try to stay focused on underlying fundamentals because they\ndetermine the outlook for the economy over the medium run, the time horizon over which monetary\npolicy can affect the economy. In my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the U.S. economic\nexpansion remain sound. These include accommodative monetary policy, household balance sheets that\nhave improved greatly since the recession, continued progress in the labor market, a more resilient\nbanking system, and low oil prices. There are risks around all forecasts, but my modal forecast has been\n\n\f2\nthat over the next two years the U.S. economy will continue to expand at a pace slightly above its longerrun trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will remain slightly under\nits longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually\nreturn to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Of course, even in the best of times, without the\nincreased uncertainty of our current situation, there is some variation in growth and other economic\nindicators over time. The trick is to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from economic\nand financial market information that can often be quite noisy.\n\nEconomic growth\nWe’ve seen this kind of variability in the quarterly measures of U.S. GDP growth. Growth in the first\nquarter of the year slowed, although less so than originally estimated. Incoming information suggests that\nwe are seeing a rebound of growth in the second quarter. This is very similar to the pattern we saw in\n2014 and 2015. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output in the U.S., has\naccelerated in recent months. The continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in\npersonal income, low borrowing rates, and relatively low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending.\nIn the U.S., the drop in gasoline prices by almost $1 per gallon between 2014 and 2015 saved the average\nhousehold about $700. Although gasoline prices have moved up in the past couple of months, the U.S.\nEnergy Information Administration now forecasts that the average price of gasoline will be down again\nthis year, resulting in another $200 in cost savings for the average household. Some of those savings\nhave been spent. For example, we’ve seen high levels of auto sales for the past two years. Some\nhouseholds likely saved part of the windfall instead of spending it, or used it to pay down debt. Either\nway, stronger household balance sheets will help support future consumption spending.\n\nThe U.S. housing sector has been gradually recovering for some time. In the aftermath of the housing\ncrash, house prices in the U.S. began rising again in mid-2011, and for the past two years, they have been\nincreasing at a 5 to 6 percent annual rate. At the aggregate level, homeowners lost an unprecedented $7\n\n\f3\ntrillion in real estate equity during the housing crash, but the increases in house prices have allowed\nhomeowners to recover nearly all of that. Sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of home sales\nin the U.S., are now back near the levels seen before the housing bubble run-up in the early to mid-2000s.\nI am using the pre-bubble level as my benchmark because we shouldn’t want to see the housing market\nreturn to bubble proportions. Other parts of the housing sector haven’t yet fully recovered. Construction\nand sales of new homes have been rising at a gradual pace, but they are not back up to their pre-bubble\nlevels. Starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer\nrun, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn’t kept up with demand. In addition, the type of\nhousing being built has shifted. Over the past five years, increases in multifamily housing starts have\nsignificantly outpaced increases in single-family starts. This may reflect a shift in preferences toward\nmore urban living, but it likely also reflects the desire on the part of some people who lived through the\ncrisis to rent rather than own. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on\nmore mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. My\nassessment of conditions is that the recovery in housing should continue at a moderate pace.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak. While the sharp drop in oil prices since\nmid-2014 benefited consumers and many businesses, firms in the drilling and mining sector, their\nsuppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector have been hurt. We have seen the\neffects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production has been down and firms tied to\nenergy have had to cut jobs and reduce investment. Business contacts in the steel industry have told us\nthey’ve been encouraged by the firming in oil and other commodity prices since the start of the year, but\nthey remain uncertain about the sustainability of those increases. Other contacts in the energy sector have\ntold us that the price increases have spurred moving forward on some investment projects that had been\nput on hold. But even outside of the energy sector, business investment has been soft despite generally\naccommodative financial conditions. Manufacturers have been investing but mainly to maintain current\noperations rather than to expand. Some manufacturers in the Cleveland District have told us that\n\n\f4\nbusinesses’ reluctance to expand capacity reflects concern about the overall longer-run direction of the\neconomy rather than concerns about the economy in the near term or their own firms’ performance. Part\nof the softness in investment reflects weakness in demand outside of the U.S., which has hurt U.S.\nexports.\n\nIndeed, firms exposed to U.S. trade have had to operate in a very challenging environment. From mid2014 until last week, the nominal value of the U.S. dollar has appreciated about 18 percent on a broad\ntrade-weighted basis. This has placed a significant drag on manufacturing output and export growth. But\nthe slowdown in the rate of appreciation in recent months was starting to diminish the drag on growth\nfrom net exports. In the first quarter, net exports made a slightly positive contribution to U.S. output\ngrowth; in contrast, they subtracted about a half of a percentage point from growth last year.\n\nOf course, global growth, commodity price changes, and currency fluctuations are not necessarily\nindependent events. For example, a portion of the more than 50 percent decline in oil prices since mid2014 likely reflects expectations of weaker growth in China and other countries, although supply factors\nhave likely played a greater role. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar since mid-2014 has reflected\nexpectations that real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as\nprojected real interest rate differentials between the U.S. and other economies. We have to be careful not\nto think of these shocks as independent events and merely sum their effects. We live in an interconnected\nglobal economy. Changes in prices and currency values are one way economies reach a new equilibrium\nafter a shock.\n\nWhile I would expect investment to begin to pick up as overall economic growth expands, the weakness\nin investment and the associated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of\nthe U.S. economy. Structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output\nand increases in living standards. And investment in capital, including human capital, is a key\n\n\f5\ndeterminant of productivity growth. Labor productivity growth has risen at only a half of a percent\nannual rate over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical: weak investment during the\nrecession and early part of the expansion contributed to slow productivity growth over this period. But\nthe weakness in investment and productivity has persisted. Productivity growth is very difficult to\nforecast, so the softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it’s\nthe latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth\nI’ve been assuming.\n\nAs this overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But overall,\neconomic growth has proven to be resilient and at a pace slightly above trend. The pace has been\nsufficient to generate significant progress in labor markets.\n\nLabor markets\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about\n10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its\npeak of 10 percent in late 2009. Over the past two years, there have also been significant improvements\nin other gauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time\nworkers who would rather work full-time and the number of people who have only been looking for work\nsporadically or have been discouraged from looking at all because they don’t think they will find a job.\nIncreasingly, we are hearing from businesses that they are having trouble finding qualified workers.\nEarly on, such reports were concentrated in high-skilled occupations in information technology, health\ncare, and specialized construction. Now, the reports are expanding to include lower-skilled jobs and lessspecialized occupations in a broader set of industries.\n\nSo when the U.S. labor market report for May was released early last month, it garnered considerable\nattention. Just when we were beginning to see signs of a pickup in growth in the second quarter, we\n\n\f6\nreceived news that firms added just 38,000 jobs to their payrolls in May. Part of the weakness reflected\nthe effects of a strike by workers at Verizon Communications. But even adjusting for that, which\naccounted for about 35,000 jobs, the pace was a considerable step down from the 200,000-plus jobs per\nmonth the U.S. economy was adding last year and early this year. The question is: was this the start of a\nreversal from the considerable progress that’s been made in labor markets, or was this the type of\ntransitory change we typically see during expansions?\n\nMy read of the available data puts me in the second camp: I believe the U.S. labor market remains sound\nand that we’ll continue to see further improvements in the job market, although the pace of improvement\nwill necessarily slow given the progress that’s already been made. It’s important to put the May jobs\nreport into context. One thing we have learned is that we shouldn’t take too much signal from one or two\nmonthly reports. Payroll growth has slowed several times during this expansion, only to pick up again.\nWe will see how payrolls behaved in June when the report is released next Friday.\n\nIn addition, we should expect to see some slowdown in the pace of job growth as the economy nears full\nemployment. The bigger surprise may have been the very strong job numbers early this year. Adjusting\nfor the Verizon strike, over the past three months firms added an average of 127,000 jobs per month.\nThat pace exceeds the 75,000 to 120,000 per month range of trend employment growth estimates from\nvarious models that take into account the aging of the population and other demographic factors affecting\nlabor force participation. So it is enough to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nOther incoming data remain consistent with an improving labor market. Claims for unemployment\ninsurance are low. The rates of job openings and hiring are high. The quit rate is also high, suggesting\nthat workers are confident enough to be looking for better jobs. The unemployment rate is low. Of\ncourse, just as I discount taking a strong signal from weak May payrolls, I don’t read May’s sharp drop in\nthe unemployment rate to 4.7 percent as indicating a significant tightening in labor market conditions.\n\n\f7\nThe drop reflected not only a decline in the number of unemployed people but also an outsized decline in\nthe labor force participation rate. The participation rate varies from month to month, but averaging over\nthe past several months, the level of the participation rate is consistent with estimates of its longer-run\ndownward trend. Another positive is that there are signs in the data and from anecdotal reports that\nwages may be accelerating.\n\nAll of this suggests to me that labor market progress will continue. At the same time, I do not want to\nunderestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession and slow\nrecovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced\nby different demographic groups in the U.S. There are serious longer-run workforce development issues\naffecting U.S. labor markets, and the deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated\nthese problems. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and\nthe skill sets needed to perform those jobs. As a country, the U.S. needs to ensure that people can enter\nand remain productive members of the modern labor force. This will raise our shared standard of living\nand make us more competitive in the global economy. I believe that government programs and privatepublic partnerships, including educational assistance, retraining programs, and apprenticeships, can be\neffective in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and should be brought to bear. On the other\nhand, I do not believe that monetary policy would be effective in addressing these longer-run problems.\nSo from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, I believe the economy is basically at maximum\nemployment, one part of the Fed’s dual mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s\ngoal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the\nprice of oil and other commodities, which began in mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar,\nwhich has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S. According to dynamic simulations\n\n\f8\nof the Federal Reserve Board staff’s SIGMA model, a 10 percent rise in the real value of the dollar affects\ncore inflation via import prices fairly quickly, resulting in a drop of about 0.5 percent in core inflation a\nyear after the shock, which partially reverses over the subsequent year. A shock to the value of the dollar\nalso tends to reduce GDP with a lag, and the model indicates that this would put additional downward\npressure on inflation.1\n\nThe most recent inflation data have been encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the\nFOMC. Inflation measures have gradually risen as the effects of previous declines in oil prices and dollar\nappreciation have begun to fade. Headline PCE and CPI inflation, as measured by the year-over-year\nchanges in the underlying indices, have moved up from the very low levels recorded last year and have\nbeen stable at a little more than 1 percent in recent months. The core inflation measures, which omit food\nand energy prices because they tend to be volatile, have also been moving up and are above the headline\nnumbers. Another gauge of underlying inflation, the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate, rose to\nover 2.5 percent in May, its highest level in over seven years.2\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. Even in the face of\nsizable declines in energy prices, inflation expectations have been relatively stable in my view. At this\npoint I expect them to remain reasonably well anchored, but I am monitoring readings carefully. There\nare various measures of inflation expectations. Survey-based measures have tended to be more stable\nthan those based on market data. Inflation compensation, as distinct from expectations, is the difference\nin yields between nominal U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities. Inflation\ncompensation has fallen by more than the survey measures of expectations, but various models suggest\n\n1\n\nSee Chart 5 in Stanley Fischer, “U.S. Inflation Developments,” remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, WY, August 29, 2015.\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-anddata/median-cpi.aspx.\n\n\f9\nthat the movement more likely reflects changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than\nchanges in inflation expectations. Over a period of heightened market volatility and safe-haven flows into\nU.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based\nmeasure of inflation compensation than from the survey measures. The Cleveland Fed’s model of\ninflation expectations provides somewhat of a compromise by incorporating survey measures, as well as\nmarket data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps. Its measure of 5-year inflation, 5 years from\nnow has been stable, at about 1.9 percent, in recent months.3\n\nGiven these readings on inflation and inflation expectations, so long as the real side of the economy\ncontinues to perform as expected, I anticipate that inflation will continue to gradually move back to our\ngoal of 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn setting monetary policy, the FOMC assesses both realized and expected progress on our statutory\nlonger-run goals of price stability and maximum employment. That assessment encompasses a wide\nrange of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators,\nas well as the information FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions.\n\nAt its June meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds\nrate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC indicated that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary\npolicy, it anticipates further improvements in the economy. This was reflected in the Summary of\nEconomic Projections also released at the June meeting. The median projection among the FOMC\nparticipants shows growth at about 2 percent over the next three years, consistent with the median\n\n3\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations measure is available at https://clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicatorsand-data/inflation-expectations.aspx.\n\n\f10\nestimate of longer-run trend growth; the unemployment rate coming down a bit from current levels and\nremaining under the median longer-run estimate of 4.8 percent through 2018; and inflation gradually\nmoving up to 2 percent by the end of 2018.\n\nIn June, the FOMC also indicated that economic developments will likely warrant only gradual increases\nin the fed funds rate. Of course, the timing of those rate increases and the overall slope of that gradual\npath will depend on how the economy, the economic outlook, and the risks evolve.\n\nIndeed, in the June projections, the median fed funds rate path of appropriate policy was somewhat\nshallower than in the last set of projections in March – partly reflecting somewhat slower growth\nprojected for this year, and partly reflecting a lower estimate of the fed funds rate over the longer run.\n\nI supported the decision not to change rates in June. My reason did not reflect a fundamental change to\nmy outlook. The progress being made on our policy goals and the outlook suggest that a gradual upward\npath of interest rates continued to be appropriate. A gradual path means that monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against\ndownside risks. As I said, I do not think we are at the start of a significant reversal in labor markets, and I\nview the inflation data as supportive of a gradual return to target. Now, some might argue that in an\nabundance of caution, we should wait for clarity on these issues, and I agree that there are risks to acting\ntoo soon. But there are also risks to forestalling rate increases for too long when we are continuing to\nmake cumulative progress on our policy goals. Waiting too long increases risks to financial stability and\nraises the chance that we would have to move more aggressively in the future, which poses its own set of\nrisks to the outlook. I believe waiting too long also jeopardizes our future ability to use the nontraditional\nmonetary policy tools that the Fed developed to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and\ndeep recession. If we fail to gracefully navigate back toward a more normal policy stance at the\nappropriate time, then I believe there is a non-negligible chance that these tools will essentially be off the\n\n\f11\ntable because the public will have deemed them as ultimately ineffective. This is a risk to the outlook\nshould we ever find ourselves in a situation of needing such tools in the future. Of course, such a risk is\nhard to measure and is not one we typically consider. But we live in atypical times, and we need to take\nthe whole set of risks into account when assessing appropriate policy.\n\nSo why, then, did I think it appropriate not to raise rates in June? The reason was timing. There was\nconsiderable uncertainty about the outcome of the upcoming U.K. referendum on membership in the\nEuropean Union. The vote was being held a week after the June FOMC meeting. It was clear there was\ngoing to be volatility in financial markets surrounding the vote. If the vote favored exit, there was the\npotential for disruption in markets. Given that I do not think U.S. monetary policy is behind the curve\nyet, I saw little cost in waiting to take the next step.\n\nAfter the U.K. Referendum\nIt is an understatement to say that market volatility increased on the outcome of the U.K. referendum. We\nare now in a world of heightened economic and political uncertainty, and I expect we will be living with\nuncertainty for a while as the U.K. and Europe establish the terms of their new relationship.\n\nWhen a shock like this hits financial markets, the first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is\nsufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets to continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of\nextreme volatility, and to assure the public that we are prepared to act as necessary. The Bank of\nEngland, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 countries, and several other\nindividual central banks including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal\nReserve, put out statements last Friday indicating that they stand ready to use established liquidity tools to\n\n\f12\nsupport market functioning.4 Central banks are monitoring the situation for possible contagion across\nfinancial markets. Despite the volatility, markets have been functioning in an orderly manner. The\nconsiderable efforts undertaken in the U.K., Europe, the U.S., and other countries in response to the\nglobal financial crisis to increase the resiliency of the financial system, including higher capital and\nliquidity requirements, mean financial institutions are now in considerably better shape to withstand\nshort-run volatility while continuing to extend credit to households and businesses.\n\nUltimately, global economies will adjust to the new trading and labor relationships negotiated between\nthe U.K. and Europe. It is too early to judge what the magnitude of the effects on the global economy\nwill be and, for the U.S. economy, whether there will be a material change in the medium-run outlook. It\nwill depend on how the situation evolves, so the assessment will take some time to fully develop. While\nthe U.K. represents about 4 percent of world output and global trade, London is one of the major financial\ncenters of the world. About 4 percent of U.S. exports go to the U.K., which is a relatively small share, but\nthe financial ties between our two countries are larger. Barring any major disruption in financial and\nbanking markets, one of the main mechanisms through which the exit decision could affect the U.S.\neconomy is through dollar appreciation, which, depending on its persistence and magnitude, could\ndampen U.S. export growth and cause a delay in the return of inflation to 2 percent. Slower growth\noutside of the U.S. would also lower demand for U.S. exports. But it is important to remember that\nexports make up only about 12 percent of U.S. output, so whatever the reduction in export growth, it\nwould mean a smaller reduction in overall GDP growth.\n\n4\n\nSee the following statements released on June 24, 2016: Statement from the Bank of England; Statement from the\nGovernor of the Bank of England Following the E.U. Referendum Result; Statement of G-7 Finance Ministers and\nCentral Bank Governors; ECB is Closely Monitoring Financial Markets; Statement by Minister Aso and Governor\nKuroda on the U.K.’s Decision to Leave the E.U.; and The Federal Reserve is Carefully Monitoring Developments\nin Global Financial Markets.\n\n\f13\nHeightened and persistent uncertainty is another factor that can affect the economy. When the exit\ndecision was announced, investors moved away from risk assets. Higher credit spreads and lower equity\nprices, coupled with continued uncertainty, could put firms and households in a wait-and-see mode,\nreducing economic activity for a time. In his speech yesterday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney\nhighlighted the dampening effect uncertainty could have on economic performance in the U.K. and\nindicated possible responses to it.5\n\nAs I said, it is too soon to judge the full magnitude of such effects. At this point, we need to continue to\nmonitor developments. For example, some of the tightening in financial conditions after the\nannouncement of the vote’s outcome has been reversed in recent days. As we see how things play out,\nwe will have a better sense of whether the medium-run U.S. economic outlook has been meaningfully\naffected and whether that changes our assessment of appropriate U.S. monetary policy going forward.\nMonetary policymakers cannot let the lack of economic clarity distract us from our important mission.\nWe must continue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess the situation. As an\nFOMC member, I will remain focused on and committed to setting monetary policy to promote the\nFederal Reserve’s longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the\npublic.\n\n5\n\nMark Carney, “Uncertainty, the Economy and Policy,” Bank of England, June 30, 2016.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Five Points About Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSveriges Riksbank Conference on Rethinking the Central Bank’s Mandate\nStockholm, Sweden\nJune 4, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Stefan Ingves and Anders Vredin for inviting me to participate in this conference on the central\nbank’s mandate. It seems very fitting that such a discussion should take place in Sweden, as the Riksbank\nis considered to be the oldest central bank in the world, only a couple of years shy of 350 years old. The\nFederal Reserve, which recently marked its 100th anniversary, is quite a youngster by comparison,\nalthough the Fed has endured considerably longer than the first two attempts at central banks in the U.S.,\neach of which lasted only 20 years.\n\nSince the 2008 global financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed, economists and\npolicymakers have been evaluating the factors that led to the crisis, assessing what could have been done\nto prevent, or at least limit, the damage, and considering what can and should be done to reduce the\nprobability and impact of future disruptions to financial stability. That this is a very broad topic can\neasily be seen by looking at the agendas of this and previous years’ conferences organized by the\nRiksbank. Today I will focus my remarks on the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability,\nand I’ll arrange my comments around five main points. Before I continue, I should mention that these are\nmy own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nPoint 1: Financial stability matters to central banks because the goals of monetary policy and\nfinancial stability are interconnected.\nCentral banks care about financial stability. Financial institutions are able to provide valuable credit, riskmanagement, and liquidity services to businesses and households because they are designed to take risks\nand are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial businesses. But this risk-taking and leverage raise\nthe possibility of systemic problems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real\neconomic activity, and impose significant economic costs. In fact, the Federal Reserve was established in\n\n\f2\n1913 after a series of financial panics to help promote a more stable financial system and avoid costly\nbank runs.\n\nIn my view, a central bank should care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of\nthe real economy. Volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a\ndynamic economy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something the monetary policy\nauthority should respond to. Indeed, to the extent that the word “stability” gives the impression that the\nfinancial system is static, we may want to adopt the language used in the United Kingdom and speak\nabout financial system resiliency, that is, the ability of the financial system to continue to provide the core\nfinancial services of intermediation, risk management, and payments in the face of the inevitable shocks\nthat will hit a dynamic economy.1\n\nMonetary policy mainly works through its ability to affect current and expected future interest rates;\nhowever, in certain circumstances, it also has the ability to affect risk-taking by investors and financial\ninstitutions, and thereby is linked to financial stability.2 I believe that, in general, the goals of monetary\npolicy and financial stability are complementary. For example, price stability helps businesses,\nhouseholds, and financial institutions make better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial\nsystem. And a stable financial system allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy\nthroughout the economy. I view this complementarity as similar to the complementarity between the two\nmonetary policy goals that the U.S. Congress has given to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),\nnamely, price stability and maximum employment.\n\n1\n\nSee Tucker (2015).\n\n2\n\nSee Adrian and Shin (2011) for a review of the literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.\n\n\f3\nBut during the financial crisis we learned that financial imbalances can build up even in a low-inflation\nenvironment, so that while price stability may promote financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition.\nWe also learned that financial instability can arise from nonbanks and from institutions that are solvent\nand not necessarily highly leveraged.3\n\nA large body of research has aided our understanding about how systemic risk can build up and propagate\nthrough the economy. Well before the financial crisis, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) did seminal work on\nthe important role collateral plays in lending markets. In their model, because borrowers cannot be forced\nto repay, all lending is collateralized. When the economy is performing well, the value of the collateral\nincreases, which supports further borrowing and higher output. But when a negative shock hits the\neconomy and output declines, collateral values also fall, which means borrowing falls, which depresses\noutput even further. Thus, the collateral constraint is a mechanism that amplifies and propagates the\neffects of temporary shocks on the economy.\n\nBrunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) build on the Kiyotaki and Moore model. In their model, an economic\nboom increases bank capital levels high enough so that credit is amply available to borrowers. This\nlowers the volatility of both output and asset prices. The lower volatility induces banks to increase their\nleverage and lend even more, so much so that the system is now vulnerable to a negative shock. Gorton\nand Ordoñez (2014) examine how private market activities generate endogenous accumulations of and\nsubsequent collapses in leverage. These models illustrate that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by\nthe choices of the model’s decision makers, and varies across the cycle.\n\n3\n\nFeroli, Kashyap, Schoenholtz, and Shin (2014) focus on market “tantrums,” which they define as periods in which\nrisk premiums inherent in market interest rates fluctuate widely. Using data on inflows and outflows to open-end\nmutual funds, they conclude that market tantrums can arise independently of the degree of leverage in the system.\n\n\f4\nDuring the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission\nof monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. In those circumstances, the actions taken to\nimplement monetary policy can also affect financial stability. The FOMC has acknowledged that\nnonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of very\nlow interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and by\nspurring risk-taking in a search for yield.4 Empirical work is beginning to document this effect. For\nexample, Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) use data on 23 million bank loans from the\nSpanish credit registry and find that a lower overnight policy rate induces low-capitalized banks to lend\nmore to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized banks, direct\nevidence of monetary policy’s effect on risk-taking.5\n\nThus, while I believe that, in most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are\ncomplementary, we need to recognize that, at times, actions taken to foster financial stability and those\ntaken to promote our monetary policy goals might be in conflict, at least in the short run. In the U.K., the\nFinancial Services Act recognizes this potential tradeoff and explicitly says that the Financial Policy\nCommittee is not authorized to act in a way that it feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on\nthe capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long\nterm.”6\n\nIn deciding whether to take action against a growing imbalance, policymakers need to balance the\nexpected improvement in future economic conditions against the potential cost of unduly limiting credit\n\n4\n\nThe Board of Governors discusses developments related to financial stability in its monetary policy report to\nCongress. For example, see Board of Governors (2016), p. 20.\n5\n\nJiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) separately identify how a change in the monetary policy rate affects\nthe demand for credit and the volume and composition of credit supplied, in particular, the supply to riskier\nborrowers.\n6\n\nSee Section 9c(4) of the U.K.’s Financial Stability Act 2012.\n\n\f5\nextension. Too high a resilience standard will thwart risk-taking and innovation, which will undermine\nlonger-run economic growth. In setting the standard, we need to come to some common understanding\nabout the amount of growth and prosperity we are willing to give up in order to lower the risk to financial\nstability. In the U.S., people who are 80 years old have lived through two major financial crises (the\nGreat Depression and the 2008 crisis). Is that too many? Would we rather lower the probability of such\nan event to one every 1,000 years? What would we be willing to give up to do that?\n\nThat may be a premature question at this point. There are likely things that can be done and that are being\ndone to lower the risk to financial stability without much cost in terms of longer-run growth. If we think\nof there being a risk-return frontier relating financial stability risk to the economic return that a wellfunctioning financial system can provide, then it isn’t hard to imagine that we were operating at a point\nwell interior to that frontier in the run-up to the crisis, and that the improvements being made in our\nfinancial regulatory and supervisory regime are moving us toward the frontier without sacrificing growth.\nThis brings me to my second point.\n\nPoint 2: To foster the resiliency of the financial system, macroprudential tools are being developed\nto lower the probability that instability arises and to limit the damage when financial shocks arise.\nIn the U.S., the regulatory reforms engendered in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act aim to foster financial stability in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of\na financial crisis, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits\nthe financial system. Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies in\nthe U.S. were directed to augment their traditional microprudential approach, which promotes the safety\nand soundness of individual institutions, with a macroprudential approach in which examiners and\nsupervisors take a horizontal view of risk across institutions rather than looking at only one institution at a\ntime.\n\n\f6\nAlthough there is still more to be done, regulators continue to make progress in developing tools to\nimplement the macroprudential approach and to monitor the risks over the business and financial cycles.\nSome tools focus on building up the structural resiliency of the financial system throughout the business\ncycle. In my view, these structural resiliency tools are the most promising. They include the Basel III\nrisk-based capital requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, central clearing for derivatives, and\nbank stress tests. Living-will resolution plans and the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which is housed at\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), are intended to make it easier for regulators and\npolicymakers to allow large complex financial institutions to fail.\n\nIn addition to structural tools, there are countercyclical tools that aim to mitigate the systemic risk that can\nbuild up over the business cycle. These include the countercyclical capital buffer and the capital\nconservation buffer.7 Other possible cyclical tools, not yet established in the U.S. but used in other\ncountries, include loan-to-value ratio limits and debt-to-income ratio limits that vary over the cycle and\nwhich have been targeted to particular sectors like housing credit or household credit.8\n\nThe performance of the set of macroprudential tools is largely untested. Cross-country studies find mixed\nresults, with the effectiveness of the tools varying with economic circumstances and the types of shocks\n\n7\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer allows regulators to increase risk-based capital requirements when credit growth\nis judged to be excessive and leading to rising systemic risk. The capital conservation buffer ensures that banks\nraise capital above regulatory minimums in good times so that when they cover losses in bad times, their capital\nratio will stay at or above the regulatory minimum.\n8\n\nFor example, Canada tightened loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits on mortgage lending over the 2009 to 2012\nperiod (Krznar and Morsink, 2014). Beginning in 2010, Israel also implemented a package of macroprudential tools\nto restrict the supply of housing credit (Fischer, 2014). Spain introduced dynamic loan-loss provisioning in 2000.\nThis method builds up reserves during good economic times according to the historical losses experienced by the\nasset classes held in the bank’s portfolio. This buffer is then available to absorb losses in bad times (Balla and\nMcKenna, 2009).\n\n\f7\nhitting the financial sector.9\n\nIn the U.S., the application of these countercyclical tools is complicated by the complexity of the\nregulatory structure. There are multiple financial regulators in the U.S., including the Federal Reserve,\nthe FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Association, the U.S.\nTreasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In many cases, the\nregulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by instrument. While\nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), created by the Dodd-Frank Act, promotes coordination\nand information sharing across these financial system regulators, the need to coordinate countercyclical\nmacroprudential policy actions across multiple regulators in the U.S. adds a complication to effectively\nusing such tools in a timely way.\n\nThe complex financial system also makes monitoring risks more complicated. The Office of Financial\nResearch, established under Dodd-Frank, is collecting data to aid in this task. The Federal Reserve has\nalso developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, and financial stability surveillance is\nreceiving regular attention in FOMC meetings.10 This regular and systematic analysis is helping us to\n\n9\n\nFor example, a study by economists at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) examined the effectiveness of\nmacroprudential tools in reducing systemic risk in 49 countries. The authors concluded that many of the most\nfrequently used tools were effective in reducing the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage, but the effectiveness\ndepended on the type of shock hitting the financial sector. (See Lin, Columba, Costa, Kongsamut, Otani, Saiyid,\nWezel, and We, 2011.) Another study published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) examined 57\ncountries over a span of up to three decades and found that imposing maximum debt-service-to-income ratios can\nlimit the buildup of credit in housing markets, but maximum loan-to-value ratios were less effective, and\ninstruments like reserve and liquidity requirements focused on the supply of credit had little impact on housing\nmarkets. (See Kuttner and Shim, 2016.)\n10\n\nThis framework is described in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013), and involves tracking a standard set of financial\nsystem vulnerabilities, including the pricing of risk, leverage, maturity and liquidity transformation, and\ninterconnectedness and complexity. Recognizing the complex nature of the U.S. financial system, Federal Reserve\nstaff track these risks across four broad areas of the financial system: asset markets, the banking sector, shadow\nbanks, and the nonfinancial sector.\n\n\f8\nbetter identify changes in conditions over time. This brings me to my next point: the importance of\ntaking a systematic approach to financial stability.\n\nPoint 3: To the extent possible, policymakers should take a systematic approach in applying\nfinancial stability policy rather than relying on discretion.\nThe financial crisis underscored the important role of incentives in financial markets – not only the\nincentives of financial institutions but also those of regulators and policymakers. Time-inconsistency\nproblems and moral hazard issues are important factors that need to be considered when designing a\nframework for implementing financial stability policy. These types of problems argue for taking a\nsystematic approach in applying financial stability policy rather than relying on discretion.\n\nThe benefits of systematic monetary policy are well established. When monetary policymakers respond\nin a systematic fashion to incoming information, the public will have a better sense of how policymakers\nare likely to react to economic developments – whether those developments are anticipated or\nunanticipated – so their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment\nhelps the public make better financial and economic decisions, thereby making monetary policy more\neffective.\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which\npolicymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. Being\nsystematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems in monetary policy, whereby policymakers\nmay favor the short run over the long run. Note that by systematic policy I do not mean that monetary\npolicy will be set mechanically by a policy rule or that policymakers need to be prescient about the types\nof shocks that will hit the economy. Rather, I mean that policy will react in a systematic fashion to\neconomic developments that change the economic outlook.\n\n\f9\nA systematic approach to financial stability policy is perhaps even more important than in the case of\nmonetary policy because of the important role played by incentives. The crisis shined a bright light on\nsignificant moral hazard problems that exist in financial markets. A financial stability policymaker that is\nsystematic in how it applies its tools to promote stability will likely help tame some of the moral hazard\nproblems and also some of the time-inconsistency problems to which the regulators themselves are\nsubject.\n\nAn important tool in this regard is the resolution of insolvent financial institutions. Without a credible\nresolution method, during the crisis in the face of serious distress at a large financial firm, governments\nfaced a dilemma: either rescue the firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and\nrisk causing a cascade of other failures. The fact that policymakers had to make these decisions in the\nheat of the moment using their best judgment based on limited information didn’t help. Without a\ncredible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that even well-intentioned policymakers will be\nbiased toward bailouts. A resolution method that can be applied systematically can help alleviate this\nproblem. The living-will resolution plans and Orderly Liquidation Authority in the U.S. are promising,\nbut still untested, tools in a process that will allow large firms to fail. This, in turn, provides incentives\nfor these large, systemically important institutions to reorganize themselves in a way that reduces the risk\nthey pose to the financial system.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has become more systematic in monitoring risks across the financial\nsystem. Coupling that monitoring with the application of a resiliency standard across the entire financial\nservices landscape, including the so-called shadow banking system that was less-heavily regulated in the\npast, would limit regulatory arbitrage. As the financial crisis made clear, taking an action that pushes risk\n\n\f10\nfrom one set of institutions to another doesn’t eliminate the risk, it just moves it around, potentially to a\npart of the financial system where the risk is more difficult to monitor and control.11\n\nI acknowledge that this broad application of the resiliency standard across the financial system may be\nparticularly difficult in the U.S. with its complex regulatory structure. Still, we can devise ways to make\nthe macroprudential tools more systematic and less discretionary. Regulators could agree in advance on\nthe contingencies under which the cyclical macroprudential tools would be invoked, rather than waiting\nuntil the risks escalated before starting the process to coordinate action. For example, we can write down\na formula for a countercyclical buffer, and we can define an explicit trigger for contingent convertible\nbonds. Knowing that such policies will be systematically applied and what will trigger them may induce\nfinancial market participants to limit the buildup of risks in the first place. This underscores the\nimportance of communication, my fourth point.\n\nPoint 4: Macroprudential policy actions must be communicated in a clear way to avoid creating a\nconflict with or causing confusion over actions taken to foster monetary policy goals.\nTransparency and clear communication are hallmarks of best-practice monetary policymaking and the\nsame should be true for financial stability policymaking. Clear communication helps align the public’s\npolicy expectations, which makes monetary policy more effective. Transparency is necessary so that the\npublic and elected officials have the ability to hold monetary policymakers accountable for their\ndecisions. The Federal Reserve has been given independence in setting monetary policy, which has been\nwell documented as yielding more effective policy and better economic outcomes. But accountability\n\n11\n\nApplication of a resiliency standard would allow the type of supervision to vary appropriately by the nature of the\nsystemic risk associated with each part of the financial system. As discussed in Mester (2015), this is a component\nof the regime for financial stability advocated by Paul Tucker (2015). Several of the macroprudential tools are\nfocused on those institutions that have been deemed systemically important, including the capital surcharge for\nglobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and the U.S. stress tests for banks with more than $50 billion in\nassets.\n\n\f11\nmust go hand-in-hand with independence. So the Federal Reserve regularly communicates the basis for\nits policy decisions.\n\nA parallel can be drawn with financial stability policy. Although, in some cases, prudential supervisory\ninformation should be kept private, as a general principle, I think financial stability policymakers should\nstrive for greater transparency and more disclosure. Similarly, they should require more disclosure from\nfinancial firms so that creditors and other market participants can exert market discipline.\n\nOf course, clear communication is easier said than done. Three aspects make this even harder for\nfinancial stability policy than for monetary policy. First, the framework and tools of financial stability\npolicy are new. It will take considerable effort on the part of the financial stability policymakers to\nexplain the tools they are using and the rationale for their policy decisions. However, such\ncommunication is necessary so that the public understands when an action is being taken because of\nconcerns about financial stability rather than concerns about monetary policy goals. This would be\nparticularly true when the monetary policy authority is also responsible for taking financial stability\nactions, and if monetary policy were the tool used to address the financial stability concerns. It is worth\nconsidering whether separating decisions about financial stability from decisions about monetary policy\nwithin the central bank, perhaps by having separate committees as in the U.K., could aid communication\nand decision-making.12\n\nA second complication for effective communication of financial stability policy is timing. If effective\nmonetary policy means taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, then effective financial\nstability policy might mean taking away the punch bowl before the guests have even arrived because the\nseeds of financial instability are sown much earlier and action must be taken earlier as well. If the need\n12\n\nKohn (2015) discusses the benefits of such separation.\n\n\f12\nfor monetary policy to be forward looking is a difficult concept for the public to grasp, the need for\nfinancial stability policy to act well before there are clear signs of instability may be even more difficult\nto explain.\n\nYet a third complication to effective communication is the complexity of the financial regulatory regime\nitself.13 In my view, a sometimes overlooked lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can\ncomplicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Given the scope and everchanging nature of the financial system, regulatory complexity is, to a certain extent, unavoidable. But\nthe tradeoffs should be recognized. For example, it is reasonable to require banks to hold higher levels of\ncapital against higher-risk assets, but a system of risk weights that is overly granular and complex would\nbe counterproductive. In practice, too much complexity would make it harder for regulators to assess\ncompliance and to determine whether institutions were engaging in some practices merely as a way to\nhide risk and lower their capital requirements. If regulators have made the rules so complex that they\ncannot assess compliance, then, in practice, there are no consequences for firms that fail to meet the\nstandards. Complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the monitors. It might be worth exploring\nwhether we would be better off with a much simpler macro- and microprudential supervisory structure,\none that is easier to implement and simpler to govern and that is approximately right across various\neconomic models and states of the world even if it is never optimal in any particular model or state.\n\nOf course, we aren’t in that simpler regime. So the question is, given our current financial structure, how\nshould policy respond to emerging financial stability risks and what role should monetary policy play?\nThis question is the focus of my final point.\n\n13\n\nHaldane and Madouros (2012) discuss the benefits of a less complex financial regulatory structure and argue that\nthe complexity of the financial landscape does not call for a complex financial regulatory structure, but just the\nopposite.\n\n\f13\nPoint 5: Financial stability should not be added as another goal for monetary policy, but monetary\npolicymakers need to remain cognizant of the linkages between financial stability and monetary\npolicy goals.\nIn my view, the first line of defense against financial instability involves the tools that will make the\nstructure of the financial system less prone to crisis. These structural resiliency tools include higher\ncapital standards (including a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital\nstandards), liquidity standards, stress tests, living wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically\nimportant bank and nonbank financial institutions. Much work has been done to develop these structural\nresiliency tools, and I believe the system is in a better position to handle shocks now than it was before\nthe financial crisis.\n\nCountercyclical macroprudential tools, such as limits on loan-to-value ratios in particular markets, are\nworth further study, but at this point, I am not convinced that we have enough knowledge and experience\nwith them to use them effectively in the U.S. That consideration leads me to think that we should set\nstandards for the structural resiliency tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more\nconfidence in the countercyclical tools.\n\nWhat about using monetary policy? As I’ve discussed, monetary policy and financial stability goals and\nactions are interrelated. Very loose monetary policy increases the likelihood that financial instabilities\nwill develop, thereby increasing the likelihood that macroprudential policy tools will be needed. Tight\nmacroprudential policy can tighten financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood\nthat a monetary policy response will be needed.\n\nIn my view, monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and maximum\nemployment; financial stability should not be added as a third objective for monetary policy. First, it isn’t\nclear that monetary policy would be very effective against emerging financial stability risks. While\ninterest rates affect the fundamental value of assets, it is not clear that they affect the speculative or\n\n\f14\nbubble portion; the impact may depend on the underlying nature of the financial imbalance.14 Second,\nmonetary policy tends to be a blunt instrument, so any benefits of using it to stem financial imbalances,\nmispricing of assets, or excessive leverage need to be weighed against the economic costs in terms of\nprice stability and employment. Svensson (2016) brings some metrics to the question and concludes that\nthe costs outweigh the benefits.15\n\nWhile I don’t believe financial stability should be part of the monetary policy mandate, I do think that\nwhen we are making monetary policy decisions, we need to be cognizant of the linkages between our\nmonetary policy actions and financial stability. In the case of the housing market, which precipitated the\nlast crisis, policymakers underestimated the breadth and depth of the negative impact this would have on\nthe rest of the economy and financial system. To the extent that we misjudged the impact, there is a\nlarger potential gain to carefully monitoring financial market conditions, implementing the structural\nmacroprudential tools, and being open to taking offsetting action should imbalances develop.16\n\nIf our macroprudential tools proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks continued to grow, I\nbelieve monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. However, in this case, the blurring\nbetween financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to\nfinancial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also\nbe in jeopardy. Which brings me back to my original point: in most cases, the goals of price stability,\nmaximum employment, and financial stability are complementary.\n14\n\nFor example, in the Gali (2014) model, raising interest rates to combat a bubble can actually inflate it.\n\n15\n\nThe benefit of “leaning against the wind,” that is, running monetary policy tighter than it otherwise would be in\norder to stem emerging financial instabilities, is a reduction in the probability of entering into a financial crisis. The\ncost is worse economic conditions today and higher economic costs should the economy enter into a crisis. By\nSvensson’s (2016) metrics, these costs outweigh the small reduction in the probability of a crisis. One caveat about\nSvensson’s analysis is that it is based on a log-linear model, but we know that financial crises involve extreme states\nand non-linearities.\n16\n\nPeek, Rosengren, and Tootell’s (2015) textural analysis of the transcripts of FOMC meetings from 1982 through\n2009 suggests that the FOMC does consider financial stability when setting monetary policy.\n\n\f15\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by noting that in his 2015 presidential address to the American Finance Association,\nLuigi Zingales (2015) posed the question, “Does Finance Benefit Society?” While academics, and, I\nbelieve, central bankers, typically say “yes,” a recent survey indicates that the average American is much\nless certain.17 I am hopeful that the considerable efforts underway across the globe will change that. I\nbelieve it is our responsibility to ensure that we create and maintain a financial system that is seen by the\npublic as being beneficial, and one that truly is.\n\n17\n\nZingales (2015) cites the Chicago Booth-Kellogg School Financial Trust Index survey of a representative sample\nof about 1,000 American households, conducted by Social Science Research Solutions. Forty-eight percent of\nrespondents to the December 2014 survey said that the U.S. financial system hurts the U.S. economy, while only 34\npercent said that it benefits the U.S. economy.\n\n\f16\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring.” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series (FEDS) paper 2013-21, Divisions of Research and Statistics and\nMonetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board, March 2013.\nAdrian, Tobias, and Hyun Song Shin, “Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics,” in Handbook\nof Monetary Economics, Vol. 3a, ed. by B.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Cleveland Association for Business Economics, CFA Society Cleveland,\nand the Risk Management Association, Northern Ohio Chapter\nCleveland, OH\nApril 6, 2016\n\nPresident Mester delivered similar remarks about the national economy to the New York Association for\nBusiness Economics in New York, NY on April 1, 2016.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon and thank you for that very kind introduction. I also thank the Cleveland Association for\nBusiness Economics, CFA Society Cleveland, and the Northern Ohio chapter of the Risk Management\nAssociation for inviting me to speak today. The very first speech I gave in Cleveland as president of the\nCleveland Fed was at your organizations’ invitation. As they say, you never forget your first, and so it is\nwith great pleasure that I am back with you today. Another reason I’m happy to be here is that I believe\nan important responsibility of Federal Reserve policymakers is to share their economic perspectives with\nthe public. Congress has wisely given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in\npursuit of our statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. I say “wisely” because a body\nof research and practical experience both here and abroad show that when central banks formulate\nmonetary policy free from short-run political interference, the policy is more effective and yields better\neconomic outcomes. But to preserve that independence, the central bank must be held accountable for its\npolicy decisions. And a key component of that accountability involves policymakers providing\ninformation to the public on their evaluation of economic conditions, their outlook for the economy, and\nthe rationale for their decisions.\n\nAt its March meeting, three weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC also released a new set of economic\nprojections, something that it does four times a year. Today, I plan to discuss my outlook for the national\nand regional economy and monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nDespite the gyrations in financial markets at the start of the year, the underlying fundamentals of the U.S.\neconomy remain sound. I expect the economy to grow at a moderate pace of 2.25 to 2.5 percent this year,\nslightly above its longer-run trend and sufficient to generate further job gains and a further reduction in\n\n\f2\nthe unemployment rate this year. I anticipate that inflation will continue to move gradually up toward our\ntarget of 2 percent over time. In my view, it will be appropriate for monetary policymakers to continue to\ngradually reduce the level of accommodation this year.\n\nIn putting together my forecast for the March FOMC meeting, I incorporated the new information we had\nreceived since the December FOMC projections. Although we publish our forecasts four times a year, let\nme assure you that policymakers are constantly assessing incoming information for its implications for\nthe outlook and risks around the outlook. This information includes the official statistical releases and the\nreports we garner from talking to our boards of directors, advisory councils, and other contacts in our\nregions. It is important that our policy be “data-dependent,” meaning that policy should depend on how\neconomic and financial conditions evolve, to the extent that those conditions have implications for the\nmedium-run outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nThe focus is on the medium run because that’s the time horizon over which monetary policy affects the\neconomy. But we live in a high-frequency world. Measures of stock market volatility, like the VIX,\nattest to that. The market gyrations at the end of last year and the beginning of this year were notable.\nThe declines in global equity markets partly reflected market participants’ reassessment of the outlook for\nglobal growth, as well as their views on how effective policy actions taken abroad will be. Over the past\nmonth or so, we’ve seen some stability return to financial markets. Volatility has declined, stock prices\nhave risen, and credit risk spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed. As a result, on balance, financial\nconditions are only slightly more restrictive than they were in December.\n\nWhile less volatile than financial market indicators can be, economic data can also vary quite a bit from\nmonth to month. “Data-dependent” policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every short-run\nchange in the data – that would be a mistake. One of the challenges for monetary policymakers is making\n\n\f3\nlow-frequency policy in a high-frequency world. We need to extract the signal about where the economy\nis headed from economic and financial market information that can often be noisy.\n\nMy own forecasts tend to have some consistency over time because I try to stay focused on underlying\nfundamentals and the medium-run outlook. That said, I have made some changes to my outlook since\nDecember. Most of the changes have to do with my longer-run projections. The moderate growth of\naround 2 percent that we’ve seen during the expansion has been sufficient to generate a significant fall in\nthe unemployment rate, while inflation has remained low. Taking that evidence on board, I slightly\nmoved down my estimates of longer-run growth, the longer-run unemployment rate, and the longer-run\nfed funds rate, reducing each by 25 basis points. I now project longer-run growth at 2 percent, the longerrun unemployment rate at 5 percent, and the longer-run fed funds rate at 3.25 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\nIn terms of the forecast, as I’ve mentioned, I anticipate that growth will pick up to a 2.25 to 2.5 percent\nrange this year. That is slightly lower than my last forecast and reflects both the weakness we saw in the\nfourth quarter, which suggests that the economy entered 2016 with a little less momentum, and slightly\ntighter financial conditions, which partly reflect somewhat slower growth abroad. So far, the information\nwe have suggests that growth in the first quarter will remain near the fourth quarter’s pace of around 1.5\npercent, but there is still more information coming in.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, has been one of the economy’s\nstrengths, although it too has shown month-to-month volatility that we need to smooth through.\nConsumer spending has been buoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets; growth in\npersonal income, reflecting the progress in labor markets; and lower oil prices, as well as highly\naccommodative monetary policy that has kept borrowing rates low. The drop in gasoline prices from\n$3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42 per gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S.\n\n\f4\nEnergy Information Administration now forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.89 per gallon this\nyear, which would mean another $400 in cost savings for the average household. I believe we are seeing\na positive effect on spending from lower gasoline prices. Auto sales were particularly strong over the past\nyear, hitting a new record of nearly 17.5 million; many of these were SUVs and other larger vehicles.\nInstead of spending it, some households may be choosing to save some of the windfall from lower gas\nprices – we’ve seen the savings rate rise. Or they may be using it to pay down debt. Either way, the\nimprovement in balance sheets will help support future consumption.\n\nThe housing sector has also shown steady improvement, and I expect that to continue. Total sales of new\nand existing homes have been rising slowly over the past few years. Existing home sales have made\nconsiderable progress in approaching the average level seen before the run-up during the housing bubble,\nwhile new home sales still have some ways to go to reach that milestone. Housing starts have been\nmoving up but are still below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the\nlonger run, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn’t kept up with demand. So there is some\nchance we will see an acceleration in construction this year. Mortgage rates are low, but households are\nbeing appropriately careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are\nlending to those with good credit quality. House prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace, on a\nnational level. This has allowed households to rebuild some of the housing equity they lost during the\nhousing bust, another factor that will support consumer spending going forward.\n\nWhile residential investment has been improving, business fixed investment remains weak. The sharp\ndrop in oil prices since mid-2014 has benefitted consumers but has weighed heavily on firms in the\ndrilling and mining sector, on their suppliers, and on regions whose economies depend on the energy\nsector. Firms tied to the sector have responded by cutting jobs and reducing investment. Some firms may\nface bankruptcy or will need to merge. In the face of low oil prices, I expect this sector to feel continued\npressure.\n\n\f5\n\nManufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging\nenvironment. The dollar has appreciated around 20 percent since mid-2014. This appreciation has been a\nconsiderable drag on U.S. export growth and on manufacturing output. We can expect the dollar to\nremain strong because real growth in the U.S. is expected to exceed growth abroad, and interest rates in\nthe U.S. are expected to be higher than those in our major trading partners for some time to come.\nHowever, the rate of appreciation of the dollar has slowed, so the direct effect on U.S. net exports will\nlikely lessen over time. Indeed, after last year’s deceleration in manufacturing output, several surveys\nsuggest that manufacturing activity may be stabilizing. These include the national survey conducted by\nthe Institute for Supply Management, as well as the regional surveys conducted by the Dallas, New York,\nPhiladelphia, and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nAs this review suggests, some parts of the economy are doing better than others. But the message I take\nfrom U.S. economic performance is that despite financial market volatility, despite the pain inflicted on\nthe energy sector from falling oil prices, and despite the relatively weak growth abroad, the U.S. economy\nhas proven to be remarkably resilient.\n\nLabor Markets\nStrong evidence of this resiliency is seen in labor markets. The unemployment rate is now half of what it\nwas at its peak of 10 percent in October 2009. Over the past two years, we’ve also seen significant\nimprovement in other measures of the under-utilization of labor. The share of workers who are working\npart-time but who would prefer to work full-time has declined significantly, as has the number of people\nwho have only been looking for work sporadically or who have been discouraged from looking at all\nbecause they don’t think they’ll find a job. Since its low point last September, the labor force\n\n\f6\nparticipation rate has risen by over half of a percentage point and is now at a level consistent with\nestimates of its longer-run trend.1\n\nPayroll job growth has averaged more than 200,000 jobs per month over the past two years. And while\nthere have been ups and downs in the monthly reports – as there always are – I think it is notable that\neven as output growth slowed during the fourth quarter of last year, firms continued to add workers to\ntheir payrolls at a very good pace. The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor\nTurnover Survey, or JOLTS, show that some dynamism is returning to the labor market.2 The rate of job\nopenings is stronger than during the previous expansion, and both the hiring and quit rates have risen to\nlevels suggesting that firms are looking to hire and workers are confident enough to be looking for better\njobs.\n\nWage acceleration typically lags the improvement in labor markets, and this time is no different. Average\nhourly earnings have only slowly accelerated over the past few years, and the employment cost index,\nwhich measures total compensation, has risen at about 2 percent a year over the past three years. Some of\nthe anecdotal reports suggest that wage pressures may be building. We have heard for some time from\nemployers in our region that it has been hard to find workers with the necessary skills in certain higherskilled occupations, including information technology, health care, and specialized construction. Firms\nhave had to increase wages and benefits and offer and sweeten retention packages for these types of\nworkers. But we are now hearing increasingly from firms across the service sector that they are having\n\n1\n\nSee Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William\nWascher, “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic\nActivity, Fall 2014, pp. 197-255.\n2\n\nNote that John Haltiwanger argues that there has been a longer-run decline in labor market fluidity. See John\nHaltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” paper written for\nthe Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth conference, August 2015.\n\n\f7\ndifficulty finding workers in lower-skilled and less-specialized occupations, like bank tellers and retail\nstaff. As labor markets continue to tighten, I expect to see wages accelerate somewhat.\n\nI do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many workers have had during the recession and slow\nrecovery, and that many continue to have. For example, those who have lost jobs in the mining, oil, and\ngas sectors in Appalachia and eastern Ohio have been slow to find new work because the economies in\nthose areas are not well-diversified. I believe there are longer-run workforce development issues\naffecting U.S. labor markets, and the deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated\nthese problems. As a country, we need to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of\nthe labor force to raise our standard of living and make us more competitive in the global economy. The\nquestion is how to do that. I do not believe monetary policy would be effective in addressing these\nlonger-run problems. More than that, trying to rely on it to do so is counterproductive because it takes the\nfocus off of programs and policies that can help to prepare and sustain workers in the modern workforce.\nSo from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, the totality of the evidence suggests to me that\nthe economy is basically at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment.\nHowever, I do believe that government policy and programs, such as educational assistance and retraining\nprograms, have a role to play in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and it should be brought\nto bear.\n\nRegional Growth and Labor Markets\nAn important role of Federal Reserve Bank presidents is gathering information from our regions to help\ninform national monetary policy. For example, the anecdotal information on wages that I just mentioned\nhas been particularly useful. Let me spend a few minutes on economic developments in the Fourth\nFederal Reserve District, which comprises all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the\nnorthern panhandle of West Virginia. Our regional economy is quite diverse, but the path of economic\nexpansion here has been similar to the nation’s, with some sectors performing better than others and with\n\n\f8\nlonger-run economic challenges evident. The outlook for our regional economy is similar to that of the\nnation.\n\nThe energy sector in our region continues to feel the effects of the sharp decline in oil prices since mid2014, as well as the longer-term shift away from coal as a source of energy. The region had seen a sharp\nincrease in production and employment in the oil and gas extraction sector as new technologies were\nbrought to bear. But while natural gas production remains at historic highs, the sharp drop in oil prices\nsince mid-2014 has resulted in a significant slowdown in natural gas and oil exploration in the Marcellus\nand Utica shale regions, which include the part of our District in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.\nSuppliers and other service providers to the industry and those employed in the industry have also\nexperienced the slowdown.3\n\nRegional firms with international exposure, such as steel producers, also continue to struggle in the wake\nof dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices that reflect weak global demand. Like the nation as a\nwhole, the region’s economy has diversified over time, with jobs shifting from manufacturing to the\nservice sector. Still, manufacturing remains a relatively important sector in our region, accounting for 15\npercent of private-sector jobs in Ohio compared to about 10 percent in the U.S. While manufacturers\nwith ties to energy and steel production have faced challenges, the weakness in that segment has been\noffset by production increases at manufacturers supplying the construction industry, and by the auto\nindustry, which represents a significant share of manufacturing in Ohio and Kentucky. Over the past few\nyears, District auto plants have produced about 17 percent of the nation’s autos and light trucks, so as auto\nsales have risen to record levels, regional production has risen as well. Our contacts in the District’s auto\nsector remain optimistic even though the record sales pace seems likely to level off.\n3\n\nFor further discussion of trends in the energy, steel, and auto sectors in the Cleveland Federal Reserve District, see\nMark E. Schweitzer, Robert Sadowski, and Christopher Vecchio, “Three Trends Influencing the Region’s Growth,”\nForefront, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, January 15, 2016.\n\n\f9\n\nLike the rest of the nation, our region has seen considerable improvement in labor markets. In Ohio, the\nunemployment rate has fallen sharply from a peak of 11 percent in December 2009 to 4.9 percent in\nFebruary, about the national average. Since the start of the expansion, jobs in Ohio have been growing at\nan annual pace of 1.2 percent. Admittedly, this is slower than the nation’s 1.4 percent pace. However,\nOhio’s job growth has been well above the pace we saw during the previous expansion, when\nemployment in Ohio was essentially flat. When I last spoke before your organizations in September\n2014, employment in Ohio had not quite made it back to its pre-recession peak. There is no denying that\nit was a long time in coming, but Ohio payroll employment has finally regained its pre-recession peak.\n\nThe longer-run challenges facing national labor markets also affect the regional economy. In addition,\npopulation growth in our region has been slower than in other parts of the country. Ohio’s population has\nbeen growing at less than 0.4 percent a year over the past 5 years, about half as fast as in the nation as a\nwhole, and considerably slower than in the southern and western parts of the country. This is an\nadditional factor that will need to be considered when assessing the future outlook for regional labor\nmarkets and the overall economic health of the region.\n\nInflation\nIn addition to maximum employment, price stability is the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate. Inflation\nhas been running below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the\neffects of earlier declines in the price of oil and other commodities since mid-2014, as well as the\nappreciation of the dollar, which has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S. But the\nmost recent data have been somewhat encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the\nFOMC. As oil prices and the dollar have shown some stability of late, the headline and underlying\nmeasures of inflation have moved higher. And these moves are not just one month’s data. Headline and\ncore inflation, as measured by the year-over-year changes in the underlying indices, have been moving up\n\n\f10\nover the past year. Headline PCE inflation has risen to 1 percent from 0.2 percent at the start of last year,\nand core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent, compared to 1.3 percent a year ago. Core CPI inflation is now\nabove 2 percent. The Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate is 2.4 percent and it, too, has been rising\nover the past year.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. In my view, inflation\nexpectations have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices. Marketbased inflation compensation, which measures the difference in yields between nominal Treasury\nsecurities and Treasury inflation-protected securities, has fallen by more than the survey measures of\ninflation expectations. But movements in inflation compensation have been highly correlated with\nchanges in oil prices, and in this period of heightened market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into\nU.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based\nmeasure of inflation compensation. Various models suggest that the movements in inflation\ncompensation more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes\nin expectations.4\n\n4\n\nThe Cleveland Fed publishes estimates of inflation expectations and the inflation risk premium based on a model\nthat incorporates survey measures of inflation expectations as well as market data on nominal Treasuries and\ninflation swaps. The 5-year/5-year-forward measure of inflation expectations has been relatively stable and near 2\npercent. The data are available at www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/inflationexpectations.aspx For a discussion of this model, see Joseph Haubrich, George Pennacchi, and Peter Ritchken,\n“Inflation Expectations, Real Rates, and Risk Premia: Evidence from Inflation Swaps,” The Review of Financial\nStudies, 25, 2012, pp. 1588-1629. See also the Atlanta Fed’s macroblog discussion by Nikolay Gospodinov and\nPaula Tkac, “Are Long-Term Inflation Expectations Declining? Not So Fast, Says Atlanta Fed,” January 15, 2016.\nThe authors conclude that long-run inflation expectations remain stable and that the large correlation of marketbased inflation compensation and oil prices is due mainly to the liquidity premium on TIPS. These conclusions are\nbased on a model described in Nikolay Gospodinov and Bin Wei, “Forecasts of Inflation and Interest Rates in NoArbitrage Affine Models,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Working Paper 2016-3, February 2016, and Nikolay\nGospodinov and Bin Wei, “A Note on Extracting Inflation Expectations from Market Prices on TIPS and Inflation\nDerivatives,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, November 2015.\n\n\f11\nBased on the evidence at hand, if the real side of the economy continues to perform consistent with my\nprojections, I expect inflation to remain low this year but to gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent\nover the next couple of years. And I will continue to monitor all of the measures of inflation and inflation\nexpectations to assess whether this forecast is on track.\n\nRisks to the Forecast\nOf course, we have to recognize that the economy rarely evolves exactly as expected. The world is a\ndynamic place and the economy is hit by shocks, both positive and negative. So any economic forecast is\nsurrounded by fairly wide confidence bands, and mine is no exception. I see risks on both the downside\nand the upside around my forecast. If the dollar were to appreciate more than I’ve assumed, perhaps\nbecause of weaker growth abroad, or if there were a significant further decline in oil prices rather than a\nstabilization, then growth and inflation could be lower than in my baseline forecast. The actions taken by\nseveral foreign central banks to increase monetary accommodation to further support their economies\nmay help to mitigate some of this risk.\n\nBecause inflation has been undershooting our goal for some time, many people have quite reasonably\nbeen focusing on the downside risks to inflation. But it is also good to keep in mind that, according to\nanalysis by the Cleveland Fed staff, over the last 15 years historical forecast errors from several highly\nregarded inflation forecasting models have skewed to the upside; that is, the models have tended to\nunderestimate actual inflation.5 While the steep declines in oil prices have kept inflation low, in the\ncurrent environment, low oil prices also pose an upside risk to inflation over the medium run. They may\n\n5\n\nModels whose forecast errors skew to the upside include the Faust and Wright inflation-expectations gap model\nand the Stock and Watson unobserved components model. See Jon Faust and Jonathan H. Wright, “Forecasting\nInflation,” in Handbook of Economic Forecasting, Graham Elliott and Allan Timmermann, eds., Amsterdam:\nElsevier Press, vol. 2A, 2013, pp. 2-56, and James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson, “Why Has U.S. Inflation Become\nHarder to Forecast?” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, supplement to vol. 39, no. 1, February 2007, pp. 3-33.\n\n\f12\nspur stronger-than-expected consumer spending, and this, combined with accommodative monetary\npolicy, could lead to a faster increase in inflation than forecasted.\n\nThe intense volatility in financial markets that we saw at the end of last year and the beginning of this\nyear has subsided. But were it to intensify and be sustained, this could lead to a broader pullback in risk\nappetites among investors, businesses, and consumers, which could dampen the U.S. economy. I note,\nthough, that even during the recent turbulence we did not see this. Focusing too much on signals from\nmarket volatility is also a risk, as messages from the market can turn around quickly. It could be that if\nmarkets remain relatively stable, businesses may begin to feel more secure and investment spending may\npick up more than expected. The resiliency of the U.S. economy throughout turbulent times is worth\nremembering as we aim to set monetary policy that will promote our longer-run goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\nGiven actual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward\nour policy goals, my assessment at this time is that it will be appropriate to continue to gradually reduce\nthe degree of accommodation this year. Gradual normalization means that monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against\ndownside risks. I think that’s appropriate given some of the forces still affecting our economy – for\nexample, slow growth abroad, appreciation of the dollar, somewhat more restrictive financial conditions,\nand the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, at our March meeting the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds\nrate at ¼ to ½ percent. I did not dissent from that decision. Even though I expect it will be appropriate to\ncontinue on the path of normalization this year, I recognized that the data we had on the first quarter were\nlimited. I agreed that a reasonable case could be made to wait until more information could be gathered\n\n\f13\nand assessed to see if they confirm that the economy is evolving as anticipated – namely, resumption of\nthe moderate growth trajectory, with continued improvement in labor markets and inflation on track for a\ngradual return to 2 percent.\n\nI do not think the FOMC is behind the curve, but while there are risks to moving too soon, there are also\nrisks to waiting too long to take the next steps on the normalization path given the lags with which\nmonetary policy affects the economy. We live with uncertainty and one could always make the case that\nwe should wait to act until we gather more information. But waiting until every piece of data lines up in\nthe correct way means waiting too long and risks having to move rates up more aggressively in the future,\nwith negative impacts on our economy. Similarly, forestalling rate increases for too long in light of\nfinancial market volatility that doesn’t affect the outlook may simply produce more volatility in the future\nif we find ourselves having to increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to achieve our goals.\n\nOf course, the actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how\nthey affect the outlook. As we’ve seen over this expansion, things can take unexpected turns, and we\nwant policy to appropriately react to changes in the medium-run outlook. The policy path I foresee as\nappropriate today is slightly more gradual than the path I foresaw in December, partly because of the\nslight downward revision to my growth forecast but mainly because I now estimate a lower longer-run\nequilibrium interest rate. But these are small changes. As indicated in the March Summary of Economic\nProjections, or SEP, the other FOMC participants also currently anticipate that it will be appropriate for\nthe funds rate to move up gradually over time, with the median path across participants now slightly\nshallower than in December. The change in the path provides an excellent illustration of how our policy\nis data dependent. The important point I’d like to leave you with is that the economy has shown\nconsiderable resiliency, and in my view, the outlook and risks around the outlook will likely support\ngradual reductions in the degree of accommodation this year.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, NY\nApril 1, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. I thank Ellen Zentner and the New York Association for Business Economics for the\ninvitation to speak to you today. I believe that one of the important responsibilities of a Federal Reserve\npolicymaker is to share his or her economic perspectives with the public. Congress has wisely given the\nFed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of our statutory goals of price stability\nand maximum employment. I say “wisely” because a body of research and practical experience both here\nand abroad show that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from short-run political\ninterference, the policy is more effective and yields better economic outcomes. But to preserve that\nindependence, the central bank must be held accountable for its policy decisions. And a key component\nof that accountability involves policymakers providing information to the public on their evaluation of\neconomic conditions, their outlook for the economy, and the rationale for their decisions.\n\nAt its March meeting, about two weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee made one of those\ndecisions: it decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC\nalso released a new set of economic projections, something that it does four times a year. Today, I plan to\ndiscuss my outlook for the economy and monetary policy. In doing so, I realize I am going against the\nteachings of Laozi, the 6th century BC Chinese philosopher, who said, “Those who have knowledge,\ndon’t predict, and those who predict, don’t have knowledge.” However, I take my inspiration from a\nmore modern thinker, Henri Poincaré, the 19th century French mathematician, who said, “It is far better to\nforesee even without certainty than not to foresee at all.” Before I discuss what I foresee, I should remind\nyou that the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nDespite the gyrations in financial markets at the start of the year, the underlying fundamentals of the U.S.\neconomy remain sound. I expect the economy to grow at a moderate pace of 2.25 to 2.5 percent this year,\n\n\f2\nslightly above its longer-run trend and sufficient to generate further job gains and a further reduction in\nthe unemployment rate this year. I anticipate that inflation will continue to move gradually up toward our\ntarget of 2 percent over time. In my view, it will be appropriate for monetary policymakers to continue to\ngradually reduce the level of accommodation this year.\n\nIn putting together my forecast for the March FOMC meeting, I incorporated the new information we had\nreceived since the December FOMC projections. I know that many people in this room have to forecast\nat a much higher frequency than four times a year. Let me assure you that policymakers are also\nconstantly assessing incoming information for its implications for the outlook and risks around the\noutlook. This information includes the official statistical releases and the reports we garner from talking\nto our boards of directors, advisory councils, and other contacts in our regions. It is important that our\npolicy be “data-dependent,” meaning that policy should depend on how economic and financial\nconditions evolve, to the extent that those conditions have implications for the medium-run outlook and\nrisks around the outlook.\n\nThe focus is on the medium-run outlook because that’s the time horizon over which monetary policy\naffects the economy. But we live in a high-frequency world. Measures of stock market volatility, like the\nVIX, attest to that. The market gyrations at the end of last year and the beginning of this year were\nnotable. The declines in global equity markets partly reflected market participants’ reassessment of the\noutlook for global growth, as well as their views on how effective policy actions taken abroad will be.\nOver the past month or so, we’ve seen some stability return to financial markets. Volatility has declined,\nstock prices have risen, and credit risk spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed. As a result, on\nbalance, financial conditions are only slightly more restrictive than they were in December.\n\nWhile less volatile than financial market indicators can be, economic data can also vary quite a bit from\nmonth to month. “Data-dependent” policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every short-run\n\n\f3\nchange in the data – that would be a mistake. One of the challenges for monetary policymakers is making\nlow-frequency policy in a high-frequency world. We need to extract the signal about where the economy\nis headed from economic and financial market information that can often be noisy.\n\nMy own forecasts tend to have some consistency over time because I try to stay focused on underlying\nfundamentals and the medium-run outlook. That said, I have made some changes to my outlook since\nDecember. Most of the changes have to do with my longer-run projections. In particular, the cumulative\nevidence since I last adjusted my longer-run projections has led me to slightly move down my estimates\nof longer-run growth, the longer-run unemployment rate, and the longer-run fed funds rate, each by 25\nbasis points. My longer-run growth and unemployment rate estimates had been on the high side of\nFOMC projections. Of course, it’s important to remember that because of the considerable uncertainty\naround estimates of potential growth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the equilibrium real interest\nrate, the differences across FOMC participants’ longer-run estimates are not statistically significant, nor\nare the 25-basis-point reductions I made to my own estimates. Nonetheless, I wanted to recognize that\nthe moderate growth of around 2 percent that we’ve seen during the expansion has been sufficient to\ngenerate a significant fall in the unemployment rate, while inflation has remained low. That combination\nof moderate growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and low inflation persuaded me that it was\ntime to take the evidence on board and to move my estimates of the longer-run values down a bit. I now\nproject longer-run growth at 2 percent, the longer-run unemployment rate at 5 percent, and the longer-run\nfed funds rate at 3.25 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\nIn terms of the forecast, as I’ve mentioned, I anticipate that growth will pick up to a 2.25 to 2.5 percent\nrange this year. That is slightly lower than my last forecast and reflects both the weakness we saw in the\nfourth quarter, which suggests that the economy entered 2016 with a little less momentum, and slightly\ntighter financial conditions, which partly reflect somewhat slower growth abroad. So far, the information\n\n\f4\nwe have suggests that growth in the first quarter will remain near the fourth quarter’s pace of around 1.5\npercent, but there is still more information coming in.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, has been one of the economy’s\nstrengths, although it too has shown month-to-month volatility that we need to smooth through.\nConsumer spending has been buoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets; growth in\npersonal income, reflecting the progress in labor markets; and lower oil prices, as well as highly\naccommodative monetary policy that has kept borrowing rates low. The drop in gasoline prices from\n$3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42 per gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S.\nEnergy Information Administration now forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.89 per gallon this\nyear, which would mean another $400 in cost savings for the average household. I believe we are seeing\na positive effect on spending from lower gasoline prices. Auto sales were particularly strong over the past\nyear, hitting a new record of 17.5 million; many of these were SUVs and other larger vehicles. Instead of\nspending it, some households may be choosing to save some of the windfall from lower gas prices –\nwe’ve seen the savings rate rise. Or they may be using it to pay down debt. Either way, the improvement\nin balance sheets will help support future consumption.\n\nThe housing sector has also shown steady improvement, and I expect that to continue. Total sales of new\nand existing homes have been rising slowly over the past few years. Existing home sales have made\nconsiderable progress in approaching the average level seen before the run-up during the housing bubble,\nwhile new home sales still have some ways to go to reach that milestone. Housing starts have been\nmoving up but are still below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the\nlonger run, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn’t kept up with demand. So there is some\nchance we will see an acceleration in construction this year. Mortgage rates are low, but households are\nbeing appropriately careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are\nlending to those with good credit quality. House prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace, on a\n\n\f5\nnational level. This has allowed households to rebuild some of the housing equity they lost during the\nhousing bust, another factor that will support consumer spending going forward.\n\nWhile residential investment has been improving, business fixed investment remains weak. The sharp\ndrop in oil prices since mid-2014 has benefitted consumers but has weighed heavily on firms in the\ndrilling and mining sector, on their suppliers, and on regions whose economies depend on the energy\nsector. Firms tied to the sector have responded by cutting jobs and reducing investment. Some firms may\nface bankruptcy or will need to merge. In the face of low oil prices, I expect this sector to feel continued\npressure.\n\nManufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging\nenvironment. The dollar has appreciated around 20 percent since mid-2014. This appreciation has been a\nconsiderable drag on U.S. export growth and on manufacturing output. We can expect the dollar to\nremain strong because real growth in the U.S. is expected to exceed growth abroad, and interest rates in\nthe U.S. are expected to be higher than those in our major trading partners for some time to come.\nHowever, the rate of appreciation of the dollar has slowed, so the direct effect on U.S. net exports will\nlikely lessen over time. Indeed, after last year’s deceleration in manufacturing output, several surveys\nsuggest that manufacturing activity may be stabilizing. These include the national survey conducted by\nthe Institute for Supply Management, as well as the regional surveys conducted by the Dallas, New York,\nPhiladelphia, and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nAs this review suggests, some parts of the economy are doing better than others. But the message I take\nfrom U.S. economic performance is that despite financial market volatility, despite the pain inflicted on\nthe energy sector from falling oil prices, and despite the relatively weak growth abroad, the U.S. economy\nhas proven to be remarkably resilient.\n\n\f6\nLabor Markets\nStrong evidence of this resiliency is seen in labor markets. The unemployment rate is now about half of\nwhat it was at its peak of 10 percent in October 2009. Over the past two years, we’ve also seen\nsignificant improvement in other measures of the under-utilization of labor. The share of workers who\nare working part-time but who would prefer to work full-time has declined significantly, as has the\nnumber of people who have only been looking for work sporadically or who have been discouraged from\nlooking at all because they don’t think they’ll find a job. Since its low point last September, the labor\nforce participation rate has risen by half of a percentage point and is now at a level consistent with\nestimates of its longer-run trend. 1\n\nPayroll job growth has averaged more than 200,000 jobs per month over the past two years. And while\nthere have been ups and downs in the monthly reports – as there always are – I think it is notable that\neven as output growth slowed during the fourth quarter of last year, firms continued to add workers to\ntheir payrolls at a very good pace. The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor\nTurnover Survey, or JOLTS, show that some dynamism is returning to the labor market. 2 The rate of job\nopenings is stronger than during the previous expansion, and both the hiring and quit rates have risen to\nlevels suggesting that firms are looking to hire and workers are confident enough to be looking for better\njobs.\n\nWage acceleration typically lags the improvement in labor markets, and this time is no different. Average\nhourly earnings have only slowly accelerated over the past few years, and the employment cost index,\n\n1\n\nSee Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William\nWascher, “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic\nActivity, Fall 2014, pp. 197-255.\n2\n\nNote that John Haltiwanger argues that there has been a longer-run decline in labor market fluidity. See John\nHaltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” paper written for\nthe Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth conference, August 2015.\n\n\f7\nwhich measures total compensation, has risen at about 2 percent a year over the past three years. Some of\nthe anecdotal reports suggest that wage pressures may be building. We have heard for some time from\nemployers in our region that it has been hard to find workers with the necessary skills in certain higherskilled occupations, including information technology, health care, and specialized construction. Firms\nhave had to increase wages and benefits and offer and sweeten retention packages for these types of\nworkers. But we are now hearing increasingly from firms across the service sector that they are having\ndifficulty finding workers in lower-skilled and less-specialized occupations, like bank tellers and retail\nstaff. As labor markets continue to tighten, I expect to see wages accelerate somewhat.\n\nI do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many workers have had during the recession and slow\nrecovery, and that many continue to have. For example, in my region, those who have lost jobs in the\nmining, oil, and gas sectors in Appalachia and eastern Ohio have been slow to find new work because the\neconomies in those areas are not well-diversified. I believe there are longer-run workforce development\nissues affecting U.S. labor markets, and the deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and\nexacerbated these problems. As a country, we need to ensure that people can enter and remain productive\nmembers of the labor force to raise our standard of living and make us more competitive in the global\neconomy. The question is how to do that. I do not believe monetary policy would be effective in\naddressing these longer-run problems. More than that, trying to rely on it to do so is counterproductive\nbecause it takes the focus off of programs and policies that can help to prepare and sustain workers in the\nmodern workforce. So from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, the totality of the evidence\nsuggests to me that the economy is basically at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum\nemployment. However, I do believe that government policy and programs, such as educational assistance\nand retraining programs, have a role to play in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and it\nshould be brought to bear.\n\n\f8\nInflation\nPrice stability is the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s goal\nof 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the price of\noil and other commodities since mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down\nthe prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S. But the most recent data have been somewhat\nencouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the FOMC. As oil prices and the dollar have\nshown some stability of late, the headline and underlying measures of inflation have moved higher. And\nthese moves are not just one month’s data. Headline and core inflation, as measured by the year-overyear changes in the underlying indices, have been moving up over the past year. Headline PCE inflation\nhas risen to 1 percent from 0.2 percent at the start of last year, and core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent,\ncompared to 1.3 percent a year ago. Core CPI inflation is now above 2 percent. The Cleveland Fed’s\nmedian CPI inflation rate is 2.4 percent and it, too, has been rising over the past year.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. In my view, inflation\nexpectations have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices. Marketbased inflation compensation, which measures the difference in yields between nominal Treasury\nsecurities and Treasury inflation-protected securities, has fallen by more than the survey measures of\ninflation expectations. But movements in inflation compensation have been highly correlated with\nchanges in oil prices, and in this period of heightened market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into\nU.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based\nmeasure of inflation compensation. Various models suggest that the movements in inflation\ncompensation more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes\n\n\f9\nin inflation expectations. 3\n\nBased on the evidence at hand, if the real side of the economy continues to perform consistent with my\nprojections, I expect inflation to remain low this year but to gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent\nover the next couple of years. And I will continue to monitor all of the measures of inflation and inflation\nexpectations to assess whether this forecast is on track.\n\nRisks to the Forecast\nOf course, we have to recognize that the economy rarely evolves exactly as expected. The world is a\ndynamic place and the economy is hit by shocks, both positive and negative. So any economic forecast is\nsurrounded by fairly wide confidence bands, and mine is no exception. I see risks on both the downside\nand the upside around my forecast. If the dollar were to appreciate more than I’ve assumed, perhaps\nbecause of weaker growth abroad, or if there were a significant further decline in oil prices rather than a\nstabilization, then growth and inflation could be lower than in my baseline forecast. The actions taken by\nseveral foreign central banks to increase monetary accommodation to further support their economies\nmay help to mitigate some of this risk.\n\n3\n\nThe Cleveland Fed publishes estimates of inflation expectations and the inflation risk premium based on a model\nthat incorporates survey measures of inflation expectations as well as market data on nominal Treasuries and\ninflation swaps. The 5-year/5-year-forward measure of inflation expectations has been relatively stable and near 2\npercent. The data are available at www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/inflationexpectations.aspx. For a discussion of this model, see Joseph Haubrich, George Pennacchi, and Peter Ritchken,\n“Inflation Expectations, Real Rates, and Risk Premia: Evidence from Inflation Swaps,” The Review of Financial\nStudies, 25, 2012, pp. 1588-1629. See also the Atlanta Fed’s macroblog discussion by Nikolay Gospodinov and\nPaula Tkac, “Are Long-Term Inflation Expectations Declining? Not So Fast, Says Atlanta Fed,” January 15, 2016.\nThe authors conclude that long-run inflation expectations remain stable and that the large correlation of marketbased inflation compensation and oil prices is due mainly to the liquidity premium on TIPS. These conclusions are\nbased on a model described in Nikolay Gospodinov and Bin Wei, “Forecasts of Inflation and Interest Rates in NoArbitrage Affine Models,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Working Paper 2016-3, February 2016, and Nikolay\nGospodinov and Bin Wei, “A Note on Extracting Inflation Expectations from Market Prices on TIPS and Inflation\nDerivatives,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, November 2015.\n\n\f10\nBecause inflation has been undershooting our goal for some time, many people have quite reasonably\nbeen focusing on the downside risks to inflation. But it is also good to keep in mind that, according to\nanalysis by the Cleveland Fed staff, over the last 15 years historical forecast errors from several highly\nregarded inflation forecasting models have skewed to the upside; that is, the models have tended to\nunderestimate actual inflation. 4 While the steep declines in oil prices have kept inflation low, in the\ncurrent environment, low oil prices also pose an upside risk to inflation over the medium run. They may\nspur stronger-than-expected consumer spending, and this, combined with accommodative monetary\npolicy, could lead to a faster increase in inflation than forecasted.\n\nThe intense volatility in financial markets that we saw at the end of last year and the beginning of this\nyear has subsided. But were it to intensify and be sustained, this could lead to a broader pullback in risk\nappetites among investors, businesses, and consumers, which could dampen the U.S. economy. I note,\nthough, that even during the recent turbulence we did not see this. Focusing too much on signals from\nmarket volatility is also a risk, as messages from the market can turn around quickly. It could be that if\nmarkets remain relatively stable, businesses may begin to feel more secure and investment spending may\npick up more than expected. The resiliency of the U.S. economy throughout turbulent times is worth\nremembering as we aim to set monetary policy that will promote our longer-run goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\nGiven actual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward\nour policy goals, my assessment at this time is that it will be appropriate to continue to gradually reduce\n\n4\n\nModels whose forecast errors skew to the upside include the Faust and Wright inflation-expectations gap model\nand the Stock and Watson unobserved components model. See Jon Faust and Jonathan H. Wright, “Forecasting\nInflation,” in Handbook of Economic Forecasting, Graham Elliott and Allan Timmermann, eds., Amsterdam:\nElsevier Press, vol. 2A, 2013, pp. 2-56, and James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson, “Why Has U.S. Inflation Become\nHarder to Forecast?” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, supplement to vol. 39, no. 1, February 2007, pp. 3-33.\n\n\f11\nthe degree of accommodation this year. Gradual normalization means that monetary policy will remain\naccommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against\ndownside risks. I think that’s appropriate given some of the forces still affecting our economy – for\nexample, slow growth abroad, appreciation of the dollar, somewhat more restrictive financial conditions,\nand the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, at our March meeting the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds\nrate at ¼ to ½ percent. I did not dissent from that decision. Even though I expect it will be appropriate to\ncontinue on the path of normalization this year, I recognized that the data we had on the first quarter were\nlimited. I agreed that a reasonable case could be made to wait until more information could be gathered\nand assessed to see if they confirm that the economy is evolving as anticipated – namely, resumption of\nthe moderate growth trajectory, with continued improvement in labor markets and inflation on track for a\ngradual return to 2 percent.\n\nI do not think the FOMC is behind the curve, but while there are risks to moving too soon, there are also\nrisks to waiting too long to take the next steps on the normalization path given the lags with which\nmonetary policy affects the economy. We live with uncertainty and one could always make the case that\nwe should wait to act until we gather more information. But waiting until every piece of data lines up in\nthe correct way means waiting too long and risks having to move rates up more aggressively in the future,\nwith negative impacts on our economy. Similarly, forestalling rate increases for too long in light of\nfinancial market volatility that doesn’t affect the outlook may simply produce more volatility in the future\nif we find ourselves having to increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to achieve our goals.\n\nOf course, the actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how\nthey affect the outlook. As we’ve seen over this expansion, things can take unexpected turns, and we\nwant policy to appropriately react to changes in the medium-run outlook. The policy path I foresee as\n\n\f12\nappropriate today is slightly more gradual than the path I foresaw in December, partly because of the\nslight downward revision to my growth forecast but mainly because I now estimate a lower longer-run\nequilibrium interest rate. But these are small changes. The important point is that the economy has\nshown considerable resiliency, and in my view, the outlook and risks around the outlook will likely\nsupport gradual reductions in the degree of accommodation this year.\n\nThe FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections\nAs indicated in the March Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, the other FOMC participants also\ncurrently anticipate that it will be appropriate for the funds rate to move up gradually over time, with the\nmedian path across participants now slightly shallower than in December. A lot of media commentary\nhas focused on this somewhat flatter policy path. To my mind, this change in the path is an excellent\nillustration of how our policy is data dependent. There were slight reductions in the participants’\neconomic projections between December and March, reflecting incoming economic information\nincluding weak fourth quarter U.S. growth, lower estimates of global growth, volatility in financial\nmarkets, and somewhat tighter financial conditions. Each participant took these developments into\naccount when revising his or her projections and the policy path the participant thought was appropriate to\nachieving those outcomes. Because there is uncertainty around each participant’s projections of growth,\nthe unemployment rate, and inflation, there is also uncertainty around the appropriate policy path. Thus,\nno one should read the median path in the SEP as a promised policy path. Policy is not on a pre-set\ncourse; the actual path of the fed funds rate will depend on the economic outlook and risks around the\noutlook. But the median policy path and changes in that path over time help to illuminate participants’\nreaction functions – how participants believe policy should systematically respond to changes in\neconomic conditions that affect the outlook.\n\nI believe the discipline of forecasting how the economy might evolve over the medium run and the\nuncertainty around the forecast is an essential part of the framework for setting monetary policy. It\n\n\f13\nprovides a useful methodology for avoiding too much focus on short-run changes in the economic data or\nvolatility in the markets. It allows us to do low-frequency policymaking in a high-frequency world. It\nforces us to consider how changes in the economic and financial data may or may not change the\nmedium-run outlook, the risks around the outlook, and the appropriate policy path. It is the construct\nthrough which our policymaking can be made systematic, yet responsive to the evolution of economic\nconditions. The outcome of this process – the projections of economic outcomes and the policy paths\nthought appropriate to achieve those outcomes – is summarized in our SEP four times a year, allowing the\npublic to better understand how the assessments of the economy and monetary policy are evolving. I\nview this as essential transparency, which is why I believe the SEP continues to be an important part of\nFOMC communications.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nSarasota, FL\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank David Kotok and his colleagues at the Global Interdependence Center for giving me the\nopportunity to speak with you this morning about economic developments and monetary policy. I am\nvery happy to be here – and not just because I left single-digit temperatures in Cleveland. No, it’s\nbecause at each GIC program I’ve attended over the years – and there have been many – I’ve always\nwalked away with some new insight or perspective with which to view the economy and policy. The\nGIC’s Central Banking Series is an important forum for discussing economic matters of global interest,\nand I am privileged to say that today’s talk is my second in the series. Last March, at the GIC’s program\nwith the Banque de France, I spoke about the journey from extraordinary monetary policy back to\nordinary monetary policy. Today, I will update you on the progress that’s been made on that journey and\nmy outlook for the economy and monetary policy. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own\nand not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions and Communications: Steps on the Normalization Path\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½\nof a percent. I supported this decision because I believe that policy, for the time being, is well-calibrated\nto the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook. The current target range had been set in\nDecember when the FOMC implemented its first change in the policy rate in 7 years and the first rate\nincrease in 9 ½ years. I supported that decision as well. December’s increase in the rate from essentially\nzero recognized the considerable progress the economy has made since the Great Recession, which\nofficially ended more than six years ago, as well as the FOMC’s outlook that the economy will improve\nfurther, supported by monetary policy that continues to be quite accommodative. The rate increase in\nDecember was a step on the path toward more normal policy, a journey that arguably began in October\n2014 when the FOMC ended its third large-scale asset purchase program, also known as quantitative\neasing, or QE3.\n\n\f2\nThe Committee has indicated that, in setting policy, it assesses both realized and expected progress\ntoward the FOMC’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The policy\ndecisions in December and January represented the outcomes of such an assessment, which encompasses\na wide range of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market\nindicators, as well as the information I and other FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in\nour regions. When the FOMC says its decisions are “data-dependent,” I view this as shorthand for this\nmore comprehensive process of parsing economic and financial information to evaluate current economic\nconditions, and then determining what that information implies about the medium-run economic outlook\nand the risks around that outlook. The medium run is the relevant time horizon for monetary policy\nbecause it takes time for monetary policy to have an effect throughout the economy.\n\nThe Evolution of Forward Guidance Toward Data Dependency\nI don’t view this “data-dependent” approach to policymaking as something new. Instead, I view it as a\nstep on the journey back from extraordinary to more ordinary monetary policymaking. You will recall\nthat one of the policy tools the FOMC used during the recession and early part of the recovery was\nexplicit forward guidance. That guidance changed over time. It began as qualitative guidance offered in\nDecember 2008 when the FOMC indicated that weak economic conditions were likely to warrant\nexceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for “some time.” This changed to calendar-date guidance in\nAugust 2011 when the FOMC said that it anticipated an exceptionally low fed funds rate at least through\nmid-2013. Guidance based on economic thresholds was offered in December 2012 when the Committee\nsaid that it anticipated that the 0-to-¼ percent target range for the fed funds rate would be appropriate at\nleast as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years\nahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored. A year later, in December\n2013, the FOMC blended state-contingent forward guidance with an element of calendar-date forward\nguidance, indicating the information it would consider in determining how long to maintain highly\naccommodative monetary policy as well as an assessment that it would likely be “well past the time that\n\n\f3\nthe unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below\nthe Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.”\n\nIn March 2014, the FOMC abandoned quantitative thresholds and moved toward the type of forward\nguidance we have today, which links the path of policy to the Committee’s assessment of both realized\nand expected progress toward its dual-mandate objectives. The guidance continued to provide a time\nelement by indicating it was likely that liftoff would not occur for “a considerable time after the asset\npurchase program ends.”\n\nAfter the purchase program ended, using it as a benchmark for guidance became less salient. In January\n2015, the FOMC replaced this benchmark and simply said it judged it could be patient in beginning to\nnormalize policy. In March, the FOMC fine-tuned this by stating the two criteria it would use to assess\nwhen it would be appropriate to make the first fed funds rate increase. These criteria were further\nimprovement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to its 2\npercent objective over the medium term. Since December’s liftoff, the Committee has continued to\nindicate that the path of policy will depend on progress toward our goals, and that while the actual path\npolicy takes will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data, the Committee’s current\nassessment is that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in\nthe federal funds rate.\n\nThis evolution in the FOMC’s forward rate guidance represents a return to more normal times. While\nexplicit forward guidance was used as a policy tool during the recession and early in the recovery, in\nmore normal times, away from the zero lower bound, I believe forward guidance should be viewed more\nas a communications device. But this step back from explicit guidance poses a challenge for the FOMC\nfor at least two reasons. First, market participants tend to like more explicit statements and less\nuncertainty. Yet, it’s appropriate for monetary policy to respond to economic developments, whether\nforeseen or not. Second, while before the Great Recession, the public had a pretty good sense of how\n\n\f4\nmonetary policy would respond to economic developments, there is likely less clarity about the Fed’s socalled reaction function now. After the great inflation of the 1970s, the FOMC became more predictable\nand systematic in how it reacted to changes in economic activity and inflation. 1 As a result, explicit\nforward guidance was rarely used. But the Great Recession required the Fed to behave in a way quite\ndistinct from its past behavior, and consequently, there is less understanding about how policymakers are\nlikely to react to incoming economic information than there was earlier.\n\nThus, in my view, an important goal of FOMC communications is to explain the rationale of our\ndecisions to the public so they will have a sense of how policy is likely to change, in response not only to\nexpected changes in economic conditions but also to unforeseen changes in conditions. I believe that the\nFOMC statements have been evolving along these lines, although there are likely further steps we could\ntake to provide more information about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance\nof policy to the economy’s actual and anticipated progress toward our dual-mandate goals. In addition to\nthe policy statement, I believe the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) can be helpful in\nilluminating the FOMC’s reaction function.\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections\nFOMC policymakers provide funds rate projections in the SEP that represent their views of appropriate\npolicy – the renowned dot plot – as well as projections of economic growth, the unemployment rate, and\ninflation that are conditional on their policy path. It’s important to note that the policy paths in the SEP\nare not policy forecasts, unlike interest rate projections in private-sector forecasts. Nonetheless, because\nthere is uncertainty around the outlook, there is also uncertainty around the FOMC’s policy path. If the\neconomy’s evolution turns out to be different from what we currently anticipate, our policy path may well\nhave to deviate from our current expectation. The policy paths in the SEP should be expected to change\n\n1\n\nFor a discussion, see John B. Taylor, “Monetary Policy During the Past 30 Years with Lessons for the Next 30\nYears,” luncheon address at the Cato Institute’s 30th Annual Monetary Conference on Money, Markets and\nGovernment: The Next 30 Years, Washington, D.C., November 15, 2012.\n\n\f5\nover time as the outlook changes. I don’t view this as problematic – we want policy to respond\nappropriately to changes in the outlook. Thus, the actual path normalization takes could very well turn\nout to be either less gradual or more gradual than what we anticipate it to be today.\n\nThe last SEP projections were released in December; the next set of projections will be released at our\nMarch FOMC meeting. The evolution of the dot plot in the SEP over meetings to come will provide the\npublic with information on how participants think monetary policy should appropriately respond to\nchanges in the outlook that reflect economic developments. I think the SEP will be particularly helpful in\nMarch given the global economic and financial developments we’ve seen since our last set of projections.\n\nThe FOMC’s policy statement in January made it clear that the Committee is closely monitoring these\ndevelopments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of\nrisks to the outlook. I certainly will use the time between now and the March meeting to continue to\ngather information from contacts in the Fourth Federal Reserve District about economic developments\naffecting businesses, customers, and households; to look at the details of the official economic statistical\nreleases and financial market indicators; and to consider the results from the economic models and\nforecasts developed by the Cleveland Fed’s staff as well as those of other economists. I will walk into\nthe March FOMC meeting with my own assessment of the medium-run outlook for the U.S. economy and\nrisks around the outlook, but I will want to hear the views of others around the table who may or may not\nshare my views based on their own analysis. By design, the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a\nmosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. This regional information,\nalong with national data and analysis, plays an important role in setting national monetary policy. The\neconomic developments we’ve seen since the beginning of the year will be part of the discussion, so let’s\nturn to those now.\n\n\f6\nThe Economy\nAccording to the first estimate, real GDP growth slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of last year, to\nan annualized growth rate of only 0.7 percent, down from an average pace of about 3 percent in the\nsecond and third quarters. A decline in net exports and a reduced pace of inventory investment were the\nmain drags on growth last quarter, but nonresidential investment also declined. In contrast, consumer\nspending and residential investment held up well. So, one question is whether the softness seen last\nquarter will persist. Another question is whether the recent financial market volatility and decline in oil\nprices are signaling a material change in the medium-run outlook.\n\nMarket Volatility\nThe declines in global equity markets since the beginning of the year partly reflect market participants’\nreassessment of the outlook for growth in China and their views on whether policy actions undertaken by\nChinese policymakers will be effective in fostering growth there. China is undergoing a longer-run\nstructural transition from an economy driven by trade to one more dependent on domestic consumption\ngrowth, and these kinds of structural changes can be challenging and long lasting. Over the past couple of\ndecades, we have seen some of those challenges play out on a much smaller scale at the regional level in\nthe U.S. as industrial states have transitioned from manufacturing-based economies to more diversified\neconomies.\n\nAs it relates to U.S. growth, the direct trade ties between the U.S. economy and China are not very strong:\nExports to China represent 7 to 8 percent of total U.S. exports and total U.S. exports are about 12 to 13\npercent of U.S. GDP. So the direct effect of trade with China on U.S. output is small. Of course, some\nU.S. industries and regions of the country are more exposed to international developments via trade than\nothers, and because many emerging economies are considerably more dependent on trade with China, the\nimplications of developments in China for the global economy need to be considered.\n\n\f7\nIn addition to the decline in stock prices, we have seen another sharp decline in oil prices since the\nbeginning of the year. In part, this reflects the same reassessment of global growth prospects affecting the\nstock market. But supply-side factors are also very important. Worldwide oil inventories remain high\nand oil production has not been as responsive as one might have thought, given the declines in oil prices\nseen over the past 18 months. This means that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than\npreviously anticipated, as it is taking longer for supply to rebalance with demand.\n\nAt this point, I see the market volatility and sharp drop in oil prices as posing risks to the forecast, but I\nbelieve it is premature to conclude they necessitate a material change in my modal economic outlook.\nWhile there is a possibility that a steeper, more persistent drop in equity markets could lead to a broader\nand more persistent pullback in risk-taking and credit extension, with spillovers to the broader economy,\nso far we have not seen this. Solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, and healthy\ngrowth in real disposable income suggest that underlying U.S. economic fundamentals remain sound. I\ncontinue to monitor developments, but until I see further evidence to the contrary, my current expectation\nis that the U.S. economy will work through this episode of market turbulence and the soft patch of\neconomic data to regain its footing for moderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors\nremain challenged.\n\nConsumer Spending, Housing, and Credit\nConsistent with this view, January’s advance retail sales report suggests that consumer spending, which\nmakes up about two-thirds of output, started the year on a strong note, rebounding from a somewhat\nsofter reading in December. Sales gains were broad-based, including those of motor vehicles, which have\nbeen particularly strong over the past year. The relative strength in the consumer sector shouldn’t be too\nmuch of a surprise because it is based on sound economic fundamentals. Consumer spending has been\nbuoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in personal income, which\nreflects the progress in labor markets, and lower oil prices.\n\n\f8\nAmidst highly volatile markets, stock prices were little changed, on net, in 2015, and are down since the\nstart of this year. But the cumulative increase in stock prices since the financial crisis ended is still\nsignificant. Similarly, house prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace over the past couple of years,\nallowing households to rebuild their housing equity. Housing has been slowly recovering for some time.\nHousing starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer\nrun. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than\nthey can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. These factors are supportive of\nhousing continuing to make a positive contribution to growth and of households continuing to build their\nhousing equity.\n\nIn the aggregate, households lost $13 trillion in net worth during the Great Recession, but the\ndeleveraging that households undertook, coupled with the cumulative increase in stock and house prices\nover the expansion, means that households have recovered that loss and have added an additional nearly\n$18 trillion in net worth to their balance sheets.\n\nBank balance sheets have also improved considerably, and lending, which supports economic growth, is\nrising. The proportion of loans that are nonperforming, delinquency rates, and default rates have all been\ndeclining and, outside of the real estate portfolio, are back to pre-crisis levels. At the same time, capital\nratios and loan-loss reserves are rising, so that banks generally are in a considerably better position to\nhandle future losses should they arise. Although risk premia have increased, especially on higher-yield\nbonds, credit for higher-quality borrowers remains available to support growth.\n\nThe fact that consumer lending is rising is an indication that, in general, consumers are feeling pretty\npositive about their earnings prospects. This is a very reasonable view, reflecting the cumulative progress\nthat has been made in the labor market.\n\n\f9\nLabor Markets\nIt is good to remember how far we have come. Over the past six years, the unemployment rate has been\nmore than halved, falling from a high of 10 percent in October 2009 to 4.9 percent in January. Other\nmeasures of underutilization of labor have also improved significantly over the past few years, although\nthey are not quite back to pre-recession levels. These measures include the long-term unemployment rate,\nas well as the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and part-time workers who would\nrather work full-time. Nonfarm payrolls are now more than 4 ¾ million above their previous peak before\nthe Great Recession. Last year, the economy added about 2 ¾ million jobs, an average pace of nearly\n230,000 per month. Solid labor market performance continued into this year. Firms added 151,000 jobs\nin January. While this was somewhat fewer than the average monthly increase last year, it is\nconsiderably more than the 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month that economists currently estimate would be\nenough to keep the unemployment rate constant. I continue to expect that growth this year will be\nsufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets. I wouldn’t be surprised if the pace of\njob gains slowed somewhat, based on demographics and the stage of the business cycle, but the gains\nshould be strong enough to put additional downward pressure on the unemployment rate and support\nbroader acceleration in wages.\n\nI do not want to underplay the significant longer-run challenges the country faces in the labor market.\nUnemployment rates among minorities have been chronically higher than those for whites. The structural\ntransition of our economy from one based on traditional manufacturing to one encompassing high-tech\nmanufacturing and services has also created demand for different skill sets, thereby requiring workers to\nincrease their human capital. 2 The difference in wages between those with a college degree and those\nwithout, the so-called skill premium, has widened substantially over time, more than doubling since the\n\n2\n\nFor further discussion, see Loretta J. Mester, “Community Development and Human Capital,” remarks at the 2015\nPolicy Summit on Housing, Human Capital, and Inequality, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland,\nPhiladelphia, and Richmond, Pittsburgh, PA, June 19, 2015.\n\n\f10\n1970s. 3 This skill premium is inducing people to increase their skills, often taking on student debt to do\nso. Enrollments in college are near historic highs, but non-completion rates are also quite high. 4 So\nwhile the proportion of 25-year-olds with college degrees has moved up from 25 to 30 percent over the\npast 15 years, by this metric, the U.S. is now ranked only 12th among developed nations. 5\n\nThese developments pose difficult challenges. As a country, we need to ensure that people can enter and\nremain productive members of the modern labor force, to raise our standards of living and to make us\nmore competitive in the global economy. The question is how to do that. I do not believe monetary\npolicy would be effective in addressing these longer-run problems and leaning on it to try to do so can be\ncounterproductive. It takes the focus off of programs and policies that are better suited to addressing\nthese issues. From the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, in my view the totality of evidence\nsuggests that the economy is at or very nearly at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum\nemployment. However, I do believe there is a role for government policy and that it should be brought to\nbear on these challenges. There is evidence of positive externalities from education. Less-educated\nworkers appear to benefit in the form of higher wages from working in areas populated with moreeducated workers. 6 And cities with more highly educated populations experience lower unemployment\nrates, higher productivity growth, and higher growth in entrepreneurship than what would have been\n3\n\nMedian hourly wages for those with a bachelor’s degree are now about 80 percent higher than wages for high\nschool graduates. (See Jonathan James, “The College Wage Premium,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nEconomic Commentary, August 2012.) Over a lifetime, in present value terms, a college graduate can expect to earn\nnearly twice as much as a high school graduate. (See Kartik Athreya and Janice Eberly, “The College Premium,\nCollege Noncompletion, and Human Capital Investment,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Working Paper 1302R, February 2015.)\n4\n\nAccording to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, only about 55 percent of students who start\ncollege earn bachelor’s degrees within five years. (See Digest of Education Statistics, table 302.60 for enrollment\nrates (http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_302.60.asp) and table 326.10 for completion rates\n(http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_326.10.asp).)\n5\n\nSee p. 57 of Robert J. Gordon, “Secular Stagnation: A Supply-Side View,” American Economic Review: Papers\nand Proceedings 5, May 2015, pp. 54-59.\n\n6\n\nEnrico Moretti estimated spillovers from college education by comparing wages for similar individuals who work\nin cities that differ by the proportion of college graduates in their labor force, being careful to consider unobserved\ndifferences in the individuals and the cities. He found that each percentage point increase in the share of college\ngraduates between 1980-1990 was associated with 1.6 percent higher wages of high school graduates and 0.4\npercent higher wages of college graduates. See Moretti, “Estimating the Social Return to Higher Education:\nEvidence from Longitudinal and Repeated Cross-Sectional Data,” Journal of Econometrics 121, 2004, pp. 175-212.\n\n\f11\npredicted by considering only the educational levels of individuals. 7 The positive externalities suggest we\nare under-investing in education from society’s viewpoint and that appropriately constructed government\npolicies and programs can be a valuable investment for the country to undertake.\n\nOil Prices\nIn addition to improved balance sheets and earning prospects, lower oil prices are a third factor that will\ncontinue to support consumer spending in the U.S., even as it continues to weigh heavily on the U.S.\nenergy and manufacturing sectors. The drop in gasoline prices from $3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42\nper gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.98 per gallon this year, which would mean\nanother $300 in cost savings for the average household. Households may be choosing to spend some of\nthis gain – we’ve seen this already in high sales of SUVs and other larger vehicles – or they may be\nchoosing to save some of this gain – we’ve seen the savings rate rise – and these savings will help support\nfuture consumption.\n\nOf course, there is a downside to the lower energy prices, too, for both growth and inflation. The drop in\noil and other commodity prices has weighed heavily on firms in the drilling and mining sector, and on\ntheir suppliers, and these firms have responded by cutting jobs and reducing investment. Some firms may\nface bankruptcy or will need to merge. I expect firms in these sectors to face continued pressure.\nManufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging\nenvironment. The dollar has appreciated more than 20 percent since mid-2014, reflecting the expectation\nthat real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as projected interest\nrate differentials between the U.S. and foreign economies. A stronger dollar means better terms of trade\nfor U.S. consumers and businesses, which is a positive for a growing economy in the longer run. But in\n7\n\nSee Edward L. Glaeser, Giacomo A.M. Ponzetto, and Kristina Tobio, “Cities, Skills, and Regional Change,”\nRegional Studies 48, 2014, pp. 7-43, and the discussion in Lisa Nelson and Francisca Richter, “The Prospects of\nNon-College Bound Workers in the Fourth District,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland A Look Behind the\nNumbers, February 2014.\n\n\f12\nthe near term, this appreciation has been a considerable drag on U.S. export growth. Should economic\ngrowth in our trading partners weaken, this would put further strains on U.S. exports. I expect that net\nexports will be a negative influence on real GDP growth for some time to come.\n\nInflation\nThe latest round of oil price declines means headline inflation will remain lower for longer than I\npreviously thought. Inflation has been running below the Fed’s 2 percent goal for quite some time.\nHeadline inflation, measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, was 0.6 percent in December, and core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices,\nwhich tend to be volatile, was 1.4 percent. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of declines in oil\nprices and other commodity prices since mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has\nheld down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S.\n\nWhile headline inflation is likely to remain low in the near term, I still think a reasonable forecast is that\ninflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the medium run. I can point to a couple of things to\nsupport this view. First, measures of underlying inflation, like the core, the trimmed mean, and the\nCleveland Fed’s median CPI, are higher than headline inflation. They have remained relatively stable\ndespite the continuing sharp drop in the prices of oil and other commodities and the appreciation of the\ndollar we’ve seen over the past 18 months.\n\nIn my view, longer-run inflation expectations, an important factor in the inflation forecast, have also been\nrelatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices, which, according to analysis by the\nCleveland Fed staff, account for much of the movement in longer-run inflation expectations. 8 I take less\nof a signal from the downward moves in market-based measures of inflation compensation, because\n\n8\n\nSee Randal J. Verbrugge and Amy Higgins, “Do Energy Prices Drive the Long-Term Inflation Expectations of\nHouseholds?” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Trends, March 24, 2015.\n\n\f13\nestimates suggest that these more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather\nthan changes in inflation expectations.\n\nOil prices cannot continue to decline indefinitely, nor can the dollar continue to appreciate forever. At\nsome point, both will regain some stability and the effect of previous changes on inflation will dissipate.\nIn fact, we saw those dynamics play out toward the end of last year when oil prices and the value of the\ndollar had begun to stabilize, and the underlying inflation measures began to firm. When oil prices and\nthe dollar both regain some stability, and with inflation expectations remaining stable and economic\ngrowth continuing, it is reasonable to expect that inflation will move back slowly to 2 percent; it just\nmight take a bit longer now, given the most recent decline in oil prices.\n\nMonetary Policy\nOf course, going forward, it will be important to continue to monitor inflation developments, in particular\ninflation expectations, as well as economic developments both here and abroad. We want to set the path\nof policy based on an outlook informed by economic developments, a path that will best achieve our\nlonger-run objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Given my outlook that the economy\nwill work through this rough patch and resume a trajectory of moderate growth, with continued\nimprovement in labor markets and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent, I believe the appropriate\npolicy path will involve gradual reductions over time in the extraordinary level of accommodation that\nwas necessary to address the Great Recession. Even as policy gradually normalizes, it will likely need to\nremain accommodative for some time to come, given some of the forces still impacting our economy –\nfor example, slow growth abroad, dollar appreciation, more restrictive financial conditions, and the\ncontinued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nThe actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how they affect\nthe outlook. As we’ve seen, things can take unexpected turns. Our economic forecasting models are, by\nnecessity, simplifications. The economy is dynamic and can be hit by various shocks that might lead to\n\n\f14\nchanges in the medium-run outlook for employment and inflation to which policy would want to respond\nin a systematic fashion in order to promote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIt is good to remember that confidence bands around economic forecasts tend to be wide. I wish we were\nable to forecast with more precision – economists are working on it – but unfortunately the state of the\nscience, or perhaps I should say the state of the art, isn’t there yet. For example, averaging across several\nmodels, the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or\nminus 1 percentage point; the confidence band around a forecast of short-term interest rates one year out\nis of similar magnitude. When the FOMC releases its projections, some observers tend to focus on the\ndispersion across FOMC participants. But this dispersion is actually pretty modest compared to the\nuncertainty around the projections.\n\nBut just because we cannot forecast the future with as much precision as we’d like does not mean the\nexercise is without value. The discipline of forecasting how the economy might evolve over the medium\nrun and assessing the uncertainty around the forecast is an essential part of the framework for setting\nmonetary policy. It provides a useful methodology to help policymakers avoid focusing too much on\nshort-run changes in the economic data or volatility in the markets. It forces one to consider how those\nchanges in the economic and financial data may or may not change the medium-run outlook, the risks\naround the outlook, and the appropriate policy path. It is the construct through which our policymaking\ncan be made systematic, yet responsive to changes in economic conditions. The outcome of this process\nis communicated in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is why I view the SEP as an\nimportant part of FOMC communications, one that will continue to serve us well as we continue on the\njourney toward more normal monetary policy.\n\n\f"

        "content": "A Monetary Policymaker’s Lexicon\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMarket News International\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 4, 2016\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nThank you for the invitation to present some remarks and to participate in what I am sure will be an\ninteresting question and answer session to follow. I say “interesting” because over the 18 months in\nwhich I’ve served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, I find that whenever I present\nremarks, I learn a lot from the questions posed by the audience – most likely, more than they learn from\nme. I view the exchange of ideas with the public as one of a Fed president’s duties, but it has also turned\nout to be one of its pleasures.\n\nAnother pleasure of mine is serving on the Federal Open Market Committee’s Subcommittee on\nCommunications. The Federal Reserve has worked over many years to improve its communications with\nthe public and to increase transparency. This work is gratifying but it is also challenging. One of the\nchallenges is trying to explain policy decisions and the rationale behind those decisions, which can be\nquite complex. In a world in which every word of the FOMC is scrutinized, those of us on the\nCommittee try to be very careful with our language. But at times, this can make us seem somewhat\ninscrutable. So today I would like to give you my own interpretation of four expressions that have\nbecome part of the lexicon of monetary policymakers. These phrases are: data dependent, gradual\nnormalization, well underway, and symmetric inflation goal. Before proceeding, let me emphasize that\nthis is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the lingo monetary policymakers use; if I tried to do that,\nwe would be here all night and never get to the Q&A portion of the program. Let me also emphasize that\nthese are my views and interpretations, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the FOMC.\n\n“Data Dependent”\nThe FOMC has described its monetary policy decisions as being “data dependent.” At its January\nmeeting held last week, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at one\nquarter to one half of a percent. This target was set in December when the FOMC implemented its first\nchange in the policy rate in 7 years and the first rate increase in 9-1/2 years. December’s increase in the\n\n\f2\nrate from essentially zero recognized the considerable progress the economy has made since the Great\nRecession, which officially ended more than six years ago, and the FOMC’s outlook that the economy\nwill improve further, supported by monetary policy that continues to be quite accommodative.\n\nThe Committee has indicated that, in setting policy, it assesses both realized and expected progress\ntoward the FOMC’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The decision to\nmaintain the target range in January, just as the decision to raise it in December, represents the outcome\nof such an assessment. This assessment encompasses a wide range of economic information – the official\neconomic statistical releases and financial market indicators, as well as the information I and other FOMC\nparticipants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions. When the FOMC says its decisions are\n“data-dependent,” I view this as shorthand for this more comprehensive process of parsing economic and\nfinancial information to evaluate current economic conditions, and then assessing what that information\nimplies about the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nI supported the decision of no change in the fed funds rate target in January because I believe that policy,\nfor the time being, is well-calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nIt is important to note that “data dependent” policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every\nshort-run change in the data. For example, volatility in financial markets or a change in a short-run data\nreport is not a rationale for making a monetary policy decision. Instead, an assessment has to be made of\nwhat the incoming data and financial market developments are telling us about underlying economic\nconditions and the medium-run outlook. The relevant time horizon for monetary policy is the medium\nrun because it takes time for monetary policy to have an effect throughout the economy.\n\nA case in point is the economic and financial developments we’ve seen since the beginning of the year.\nAccording to the first estimate, real GDP growth slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of last year, to\nan annualized growth rate of only 0.7 percent, down from an average pace of about 3 percent in the\n\n\f3\nsecond and third quarters. A decline in net exports and a reduced pace of inventory investment were the\nmain drags on growth last quarter, but nonresidential investment also declined. In contrast, consumer\nspending and residential investment held up well. So, the question is: how long will the softness seen last\nquarter persist?\n\nWe also have to evaluate what the recent market volatility might imply about medium-run growth. The\ndeclines in global equity markets since the beginning of the year partly reflect market participants’\nreassessment of the outlook for growth in China and their views on how effective policy actions\nundertaken by Chinese policymakers will be in fostering growth there. China is undergoing a longer-run\nstructural transition from an economy driven by trade to one more dependent on domestic consumption\ngrowth, and these kinds of structural changes can be challenging and long lasting. Over the past couple of\ndecades, we have seen some of those challenges play out on a much smaller scale at the regional level in\nthe U.S. as industrial states have transitioned from manufacturing-based economies to more diversified\ngoods- and services-based economies.\n\nAs it relates to U.S. growth, the direct trade ties between the U.S. economy and China are not very strong:\nexports to China represent 7 to 8 percent of total U.S. exports and total U.S. exports are about 12 to 13\npercent of U.S. GDP. So the direct effect of trade with China on U.S. output is small. Of course, some\nU.S. industries are more exposed to international developments via trade and changes in the value of the\ndollar than others, and because many emerging economies are considerably more dependent on trade with\nChina, the implications of developments in China for the global economy need to be considered.\n\nIn addition to the decline in stock prices, we have seen another sharp decline in oil prices since the\nbeginning of the year. In part, this reflects the same reassessment of global growth prospects affecting the\nstock market. But supply-side factors are also very important. Worldwide oil inventories remain high\nand oil production has not been as responsive as one might have thought given the declines in oil prices\n\n\f4\nseen over the past 18 months. This means that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than\npreviously anticipated, as it is taking longer for supply to rebalance with demand.\n\nHow should a data-dependent policymaker incorporate these recent developments into the medium-run\noutlook? At this point, I view them as posing some risk to the outlook, but I believe it is premature to\nmaterially change my modal outlook. The drop in oil prices means that the U.S. energy and\nmanufacturing sectors will continue to experience considerable pressure. However, lower energy prices\nwill provide an offsetting benefit for U.S. households and for those in other oil-importing countries.\nHouseholds may choose to spend some of this gain – we’ve seen this already in high sales of SUVs and\nother larger vehicles – or they may choose to save some of this gain – we’ve seen the savings rate rise –\nand these savings will help support future consumption. While there is a possibility that a steeper, more\npersistent drop in equity markets could lead to a broader and more persistent pullback in risk-taking,\nwhich would negatively affect the outlook, so far we have not seen this.\n\nI continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the\noutlook and risks to the outlook. At this point, solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll\ngrowth, and healthy growth in real disposable income, suggest that underlying U.S. economic\nfundamentals remain sound. Until we see further evidence to the contrary, my expectation is that the U.S\neconomy will work through the latest episode of market turbulence and soft patch to regain its footing for\nmoderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors remain challenged. I continue to expect\nthat growth this year will be sufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets. I wouldn’t\nbe surprised if the pace of job gains slowed somewhat, but the gains should be strong enough to put\nadditional downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nThe latest round of oil price declines means headline inflation will remain lower for longer than I\npreviously thought. But I still think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will gradually return to 2\npercent over the medium run. I can point to a couple of things to support this view. First, measures of\n\n\f5\nunderlying inflation, like the core, the trimmed mean, and the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, are higher\nthan headline inflation. They have remained relatively stable despite the continuing sharp drop in oil\nprices we’ve seen over the past 18 months and the appreciation of the dollar, which puts downward\npressure on the price of U.S. imports. In my view, longer-run inflation expectations, an important factor\nin the inflation forecast, have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices.\nI take less of a signal from the downward moves in market-based measures of inflation compensation,\nbecause estimates suggest that these moves more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation\nrisk premia rather than changes in inflation expectations.\n\nOil prices cannot continue to decline indefinitely, nor can the dollar continue to appreciate forever. At\nsome point, both will regain some stability and the effect of previous changes on inflation will dissipate.\nAs that happens, with inflation expectations remaining stable and economic growth continuing, it is\nreasonable to expect that inflation will move back slowly to 2 percent; it just might take a bit longer now\ngiven the most recent decline in oil prices.\n\nOf course, going forward, it will be important to monitor inflation developments, in particular inflation\nexpectations, as well as economic developments both here and abroad. As we’ve seen, things can take\nunexpected turns. We want to set the path of policy based on an outlook informed by economic\ndevelopments, a path that will best achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nWhile the actual path the fed funds rate follows will depend on the economic outlook, and thus, will be\ndata dependent, my current view is that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant rates\nmoving up gradually over time to more normal levels. And this brings me to the second term in the\nmonetary policymakers’ lexicon: gradual normalization.\n\n“Gradual Normalization”\nI expect monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time to come. But given my outlook of\nmoderate growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent,\n\n\f6\nI believe the appropriate policy path will involve gradual reductions in the extraordinary level of\naccommodation that was necessary to address the Great Recession and its aftermath.\n\nThe FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, which includes a dot plot of each FOMC\nparticipant’s fed funds rate projection, gives a good sense of the meaning of “gradual normalization.” In\nMarch, we will have a new set of FOMC projections. The December projections showed that the\nmajority of FOMC participants believe it will be appropriate for the level of the fed funds rate to move up\nover time, but at a pace that means over the next couple of years the funds rate will be below the level\nmost participants expect to prevail over the longer run. According to the December projections, across\nparticipants, this longer-run level ranges from 3 to 4 percent, with a median projection of 3.5 percent. So\none meaning of gradual is that the level of the policy rate is expected to be relatively low for some time.\n\nAnother way to see that this pace is gradual is to compare it to past tightening cycles, when economic\nconditions and the outlook differed from those today. The median path in the December SEP is about\nhalf the pace of tightening the Committee undertook in the 2004-2006 period, the period of “measured\npace” increases. It is even more gradual when compared to the 1994 tightening cycle when the fed funds\nrate target rose by 300 basis points over 13 months.\n\nA third way to view this as gradual is to compare it to prescriptions from some simple monetary policy\nrules. As I’ve said elsewhere, 1 I believe in a systematic approach to monetary policy, but I don’t believe\nwe are at the state of knowledge where we can choose a single policy rule to set policy because no rule\nworks well enough across a variety of economic models and in a variety of economic circumstances.\nStill, I find it useful to look at the outcomes of a variety of such rules as a gauge. The median policy path\nin the December SEP is more gradual than the policy path that would be prescribed by many, although\n\n1\n\nLoretta J. Mester, “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech before the Forecasters Club of New\nYork, April 16, 2015,\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom%20and%20events/speeches/sp%2020150416%20the%20economic%20out\nlook%20and%20monetary%20policy.\n\n\f7\nnot all, simple policy rules. For example, suppose the economy evolved in the way described by the\nmedian economic projections from the December SEP. Then the simple Taylor 1993 rule would project\nthe fed funds rate rising by over 3 percentage points by the end of 2017, while the median appropriate\npolicy path in the December SEP is considerably more gradual, with the funds rate rising by about 2\npercentage points by the end of 2017. 2 In other words, according to FOMC participants, in order to\nachieve the median economic projections in the SEP, a more gradual path than the one described by a\nsimple Taylor rule will be appropriate.\n\nThus, it is anticipated that even as policy gradually normalizes, it will likely need to remain\naccommodative for some time to come given some of the forces still impacting our economy – for\nexample, slow growth abroad, dollar appreciation, more restrictive financial conditions, and the continued\nrebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nWe use the word “normalization,” but in the aftermath of the Great Recession, there is some uncertainty\nabout what the “normal” level of interest rates is. If productivity growth remains low and the potential\ngrowth rate of the economy over the longer run has moved lower, as many economists estimate it has,\nthen the longer-run level of the fed funds rate consistent with price stability and maximum employment –\nthe so-called neutral rate – would also be lower than it was in earlier periods. But estimates of long-run\ngrowth are imprecise and subject to revision, so this means there is considerable uncertainty around this\nneutral fed funds rate as well. A gradual approach to normalization will not only allow us to be\nresponsive to economic developments but also allow us to recalibrate policy over time as some of the\n2\n\nThe median policy path in the December SEP has the funds rate rising to 1.4 percent by the end of this year, 2.4\npercent by the end of 2017, and 3.3 percent by the end of 2018. The simple Taylor 1993 rule is Rt = r* + πt + 0.5(πt\n– π*) + 0.5 [(yt – y*)/y*], where Rt is the nominal federal funds rate at time t, r* is the longer-run real interest rate, πt\nis inflation at time t, π* is the inflation target, yt is the output level at time t, and y* is the level of potential output.\nSince the output gap is not contained in the FOMC projections, I translate the output gap, (yt – y*)/y*, into an\nunemployment gap, Ut – U*, where Ut is the unemployment rate and U* is the longer-run unemployment rate, and\n(yt – y*)/y* = −2.3×(Ut – U*), based on the estimated historical relationship between the output gap and the\nunemployment gap. In this Taylor rule exercise, if we ignore the fact that the economic outcomes projected in the\nSEP are conditioned on each participant’s appropriate policy path and use the median economic outcomes as inputs\ninto the Taylor rule, then the simple Taylor 1993 rule would project the fed funds rate rising to 3.1 percent by the\nend of this year, to 3.6 percent by the end of 2017, and to 3.7 percent by the end of 2018.\n\n\f8\nuncertainties surrounding the longer-term level of interest rates, the economy’s potential growth rate, and\nthe longer-run unemployment rate are resolved.\n\nWhile I’ve been using the median fed funds projection in the December SEP as a benchmark, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that these projections are not a commitment because in order to best achieve\nour goals of maximum employment and price stability, policy should be expected to react in a systematic\nfashion to material changes in the outlook. Our economic forecasting models are, by necessity,\nsimplifications. The economy is dynamic and can be hit by various shocks that might lead to changes in\nthe medium-run outlook for employment and inflation to which policy would want to respond.\nConfidence bands around economic forecasts tend to be wide. For example, averaging across several\nmodels, the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or\nminus 1 percentage point; the confidence band around a forecast of short-term interest rates one year out\nis of similar magnitude.\n\nUnlike private-sector forecasters, FOMC policymakers provide funds rate projections in the SEP that\nrepresent their views of appropriate policy rather than a policy forecast. But because there is uncertainty\naround the outlook, there is also uncertainty around the FOMC’s policy path. If the economy’s evolution\nturns out to be different from what we currently anticipate, our policy path may well have to deviate from\nwhat our current expectation is. The policy paths in the SEP will change over time as the outlook\nchanges. I don’t view this as problematic – we want policy to respond appropriately to changes in the\noutlook. Thus, the actual path normalization takes could very well turn out to be either less or more\ngradual than what we anticipate it to be today. The evolution of the FOMC’s dot plot in the SEP over\nmeetings to come will provide the public with information on how participants think monetary policy\nshould appropriately respond to changes in the outlook. As I mentioned, our next SEP will be released in\nMarch.\n\n\f9\n“Well Underway”\nAnother aspect of current monetary policy involves the Fed’s balance-sheet strategy. The Fed took some\nextraordinary policy actions in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Some of those\nactions involved purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities to\nexert downward pressure on long-term interest rates. As a result of those purchases, banks and other\ndepository institutions now hold at the Fed over $2 trillion in reserves in excess of regulatory\nrequirements, and the Fed holds about $4.5 trillion in assets on its balance sheet, nearly five times as\nmuch as before the financial crisis. Currently, the Fed is maintaining the size of its balance sheet by\nreinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities\ninto agency mortgage-backed securities and by rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The\nFOMC has said it anticipates doing this until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well\nunderway. One might reasonably ask what “well underway” means. The FOMC hasn’t given a precise\ndefinition.\n\nIn my view, “well underway” refers to the state of the economy and not a particular length of time after\nthe initial rate increase. This is consistent with the FOMC’s policy normalization principles, which\nindicate that the decision about when to cease or begin phasing out reinvestments will depend on how\neconomic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve. 3 As demonstrated in December, the\nFed has the tools to raise the fed funds rate to the target range even though the balance sheet is very large.\nSo from a policy implementation perspective, there isn’t a compelling reason to end reinvestments\nquickly. But consistent with the normalization principles, I would like the balance sheet to eventually\nreturn to a more normal size and composition; the first step in that process is ending reinvestments. We\ndon’t know precisely how the economy will evolve; this argues against deciding to end reinvestments\nafter some particular period of time has elapsed. Instead, because some policy accommodation is\nprovided via the balance sheet, it would seem better to base the decision about reinvestments on economic\n\n3\n\nSee “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” September 17, 2014,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\n\n\f10\nconditions and the outlook, just as we do with the funds rate path. Indeed, the economic conditions and\noutlook that would support reducing the degree of monetary accommodation by gradually raising the fed\nfunds rate would also tend to support slowly reducing the size of the balance sheet, which would result\nwhen reinvestments end. Thus, in my view, the level of the fed funds rate might be used as a guide to\nwhen to end reinvestments – in this case, both our fed funds rate path and our balance-sheet policy would\nbe data dependent. I would be comfortable ending reinvestments after we have a few more funds rate\nincreases under our belt, perhaps when the funds rate has reached 1 percent or so. This is my\ninterpretation of “well underway,” but as Chair Yellen indicated in her December press briefing, the\nFOMC has not given further guidance on this. 4\n\nThe final phrase in the monetary policymakers’ lexicon I’d like to discuss is the FOMC’s “symmetric\ninflation goal.”\n\n“Symmetric Inflation Goal”\nThe FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy serves to clarify the FOMC’s\nframework for making monetary policy decisions. 5 I view the statement as a very important part of the\nCommittee’s communications arsenal. This statement makes explicit the FOMC’s numerical goal for\ninflation over the longer run. This goal is 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change\nin the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. Since first being issued in\nJanuary 2012, the statement has been reaffirmed at the Committee’s annual organizational meetings each\nJanuary.\n\n4\n\nSee “Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference,” December 16, 2015,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/fomcpresconf20151216.pdf. Also see the discussion of\nreinvestments in the minutes of the September 2015 FOMC meeting,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150917.pdf.\n5\n\nSee “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012,\namended effective January 26, 2016,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_20160126.pdf.\n\n\f11\nGiven that it lays out the FOMC’s decision-making framework, I view the statement on long-run goals as\nsomewhat constitutional in nature, but periodically, the FOMC and its Subcommittee on Communications\nappropriately consider whether there are any changes that might be beneficial in clarifying the\nframework.\n\nOne such change was made this January when the FOMC clarified that the 2 percent inflation target is\nsymmetric. As indicated in the statement, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running\npersistently above or persistently below the goal. Persistent one-side misses can be of concern because in\nmany models of the inflation process, current and past deviations from the target are informative about\nfuture inflation. Another factor affecting the outlook for inflation is inflation expectations. Persistent\nmisses on either side of the goal can be of concern because they might ultimately cause inflation\nexpectations to become unanchored, thereby undermining the achievement of the Fed’s longer-run\ninflation objective.\n\nThese concerns may or may not rise to the level of necessitating a policy action. The FOMC has to\nbalance a number of considerations in setting policy to promote its dual mandate goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. As we’ve discussed, policy action is tied to the medium-run outlook. If\nthe one-sided misses have changed the outlook for inflation and employment materially, then policy\nmight need to respond in order to foster attainment of our goals. In other cases, even if inflation were\nrunning above or below the target, no policy response might be called for because the outlook continued\nto be for inflation to return to 2 percent over time and for the economy to be at full employment.\n\nAn example is the period in late 2006 and early 2007. The minutes of the December 2006 FOMC\nmeeting indicate that the economy was expected to expand at a moderate pace and all FOMC participants\nwere concerned about inflation.6 Nearly all participants felt that the core measures of inflation were\n“uncomfortably high.” Part of the increase in both headline and core inflation reflected earlier rises in\n6\n\nSee “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 12, 2006,”\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20061212.htm.\n\n\f12\nenergy and other commodity prices. The FOMC continued to forecast that core inflation would move\nlower over time as the effects of higher energy and commodity prices passed through and growth\nmoderated. They expressed concern that if inflation didn’t moderate as expected, there would be\nsignificant costs if inflation expectations drifted up. But on balance, these concerns did not elicit a\nchange in the fed funds rate, although there was one dissent in favor of raising rates in light of the\ninflation outlook. Similarly, in meetings in early 2007, the Committee was concerned about inflation but\nthe forecast was for inflation to moderate and there was no policy response.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Great Recession and our experience with low inflation, I have not heard many\npeople say that they believe that the Fed interprets its inflation target as a ceiling, and is only concerned\nabout misses on the upside. Nonetheless, I do think the change the Committee made in January to clarify\nthe symmetric nature of the inflation target was a positive step toward improved transparency and\ncommunications.\n\nAnd I hope that my remarks today helped to clarify for you my own interpretation of four catch-phrases in\nthe monetary policymaker’s lexicon: data dependent, gradual normalization, well underway, and\nsymmetric inflation goal. Thank you for your attention.\n\n\f"
