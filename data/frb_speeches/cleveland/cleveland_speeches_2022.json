Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMarkus’ Academy\nPrinceton Bendheim Center for Finance\nPrinceton University\nPrinceton, NJ\n(via videoconference)\nNovember 10, 2022\n\n\f1\ndiligent (adj): having or showing care and conscientiousness in one’s work or duties\n\nI thank Markus Brunnermeier for inviting me to speak in the webinar series he runs as director of the\nPrinceton Bendheim Center for Finance. I make it a point to listen to his webcast, so it is a real honor to\nparticipate in this series. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLast week, the FOMC raised its target range of the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 3-3/4 to 4\npercent. We also indicated that we anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be\nappropriate in order to attain a monetary policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2\npercent. Given the level and persistence of inflation, the journey back to 2 percent inflation will likely\ntake some time. The FOMC is also continuing the process of reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet\nby allowing assets to roll off, which also helps to firm the stance of monetary policy.\n\n[Figure 1. Federal funds rate]\nThe move last week was the fourth 75-basis-point increase in as many meetings and the funds rate target\nis now 375 basis points higher than it was at the start of the year. Compared to history, this has been a\nbrisk pace of increases in our policy rate. But compared to history, the economy is experiencing very\nhigh and persistent inflation, and the real policy rate is just beginning to move into restrictive territory.\nNonetheless, overall financial conditions are tighter than at the start of the year: Treasury yields,\nmortgage rates, and credit spreads are higher, the dollar has appreciated, and equity prices are lower.\n\n[Figure 2. Inflation, year-over-year]\nIndeed, unacceptably high and persistent inflation remains the key challenge facing the U.S. economy.\nInflation rates remain at 40-year highs. Measured year-over-year, in September, PCE inflation was still\nrunning over 6 percent and core PCE inflation moved up in September to over 5 percent. The median and\n\n\f2\ntrimmed-mean measures, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each month, tell\na similar story of persistently high inflation.1\n\n[Figure 3. Inflation, 3-month change, annualized]\nA positive sign is that the three-month changes in underlying inflation measures are lower now than they\nwere in June, although they remain high. Other positive signs are that commodity prices have moved\ndown and goods inflation has begun to ease. This morning’s October CPI report also suggests some\neasing in overall and core inflation. On the other hand, services inflation, which tends to be sticky, has\nnot yet shown signs of slowing. In addition, inflation continues to be broad-based. In September’s PCE\ninflation report, the prices of about half of the items people buy were at least 5 percent higher than they\nwere a year ago, and we’ve seen little improvement in this share. Inflation is particularly difficult for\npeople in lower-income households, who spend a larger share of their income on essentials like food,\nshelter, and energy, components that have seen some of the largest price increases.\n\n[Figure 4. GDP growth and sectors]\nIn order for inflation to fall, there will need to be further slowing in product and labor markets, bringing\ndemand into better balance with supply to alleviate price pressures. We are beginning to see demand in\nproduct markets slowing, partly in response to higher interest rates. Real output contracted in the first\nhalf of the year. It grew in the third quarter, but final sales to private domestic purchasers were\nessentially flat. Growth in consumer spending slowed and residential investment fell significantly. While\nequipment spending grew at a healthy pace in the third quarter, readings of new orders from the ISM and\nregional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys indicate that equipment spending is likely to slow in the\ncoming months. On the supply side, improvement in supplier delivery times and anecdotal reports from\n\n1\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx)\n\n\f3\nmy business contacts indicate some welcome easing in supply bottlenecks. On balance, I expect real\nGDP growth to be well below trend this year and next year.\n\n[Figure 5. Employment growth and the unemployment rate]\nThere has been a slight moderation in labor market conditions, but the labor market remains tight. Job\ngains have slowed to an average of about 290 thousand per month over the past three months compared to\nabout 540 thousand per month over the comparable period a year ago and job openings are lower than\nthey were in March. Nonetheless, there are still almost two openings per unemployed person, which is\nwell above the level in the strong labor market in 2019. And even with some slowing in output growth,\nbusiness contacts continue to report that they cannot find the workers they need. The unemployment rate,\nat 3.7 percent, is still very low by historical standards.\n\n[Figure 6. Employment Cost Index]\nAnother indication that labor demand is outpacing labor supply is strong wage growth. The year-overyear growth rate of the employment cost index is 5 percent, well above the level consistent with price\nstability, based on estimates of trend productivity growth.\n\nAlthough growth is slowing, there continue to be some upside risks to the inflation forecast. Russia’s\ncontinuing war against Ukraine could mean gas and energy prices move higher again this winter and next\nwinter. And I remain cognizant of the fact that economists’ forecasts – private sector, the FOMC’s, and\nmy own – have underestimated the level of inflation and its persistence for almost two years.\nNonetheless, I do expect inflation to begin to slow meaningfully next year and the following year,\nreaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. This is because the FOMC is strongly committed to returning the\neconomy to price stability. We will be diligent in making that happen, that is, we will proceed with care\nand conscientiousness.\n\n\f4\n[Figure 7. Near-term and longer-term inflation expectations]\nThe behavior of longer-term inflation expectations reflects that commitment. Near-term expectations\nhave risen significantly with actual inflation, and they have fallen in recent months as gasoline prices\nhave declined. Inflation expectations over the longer term have risen much less. They remain reasonably\nwell anchored at levels consistent with our goal and that should help to lower inflation without as large of\na slowdown in activity. However, we cannot take that anchoring for granted. The longer actual inflation\nand near-term inflation expectations remain elevated, the greater the risk that longer-term inflation\nexpectations become unanchored and high inflation permeates wage- and price-setting behavior and\ninvestment decisions, making it much more costly to return inflation to our goal.\n\n[Figure 8. November FOMC statement forward guidance]\nWe have moved rates up expeditiously this year, starting from a very accommodative stance to a stance\nthat is becoming restrictive. The focus had been on how quickly we could get to that restrictive stance.\nNow the focus can shift to the appropriate level of restrictiveness that will return the economy to price\nstability in a timely way. Given the current level of inflation, its broad-based nature, and its persistence, I\nbelieve monetary policy will need to become more restrictive and remain restrictive for a while in order to\nput inflation on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. As indicated in the FOMC statement last\nweek, in determining the pace of future increases, the Committee will take into account the cumulative\ntightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and\ninflation, and economic and financial developments. All of these factors figure into the economic outlook\nand risks around the outlook, which inform our policy decisions.\n\nPrecisely how much higher the fed funds rate will need to go and for how long policy will need to remain\nrestrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down, which\ndepends on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being resolved, and price pressures are\neasing. To help me make the assessment of how high and how long, I will be looking at a variety of\n\n\f5\nincoming information and data, including the official statistics, survey evidence, and reports from our\nbusiness, labor market, and community contacts, which are more forward looking than other data sources.\nIn December, the Committee will be releasing a new set of economic projections, which will incorporate\neach participant’s thinking about the appropriate path of policy.\n\nThe transition back to price stability will take some time and will not be without some pain. It is likely\nthat there will continue to be higher-than-normal levels of financial market volatility, which can be\ndifficult to navigate. With growth likely to be well below trend, it could easily turn negative for a time.\nBusiness contacts tell us that given how hard it has been to attract and retain workers over the last two\nyears, they intend to keep their workers even as the economy slows. If so, we could see less of an\nincrease in the unemployment rate than is typical in an economic slowdown. However, it is also possible\nthat the unemployment rate could go up more than anticipated and this would impose difficulties on\nhouseholds and businesses.\n\nBut it is important to remember that the current very high inflation is painful as well, as less well-off\npeople and businesses struggle to make ends meet. Moreover, we should not underestimate the\nconsequences of continued elevated inflation on the long-run health of the economy. Without price\nstability, businesses and households have to divert their attention to trying to preserve the purchasing\npower of their money. It becomes more difficult to plan for the future and to make long-term\ncommitments, and decisions regarding investments in physical and human capital are distorted. Without\nprice stability we will not be able to sustain healthy labor market conditions over the medium and long\nrun, which is inconsistent with the maximum employment part of our dual mandate. This means that\ncontinued high inflation can have negative long-run implications for an economy’s potential growth rate\nand standard of living. So returning the economy to price stability remains our priority.\n\n\f6\nAs is always the case when we are transitioning monetary policy, we will need to continue to weigh the\nrisks of tightening too much against the risks of tightening too little. Tightening too much would slow the\neconomy more than necessary and entail higher costs than needed. Tightening too little would allow high\ninflation to persist, with short- and long-run consequences, and necessitate a much more costly journey\nback to price stability. We will need to be very diligent in setting monetary policy to return the economy\nto price stability and be judicious in balancing these risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nDespite the moves we have made so far, given that inflation has consistently proven to be more persistent\nthan expected and there are significant costs of continued high inflation, I currently view the larger risks\nas coming from tightening too little. As policy moves further into restrictive territory, the effects of our\ncumulative tightening will work through to the broader economy, and I anticipate that we will see\ninflation pressures ease. At that point, I expect that my view of the balance of these risks will shift, and I\nwill welcome that shift because it will mean that inflation is moving down in a meaningful way.\n\n\fFigures for\n“A Diligent Return to Price Stability”\nLoretta J.

        "content": "An Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy:\nPerseverance in Returning to Price Stability\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSignature Luncheon\nEconomic Club of New York\nNew York, NY\nOctober 11, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Economic Club of New York for the opportunity to speak with you today. I am looking\nforward to the dialog. It is likely no surprise that I will focus my prepared remarks on inflation and how\nmonetary policymakers will persevere in fostering a return to price stability. The views I present will be\nmy own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\nUnacceptably high and persistent inflation remains the key challenge facing the U.S. economy. Inflation\nhas been running well above 2 percent for almost a year and a half, and the risks to inflation forecasts are\nskewed to the upside. Everyone is feeling the brunt of high inflation. It is imposing a particularly\nonerous burden on those households and businesses that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for\nessentials like food, gasoline, and shelter. Lower-income households spend a higher proportion of their\nincome on these essentials, and these components have had some of the strongest price increases. We\nhave moved from a situation in which households and businesses could be rationally inattentive to\ninflation to one in which inflation is on everyone’s mind, with lower-income households having to make\nhard choices about how to spend their money to make ends meet.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy. It is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain\nhealthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive\nand live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. Without price stability, businesses and households\nhave to divert attention to trying to preserve the purchasing power of their money, and it becomes more\ndifficult to plan for the future and to make long-term commitments and investments. Hence, high\ninflation can have negative long-run implications for an economy’s potential growth rate and standard of\nliving.\n\n\f2\nThe FOMC is strongly committed to using its tools to return the economy to price stability and it will\npersevere to make this happen. We are taking decisive action to remove monetary policy accommodation\nto bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and labor markets. Since\nMarch, the FOMC has reduced monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range of the fed\nfunds rate by 3 percentage points and by reducing assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet.\n\nGiven the current level of inflation, its broad-based nature, and its persistence, I believe monetary policy\nwill need to become more restrictive in order to put inflation on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent.\nGiven appropriately restrictive financial conditions, my modal outlook is that inflation will move down\nappreciably next year, to about 3-1/2 percent, and continue to decline, reaching our 2 percent goal in\n2025. I anticipate that the return to price stability will entail a period of output growth that is well below\ntrend over the next two years. This below-trend growth will lead to slower employment growth, with the\nunemployment rate moving up to 4-1/2 percent by the end of next year and up a bit more in 2024. We are\nlikely to experience higher-than-normal levels of financial market volatility as well. At this point, indices\nconstructed by the St. Louis Fed and the Kansas City Fed point to low levels of financial stress, but we\nwill need to remain attentive to financial vulnerabilities.1 With growth well below trend over the next\ncouple of years, it is possible that a shock could push the U.S. economy into recession for a time. None\nof this is painless, but the high inflation we are experiencing is already inflicting pain on many people.\nThe necessary costs incurred now for the economy to transition back to price stability are much lower\nthan the costs borne later were inflation to become embedded in the economy, influencing wage- and\nprice-setting behavior, investment decisions, and longer-term productivity growth. Perhaps Paul Volcker\nsaid it best as he fought inflation in the 1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation\nwill only make any subsequent effort more difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”2\n\n1\n\nThe St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index is available at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI3. The Kansas\nCity Financial Stress Index is available at https://www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/kansas-city-financialstress-index/current-release/.\nSee Paul A. Volcker, “No Time for Backsliding,” remarks at the National Press Club, Washington, DC, September\n25, 1981, p. 2. (https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/statements-speeches-paul-a-volcker-451/time-backsliding-8243)\n2\n\n\f3\n\nEconomic Growth\nThe inflation we are experiencing today stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an\nimbalance between strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures\non prices. Indeed, both aggregate demand and aggregate supply were affected by the pandemic and by\nthe responses of households, businesses, and policymakers to it. Mandated shutdowns and the voluntary\npullback in demand for high-contact services led to a shift in spending early in the pandemic from\nservices to goods. When the economy reopened, demand surged. This strong demand was supported by\nthe extraordinary level of fiscal transfers and accommodative monetary policy applied during the height\nof the pandemic.\n\nEconomic growth is slowing down from last year’s robust 5-3/4 percent pace. Indeed, the level of real\nGDP decreased in the first half of this year, but current estimates suggest that it resumed rising in the\nsecond half. Activity is slowing partly in response to the monetary policy actions taken this year, which\nhave led to tighter overall financial conditions. This is most easily seen in the housing market. Housing\ndemand increased during the pandemic as housing preferences shifted. Housing supply, which was\nalready somewhat constrained before the pandemic, could not keep up with increased demand and house\nprices rose. This year housing market activity has slowed appreciably as mortgage rates have risen 3-1/2\npercentage points since the start of the year. Housing starts and sales have moved down. House price\ninflation is beginning to ease but the year-over-year increase in house prices is still in double digits and\nwell above pre-pandemic levels; growth in rents also remains high.\n\nIn addition to tighter financial conditions, the slowdown in economic activity more broadly reflects how\nhouseholds and businesses are responding to very high inflation and their concerns about the economic\noutlook, to the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and to slower growth abroad. Both\n\n\f4\nconsumer spending and business investment have decelerated from the robust pace seen last year, and as\nthe effects of the pandemic have waned, consumption has begun to shift from goods to services.\n\nThe supply side of the economy remains constrained relative to demand. There are signs that supply\nchain bottlenecks, which have stemmed from pandemic-related shutdowns across the globe and the war in\nUkraine, have begun to ease.3 Our business contacts tell us that supply chain disruptions remain a\nchallenge but over time they have learned to navigate through them more effectively. They report that the\nlarger factor holding back production is the lack of available workers.\n\nLabor Markets\nWe are seeing some signs of moderation in the labor market, but overall conditions remain very strong\nand labor demand is still outpacing labor supply. The number of job openings has fallen this year, but\nthere are still 1.7 openings per unemployed person. Back in 2019, another time of tight labor markets,\nthere were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker. Last year, job gains averaged over 550 thousand\nper month. This year, through September, job gains have eased to an average of 420 thousand per month,\nbut that is still very strong job growth by historical standards. The unemployment rate is lower now than\nit was at the start of the year, and at 3.5 percent is at a 50-year low. The participation rate of prime-age\nworkers has returned to where one would expect it to be based on demographics. Many people chose to\nretire during the pandemic and left the labor force, and the overall participation rate, which includes those\nof retirement age, has risen only gradually.\n\nA continued rise in participation would be helpful in easing the imbalance between labor demand and\nsupply. But typically, most people who have retired and have begun to receive Social Security payments\ndo not return to the job market. I don’t expect to get much help from immigration either: net migration\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) has fallen appreciably this\nyear but remains above its pre-pandemic level. And if transportation costs rise again, supply chain pressures may\nalso begin to rise. The GSCPI is available at https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/overview.\n3\n\n\f5\nhas been declining since the late 1990s. So it is likely that much of the rebalancing will need to come on\nthe labor demand side. This could occur mainly through firms reducing the number of workers they are\nseeking rather than through layoffs. Indeed, many employers have told us that because it has been so hard\nto attract and retain workers over the past two years, they will strive to keep them on their payrolls even if\ndemand for their products slows down. This would result in a smaller rise in the unemployment rate than\nhas been seen in other economic slowdowns.\n\nThe imbalance between labor demand and supply has put upward pressure on wages. The employment\ncost index for private industry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6\npercent annual pace. If you squint, more recent reports suggest that wage pressures may be starting to\nstabilize. For example, average hourly earnings rose at about a 4-1/2 percent annual pace in the three\nmonths ending in September, compared to a little over 4-3/4 percent in 2021. With trend productivity\ngrowth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, nominal wage growth will need to moderate to\naround 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price stability. Even with the moderation in nominal\nwage growth that will occur as the economy returns to price stability, workers will be better off. In real\nterms, workers have been losing ground because wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Indeed,\nsince April of last year, wages adjusted for inflation have been declining. If real wages continue to\ndecline, it will be difficult to attract people back to the workforce, exacerbating the imbalance in the labor\nmarket.\n\nInflation\nDespite some moderation on the demand side of the economy and nascent signs of improvement in\nsupply side conditions, there has been no progress on inflation. Inflation readings have persisted at the\nhighest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, in August, PCE inflation was still running over 6\npercent and CPI inflation was over 8 percent. The core measures, which omit food and energy prices, and\nthe median and trimmed-mean measures, which exclude components with the most extreme movements\n\n\f6\neach month, tell a similar story of broad-based, persistently high inflation.4 I note that we look at these\nmeasures not because food and energy prices or the prices of other volatile components, such as apparel,\nare not important parts of a household’s consumption basket. Indeed, our long-run inflation target is\nbased on total PCE inflation, which includes all components. But we look at these alternative measures\nbecause they can give us a better sense of where inflation is likely going. Measured year-over-year, these\nunderlying inflation measures all moved up in August. The month-to-month changes in the inflation\nmeasures have shown no real decline, so we cannot even say inflation has peaked yet, let alone that it is\non a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. Given developments related to the ongoing war in Ukraine,\ngas and energy prices may move higher again later this year. In addition, services inflation, which tends\nto be persistent, is at its highest level since the early 1990s, with growth in housing rent and shelter costs\nlikely to keep inflation elevated for some time.\n\nIn my view, even with appropriate monetary policy actions, given inflation dynamics, it will take a couple\nof years before inflation returns to the Fed’s 2 percent goal. But I do expect to see meaningful progress\nover the next year as output growth and employment growth slow and there is some improvement in\nsupply side conditions. A key factor in this outlook is that medium- and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent goal despite current high inflation\nreadings. This anchoring should help to bring inflation back to our goal without as large a change in the\noutput gap. It is the job of monetary policymakers to ensure that inflation expectations remain well\nanchored.\n\n4\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx)\n\n\f7\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. And as\nalways, we are calibrating our monetary policy based on the implications of incoming information for the\neconomic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals.\n\nMonetary policy acts with a lag on the economy so we need to be forward looking. It is unlikely that we\nhave seen the full effects on households and businesses of the latest rate increases we have implemented\nand it would not be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2 percent. But\nit is also the case that based on Fed communications, financial conditions began to tighten well before our\nfirst rate increase in March and those effects have been passing through to the economy. Yet high\ninflation persists, an indication that we need to increase rates further.\n\nIn order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent, policy will need to move into a\nrestrictive stance. That means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is, real\ninterest rates, will need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Although we have\nraised the nominal fed funds rate by 300 basis points, policy is not yet restrictive. The median projection\nfor the longer-run nominal fed funds rate in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) of\nFOMC participants is 2.5 percent, which is my own estimate as well.5 This means that if inflation were 2\npercent, and inflation expectations were well anchored at levels consistent with that goal, a real fed funds\nrate of half of a percent would be neutral in the sense of neither stimulating nor restraining economic\nactivity. But that is an important “if.” Currently, inflation and shorter-term inflation expectations are\nwell above 2 percent. If we adjust the current nominal fed funds rate by the SEP median projection for\ninflation next year, which is 2.8 percent, policy is still a tad accommodative. Further funds rate increases\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee, “Summary of Economic Projections,” September 21, 2022.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf)\n5\n\n\f8\nare needed to get policy into a restrictive stance, and the median fed funds rate path in the SEP has rates\nmoving up to 4.4 percent by the end of this year and to 4.6 percent next year.\n\nBecause I see more persistence in inflation than the median SEP projection, the funds rate path I\nsubmitted for the September SEP was a bit higher over the next year than the median path, and I do not\nanticipate any cuts in the fed funds target range next year. But let me emphasize that this is based on my\ncurrent reading of the economy and outlook, and I will adjust my views as warranted based on the\nimplications of incoming economic and financial information for the outlook and risks around the\noutlook. While it is clear that the fed funds rate needs to move up from its current level, the size of rate\nincreases at any particular FOMC meeting and the peak fed funds rate will depend on the inflation\noutlook, which depends on the assessment of how rapidly aggregate demand and supply are coming back\ninto better balance and price pressures are being reduced. Given lags in the data, the reconnaissance we\nreceive from our contacts about what is happening on the ground in real-time will be particularly\nimportant in assessing the effects of the cumulative tightening on the economy. Making this assessment\nwill be challenging because both the demand and the supply sides of the U.S. economy will continue to\nbe affected by a variety of factors. This includes economic and policy developments in the rest of the\nworld, which can affect the U.S. economy through trade and financial market channels.\n\nWe will be operating in an uncertain environment for some time. High uncertainty is usually associated\nwith being cautious, and being cautious is often associated with acting inertially. But in the current\nenvironment of high and persistent inflation, a risk management, robust control approach counsels that\nbeing cautious does not mean doing less. Instead, it means being very careful to not allow wishful\nthinking to substitute for compelling evidence, leading one to prematurely declare victory over inflation\nand pause or reverse rate increases too soon. It means not being complacent that inflation expectations\nwill remain well anchored in this high inflation environment but taking appropriate actions to keep them\nanchored.\n\n\f9\n\nIt has been very helpful that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up less than\nshort-run expectations. They are below current inflation readings, an indication that the public believes\nthat inflation will move back down. Yet the recent declines in medium- and longer-term expectations\noccurred as gasoline prices declined; the jury is still out about whether these readings will rise again if\ngasoline prices move back up. In addition, every month that inflation remains highly elevated raises the\nchances that inflation expectations will become unanchored and that firms and households will begin to\nmake decisions based on persistently high inflation. If that were to happen, returning to price stability\nwould be more difficult and much more costly in terms of lost output and higher unemployment. Even if\none doesn’t think an unanchoring of inflation expectations is the most likely scenario, the costs of being\nwrong are high given the current state of the economy. So the robust control approach encourages strong\naction to keep expectations anchored to prevent the worst-case outcome from actually occurring.6 In my\nview, in the current environment, being cautious means that the FOMC should persevere in taking policy\nactions to return the economy to price stability.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, inflation remains very elevated and is placing a large burden on households and businesses.\nThe FOMC is committed to taking appropriate action to tighten financial conditions by raising the fed\nfunds rate and continuing to reduce the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet in order to return the economy to\nprice stability. Monetary policy is moving into restrictive territory and will need to be there for some\ntime in order to put inflation on a sustained downward path to our 2 percent goal. We will be looking at a\nvariety of incoming data and collecting economic and financial information from our business, labor\n\nSee Loretta J.

        "content": "An Update on the Federal Reserve’s Efforts to\nModernize the Payment System\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Speech\n2022 Chicago Payments Symposium:\nBuilding Customer-Centered and Adaptive Networks\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, IL\nOctober 4, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Ellen Bromagen and the other organizers for inviting me to speak again at the Chicago Payments\nSymposium. It is truly an honor to participate in this symposium, which, under Ellen’s leadership, is a\npremier event for sharing ideas and for gathering insights from those who are involved in the payment\nsystem. At this time of dramatic change in payments, I feel privileged to chair the Fed’s Financial\nServices Policy Committee (FSPC), which oversees the provision of the Fed’s payment services to\ndeposit institutions and the U.S. Treasury. And I want to thank Ellen for being such a key member of our\ncommittee, providing insights from her years of experience working in payments. I would also like to\ntake this opportunity to extend my sincere appreciation to Federal Reserve Bank presidents Charles Evans\nand Esther George, who will be stepping down from their roles in January. Throughout their careers at\nthe Fed, Charlie and Esther have been strong and dedicated leaders working on behalf of the public. They\nhave made important contributions to all aspects of the Fed’s work, including monetary policy, banking\nsupervision, financial stability, community development, and payments. Indeed, their leadership has been\ninstrumental in the System’s success in supporting the ongoing modernization of the payment system. I\nam very grateful to count Esther and Charlie as friends and I appreciate their mentorship – although they\nmay have wished for a better student.\n\nThis morning, I will discuss some efforts the Federal Reserve has underway, in collaboration with the\nindustry and other payments stakeholders, to modernize the payment system, a critical part of the\ninfrastructure in the U.S. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Fed’s Modernization Efforts\nBecause the current payment system works well, most people have spent little time thinking about the\nbackbone that makes these payments possible and ensures that the payment system is reliable and secure.\nThis rational inattention is just as it should be. But with the changes brought by new technology and the\n\n\f2\nentry of new service providers, more people are seeking new ways to execute transactions, whether it be\nonline or via cell phone, and they want to execute them faster. The modernization efforts underway aim\nto foster a system that is not only efficient, secure, and effective, but also one that is innovative,\nadaptable, resilient, and accessible to everyone: a payment system that consumers and businesses can rely\non with confidence to efficiently make purchases, pay bills, and get paid. Indeed, ensuring that the public\ncan be confident in the system is a critical ingredient in achieving a better payment system, so innovations\naimed at efficiency must also be designed for security and resiliency.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has taken a collaborative approach in its modernization efforts. Ten years ago, the\nFed recognized that the payment system was at an inflection point. New technologies were being\ndeveloped and increasingly used, and the expectations of the end users of the payment system were also\nevolving. These conditions portended a period of rapid transformation in the end-to-end payments\nlandscape. The Fed engaged with a diverse set of payment-system stakeholders, and we all came to agree\nthat the U.S. payment system needed to evolve further and faster to support the changing nature of\ncommerce, keep pace with the global economy, meet the changing needs of end users and offer them\nbetter value, and address new and ongoing threats to security. Again engaging with stakeholders, the Fed\nestablished strategies to improve the payment system in terms of the speed, security, and efficiency of\ndomestic and cross-border payments. 1 These strategies, along with tactics, were published in 2015 and\nthey have guided the Fed’s modernization efforts.\n\nOver the ten years since the Fed recognized that the U.S. payment system needed improvement, two\nthings have happened. First, as foreseen, the payments landscape has undergone significant change. New\nentrants, shifting user needs, and digitalization have all shaped new models and methods for making\npayments. Traditional providers and fintech firms are coming to market with products that better meet\n\n1\n\nSee Federal Reserve System (2015).\n\n\f3\ncustomers’ needs in terms of convenience and that address long-standing frictions in the payment system.\nNew technologies have shaped the public’s expectations for faster, more efficient, and broadly accessible\npayment services that, at the same time, are safe and secure.\n\nThe second thing that has occurred is considerable progress toward the goal of a better payment system\nthat benefits all, a goal shared by the Federal Reserve, the industry, and end users. What both the private\nsector and the public sector have accomplished in a relatively short period of time is impressive,\nparticularly given the complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. financial infrastructure. This\nprogress underscores the value of collaboration. Indeed, the Fed working collaboratively with a broad\narray of payment participants was one of the five strategies included in our 2015 paper that catalyzed our\ncurrent modernization efforts.\n\nLet me now touch on a few examples of current and future innovations.\n\nCurrent Payment Innovations\nDigital payments\nInnovative digital payments products are filling gaps, addressing inefficiencies, and expanding payments\naccess to underserved consumers. According to a 2021 Fed survey, nearly seven out of 10 consumers use\nmobile payment devices to send or receive payments, and this usage spans consumers of all ages. 2 This is\na considerable increase from 2013, when only one in 10 consumers had ever made a mobile payment. In\naddition to using services from their primary bank or credit union, 83 percent of consumers are using a\ndigital wallet or a fintech payment app at least occasionally to complete transactions, including 71 percent\nof those age 55 and older. 3\n\n2\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2022).\n\n3\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2022).\n\n\f4\nOf course, the pandemic has had a wide-ranging and uneven impact on firms’ and households’ payment\nbehaviors and patterns. The share of retail sales done electronically jumped during the pandemic, but this\nshare began increasing much earlier. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales accounted\nfor about 6 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2013. That share has now risen to about 14 percent. 4 It\nseems clear that the consumer’s preference for digital payments, which has been spurred by industry\ninnovation, is here to stay. Apps created by financial institutions and fintech providers are increasingly\neasy to use and access. Other digital tools have significantly improved money management and financial\naccess for consumers, including those with low or moderate incomes, who have historically been\nunderserved. At the same time, because maintaining the public’s confidence in the payment system is a\npublic good, it is important to ensure that consumers using these new payments products understand how\nthese new products compare with other payment instruments, including cash, in terms of risks and\nbenefits. Ensuring that new products and payments rails are built with security and resiliency in mind\nfrom the very start is essential if the modernization of the payment system is to live up to its promise.\n\nCombating fraud and increasing cyber resilience\nOne negative trend affecting the payment system is the increase in fraud. Fraud has the potential to\nundermine the public’s confidence in the payment system, and staying ahead of the fraudsters requires\nconstant vigilance because of the increasing sophistication of the frauds being perpetrated. Scams abound\nand are constantly changing. Bad actors are hacking into systems by using bots, phishing schemes, and\nsocial networks to exploit weaknesses in the system. Payment fraud comes in a variety of forms.\nAccording to one estimate, synthetic identity fraud, in which personal identifiable information such as a\nSocial Security number is used to fabricate a person or entity in order to commit a fraudulent act,\n\nSee U.S. Census Bureau (2022). In this report, e-commerce sales are “sales of goods and services where the buyer\nplaces an order, or the price and terms of the sale are negotiated over an Internet, mobile device (M-commerce),\nextranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) network, electronic mail, or other comparable online system. Payment\nmay or may not be made online.”\n\n4\n\n\f5\naccounted for $20 billion in losses for U.S. financial institutions in 2020. 5, 6 Remote authentication fraud,\nin which a new account is fraudulently created in someone’ else’s name, or a victim’s account is taken\nover by using stolen credentials or information, is also on the rise. 7\n\nTo help its financial institution customers better fight fraud, the Fed has published a series of research\nbriefs and has expanded educational resources in concert with industry participants. The\nFraudClassifier℠ model is a good example of our recent efforts with the industry. The model can be used\nregardless of the payment type, payment channel, or payment characteristics to facilitate more consistent\nfraud classifications. This can help an organization improve its fraud management and responses, as well\nas more effectively educate its customers on current fraud methods and how to protect themselves. 8\n\nThe Fed is also working constantly to strengthen the defenses and enhance the resilience of our clearing\nand settlement platforms. While we have remained secure from ever-growing cybersecurity threats, we\ndo not take that for granted. We are continuously working to enhance the cybersecurity and resiliency of\nour own systems, applications, and data, to ensure that we can detect and prevent an attack on our\nsystems, and if one were to occur, making sure we can minimize the time it takes to contain it and limit\nthe business impact on our customers and the broader public. We regularly obtain cyber intelligence on\nhow actors may attempt to attack critical Federal Reserve payment systems; we regularly test our controls\nto determine their capabilities in preventing these attacks from being successful; and we are continuously\nimproving and testing our preparedness against a potential ransomware attack, which is a top threat for\norganizations, including the Fed.\n\n5\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2019).\n\n6\n\nThis estimate comes from software company FiVerity. See ABA Banking Journal (2021).\n\n7\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement, “Remote Authentication Fraud.”\n\n8\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement, “FraudClassifier Model.”\n\n\f6\ne-Invoicing\nThe Fed is also focused on enhancing payment efficiency. Just like consumers, American businesses are\neager to go electronic with payment options that provide immediate access to funds and support straightthrough processing of invoice, payment, and remittance data. Despite that desire, check usage remains\nhigh for business-to-business (B2B) payments because current electronic options pose challenges for\npayments reconciliation. To help remedy this impediment, the Fed is collaborating with the Business\nPayments Coalition to modernize B2B payments. One of the fruits of that collaboration is the e-invoice\nexchange market pilot. This is an effort to build and test a virtual network that will enable businesses of\nall kinds to exchange e-invoices by establishing a secure and open delivery framework between\nproviders. 9 The collaboration has also determined that the electronic exchange framework could be\nadapted so that businesses could share with one another a payment’s remittance information.\n\nFaster payments infrastructure\nPerhaps the most visible and eagerly anticipated innovation in payments is the establishment of instant\npayment capabilities. In the Fed’s 2021 payments survey, 62 percent of consumers said they expected to\nbe using faster payment options more extensively in the future, particularly options that offer robust fraud\nprotections. 10 Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of businesses we surveyed in 2020 said that they would\nfactor access to faster payments into future decisions on whether to switch banks. 11\n\nThe industry has made great strides in offering faster payments, and building in security features,\nincluding identity management, authentication, and robustness. Real-time settlement is an important\nsecurity feature of faster payments. When settlement is deferred, the payee’s service provider is taking on\ncredit risk until it gets the funds from the payer’s service provider. To reduce this risk, some, but not all,\n9\n\nSee Business Payments Coalition, “Electronic Invoices.”\n\n10\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2022).\n\n11\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2021).\n\n\f7\nof the faster payment systems around the world couple real-time or near real-time settlement with faster\npayments. 12\n\nThe Federal Reserve will launch its own instant payments rail incorporating real-time clearing and\nsettlement, the FedNow℠ Service, between May and July of next year. 13 As was discussed yesterday at\nthe symposium, the Fed’s goals in offering instant payments through FedNow include providing greater\nflexibility to consumers and businesses through instant access to their funds; increasing access to the\npayment system for more consumers; offering the potential for greater efficiency in B2B payments by\nincluding invoice and remittance data within payment messages; and leveling the playing field for\ncompetition. This faster-payments rail and the innovation that will emerge around it hold great promise\nin making both domestic and cross-border payments more efficient and more accessible to all.\n\nThe Fed has spent several years planning for and investing in FedNow and its launch is fast approaching.\nFinancial institutions will be able to connect to the service either directly, via their core processors, or\nthrough a technology service provider. Now is the time for industry stakeholders, including financial\ninstitutions and core service providers, to prepare themselves to use the new service, and the Fed is\nleaning in on stakeholder engagement to ensure everyone is ready. Our pilot testing program has more\nthan 120 participants and our FedNow Community portal is a great place to get information. 14 We realize\nthat for many financial institutions, getting ready to use FedNow will take some investment. Some\norganizations will need to upgrade 40-year-old payment infrastructures, accounting procedures, and other\nback-office processes to accommodate the expanded 24×7 operating hours. But the Fed is asking you to\n\n12\n\nSee Mester (2017) and Committee on Payments and Markets, Bank for International Settlements (2016).\n\n13\n\nSee Brainard (2022) for an update on FedNowSM.\n\n14\nInformation on joining the FedNow Community is available at https://www.frbservices.org/financialservices/fednow/community.\n\n\f8\nmake those investments so that you’ll be prepared to offer this new instant payments service to your\ncustomers, who are increasingly demanding faster payments.\n\nFuture Payment Innovations\nAs we continue to make improvements to the payment system today, we also have to prepare for the\nfuture. It is important for us to ensure that our payment system evolves in a productive way. Innovation,\ncompetition, collaboration, broad accessibility, common standards, risk management, and appropriate\nsupervision and regulation – all are important facets of a well-functioning payment system.\n\nDiversity of providers and technologies\nInnovation in payments is not going to stop. Partnerships between traditional financial institutions and\nnewer fintech firms are becoming more common. Indeed, many fintech firms have participated in the\nFederal Reserve’s FedNow Service Provider Showcase, a one-stop resource that connects financial\ninstitutions and businesses with service providers who can help them implement instant payment products\nusing the FedNow Service. Financial institutions are exploring opportunities to improve both back-office\nand customer-facing operations in partnership with fintech firms. 15, 16 Many banks now use application\nprogramming interfaces (APIs) and other tools to provide the underlying financial infrastructure to\nnonbank technology firms and their customers, including deposit services and access to the payment rails.\nFintechs are increasingly becoming significant providers of technological services to smaller banks,\nwhich lack the scale to develop such technologies on their own.\n\nThe growing diversity of the providers of payment services, including nonbank and fintech firms, is likely\nto continue. New tools and techniques previously unavailable to some financial institutions, including\n\n15\n\nSee Bowman (2022).\n\n16\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021).\n\n\f9\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence, are now being applied to credit underwriting, back-office\noperations, and various aspects of risk management. And learning how to apply these new technologies\nmore effectively is ongoing. For example, it is now better recognized that just because it is an algorithm\ndoes not mean it is immune from producing discriminatory underwriting and pricing decisions. Testing\nalgorithms before they are deployed and designing so-called ethical algorithms, which balance the\naccuracy of a credit-risk model with other goals such as not producing systematically higher error rates\nfor one racial group than another, are methods that can be used to avoid unintended consequences of the\nnew tools. 17\n\nJust like the industry, the Fed is actively monitoring and studying new technologies and approaches to\npayments, and we are enhancing some of our service offerings to help our customers offer better services\nto theirs. For example, last month Fed Financial Services launched the FedPayments® Insights Service,\nan analytical tool that generates reports on a financial institution’s payments settled through the\nFedACH® Service to help inform business strategy and day-to-day ACH operations. 18 We continue to\nprovide APIs to improve payment system efficiency and accessibility. 19 And so that we will be better\npositioned to meet our customers’ needs and those of the public, we have changed how Federal Reserve\nFinancial Services are organized within the Fed. As many of you know, for the past 20 years, we have\norganized financial services by product line, such as wholesale, retail, and cash. This year we have\nrestructured our services along functional lines, such as technology, operations, and customer service.\nMark Gould, who spoke yesterday, serves as our chief payments executive, overseeing Fed financial\nservices.\n\n17\n\nSee Mester (2020b) and Kearns and Roth (2020) for further discussion.\n\n18\n\nSee FRBServices (2022).\n\nExamples include our Service Status API, which monitors the availability of Fed financial services in real-time;\nFedCash Services E-Manifest API, now active as a pilot program, which gives financial institutions and armored\ncarriers greater ability to track currency shipments from order to delivery; and FedNow Service APIs, which will\nlaunch next year and report transaction details, update status and daily activity, and provide downloadable\ninformation to customers. See FRBServices.org for more information.\n19\n\n\f10\nCentral bank digital currency\nThe Fed, under direction from the Board of Governors, is also exploring emerging technologies and\nevaluating whether there is a potential role for a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the future.\nThe Federal Reserve has been researching issues raised by a CBDC for some time. To foster public\ndialog, earlier this year the Board of Governors released a discussion paper outlining potential benefits,\nrisks, and policy considerations of a U.S. CBDC and invited public comment. 20 As readers of that paper\nknow, there are numerous issues pertaining to CBDC that have to be evaluated including the implications\nfor financial stability, global financial market functioning, and the transition of monetary policy; how to\nensure security and balance privacy with transparency; and whether there is a use case for CBDC in the\nU.S. No decision has been made about whether to issue a U.S. central bank digital currency.\nNonetheless, given the evolving digitalization of the financial system, under coordination by the Board of\nGovernors, the Federal Reserve System is researching and experimenting with the underlying\ntechnologies. 21 We are gaining insights that will not only help inform a future decision on a CBDC but\nalso aid our current work on faster payments, interoperability between payment systems, and payment\nsystem resiliency.\n\nPayment security and consumer safeguards\nAs the payment system evolves, the safeguards needed to maintain the public’s confidence in the payment\nsystem will also need to evolve. Private-sector and public-sector service providers and regulators need to\nensure that user protections are in place for responsible data use and privacy, and that safeguards\nadequately protect customer accounts against cybersecurity breaches, fraud, and data leakage. It is also\nour collective responsibility to educate consumer and business users of the payment services so they can\ntake appropriate steps to protect themselves from fraud and understand the risks, which may vary across\n\n20\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022a).\n\n21\n\nMester (2020a) and Mester (2020b) discuss some of the experimentation taking place.\n\n\f11\nproducts and services, especially while there is variation in the consumer protections in place. And it is\nincumbent upon providers and regulators to continue to educate themselves as new technologies emerge.\nFor example, once quantum computing fully develops, it will disrupt the cryptography currently in place\nthat secures our payment services. Data privacy methods will also have to adapt. The traditional way of\nkeeping data private, by taking away names or otherwise anonymizing it, no longer works in a world rich\nwith multiple data sources that can be cross-referenced to de-anonymize the data and reveal identities. 22\nSo we can’t take for granted that our current methods for securing our payment system will remain valid;\nas technologies evolve, we need to evolve our methods as well.\n\nPayment system supervision\nHow we go about effectively supervising the payment system will also need to evolve to ensure that the\nsystem remains secure, effective, and broadly accessible. The public policy approach will need to change\nto include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data privacy regulation.\nTo ensure that the benefits of a better payment system are captured and the risks managed, there will need\nto be cooperation across these types of regulators, as well as international cooperation through the\nFinancial Stability Board and other international entities, given the global nature of payments and the\nentities that are now offering payments services. Extending some regulations to new services is already\noccurring; for example, payments services offered by bigtech firms are subject to “know your customer”\nrules.\n\nAs new providers enter the field, we’ll need to focus more on the risks a service entails rather than on the\ntype of entity providing the service. This will help limit regulatory arbitrage while at the same time\nsupporting financial stability and innovation. This risk-focused approach is seen in the final guidelines\n\nSee Mester (2020b) for further discussion. Kearns and Roth (2020) discuss how then-Massachusetts governor\nWilliam Weld’s medical record was identified by combining the anonymized medical records released by the state\nwith voter registration data.\n\n22\n\n\f12\napproved by the Board of Governors in August that Federal Reserve Banks will use when evaluating\nrequests from institutions for access to Fed accounts and payment services. 23 The guidelines incorporate a\nthree-tiered review framework that entails more extensive review for entities that entail greater risks. They\naim to increase transparency and to foster equitable national treatment of account requests while\nsupporting responsible innovation and appropriate risk management.\n\nConclusion\nA well-functioning and secure payment system is vital to our economy. As we modernize the payment\nsystem, it is important to remember that the foundation of a successful payment system is the public’s\nconfidence in it: confidence that it will be available whenever the customer needs it; confidence that it\nwill efficiently route and settle payments; confidence that it will be resilient against cyber attacks and\nfraudulent actors; and confidence that it can be relied upon without having to know the intricacies of the\ninfrastructure behind it. This confidence requires trust in the financial entities offering payment services.\nToday, the American public does have confidence in the payment services offered by the Federal Reserve\nSystem and the industry. But we cannot take that for granted. As the payment system evolves, the Fed,\nthe industry, and end users will need to continue to collaborate to ensure that the modern payment system\nlives up to its promise of being efficient, safe, resilient, and available to all. That’s the best way to\nmaintain the confidence of the public we serve.\n\n23\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022b).\n\n\f13\nReferences\nABA Banking Journal, “Report:

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nDistinguished Speaker Series\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology Golub Center for Finance and Policy\nCambridge, MA\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Eric Rosengren and MIT’s Golub Center for inviting me to speak today. I have known Eric pretty\nmuch over my entire career as an economist. I feel very lucky that I had the opportunity to learn from\nhim during our years at the Federal Reserve, not only about economics, financial stability, and monetary\npolicy, but about how to lead a Reserve Bank. Today, it is probably not surprising that I plan to speak\nabout inflation and the appropriate strategy for monetary policy when there is uncertainty about the path\nof both inflation and inflation expectations. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\nInflation\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well\nabove 2 percent for well over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced\neconomies around the globe. This high inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects\nan imbalance between strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward\npressures on prices. Inflation is a top concern of businesses and households: this is evident in surveys and\nin my conversations with regional contacts. High inflation is imposing a particularly onerous burden on\nthose who do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, and\nwho are now having to make hard choices about how to spend their money.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain\nhealthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive\nand live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. Stable prices mean businesses and households don’t\nhave to spend time trying to protect the purchasing power of their money; they can make long-term plans\nand commitments without having to deal with the uncertainty about the value of their money. Price\nstability and monetary policy are intimately linked, but because of the uncertainties surrounding inflation\ndynamics, setting monetary policy to achieve price stability is not trivial. It requires being able to\n\n\f2\nmeasure inflation so that we understand where inflation is relative to our goal. It requires being able to\nforecast inflation because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag that varies over time and with\neconomic circumstances. It requires understanding the determinants of the monetary policy transmission\nmechanism. It also requires having the ability to make decisions under uncertainty.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has not always been successful at achieving price stability, and there have been\nmisses on both sides. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the U.S. experienced deflation. In the\naftermath of the oil price shocks in the 1970s, inflation surged and remained high until then-Fed\nChairman Paul Volcker began to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down, at the cost of a deep\nrecession in the early 1980s. The Fed has learned from these historical episodes. One lesson is the\nimportance of a central bank remaining focused on its price stability goal.\n\nThe FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring inflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2\npercent. Last week we took another decisive action to remove monetary policy accommodation by\nraising the target range of the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and we are continuing the process of\nreducing assets on the Fed’s balance sheet, which also reduces accommodation. Reductions in monetary\npolicy accommodation and tighter financial conditions will bring demand into better balance with\nconstrained supply in both product and labor markets, resulting in an economic transition to growth in\nreal output that is well below trend, slower employment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\n[Figure 1: U.S. CPI and PCE inflation and global inflation]\nInflation continues to run at rates last seen in the early 1980s in the U.S. This is true whether one looks at\nCPI or PCE inflation. The strong increase in inflation that started in the spring of last year is very\ndifferent from what the U.S. experienced during the long pre-pandemic expansion. Until late in that\nexpansion, the concern was that inflation was running below our 2 percent longer-run goal, and this was\ntrue in other advanced economies as well. Several common factors contributed to low inflation in this\nperiod. First, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, global demand was weak. Prices of energy and other\n\n\f3\ncommodities were declining, and in the U.S., a rise in the value of the dollar put downward pressure on\nthe prices of imports into the U.S. Indeed, over the 2009-2011 period, one puzzle for policymakers was\nactually not why inflation was low, but rather, why it wasn’t lower.1 A major reason was that longer-term\ninflation expectations were relatively stable at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation, a topic that I’ll\nreturn to later.\n\nBut low and stable inflation preceded the Great Recession. Since the mid-1980s, inflation had been\nrelatively stable in spite of several wars, dramatic ups and downs in oil prices, and mild and severe\nrecessions. The fact that inflation had become less correlated with changes in resource utilization in the\nlabor market and in product markets – that is, there had been a flattening of the Phillips curve – suggested\na change in inflation dynamics.2 This hypothesis may still hold, but it is an open question as to whether\ninflation dynamics have once again changed or whether the factors that held down inflation prior to the\npandemic will exert their force again over time.\n\n[Figure 2: PCE energy, PCE food, PCE core inflation and share of components with high inflation\nrates]\nThe overriding message from a variety of measures is that inflation is not only high but it is broad-based.\nWhen inflation began to rise in April 2021, it was concentrated in a limited number of categories that\nwere directly related to the effects of the pandemic. But by later last year, those price pressures had\nbroadened across categories.\n\nEnergy prices have been a major contributor to the rise in inflation. Over the last year, the PCE energy\nprice index has increased over 30 percent. Recent readings have eased, but developments related to the\nongoing war in Ukraine suggest that gas and energy prices could move higher again later this year or\nearly next year. Food prices have also risen significantly and inflation in this component is at its highest\n\n1\n\nSee Constâncio (2015).\n\n2\n\nSee Del Negro et al. (2020).\n\n\f4\nlevel since the late 1970s. But even excluding these components, core PCE inflation is at its highest level\nsince the 1980s.\n\n[Figure 3: Real goods and services spending relative to trend]\nThe nature of the pandemic shock and the response to it affected aggregate demand and aggregate supply.\nThe mandated shutdowns and the voluntary pullback in demand for high-contact services led to a shift in\nspending early in the pandemic from services to goods. When the economy reopened, demand surged.\nThis strong demand was supported by fiscal transfers and accommodative monetary policy. Spending is\nbeginning to shift from goods to services, but neither is back to its pre-pandemic trend.\n\nThe strong demand was met by constrained supply, which was affected by supply chain bottlenecks and\nthe withdrawal of workers from the labor force. Many thought the supply constraints would work\nthemselves out fairly quickly. But rolling pandemic lockdowns across the globe in response to new\nwaves of the virus and the sluggish return of workers to the work force made it difficult for supply to keep\nup with demand. Our business contacts tell us that supply chain disruptions remain a challenge, although\nthey have learned how to better navigate them over time; they tell us that they have seen less\nimprovement in the imbalance between the demand and supply of labor.\n\n[Figure 4: Core PCE goods, services, and housing inflation]\nThe continued imbalance between demand and supply has led to intense inflationary pressures. Inflation\nin both goods and services is high, with goods inflation still exceeding services inflation. This is very\ndifferent from the pre-pandemic expansion, when core goods inflation was slightly negative on average\nand falling goods prices were pulling inflation down.\n\nConsumers spend a larger share of their income on services than on goods, so services have a higher\nweight in the inflation indices. Services inflation also tends to be more persistent than goods inflation.\nHousing, as measured by rents or imputed rents for owner-occupied housing, is a large and cyclically\n\n\f5\nsensitive component of services inflation; shelter is about a third of the CPI price index. Early in the\npandemic, high unemployment and moratoria on foreclosures and evictions initially put downward\npressure on housing inflation. Subsequently, there has been strong demand for housing and a rapid rise in\nhouse prices and rents. Activity in the housing sector has been slowing rapidly in response to higher\nmortgage rates, but there is a long-run imbalance between demand and supply of housing. So despite the\nmoderation in activity, housing prices and rents remain quite high. It typically takes some time for higher\nrents to flow through to the inflation measures, so growth in housing rent and shelter costs will likely\nkeep inflation elevated for some time.\n\n[Figure 5: Core, median, and trimmed-mean inflation measures]\nThe July reading of PCE and core PCE inflation showed a bit of moderation, which was welcome news.\nBut the August CPI report underscored that inflation pressures remain intense. Indicators of the\nunderlying inflation trend, including the trimmed-mean and median CPI and PCE measures, which\nexclude components with the most extreme movements each month, show that inflation pressures remain\nvery elevated and broad-based even though there has been some moderation in economic activity.\nMeasured year-over-year, the median and trimmed-mean inflation rates were either stable or actually\nincreased in July; in August, the median and trimmed-mean CPI rose.3\n\nWage pressures are also contributing to high inflation. They are growing much faster than the pace\nconsistent with price stability and there is little sign that wage pressures are abating.\n\n[Figure 6. SEP PCE inflation projections]\nThe evolution of projections made by FOMC participants shows that inflation has moved up much more\nand remained high for longer than anticipated. Both the demand and the supply sides of the economy will\n\n3\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n\n\f6\ncontinue to be affected by a variety of forces, including the war in Ukraine and the energy situation in\nEurope, the global economic outlook, property market stresses and continued lockdowns in China, the\nsentiment of consumers and businesses and their reaction to elevated inflation readings, changes in supply\nchain disruptions, and labor force participation. Since high inflation reflects the imbalance between\nsupply and demand, there will continue to be considerable uncertainty around the inflation forecast.\n\nInflation Expectations\nOne of the big lessons from the 1970s is that it is much more difficult and costly to bring inflation down\nonce it has become embedded in the economy, that is, once businesses and households expect inflation to\nremain elevated and that expectation influences their savings and investment decisions and price-setting\nand wage-setting behavior. High inflation imposes costs on households and businesses in both the short\nand the long run. It eats into savings and makes it hard to plan for the future. By making it more difficult\nto evaluate investment opportunities, high inflation can affect productivity growth, with long-term\nconsequences for the standard of living. The Fed’s monetary policy framework recognizes the\nimportance of keeping inflation expectations well-anchored at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.4\nAnd by “well-anchored” I mean longer-term inflation expectations that are insensitive to data.\n\nInflation expectations have been a central factor in models of inflationary dynamics since the 1960s and\n1970s.5 In many inflation models used by central banks, inflation is driven by three key factors: some\nmeasure of a resource utilization gap (for example, the output gap or unemployment rate gap), or\nmarginal cost of production; lagged inflation, which captures the inertia in the inflation process; and\nexpectations of inflation. Different models put different weights on these fundamental factors, but\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, revised in 2020 and reaffirmed since\nthen, says that the Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent\ncontribute to achieving its monetary policy goals. See Federal Open Market Committee (2022a).\n4\n\n5\n\nSee Phelps (1967), Friedman (1968), and Lucas (1972). Empirical work on the determinants of inflation finds that\nthe output gap matters when it is large and that, in recent years, forward-looking measures of inflation expectations\nplay a larger role in explaining inflation dynamics than do backward-looking measures.\n\n\f7\nhousehold and business expectations matter, since they affect wage demands and offers, and therefore\nfirms’ price-setting behavior.6 In addition to their role in inflation dynamics and helping to forecast\ninflation, inflation expectations also provide an indication of how credible the public finds the central\nbank’s commitment to achieving its policy goals.\n\nTheory indicates that well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations can help to mitigate the pull of\nresource gaps on inflation, and therefore, the cyclical movements in interest rates that policymakers\ninduce to maintain price stability need not be as large as when inflation expectations are not well\nanchored. This is particularly useful when the zero lower bound constrains interest rates. Arguably, the\nU.S. might have suffered much lower inflation during the Great Recession had inflation expectations not\nbeen relatively stable, offsetting some of the influence the negative output gap had on inflation.\nSimilarly, in the face of today’s very high inflation readings, keeping inflation expectations well anchored\nshould help to bring inflation back to goal without as large a change in the output gap. Of course, we\nhave to acknowledge that while the theory is compelling, the real world does not always cooperate. For\nexample, in Japan, inflation expectations have run well above actual inflation for a number of years.7\n\n[Figure 7: Measures of short-term and medium- and longer-term inflation expectations]\nOne difficulty in moving from theory to practice is that inflation expectations are not directly observable.\nSo we look at a number of measures, which differ by type of agent and time horizon. These include\nmeasures based on surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters; measures derived from\nfinancial markets; and composite indices that combine various measures.8 A clear signal is not always\nforthcoming because the inflation expectations of different groups of agents can behave differently from\n\n6\n\nFor further discussion, see Fuhrer and Olivei (2009) and Clark and Davig (2009).\n\n7\n\nSee Trehan and Lynch (2013) and Hattori and Yetman (2017).\n\nThe index of common inflation expectations is a research data series maintained by the Board of Governors’ staff.\nSee Ahn and Fulton (2021).\n8\n\n\f8\none another, even within groups there can be variation, and the literature has not firmly established whose\nexpectations are most important for inflation dynamics.9, 10\n\nShorter-term expectations tend to move with gasoline prices and the prices of other salient items like\nfood. Longer-term expectations and their level relative to short-term expectations give a better sense of\nwhether expectations are becoming unanchored from the target, an indication of increased risk of inflation\nbecoming embedded in the economy, and, relatedly, the level of the central bank’s credibility in the eyes\nof the public. For example, longer-term expectations remaining stable in the face of a positive shock to\ninflation would indicate that the public believes that inflation will come down, although it need not\nindicate that the public believes monetary policy will be the main driver of the reduction.\n\nThe rise in inflation expectations since last year has been concentrated in short-term expectations, which\nrose with the rise in gasoline and food prices. More recently, these short-term expectations have moved\ndown with gasoline prices. Still, they indicate that consumers expect high inflation to prevail over the\nnext year.\n\nMedium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up less than short-run expectations, and they\nare below current inflation readings, an indication that the public believes that inflation will move back\ndown. The recent decline in the New York Fed’s medium-term expectations measure and the University\nof Michigan’s longer-term expectations measure was welcome news. But despite the moderation, these\n\n9\n\nSee Candia, Coibion, and Gorodnichenko (2021).\n\n10\n\nAs discussed in De Pooter, et al. (2016), survey measures of the inflation expectations of professional forecasters\nand financial industry participants were fairly stable over the course of the Great Recession and recovery, while\nthose of households and businesses drifted down.\nIn addition, the Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations measure indicates that women, older\nrespondents, and more educated respondents have tended to expect higher inflation over the next year than do their\ncounterparts. The Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations measure, which started in 2021, is based\non a nationwide survey with more than 10,000 responses and is updated on a weekly basis. Instead of asking\nconsumers directly about overall inflation, the survey asks consumers how they expect the prices of the things they\nbuy to change over the next 12 months and how much their incomes would have to change for them to be able to\nafford the same consumption basket and be equally well-off. See Hajdini, et al. (2022).\n\n\f9\nmeasures are higher than they were before the pandemic. Longer-term expectations should be less\naffected by changes in gasoline prices than near-term expectations and more reflective of consumers’\nperceptions of the Fed’s commitment and ability to return the economy to price stability. The recent\nimprovement in measures of medium- and longer-term inflation expectations occurred as Fed\ncommunications emphasized that we were taking decisive action against high inflation. So the decline in\nthe expectations measures could indicate firmer anchoring. But the improvement also coincided with the\ndecline in gasoline prices. So it is not clear yet that the measures won’t move up again if gas prices rise,\nfood prices remain high, or inflation developments take a turn for the worse as the year progresses.\n\n[Figure 8: Dispersion among SPF and University of Michigan inflation expectations]\nDispersion in expectations across survey respondents also indicates how well inflation expectations are\nanchored, with lower dispersion indicating better anchoring.11 The recent data are mixed. During the\ncurrent period of high inflation, the dispersion in longer-tern inflation expectations across the respondents\nto the Survey of Professional Forecasts has risen only modestly. Those forecasters with relatively high\nand those with relatively low projections of inflation over the next 10 years expect PCE inflation to\naverage more than 2 percent, but this is mainly concentrated in the next five years. The 5-year/5-year\nforward projection is still basically 2 percent.\n\nIn contrast, dispersion in the longer-run inflation expectations across respondents to the University of\nMichigan’s survey has increased sharply since the start of the pandemic. Earlier it was driven by an\nincrease in expectations at the top part of the distribution; most recently there has been a sharp drop off in\nexpectations at the bottom part of the distribution, perhaps a reflection of respondents’ outlook for the\n\n11\n\nReis (2021) discusses the relationship between dispersion in inflation expectations and signs of unanchoring.\nNaggert, Rich, and Tracy (2021) find that the lower end of the distribution of 5-year/5-year-forward PCE inflation\nexpectations from the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters shifted up toward 2 percent and the dispersion of\ninflation expectations across respondents narrowed after the FOMC announced its revised monetary policy\nframework in August 2020.\n\n\f10\neconomy. Such a large and rising level of dispersion suggests that inflation expectations among\nconsumers may not be as well anchored as we would hope.\n\nMonetary Policymaking Strategy\nSince March, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 3 percentage points,\nand in June, the FOMC began to reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet according to the plan\nannounced in May.12 While this has been a relatively fast pace of tightening, given the current level of\ninflation and the outlook, I believe that further increases in our policy rate will be needed. In order to put\ninflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent, monetary policy will need to be in a restrictive\nstance, with real interest rates moving into positive territory and remaining there for some time.\n\n[Figure 9. September 2022 SEP median fed funds rate path]\nThe FOMC released a new Summary of Economic Projections last week. The median path among\nFOMC participants moved up again in response to the implications of incoming data for the outlook. In\nparticular, high inflation is proving to be more persistent, and more restrictive policy will be needed and\nfor longer to ensure that inflation expectations do not move up and that inflation moves back down.13\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain environment, and assessing the balance between supply and demand will\nremain challenging as we go. In terms of the appropriate policy responses in an environment with a lot of\nuncertainty, some results in the literature suggest that when policymakers confront more uncertainty\neither in their data or in their models, they should be more cautious in acting, that is, be more inertial in\ntheir responses.14 However, subsequent research has shown that this is not generally true. For example,\n\n12\n\nStarting in September, the Fed will allow up to $60 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $35 billion\nper month of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities\nare less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. See the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (2022b).\n13\n14\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee (2022c).\n\nSee Mester (2016). Aoki (2003) studied the optimal policy response when data are measured with error and\nconcluded that the degree of response to a variable in the policy rule should be less the higher the variable’s\n\n\f11\nSargent (1999) points out that caution does not necessarily mean doing less. When there is uncertainty, it\ncan be better for policymakers to act more aggressively because aggressive and pre-emptive action can\nprevent the worst-case outcomes from actually coming about.15 Walsh (2003, 2022) points out that better\neconomic outcomes are achieved by assuming that high inflation will be persistent and acting\naccordingly.\n\nFollowing this robust-control view, in current circumstances I am going to be very cautious and not\nassume that one or two improved readings on inflation mean inflation is on a downward path or that\ninflation expectations are firmly anchored at our goal when expectations measures are elevated. Wishful\nthinking cannot be a substitute for compelling evidence. So before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I\nwill need to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings. I will also guard against\nbeing complacent that longer-term expectations are well anchored. The longer inflation remains elevated,\nthe higher the risk that inflation expectations become unanchored and firms and households begin making\ndecisions based on persistent high inflation. Were that unanchoring to occur, returning the economy to\nprice stability would be more difficult and much more costly in terms of lost output and higher\nunemployment.\n\nResearch indicates that erroneously assuming that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at\nthe level consistent with price stability when, in fact, they are not is a more costly error for the economy\nthan assuming they are not well-anchored when they actually are.16 If inflation expectations are drifting\nup and policymakers treat them as stable, policy will be set too loose. Inflation would then move up and\nthis would be reinforced by increasing inflation expectations. And that will be harder to rein in. If, on the\n\nmeasurement error. Brainard (1967) studied optimal policy in response to a shock when there is uncertainty about\nthe effect of policy on the economy and concluded that policy should respond less when there is uncertainty than\nwhen there is no uncertainty. It has been shown that this result is not general across models.\n15\n\nGiannoni (2002 and 2007) shows policymakers averse to uncertainty will react more strongly to fluctuations in\ninflation and the output gap than if there were no uncertainty. They would put more weight on stabilizing inflation\nand the output gap and less weight on stabilizing the nominal interest rate.\n16\n\nSee De Pooter, et al. (2016) and Walsh (2022).\n\n\f12\nother hand, inflation expectations are actually stable and policymakers view the drift up with concern,\npolicy will initially be set tighter than it should. Inflation would move down, perhaps even below target,\nbut not for long, since inflation expectations are anchored at the goal.\n\nIn summary, price stability is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a healthy,\nproductive economy over time. So the FOMC will be resolute in putting inflation on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent. There will be some pain and bumps along the way as the growth in output\nand employment slow and the unemployment rate moves up. But the current persistent high inflation is\nalso very painful for many households and businesses. I do not view the current situation as one in which\nthere is a tradeoff between our two monetary policy goals. If we were to fail to take decisive action to get\ninflation down and firmly anchor inflation expectations, the costs would be high: we would not be able to\nsustain healthy labor markets over time, to the detriment of the public.\n\n\f13\nReferences\nAhn, Hie Joo, and Chad Fulton, “Research Data Series: Index of Common Inflation Expectations,” FEDS\nNotes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 5, 2021.\n(https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2873)\nAoki, Kosuke, “On the Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Noisy Indicators,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 50, April 2003, pp. 501-523.\n(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3932(03)00023-0)\nBrainard, William C., “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” American Economic Review: Papers\nand Proceedings 57, May 1967, pp. 411-425.\n(https://www.jstor.org/stable/1821642#metadata_info_tab_contents)\nCandia, Bernardo, Olivier Coibion, and Yuriy Gorodnichenko, “The Inflation Expectations of U.S. Firms:\nEvidence from a New Survey,” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 28836, May\n2021.\n(http://www.nber.org/papers/w28836)\nClark, Todd E., and Troy Davig, “The Relationship Between Inflation and Inflation Expectations,” memo\nto the FOMC, November 30, 2009, authorized for public release by the FOMC Secretariat on 4/29/2016.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20091201memo05.pdf)\nConstâncio, Vítor, “Understanding Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, 2015.\n(https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/7077/ConstancioPanelist_JH2015.pdf)\nDel Negro, Marco, Michele Lenza, Giorgio E.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMarket News International Webcast\n(via videoconference)\nSeptember 7, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the MNI webcast. I will focus my opening\nremarks on how monetary policy will foster a return to price stability, and I look forward to the questionand-answer portion of the session to hear what is on your mind. Of course, the views I present will be my\nown and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\nThe Key Economic Challenge Is High Inflation\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well\nabove 2 percent for over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced economies\naround the globe. This inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an imbalance\nbetween strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures on prices.\nInflation is the number one concern of businesses and households: this is evident in surveys and in my\nconversations with regional contacts. High inflation imposes a particularly onerous burden on those who\ndo not have the wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, and who now have\nto make some hard choices about how to spend their money.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain\nhealthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive\nand live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. The FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring\ninflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2 percent; it is taking decisive action to remove monetary\npolicy accommodation to bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and\nlabor markets. Since March of this year, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate by\n2-1/4 percentage points, and it has begun to reduce the assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet,\nwhich will also reduce accommodation. Given current rates of inflation, I believe that the Fed has more\nwork to do in order to get inflation under control. This will entail further rate increases to tighten\n\n\f2\nfinancial conditions, resulting in an economic transition to below-trend growth in nominal output, slower\nemployment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\nEconomic Growth\nEconomic activity is beginning to slow down from last year’s robust pace. It is responding to our\nmonetary policy actions and to the tightening in overall financial conditions since last year. But the\nslowdown also reflects how households and businesses are responding to very high inflation and their\nconcerns about the economic outlook, to the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and to slower\ngrowth abroad. Consumer spending, housing activity, and business investment have decelerated from the\nrobust pace seen last year. Indeed, the level of real GDP decreased in the first half of this year. Despite\nthis moderation, aggregate demand is still out of balance with aggregate supply, which remains\nconstrained due to supply chain disruptions stemming from pandemic-related shutdowns across the globe\nand the war in Ukraine. Many firms tell us that they will be investing to make their supply chains more\nresilient to be better prepared for the future. In the meantime, supply disruptions remain a challenge and\nthey have added to price pressures.\n\nAnalysts often use the rule-of-thumb that two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth means\nthe economy is in recession. I do not believe the U.S. economy is currently in a recession because the\nlabor market is so strong. I do believe that the risks of recession over the next two years have moved up\nbecause financial conditions are tightening globally, inflation is very high in many countries, global\ngrowth is slowing, and the devastating war in Ukraine is adding considerable uncertainty and downside\nrisks to the growth outlook, especially in Europe.\n\nI am in the process of preparing my submission to the Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC\nparticipants, which will be released after our next FOMC meeting in two weeks. At this point, I have not\nincorporated a recession into my baseline outlook for the U.S., but instead expect a fairly sharp slowing in\n\n\f3\nactivity, especially when compared to the robust growth the U.S. experienced in 2021. While there is\nconsiderable uncertainty, I currently expect that the U.S. economy will return to positive growth in the\nsecond half of the year, but for this year as a whole and for next year, I expect growth to run well below 2\npercent, which is my estimate of trend growth.\n\nLabor Markets\nWith the economy growing below trend, I expect labor market conditions to cool, with the unemployment\nrate rising somewhat above 4 percent by the end of next year. Some cooling off in the labor market will\nput it on more sustainable footing compared to the unsustainably tight conditions that exist today. The\nemployment report for August, released last Friday, suggests that we are beginning to see some\nmoderation but that labor market conditions remain strong.\n\nLast year, the economy added 6.7 million jobs, a robust average of over 550 thousand jobs per month.\nThis year, average job gains have slowed to about 440 thousand per month. The unemployment rate rose\nin August, but at 3.7 percent, it remains very low. The increase in the unemployment rate partly reflects\nan increase in labor force participation. The participation rate of prime-age workers has returned to where\none would expect it to be. Many people chose to retire during the pandemic and left the labor force, and\nthe overall participation rate, which includes those of retirement age, has risen only gradually. A\ncontinued rise in participation would be helpful in easing the imbalance between labor market demand\nand labor market supply. But typically, most people do not return to the job market once they have\nretired. So there is little reason to think that we will see an influx of workers that is large enough to return\nthe overall participation rate to its pre-pandemic level. Although the number of job openings has eased in\nrecent months, labor demand is still outpacing labor supply. There is still almost double the number of\nopenings per unemployed worker. To put this into perspective: in 2019, another time of tight labor\nmarkets, there were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\n\f4\nContacts across a broad spectrum of firms tell us it has been very difficult to find workers. They have\nbeen using a variety of ways to attract and retain staff, including offering more flexible work schedules,\nsigning and retention bonuses, expanded benefits, and higher base wages. The employment cost index for\nprivate industry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6.0 percent annual\npace. More recent reports suggest that wage pressures may be beginning to stabilize, but they remain\nhigh. Even so, for many workers their wage increases have not kept up with inflation, and their\npurchasing power is being eroded. With trend productivity growth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2\npercent, wage growth will need to moderate to around 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price\nstability.\n\nInflation\nAs their costs have continued to rise, businesses have been raising the prices they charge their customers\nand finding little resistance. Despite some moderation in economic activity, inflation readings continue to\nbe at the highest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation came in at about 6-1/4\npercent in July; CPI inflation was 8-1/2 percent. These readings were down slightly from their June\nreadings, mainly reflecting a sharp drop in the price of gasoline and energy. This was welcome news, but\nwe have to guard against wishful thinking becoming a substitute for compelling evidence.\n\nIn my view, it is far too soon to conclude that inflation has peaked, let alone that it is on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent. Measures of the underlying inflation trend did not uniformly decline in\nJuly,1 and given developments related to the ongoing war in Ukraine, gas and energy prices may move\nhigher again later this year. In addition, services inflation, which tends to be persistent, is at its highest\n\n1\n\nOnly the core PCE inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, declined in July. Measured year-over-year,\ncore CPI inflation and the median and trimmed-mean inflation rates, which exclude the components with extreme\nmovements, were either stable or actually increased. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmedmean PCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces the\nmedian and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rates and the median PCE inflation rate and provides analyses of inflation\nand inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n\n\f5\nlevel since the early 1990s, with growth in housing rent and shelter costs likely to keep inflation elevated\nfor some time. In my view, it will take a while for inflation to return to the Fed’s 2 percent goal. But I do\nexpect inflation to move down into a range of 5 to 6 percent for this year and then to make more progress\ntoward our goal over the next two years, because I expect the Fed to take further action to make it so.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. Monetary\npolicy cannot affect the supply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings.\nInstead, it works on the demand side of the economy. The Fed is being resolute and intentional in\ntightening financial conditions to bring demand into better balance with supply to alleviate price\npressures. Since March, we have raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 2-1/4\npercentage points and financial conditions are tighter than they were at the end of last year.\n\nIn addition, in June we began to reduce the size of our balance sheet according to the plan announced in\nMay.2 Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction in our balance sheet is being\ndone primarily by adjusting how much we reinvest of the principal payments we receive on our assets.\nWithout asset sales, the process could take three years or so. I would favor the FOMC’s considering\nselling some of our agency mortgage-backed securities at some point during balance-sheet reduction in\norder to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury securities.3 Holding\n\n2\n\nStarting in September, the Fed will allow up to $60 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $35 billion\nper month of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities\nare less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. See the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (2022b).\n3\n\nAs indicated in the minutes of the March 2022 FOMC meeting, FOMC participants generally agreed that after\nbalance-sheet reduction was well underway, it would be appropriate to consider sales of agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities. See the Federal Open Market Committee (2022a), pp. 4-5.\n\n\f6\nmainly Treasuries will help to minimize the effect of the Fed’s holdings on the allocation of credit across\neconomic sectors.4\n\nAs is always the case, we will be calibrating our monetary policy based on the implications of incoming\ninformation for the economic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals. Monetary\npolicy acts with a lag on the economy. It is unlikely that we have seen the full effect on households and\nbusinesses of the rate increases we have implemented so far. Moreover, because of the lagged effects of\nmonetary policy, it would not be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2\npercent. That said, given the current level of inflation and the economic outlook, I believe that further\nincreases in our policy rate are needed.\n\nWe will need to move policy into a restrictive stance in order to put inflation on a sustained downward\ntrajectory to 2 percent. That means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is,\nreal interest rates, will need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Right now,\nnominal short-term interest rates are lower than expected inflation, so short-term real interest rates are still\nnegative and monetary policy is still accommodative. My current view is that it will be necessary to\nmove the nominal fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next year and hold it there; I do\nnot anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year. But let me emphasize that this is based\non my current reading of the economy and outlook. While it is clear that the fed funds rate needs to move\nup from its current level, the size of rate increases at any particular FOMC meeting and the peak fed funds\nrate will depend on the inflation outlook, which depends on the assessment of how rapidly aggregate\ndemand and supply are coming back into better balance and price pressures are being reduced.\n\n4\n\nOne potential way to implement sales would be to sell agency securities up to the cap in any month in which\nprincipal payments were less than the cap. This is similar to our treatment of Treasuries. Another way to implement\nsales would be to set a monthly floor on reductions, which would be met first by principal payments received and\nthen by sales. See Mester (2022a).\n\n\f7\nMaking that assessment will remain challenging because there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding\nthe outlook for the global economy. Both the demand side and the supply side of the economy will be\naffected by a variety of forces, including the war in Ukraine and the energy situation in Europe, the global\neconomic outlook, the sentiment of consumers and businesses and their reaction to elevated inflation\nreadings, changes in supply chain disruptions, and labor force participation.\n\nIn formulating my monetary policy views, I will be guarding against declaring victory over the inflation\nbeast too soon. Doing so would put us back in the stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s,\nwhich was very costly to households and businesses.5 Before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will\nneed to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings.\n\nI will be carefully watching measures of inflation expectations, particularly expectations of inflation over\nthe medium and longer term. The rise in inflation expectations since last year has been concentrated in\nshorter-term expectations, which tend to move with gasoline prices and the prices of other salient items\nlike food. Nonetheless, medium- and longer-term expectations remain at the upper end of the range of\nvalues consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, and they could move up further depending on inflation\ndevelopments over the balance of the year. A risk-management perspective on monetary policymaking\nstrongly argues against being complacent about a rise in longer-term expectations. If longer-term\ninflation expectations were to become unanchored and move above levels consistent with our longer-run\ninflation goal, high inflation would become embedded in the economy, affecting the actions of both firms\nand consumers; at that point, it would be considerably more difficult and more costly to bring inflation\ndown. Better economic outcomes are achieved when policymakers assume that rises in inflation and\ninflation expectations are persistent and act forcibly to bring both down.6 Such action gives the public\n\n5\n\nFor a short, readable history, see Sablik (2013).\n\n6\n\nSee Mester (2022b), De Pooter, et al. (2016), Walsh (2022), and Schnabel (2022).\n\n\f8\nmore confidence that policymakers are committed to ensuring price stability, and this helps to anchor the\npublic’s expectations about inflation, reinforcing the effect of the policy action itself.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\nThe return to price stability will take some time and a lot of fortitude. There will be bumps along the\nroad. Financial markets could well remain volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could\nslow more than expected and return to negative territory; and the unemployment rate could move above\nestimates of its longer-run level. This will be painful in the near term but so is high inflation. High\ninflation imposes costs on households and businesses in both the short and long run. It eats into savings\nand makes it hard to plan for the future. Perhaps Paul Volcker said it best as he fought inflation in the\n1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation will only make any subsequent effort\nmore difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”7\n\nIn summary, price stability is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a healthy,\nproductive economy over time. I do not view the current situation as one in which there is a tradeoff\nbetween our two monetary policy goals. If we fail to take decisive action to get inflation down and firmly\nanchor inflation expectations, we will not be able to sustain healthy labor markets over the medium and\nlong run, to the detriment of the public.\n\n7\n\nVolcker (1981), p. 2.\n\n\f9\nReferences\nDe Pooter, Michiel, Alan Detmeister, Eric Engstrom, Don Kim, David Lebow, Canlin Li, Elmar Mertens,\nJeremy Nalewaik, Marius Rodriguez, Jae Sim, Brad Strum, Robert Tetlow, Min Wei, and Emre Yoldas,\n“Longer-Term Inflation Expectations: Evidence and Policy Implications,” memo to the FOMC, March 4,\n2016, authorized for public release by the FOMC Secretariat on 1/14/2022.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20160304memo07.pdf)\nFederal Open Market Committee, Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 15-16, 2022a.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20220316.pdf)\nFederal Open Market Committee, Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,\nMay 4, 2022b.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm)\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx)\nMester, Loretta J., “The FOMC’s Plan for Significantly Reducing the Federal Reserve’s Securities\nHoldings,” panel remarks, 2022 Financial Markets Conference: A New Era of Financial Innovation and\nDisruption: Challenges and Opportunities, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Amelia Island, FL, May 10,\n2022a.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20220510-the-fomcs-plan-forsignificantly-reducing-the-federal-reserves-securities-holdings.aspx)\nMester, Loretta J., “The Role of Inflation Expectations in Monetary Policymaking: A Practitioner’s\nPerspective,” European Central Bank Forum on Central Banking: Challenges for Monetary Policy in a\nRapidly Changing World, Sintra, Portugal, June 29, 2022b.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20220629-the-role-of-inflationexpectations-in-monetary-policymaking)\nSablik, Tim, “Recession of 1981-82,” Federal Reserve History, Federal Reserve System, November 22,\n2013.\n(https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1981-82)\nSchnabel, Isabel, “Monetary Policy and the Great Volatility,” panel remarks at the Economic Policy\nSymposium, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 27, 2022.\n(https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220827~93f7d07535.en.html)\nVolcker, Paul A. “No Time for Backsliding,” remarks at the National Press Club, Washington, DC,\nSeptember 25, 1981.\n(https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/statements-speeches-paul-a-volcker-451/time-backsliding-8243)\nWalsh, Carl E., “Inflation Surges and Monetary Policy,” Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies,\nBank of Japan, IMES Discussion Paper Series, 2022-E-12, July 2022.\n(https://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/abstracts/english/22-E-12.html)\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGovernment Affairs Breakfast\nDayton Area Chamber of Commerce\nDayton, OH\nAugust 31, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a great pleasure to be with you today, and I thank Jackie Gamblin for the kind introduction. As many\nof you know, in addition to being CEO of JYG Innovations, Jackie is also a director of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Jackie for her public service to my\norganization and to the country. Jackie and her fellow directors provide a wealth of information on the\neconomic circumstances of households and businesses in their regions. The information comes from their\nown firms and customers, as well as other business and community contacts like you. In the\nunprecedented environment we have all had to confront since the start of the pandemic, I cannot overstate\nthe value of this reconnaissance in helping me and my colleagues at the Fed formulate monetary policy.\n\nIndeed, since I last spoke at this breakfast four years ago, much has transpired. At that time, the economy\nwas in the ninth year of an expansion; labor markets were strong; and inflation was finally moving up to\nour 2 percent goal after running below this goal for some time. The Fed was continuing to increase its\npolicy rate, the fed funds rate, to be consistent with these healthy economic conditions and the outlook.\nThe economic expansion continued for another two years, until the pandemic changed all that. The\nresilience shown by households and businesses over the past two challenging years has been truly\nremarkable. Yet many challenges remain; in particular, inflation, which is at a 40-year high, is a serious\nburden for households, businesses, and the overall economy. Today, I will focus my remarks on how\nmonetary policy will foster a return to price stability. Of course, the views I present will be my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe Economy\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well\nabove 2 percent for over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced economies\naround the globe. This inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an imbalance\n\n\f2\nbetween strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures on prices.\nVarious surveys and my conversations with regional contacts reveal that inflation is the number one\nconcern of businesses and households. It imposes a particularly onerous burden on those who don’t have\nthe wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, whose inflation rates have\nbeen particularly high.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain\nhealthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive\nand live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. The FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring\ninflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2 percent; it is taking decisive action to remove monetary\npolicy accommodation to bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and\nlabor markets. Since March of this year, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate by\n2-1/4 percentage points, and it has begun to reduce the assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet,\nwhich will also reduce accommodation. Given current rates of inflation, I believe that the Fed has more\nwork to do in order to get inflation under control. This will entail further rate increases to tighten\nfinancial conditions, resulting in an economic transition to below-trend growth in nominal output, slower\nemployment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\nEconomic Growth\nIn fact, we are beginning to see activity slow down from last year’s robust pace. In part, this can be\nattributed to our monetary policy actions and the tightening in overall financial conditions compared to a\nyear ago. But it also reflects households’ and businesses’ responses to very high inflation and their\nconcerns about the economic outlook, as well as the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and\nslower growth abroad. Consumer spending, housing activity, and business investment have decelerated\nfrom the robust pace seen last year. Indeed, real GDP moved down in the first half of this year. In the\nfirst quarter, the main contributors to the decline in output were declines in net exports and government\n\n\f3\nspending and slower inventory investment, but consumer and business spending remained solid. The\nsecond quarter saw slower growth in these components as well. While manufacturing surveys suggest\nactivity has moderated, firms in our region tell us that their strong order books should keep them busy at\nleast through the end of the year. In response to higher mortgage rates, residential investment, one of the\nmost interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, also fell quite sharply in the second quarter. Yet,\nbecause the supply of housing has not kept up with demand, housing prices and rents remain quite\nelevated.\n\nIndeed, supply constraints have posed a significant challenge across a variety of sectors since the\neconomy reopened after the pandemic shutdowns. In product markets, firms have had to deal with a\ncascading set of disruptions to their global supply chains. These disruptions stem from pandemic-related\nshutdowns across the globe and the war in Ukraine, which has further constrained supplies in energy,\nmetals, and agricultural commodity markets. Firms in Dayton and other parts of our region tell us that the\nsupply challenges have lasted longer than they expected and they have had to be creative in meeting those\nchallenges. Some manufacturers are stockpiling large volumes of materials to have them on hand to meet\nfuture demand or to fill their backlogged orders. Other firms are custom making parts to substitute for\nthose that are unavailable. Many have been trying to adjust their inventories to be better prepared to meet\ncurrent and future demand, which explains some of the overstocking at the end of last year, followed by\nslower inventory building this year. Many firms tell us that they will be investing to make their supply\nchains more resilient to be better prepared for the future.\n\nAnalysts often use the rule-of-thumb that two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth means\nthe economy is in recession. I do not believe the U.S. economy is currently in a recession because the\nlabor market remains very strong. I do acknowledge that the risks of recession over the next year or two\nhave moved up because financial conditions are tightening globally, inflation remains at high levels in\nmany countries, and the devastating war in Ukraine adds considerable uncertainty and downside risks to\n\n\f4\nthe growth outlook, especially in Europe. That said, at this point, I have not incorporated a recession into\nmy baseline outlook for the U.S., but instead expect a fairly sharp slowing in activity, especially when\ncompared to the robust growth the U.S. experienced in 2021. While there is considerable uncertainty, I\ncurrently expect that the U.S. economy will return to positive growth in the second half of the year, but\nfor this year as a whole and for next year, I expect growth to run well below 2 percent, which is my\nestimate of trend growth.\n\nLabor Markets\nWith the economy growing below trend, I expect the current very strong labor market conditions to cool,\nwith the unemployment rate rising somewhat above 4 percent by the end of next year. Some cooling off\nin the labor market will put it on more sustainable footing compared to the unsustainably tight conditions\nthat exist today.\n\nThe economy added 6.7 million jobs last year, an average of over 550 thousand jobs per month, which is\nvery robust. There are widespread reports from a broad spectrum of firms about how hard it has been to\nfind workers. Even so, employment growth has remained very strong this year. Job gains averaged about\n460 thousand per month over the first half of the year, and they accelerated in July. The unemployment\nrate fell to 3.5 percent, matching the lowest level reached during the long pre-pandemic expansion.\nAlthough the number of job openings has eased in recent months, they remain at historically high levels:\nthere are close to 2 openings per unemployed worker; in 2019, another time of tight labor markets, there\nwere about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\nA variety of reasons have contributed to people leaving the workforce early in the pandemic and then\nonly slowly returning. These include responsibilities for caring for children or other family members;\nfear of the virus; reevaluation of their careers; and retirement. Reduced immigration has also constrained\nlabor supply. The participation rate of prime-age workers has returned to where one would expect it to\n\n\f5\nbe. Overall participation, which includes those of retirement age, has improved, but only gradually.\nTypically, most people don’t return to the job market once they have retired. So there is little reason to\nthink that we will see an influx of workers large enough to return the overall participation rate to its prepandemic level.\n\nFirms have been using a variety of ways to attract and retain staff, including offering more flexible work\nschedules, signing and retention bonuses, expanded benefits, and higher base wages. Wage pressures\nhave been building up for a while and show little sign of abating. The employment cost index for private\nindustry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6.0 percent annual pace.\nEven so, these wage increases have not kept up with inflation, so workers’ purchasing power is being\neroded. Higher wages that reflect higher productivity growth don’t contribute to inflation, and they are a\npositive for both workers and firms. But current wage increases are not consistent with inflation returning\nto our 2 percent goal. With trend productivity growth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, wage\ngrowth will need to moderate to around 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price stability. As\nformer Fed Chair Paul Volcker pointed out in the midst of his fight against very high inflation in 1981:\n“[Wage gains], when they are not grounded in real growth and productivity, are a kind of economic ‘shell\ngame’ in which rising incomes disappear at the supermarket or the shoe store… .” 1\n\nInflation\nAs their costs have continued to rise, businesses have been raising the prices they charge their customers\nand finding little resistance. Over the past year, price pressures have broadened across goods and\nservices, and despite some moderation in economic activity, inflation readings continue to be at the\nhighest levels in 40 years. To assess the inflation situation, I look at a variety of measures. The Fed has\nset its inflation target in terms of PCE inflation. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation came in at about\n6-1/4 percent in July; CPI inflation was 8-1/2 percent. These readings were down slightly from their June\n1\n\nVolcker (1981a), p. 2.\n\n\f6\nreadings, mainly reflecting a sharp drop in the price of gasoline and energy. This was welcome news, but\nwe have to guard against wishful thinking becoming a substitute for compelling evidence.\n\nIn my view, it is far too soon to conclude that inflation has peaked, let alone that it is on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent. First, measures of the underlying inflation trend did not uniformly decline in\nJuly. Only the core PCE inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, declined. Measured year-overyear, core CPI inflation and the median and trimmed-mean inflation rates, which exclude the components\nwith extreme movements, were either stable or actually increased. 2 Second, in the coming months, goods\ninflation may slow in response to easing demand and the appreciation of the dollar, but the prices of\nenergy and other commodities are set in global markets, and developments related to the ongoing war in\nUkraine may lead to higher prices later this year. Third, inflation in the prices of services tends to be\nmore persistent. Services inflation is at its highest level since the early 1990s, and growth in housing rent\nand shelter costs, which represent a large share of measured inflation, will likely keep inflation elevated\nfor some time. All of this suggests that it will take a while for inflation to reach the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\nI expect inflation to move down into a range of 5 to 6 percent for this year and then to make more\nprogress toward our goal over the next two years, but it will require further action on the part of the Fed to\nmake that so.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. Monetary\npolicy cannot affect the supply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings.\nInstead, it works on the demand side of the economy. The Fed is being resolute and intentional in\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public.\n2\n\n\f7\ntightening financial conditions to bring demand into better balance with supply to alleviate price\npressures. Since March, we have raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 2-1/4\npercentage points and financial conditions are tighter than they were at the end of last year.\n\nIn addition, in June we began to reduce the size of our balance sheet according to the plan announced in\nMay. 3 Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction in our balance sheet is being\ndone primarily by adjusting how much we reinvest of the principal payments we receive on our assets.\nWithout asset sales, the process could take three years or so. 4\n\nMonetary policy acts with a lag on the economy. So even though other financial conditions, like\nmortgage rates, have adjusted, it is likely we have not yet seen the full effect of the rate increases we have\nimplemented so far on households and businesses. Given the lagged effects of monetary policy, it would\nnot be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2 percent. As is always the\ncase, we will be calibrating our policy based on the implications of incoming information for the\neconomic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals. That said, at our last meeting,\nthe FOMC indicated that it anticipates that ongoing rate increases in the fed funds rate will be appropriate.\nI certainly agree with that view.\n\nGiven the current level of inflation and the economic outlook, I anticipate that policy will need to move\ninto a restrictive stance in order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent. In my\n\nStarting in September, the Fed will allow up to $60 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $35 billion\nper month of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities\nare less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. See the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (2022b).\n\n3\n\nAs indicated in the minutes of the March 2022 FOMC meeting, FOMC participants generally agreed that after\nbalance-sheet reduction was well underway, it would be appropriate to consider sales of agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Sales would help to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury\nsecurities, consistent with the FOMC’s stated desire to minimize the effect of the Fed’s balance-sheet holdings on\nthe allocation of credit across economic sectors. See the Federal Open Market Committee (2022a), pp. 4-5.\n\n4\n\n\f8\nview, that means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is, real interest rates,\nwill need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Right now, nominal short-term\ninterest rates are lower than expected inflation, so short-term real interest rates are still negative and\nmonetary policy is still accommodative. The current level of the fed funds rate is near the range of\nestimates of its longer-run nominal level, and when inflation is at 2 percent and inflation expectations are\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation, this longer-run level would be neutral in the sense of neither\nstimulating nor restraining economic activity. But in the current high-inflation environment, a\n2-1/2 percent nominal funds rate is still accommodative and the Fed has more work to do. My current\nview is that it will be necessary to move the fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next\nyear and hold it there; I do not anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year. But let me\nemphasize that this is based on my current reading of the economy and outlook. While it is clear that the\nfed funds rate needs to move up from its current level, the size of rate increases at any particular FOMC\nmeeting and the peak fed funds rate will depend on the inflation outlook, which depends on the\nassessment of how rapidly aggregate demand and supply are coming back into better balance and price\npressures are being reduced.\n\nMaking that assessment will remain challenging because there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding\nthe outlook for the global economy, with a variety of forces affecting the demand and supply sides of the\neconomy. The war in Ukraine and the energy situation in Europe could impose further costs on the\npeople in that region and on the global economy, posing downside risks to growth but upside risks to\ninflation. A souring in consumer and business sentiment and reactions to elevated inflation readings\ncould result in a larger than anticipated moderation in activity. There are some potential positives on the\nsupply side of the economy. The newly passed fiscal package may have a larger effect on productivity\ngrowth and inflation over the near term than current private-sector estimates suggest. 5 And with some\n\nAnalysis by Penn Wharton Budget Model (2022) indicates that the Inflation Reduction Act would reduce\ncumulative government deficits by $264 billion over the 10-year budget window, have no meaningful effect on\n\n5\n\n\f9\nluck, supply chain disruptions will abate faster than anticipated and labor market participation will\ncontinue to rise, helping to ease supply constraints in product and labor markets and bringing supply into\nbetter balance with demand. But we cannot rely on luck.\n\nIt would be a mistake to declare victory over the inflation beast too soon. Doing so would put us back in\nthe stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s, which was very costly to households and\nbusinesses. 6 In assessing the appropriate stance of policy, I will be looking for compelling evidence that\ninflation is on a sustainable downward trajectory to our 2 percent goal. Before I conclude that inflation\nhas peaked, I will need to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings. I will also be\ncarefully watching measures of inflation expectations, particularly expectations of inflation over the\nmedium and longer term. Currently, consumers and businesses expect inflation to be well above 2\npercent over the next year. While recent readings of medium- and longer-term expectations have eased\noff a bit, they have moved up over time and are at the upper end of the range of values consistent with our\ninflation goal. Research indicates that changes in the prices of particular salient items, including gasoline\nand food, can have an outsized effect on households’ inflation expectations. 7 Gas prices have come down\nfrom recent highs but with the uncertainty surrounding world oil supply, gasoline prices could rise again,\nand food prices might remain high.\n\nWe need to be particularly attuned to inflation expectations. If longer-term inflation expectations were to\nbecome unanchored and move above levels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal, high inflation\nwould become embedded in the economy, affecting the actions of both firms and consumers; at that point\nit would be considerably more difficult and more costly to bring inflation down. A risk-management\n\ninflation in the near term, but would reduce inflation by 0.1 percentage point by the middle of the first decade. See\nPenn Wharton Budget Model (2022).\n6\n\nFor a short, readable history, see Sablik (2013).\n\n7\nFor the effect of experiences from high-inflation eras on inflation expectations, see Malmendier and Nagel (2016).\nFor the effect of salient prices on inflation expectations, see Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), Cavallo, Cruces,\nand Perez-Truglia (2017), D’Acunto, et al. (2021), and Campos, McMain, and Pedemonte (2022).\n\n\f10\nperspective strongly argues against policymakers being complacent about a rise in longer-term\nexpectations. Instead, better economic outcomes are achieved if policymakers assume rises in inflation\nand inflation expectations are persistent and act forcibly to bring both down. It is good to remember that\ninflation expectations are determined not only by movements in inflation but also by policymakers’\nactions to follow through on their strongly stated commitment to price stability, thereby justifying the\npublic’s belief in our commitment.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\nThe return to price stability will take some time and a lot of fortitude. There will be bumps along the\nroad. Financial markets could well remain volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could\nslow more than expected; and the unemployment rate could move above estimates of its longer-run level.\nThis will be painful in the near term but so is high inflation. High inflation imposes costs on households\nand businesses in both the short and long run. It eats into savings and makes it hard to plan for the future.\nIf we fail to take the actions needed to get inflation down and firmly anchor inflation expectations, we\nwill not be able to sustain healthy labor markets over the medium and long run, to the detriment of the\npublic.\n\nAs Paul Volcker said as he fought inflation in the 1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on\ninflation will only make any subsequent effort more difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.” 8\nThat statement is as true now as it was then. That is why I remain resolute in setting monetary policy to\nreturn the economy to price stability, which is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a\nhealthy, productive economy over time.\n\n8\n\nVolcker (1981b), p. 2.\n\n\f11\nReferences\nCampos, Chris, Michael McMain, and Mathieu Pedemonte, “Understanding Which Prices Affect\nInflation Expectations,” Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Number 2022-06,\nApril 19, 2022.\n(https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-ec-202206)\nCavallo, Alberto, Guillermo Cruces, and Ricardo Perez-Truglia, “Inflation Expectations, Learning, and\nSupermarket Prices: Evidence from Survey Experiments,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics\n9, 2017, pp. 1-35.\n(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20150147)\nCoibion, Olivier, and Yuriy Gorodnichenko, “Is the Phillips Curve Alive and Well after All?

        "content": "An Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPhiladelphia Council for Business Economics\nPhiladelphia, PA\n(via videoconference)\nJune 2, 2022\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\nI thank Michael Weiss and the Philadelphia Council for Business Economics (PCBE) for inviting me to\nspeak today. It is nice to be back in Philly, if only virtually. I spent many years at the Philadelphia Fed\nand fondly remember attending many of the PCBE’s programs, which were held at the Bank. The\nconversations were always relevant, with attendees providing a variety of valuable insights into the\neconomy, financial markets, and policy. So I am looking forward to engaging with you today. But before\nwe start, I need to remind you that the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe key challenge facing the economy is unacceptably high inflation, which reflects the imbalance\nbetween strong aggregate demand and constrained aggregate supply. The FOMC is committed to using\nits tools to get inflation under control, on a downward trajectory to its longer-run inflation goal of 2\npercent, and the Committee has begun the process of repositioning monetary policy. This recalibration\nreflects the evolution of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and the risks around the outlook, and\nas the recalibration proceeds, it will continue to do so.\n\nThe Economy\nLast year, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong.\nReal GDP grew at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent, the highest since 1984 and well above the trend growth\nrate, which I estimate to be about 2 percent. Growth this year has been expected to slow from this robust\npace, and in the first quarter, growth actually turned negative. But the details of the report suggest that\ndemand momentum remained strong. The main contributors to the decline in output were declines in net\nexports and government spending, and slower inventory investment. The decline in net exports reflected\na pullback in foreign demand for our exports amid continued robust domestic demand for imports.\nGovernment spending fell but remained at a high level. The pace at which firms invested in inventories\nwas still very strong, just not as strong as the robust pace seen in the fourth quarter. Supported by savings\n\n\f2\n\naccumulated during the pandemic, consumer spending grew at a solid pace in the first quarter, and growth\nin business fixed investment was solid as well. The April personal consumption data indicate that even\nthough consumers are paying higher prices, they are continuing to spend. Indeed, adjusted for inflation,\nconsumer spending increased on nondurable goods, durable goods, and services.\n\nStrong demand has occurred in the face of very constrained supply in both product and labor markets.\nProduct markets have had to deal with a cascading set of disruptions to supply chains, reflecting\ndifferences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across the globe. China’s zero-COVID\npolicy has further disrupted supply chains, and Russia’s dastardly invasion of Ukraine has further\nconstrained supplies in energy, metals, and agricultural commodity markets. Some of our business\ncontacts have characterized the situation as akin to Whac-A-Mole. As soon as they figure out how to\nsolve a problem in one part of their supply chain, a problem arises in another part. This has meant that\nthe supply chain disruptions have lasted a lot longer than businesses expected. For example, last\nDecember, almost two-thirds of our business contacts who were having supply chain problems thought\nthey would see meaningful improvement this year. Now only a third do. Firms have told us that\nmanaging their supply chains and their workforce to meet demand has taken attention away from other\nactivities, such as new product innovation, which could affect the longer-run competitiveness of their\nfirms. The recent industrial production data indicate that manufacturers have been able to maintain solid\nproduction, even if doing so has taken considerable effort.\n\nHiring and retention have also required significant effort by businesses. Labor markets are very tight.\nThe economy added 6.7 million jobs last year, and monthly payroll gains have averaged above 500\nthousand over the first four months of this year. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent and is\nnear the lowest level reached during the long pre-pandemic expansion. Labor force participation remains\nbelow its pre-pandemic level. A variety of reasons have contributed to the reduced supply of workers and\npeople leaving the workforce and then only slowly returning to work during the pandemic. These include\n\n\f3\n\nresponsibility for caring for children or other family members; fear of the virus; reevaluation of their\ncareers; retirement; and reduced immigration. Over time, participation has improved significantly, but\nlabor supply has not been able to keep up with robust labor demand. Job openings are at historically high\nlevels: there are almost 2 openings per unemployed worker; in 2019, another time of tight labor markets,\nthere were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker. The performance of the labor market over the\npast two years is even more remarkable when you think back to the early months of the pandemic. In just\ntwo months, March and April of 2020, the economy lost about 22 million jobs – about the number it had\ngained over the long pre-pandemic expansion – and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent.\nConditions are vastly different now.\n\nWith demand out of balance with supply in both product and labor markets, prices and wages have moved\nup significantly. When costs first started to rise, firms told us they were reluctant to pass on these higher\ncosts to customers. But as costs have continued to rise, firms have been passing higher costs on in the\nform of higher prices and finding little resistance. Inflation readings are now at their highest levels in 40\nyears. Measured year-over-year, in April, total PCE inflation was over 6-1/4 percent, core PCE inflation\nwas nearly 5 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation was over 4-1/4 percent. When\ninflation started to move up earlier last year, it was concentrated mainly in goods and services most\ndirectly affected by the pandemic and its effects on supply chains, such as used cars and home furniture.\nAs the economy reopened, people who accumulated savings when things were shut down have been able\nto travel and eat out more, and prices for these and other services are now rising sharply. Indeed, price\npressures have broadened to a wide set of goods and services. One way to see this is to look at the 44\ncomponents that are used to construct the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation measure. Measured yearover-year, median CPI rose at a 5.2 percent rate in April, with 64 percent of components having yearover-year inflation rates of 5 percent or more, and 82 percent of components having inflation rates of\n3 percent or more. In contrast, a year ago, the median CPI measure of inflation was 2.1 percent, and\n\n\f4\n\n41 percent of components had inflation rates under 2 percent. 1\n\nWage pressures have also built up over time. The employment cost index for private industry workers\naccelerated over the three months ending in March, rising at a 5.8 percent annual pace. Higher wages that\nreflect higher productivity growth are a positive for the economy, and a higher level of wages represents a\nshift of income share from capital to labor. But the current pace of wage increases is inconsistent with\nmaintaining price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its goals of price stability and maximum employment. While monetary policy cannot affect the\nsupply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings, it can affect the demand side\nof the economy. The Fed is committed to using its tools to get inflation under control by tightening\nfinancial conditions to bring excess demand into better balance with constrained supply.\n\nThe FOMC raised its policy rate by 25 basis points at its March meeting and by another 50 basis points at\nits May meeting, and the Committee indicated that it believes ongoing rate increases will be appropriate.\nIn addition, yesterday the Fed began reducing the size of its balance sheet according to the plan\nannounced in May. Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction will be done\nprimarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments the Fed receives on its assets.\nWithout asset sales, the process could take three years or so. The Fed is starting by allowing up to\n$30 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion per month of agency securities to run\noff its balance sheet. In three months, these caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and\n\n1\nThe median CPI and median PCE inflation measures are maintained by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation\nResearch and are available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n\n\f5\n\n$35 billion per month for agency securities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are\nless than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. As securities\nrun off the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet, the Fed’s liabilities, which include reserve balances, will\nalso decline. The balance sheet will continue to shrink until reserve balances are close to the level the\nFOMC judges is consistent with implementing monetary policy via its ample reserves operating regime.\nIn this regime, reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not needed.\n\nWith the interest rate moves we have made so far, the current target range of the federal funds rate is 75 to\n100 basis points. This is well below the range of estimates of the longer-run nominal policy rate that\nwould be neutral in the sense of neither stimulating nor restraining economic activity when inflation is\n2 percent. For example, in the March Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, the\nrange of estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate was 2 to 3 percent. My own estimate is 2-1/2 percent.\nIf inflation were 2 percent, with longer-term inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with the\n2 percent goal, this would imply a neutral real fed funds rate of 1/2 percent. But in the current high\ninflation environment, the real fed funds rate remains very negative. So given economic conditions,\nongoing increases in the fed funds rate are called for. Unless there are some big surprises, I expect it to\nbe appropriate to raise the policy rate another 50 basis points at each of our next two meetings.\n\nAt that point, the nominal funds rate will be nearing the lower end of estimates of the longer-run neutral\nrate and the balance-sheet reduction will have been underway for two months. The FOMC will then be\nwell positioned to consider the appropriate pace at which to continue removing accommodation over the\nbalance of the year and assess how high rates will need to go. In my view, with inflation as elevated as it\nis, the funds rate will probably need to go above its longer-run neutral level to rein in inflation. But we\ncannot make that call today because it will depend on how much demand moderates and what happens on\n\n\f6\n\nthe supply side of the economy. So, we need to continue monitoring economic and financial\ndevelopments closely to gauge the balance between demand and supply and the evolution of price\npressures. Making this assessment will be challenging because a variety of forces will be affecting the\ndemand and supply sides of the economy as the year progresses. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the\nCOVID lockdowns in China pose upside risks to inflation but downside risks to growth. On the demand\nside, broader financial conditions have already tightened considerably, as markets have anticipated further\nrate increases in light of the Fed’s forward guidance. For example, the 30-year mortgage rate was under\n3 percent last September and is now about 5-1/4 percent, and recent data suggest some tempering in\nhousing market activity. It could be that the relatively swift tightening in financial conditions means that\nmonetary policy will transmit throughout the economy faster than in past cycles and that demand will\nmoderate more quickly, too. The effects of the fiscal stimulus provided during the pandemic are also\nwaning, which will help to moderate growth. In addition, elevated inflation readings may also result in a\npullback in spending more generally. On the supply side of the economy, with some luck, supply chain\ndisruptions will begin to abate and labor market participation will continue to rise, helping to ease supply\nconstraints and allowing supply in product and labor markets to come into better balance with demand.\nBut we cannot rely on luck.\n\nWith both demand-side and supply-side factors contributing to high inflation, and because inflation tends\nto be persistent, it will likely take some time for inflation to reach our longer-run goal of 2 percent. I will\nbe looking for compelling evidence that inflation is on a downward trajectory toward our 2 percent goal,\nand before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will need to see several months of sustained downward\nmonthly readings of inflation. I have not seen that yet. On the positive side, the monthly increases in the\ncore PCE price index were relatively stable over February, March, and April. But in April, the monthly\nreadings of both core CPI inflation and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation reversed the declines\nseen in March. Rising rents and rising prices of energy, agricultural products, and other commodities can\nbe expected to continue to feed through to overall inflation for a time.\n\n\f7\n\nIn my view, a risk-management approach argues for being cautious about declaring that inflation is on a\nsustainable downward path because the inflation risks are to the upside and because the longer inflation\nruns above our goal, the higher the risk that longer-term inflation expectations will become unanchored,\nthereby making the return to price stability much more costly. We already see that medium- and longerterm inflation expectations have moved up over time. The Board staff’s measure of common inflation\nexpectations, which summarizes a number of measures, has been rising and is at the upper end of the\nrange of values seen since 2005. 2 Some of that rise has been driven by increases in near-term\nexpectations; for example, the Cleveland Fed’s measure of year-ahead indirect consumer inflation\nexpectations, which is based on a nationwide survey of adults with more than 10,000 responses each\nweek, moved above 7 percent for the week ended May 28, 2022, compared to around 4 percent a year\nago. 3 But even though longer-term inflation expectations have moved up by less, I do not think it is\nprudent to ignore the rise given the serious harm that would be caused were longer-term expectations to\nmove above levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal and high inflation were to become\nembedded in the economy. So, if by the September FOMC meeting, the monthly readings on inflation\nprovide compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, then the pace of rate increases could slow,\nbut if inflation has failed to moderate, then a faster pace of rate increases could be necessary.\n\nIn the current environment, there is heightened uncertainty around the outlook. The risk of recession has\nrisen, but because underlying aggregate demand momentum and the demand for labor are so strong, a\ngood case can still be made that as demand and supply come into better balance, a sharp slowdown can be\navoided, with growth slowing to a trend pace this year, labor market conditions remaining healthy, and\ninflation moving down to a 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range this year and declining further next year. Of\ncourse, if there is anything we have learned over the past two years, it is that the economy can evolve\nSee Hie Joo Ahn and Chad Fulton, “Research Data Series: Index of Common Inflation Expectations,” FEDS\nNotes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 5, 2021 (https://doi.org/10.17016/23807172.2873).\n\n2\n\n3\nThe Cleveland Fed’s measure of year-ahead indirect consumer inflation expectations is available at\nhttps://cebra.org/programs/idd/indirect-consumer-inflation-expectations/.\n\n\f8\n\ndifferently than expected and we should be ready for that.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\nAs this period of recalibration of monetary policy continues, the FOMC will need to be resolute and\nintentional in removing policy accommodation to tighten financial conditions at the pace needed to get\ninflation under control. This will take fortitude. There will be bumps along the road. Financial markets\ncould remain very volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could slow somewhat more than\nexpected for a couple of quarters; and the unemployment rate could temporarily move above estimates of\nits longer-run level. This will be painful but so is high inflation. High inflation imposes a real burden on\nhouseholds and businesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential\ngoods and services. I do not see the current situation as one involving a trade-off between our two\nmonetary policy goals. If we fail to do what is necessary to get inflation down, we will not be able to\nsustain healthy labor markets over the medium and longer run, to the detriment of the public we serve. So\nin formulating my policy views, I will remain focused and committed to using our policy tools to achieve\nour monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to explain my current views on the economy and monetary policy.\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Great Recalibration of U.S. Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nInternational Research Forum on Monetary Policy:\nMonetary Policy During and After the Pandemic\nEuropean Central Bank\nFrankfurt, Germany\n(via videoconference)\nMay 13, 2022\n\n\f1\nIt is a pleasure to participate in this policy panel at the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy\nsponsored by the Euro Area Business Cycle Network, the European Central Bank, and the Federal\nReserve Board. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last week; so in my brief prepared\nremarks, I will review the FOMC’s recent decisions and put them into context. As a reminder, the views I\npresent today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its goals of price stability and maximum employment. At the start of the pandemic in March\n2020, the FOMC reduced the target range of its policy rate, the federal funds rate, to 0 to 1/4 percent, to\nsupport the economy in the wake of the unprecedented COVID shock. The FOMC also used its balance\nsheet as a policy tool, buying large quantities of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities, to reduce the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic and to support the\neconomy. In March of this year, the FOMC raised its policy rate by 25 basis points. Last week, it raised\nthe fed funds rate by another 50 basis points and indicated that it believes ongoing rate increases will be\nappropriate. The FOMC also announced that it will begin reducing its balance-sheet assets starting in\nJune.\n\nThese actions are part of what I have called the Great Recalibration of U.S. monetary policy: a shift from\nthe extraordinarily accommodative policy needed earlier in the pandemic to a policy stance that is more\nappropriate for addressing the key challenge facing the U.S. economy: unacceptably high inflation. 1\nWhile liftoff of the funds rate from zero only occurred in March, this recalibration actually began in the\nautumn of last year. Last September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to taper asset\n\nJeff Cox, “Fed’s Mester Casts Doubt on the Need for ‘Shock’ Interest Rate Hikes Ahead,” CNBC, April 22, 2022\n(https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/22/feds-mester-casts-doubt-on-the-need-for-shock-interest-rate-hikes-ahead.html).\n\n1\n\n\f2\npurchases, and it announced the beginning of tapering in November. In December, the FOMC sped up\nthe tapering and released projections indicating that participants now expected an earlier liftoff of the\npolicy rate than they had previously anticipated. In January, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be\ntime to raise its policy rate, and then followed through with the first increase in March. Asset purchases\nalso ended in early March.\n\nThis recalibration of policy has reflected the evolution of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and\nthe risks around the outlook.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year, with real\nGDP growing at a 5-1/2 percent rate, the highest annual pace since 1984 and well above the trend growth\nrate, which I estimate to be about 2 percent. The decline in real GDP in the first quarter was driven\nmainly by declines in net exports, government spending, and a still high but lower level of inventory\ninvestment compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Growth in consumer spending and business fixed\ninvestment remained solid last quarter and there continues to be positive underlying momentum in\ndemand. Household and business balance sheets are healthy, reflecting high savings accumulated during\nthe pandemic.\n\nStrong demand has occurred in the face of very constrained supply in both product and labor markets. In\nproduct markets, differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies have resulted in a cascade\nof disruptions to the global supply chain. China’s zero-COVID policy has further disrupted supply chains\nand Russia’s dastardly invasion of Ukraine has further constrained supplies in energy, metals, and\nagricultural commodity markets.\n\nLabor markets remain very tight. The U.S. economy added 6.7 million jobs last year. Despite\nwidespread reports from firms about the difficulty of finding workers, monthly payroll gains have\n\n\f3\naveraged above 500 thousand over the first four months of this year. The unemployment rate has fallen to\n3.6 percent, nearly as low as its lowest reading during the pre-pandemic expansion. Labor force\nparticipation remains below its pre-pandemic level, but it has improved significantly over time. Still,\nlabor supply has been unable to keep up with the robust demand for labor. Job openings are at very high\nlevels by historical standards: there are almost 2 openings per every unemployed worker; in 2019, this\nratio averaged 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\nWith demand out of balance with supply in both product and labor markets, prices and wages have moved\nup. Price pressures have broadened across goods and services, and inflation readings in the U.S. are now\nat their highest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, in March, total PCE inflation was over 6-1/2\npercent, core PCE inflation was nearly 5-1/4 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation was\nalmost 4-1/4 percent. Wage pressures are also building. The employment cost index for private industry\nworkers accelerated over the three months ending in March, rising at a 5.8 percent annual pace. Higher\nwages that reflect higher productivity growth are a positive for the economy, and a higher level of wages\nrepresents a shift of income share from capital to labor. But the current pace of wage increases is\ninconsistent with maintaining price stability.\n\nThe Fed is committed to using its tools to get inflation under control by bringing excess demand into\nbetter balance with constrained supply. It will likely take some time for inflation to reach our longer-run\ngoal of 2 percent because several of the factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings\nare supply-side factors, which monetary policy cannot affect, and because inflation tends to be persistent.\nBut as we recalibrate our policy, I will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is on a\ndownward trajectory toward our 2 percent goal. We will be able to gauge improvement by looking at the\nmonthly changes in inflation readings to see if inflation is beginning to move down. The monthly\nincrease in the core PCE price index in March was little changed from its February reading, and the\nmonthly reading of the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation moved down in March. These are positive\n\n\f4\nsigns, but in April, monthly CPI inflation increased, and risks to inflation remain strongly on the upside,\nespecially in the midst of the continuing war in Ukraine and the potential that the zero-COVID policy in\nChina will further disrupt supply chains. I will need to see several months of sustained downward\nmonthly readings of inflation before I conclude that inflation has peaked.\n\nA risk-management perspective argues for such caution because inflation risks are to the upside and\nbecause the longer inflation runs above our goal, the higher the risk that long-term inflation expectations\nwill become unanchored, thereby making the return to price stability much more costly. We already see\nthat medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up. The Board staff’s measure of\ncommon inflation expectations, which summarizes a number of measures, has been rising and is at the\nupper end of the range of values seen since 2005. 2 Even though some of the rise has been driven by\nincreases in near-term expectations, I do not think it is prudent to ignore the rise given the serious harm\nthat would be caused were long-term expectations to move above levels consistent with our longer-run\ninflation goal of 2 percent. 3\n\nIn my view, the FOMC will need to be resolute and intentional in removing policy accommodation at the\npace needed to get inflation under control. High inflation imposes a real burden on households and\nbusinesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential goods and\nservices. If we fail to do what is necessary to get inflation down, we will be jeopardizing sustaining\nhealthy labor markets over the medium and longer run, again hurting lower-income households. So I do\nnot see the current situation as one involving a trade-off between our two goals.\n\nSee Hie Joo Ahn and Chad Fulton, “Research Data Series: Index of Common Inflation Expectations,” FEDS\nNotes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 5, 2021 (https://doi.org/10.17016/23807172.2873).\n\n2\n\n3\nThe Cleveland Fed’s measure of year-ahead indirect consumer inflation expectations for the week ended May 9\nwas 6.7 percent (https://cebra.org/programs/idd/indirect-consumer-inflation-expectations/).\n\n\f5\nThe current target range of the federal funds rate is 75 to 100 basis points. This is well below the range of\nestimates of the longer-run neutral nominal policy rate, which neither stimulates nor restrains economic\nactivity. For example, in the March Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, the range\nof estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate was 2 to 3 percent. The real fed funds rate is still negative.\nSo given economic conditions, ongoing increases in the fed funds rate are called for, and unless there are\nsome big surprises, I expect it to be appropriate to raise the policy rate another 50 basis points at each of\nour next two meetings.\n\nAt that point, the nominal funds rate will be nearing the lower end of estimates of the neutral rate and\nbalance-sheet reductions will be underway. The FOMC will then be well positioned to consider the\nappropriate pace at which to continue removing accommodation over the balance of the year and how far\nabove neutral rates will need to go. It will be challenging to remove accommodation at the pace needed\nto get inflation under control while sustaining healthy labor market conditions. There are likely to be\nsome bumps along the road; growth could slow a bit more than expected for a couple of quarters and the\nunemployment rate could move up temporarily. Nonetheless, the FOMC will be aiming to calibrate our\npolicy to bring demand better in line with supply, thereby putting inflation on a downward trajectory\ntoward our 2 percent goal. This calibration will entail assessing the various forces that will be affecting\nthe demand and supply sides of the economy. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in\nChina pose upside risks to inflation but downside risks to growth. Broader financial conditions have\nalready tightened considerably, as markets have anticipated further rate increases in light of the Fed’s\nforward guidance. For example, the 30-year mortgage rate was under 3 percent last September and is\nnow about 5-1/4 percent. And the Fed’s balance-sheet reduction will soon be underway. These tighter\nfinancial conditions will help moderate excess demand. With some luck, supply chain disruptions will\nbegin to abate and labor market participation will continue to rise, helping to ease supply constraints and\nallowing supply in product and labor markets to come into better balance with demand. But we cannot\nrely on luck. With both supply and demand adjusting over time, I will be monitoring economic and\n\n\f6\nfinancial developments closely to gauge the balance between demand and supply and to determine\nappropriate monetary policy. If by the September FOMC meeting, the monthly readings on inflation\nprovide compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, then the pace of rate increases could slow,\nbut if inflation has failed to moderate, then a faster pace of rate increases may be necessary.\n\nAs I mentioned, in addition to raising our policy rate, we are initiating the balance-sheet reduction in\nJune. This will be done primarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments the\nFed receives on its assets. Starting in June, the Fed will allow up to $30 billion per month of Treasury\nsecurities and up to $17.5 billion of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. After three months,\nthese caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and $35 billion per month for agency\nsecurities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury\nbills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap.\n\nThe plan that the FOMC announced last week did not rule out asset sales, and I would favor the FOMC\nconsidering asset sales after balance-sheet reduction is well underway to speed up the return of the\nportfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury securities. This would be consistent with the\nFOMC’s stated desire to minimize the effect of the Fed’s balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of\ncredit across economic sectors.\n\nThe plan also did not indicate what size the balance sheet will be when the FOMC ends the reductions,\nbut it did give some guidance. We are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating\nregime in which reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not needed. The FOMC intends to slow and then stop the\nreduction in balance-sheet assets when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is\nconsistent with ample reserves. Once runoff has stopped, reserve balances will likely continue to fall for\n\n\f7\na time, reflecting growth in other Fed liabilities, until the FOMC judges that they have reached the ample\nlevel. At that point, the FOMC will then manage its security holdings to maintain ample reserves over\ntime. The ample level of reserves is uncertain. It will depend on the banking sector’s demand for\nreserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. So as\nthe process to reduce the size of the balance sheet progresses, we will be monitoring developments in\nmoney markets to determine the appropriate level of reserves at which to end balance-sheet runoff,\nconsistent with maintaining ample reserve balances over time.\n\nThis concludes my brief remarks about the Great Recalibration of U.S. monetary policy. I look forward\nto participating in the discussion.\n\n\f"

        "content": "The FOMC’s Plan for Significantly Reducing\nthe Federal Reserve’s Securities Holdings\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel remarks prepared for the session “Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\nChallenges During Balance Sheet Normalization”\n2022 Financial Markets Conference:\nA New Era of Financial Innovation and Disruption: Challenges and Opportunities\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAmelia Island, FL\nMay 10, 2022\n\n\f1\nGood afternoon. I thank Raphael Bostic for inviting me to participate in this panel focused on balancesheet normalization. I have had the opportunity to attend and participate in this conference over the past\nfew years, and it has never disappointed in bringing together interesting research and interesting policy\nviews. This year’s conference is no exception.\n\nIn my brief prepared remarks, I will describe how the FOMC intends to significantly reduce the security\nholdings on its balance sheet. The views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, in addition to the federal funds rate, the Fed has used its balance sheet as a\npolicy tool, buying large volumes of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. At\nnearly $9 trillion in assets, the Fed’s balance sheet is now about double the size it was before the\npandemic. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the severe strains in financial\nmarkets seen early in the pandemic, and throughout the pandemic, they helped to support the economy in\nthe midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. Markets are now functioning, a solid expansion is\nunderway, and inflation is far above the Fed’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. So at its May meeting last\nweek, the FOMC decided that it will begin reducing the size of its balance sheet in June. To lay the\ngroundwork and to help prepare financial markets for this announcement, the FOMC, after its January\nmeeting, released a set of guiding principles for the reduction, and the Committee gave more specifics\nabout its plans in the minutes to its March meeting. The plans announced last week are consistent with\nthe earlier communications.\n\nBalance-sheet reduction will be done in a predictable manner, primarily by adjusting the reinvestment\namounts of the principal payments the Fed receives on its assets. Starting in June, the Fed will allow up\nto $30 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion of agency securities to run off the\nbalance sheet. After three months, these caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and\n\n\f2\n$35 billion per month for agency securities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are\nless than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap.\n\nThe plan draws on our experience from October 2017 through August 2019 when the FOMC reduced the\nbalance sheet of some of the assets that had been purchased in the wake of the Great Recession. But there\nare some important differences. Last time, runoff caps were initially set at $6 billion per month for\nTreasuries and $4 billion per month for agency securities, and the phase-in was very gradual, with caps\nincreasing by $6 billion and $4 billion, respectively, every 3 months over the next 12 months, to\n$30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for agency securities. This time, the phase-in is only 3 months\nand the monthly runoff caps total $95 billion, almost twice the size as last time. Another difference is\nthat, last time, balance-sheet reduction started almost two years after liftoff of the funds rate from zero;\nthis time it is starting about 2-1/2 months after liftoff. I note, though, that even though the gap between\nliftoff and the start of balance-sheet reduction is much shorter this time, the level of the target range is not\nthat different – only 25 basis points lower this time – because the funds rate rose very slowly last time. 1\n\nThese differences reflect the fact that the economy is in a very different place now than it was then.\nWhen the Fed began reductions in October 2017, balance-sheet assets had grown to about $4.5 trillion, or\n22 percent of GDP; reserves were about $2.2 trillion, or 11 percent of GDP; the unemployment rate was\nabout 4-1/4 percent; real output growth was near 2.7 percent; and inflation was still running slightly\nbelow 2 percent. Now, balance-sheet assets are about $9 trillion, or 37 percent of GDP; reserves have\nbeen averaging about $3.8 trillion, or about 15 percent of GDP; labor markets are very tight, with the\nunemployment rate at 3.6 percent; the economy grew 5.5 percent last year; and instead of being below our\ngoal, PCE inflation is currently 6.6 percent, a 40-year high.\n\nThe target range was 1 to 1-1/4 percent when the balance-sheet reduction began in October 2017, and it is 3/4 to 1\npercent now.\n\n1\n\n\f3\nLet me finish by discussing two items that the plan announced last week did not address: asset sales and\nthe size of the balance sheet when reductions will end.\n\nThe plan did not rule out asset sales. The FOMC has not discussed sales, but the minutes of the March\nmeeting indicated that FOMC participants generally agreed that after balance-sheet reduction was well\nunderway, it would be appropriate to consider sales of agency mortgage-backed securities. An important\nbenefit of sales is that they would help to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to being\nprimarily Treasury securities, consistent with the FOMC’s stated desire to minimize the effect of the\nFed’s balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of credit across economic sectors. One potential way to\nimplement sales would be to sell agency securities up to the cap in any month in which principal\npayments were less than the cap. This is similar to our treatment of Treasuries. Another way to\nimplement sales would be to set a monthly floor on reductions, which would be met first by principal\npayments received and then by sales. A potential drawback of sales is that, depending on the interest rate\npath, they could result in realized mark-to-market losses, which would lower the Fed’s remittances to the\nTreasury. Such losses would not entail any operational challenges for the Fed in setting monetary policy.\nHowever, they would pose communication challenges that would need to be appropriately addressed so\nthat the public understands the benefits of returning the balance sheet to a more normal size and\ncomposition despite the losses.\n\nSecond, the plan did not indicate the size the balance sheet will be when the FOMC ends the reductions,\nbut it did give some guidance. We are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating\nregime in which reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not needed. The FOMC intends to slow and then stop the\ndecline in balance-sheet assets when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is consistent\nwith ample reserves. Once runoff has stopped, reserve balances will likely continue to fall for a time,\n\n\f4\nreflecting growth in other Fed liabilities, until the FOMC judges that they have reached the ample level.\nAt that point, the FOMC will then manage its security holdings to maintain ample reserves over time.\nThe ample level of reserves is uncertain. It will depend on the banking sector’s demand for reserves, as\nwell as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. During the last\nreduction episode, the FOMC ended runoff when reserve levels were about $1.5 trillion, or 7 percent of\nGDP. When stresses developed in short-term money markets in mid-September 2019, the FOMC judged\nthat the level of reserves had fallen below the level consistent with ample reserves, and in October 2019,\nthe FOMC began purchasing Treasury bills and conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement\noperations to maintain reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.\n\nThis time, as the process to reduce the size of the balance sheet progresses, we will once again be\nmonitoring developments in money markets to determine the appropriate level of reserves at which to end\nbalance-sheet runoff, consistent with maintaining ample reserve balances over time.\n\nThis was a brief summary of the FOMC’s plan for significantly reducing the Federal Reserve’s balancesheet assets. I look forward to hearing the other panelists’ remarks and participating in the discussion.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Successful Workforce Development Programs:\nFour Lessons from Four Decades of Federal Reserve Research and Outreach\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nOhio Economic Forum 2022:\nEducation and Workforce Development: The Key to Ohio’s Economic Future\nThe University of Akron\nAkron, OH\nApril 14, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is wonderful to be at the University of Akron as a participant in this year’s Ohio Economic Forum,\nwhich focuses on education and workforce development. Workforce development is a crucial ingredient\nfor achieving a healthy and dynamic economy that can work for all. When it comes to the economic wellbeing of entire regions, many studies have documented the importance of investments in education and\ntraining programs. For example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, education\nlevels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth1 and\nthat counties with higher levels of high school graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher\nlevels of labor force participation.2 Resilient regions, ones that have been able to avoid persistent declines\nin population over the longer run, tend to have a more educated population and a more diverse industry\nmix.3 Better education helps individuals, too. It is correlated with lower levels of unemployment and\nhigher wages.\n\nSince having a skilled workforce benefits people and communities, workforce development is front and\ncenter in the work that the Federal Reserve does to promote a sound economy. I suspect that many of you\nknow that the Federal Reserve’s goals in setting monetary policy are to achieve price stability and\nmaximum employment. These goals were formally given to the Fed by Congress in 1977. Currently,\nlabor markets in the U.S. are very tight and inflation is very elevated. The Fed has begun the process of\nreducing monetary policy accommodation. Our intent is to reduce accommodation at the pace necessary\nto bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in order to get inflation under control while\nsustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy labor markets. So understanding what is\nhappening in the workforce is central to understanding the state of the business cycle and setting\nappropriate monetary policy.\n\n1\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2005).\n\n2\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2006).\n\n3\n\nLin (2012).\n\n\f2\nBut understanding workforce dynamics is also important for assessing the longer-run health of the\neconomy. It is relevant to the Fed’s role in identifying effective community development policies and\npractices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. This role arose from the responsibility that Congress gave to the Fed and other federal\nbanking regulators for implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was passed in\n1977.\n\nSo understanding all aspects of the U.S. labor force, including how communities can develop and sustain\na resilient workforce, has been part of the Fed’s mission for over four decades. Today, I will discuss four\nimportant lessons we have learned about successful workforce development from four decades of Federal\nReserve research and outreach. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Origins of Community Development Work at the Fed\nFirst, let me provide a little background. As I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has a long-standing interest\nin community development. Congress passed the CRA to help address concerns about the deterioration\nin low- and moderate-income neighborhoods throughout the U.S., a deterioration that many people at the\ntime attributed at least partially to limited access to credit and illegal practices such as redlining. The\nCRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are\nchartered to do business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and\nneighborhoods, and the Fed and other federal financial supervisory agencies were charged with\nimplementing the act.4 To do so, the Fed created its Community Affairs function in 1981 to provide\n\n4\n\nSee Mester (2017) and Braunstein (2008).\n\n\f3\ntechnical training and support to depository institutions to help bolster their compliance with the CRA.5\nFrom this targeted beginning, the Federal Reserve’s work in the area of community development has\nevolved and expanded to include research and community outreach and information gathering on a\nnumber of topics, including housing, education, health, transportation, and workforce development.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System comprises 12 regional Reserve Banks that are distributed across the country\nand a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington that oversees those Banks. The U.S. is very\ndiverse, encompassing large cities, small towns, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries and\noccupations. That is true of the Cleveland Fed’s District, the Fourth District, which comprises the entire\nstate of Ohio, and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The Reserve Banks are very\nmuch organizations of their Districts, so they are well positioned to gather information and develop a\nsolid understanding of what is actually happening on the ground in their Districts. This community\nengagement via outreach and research on relevant issues allows the Fed’s decisions to take into account\nthe diversity of the American economy and its people.\n\nFour Lessons from Four Decades of the Fed’s Work on Workforce Development\nBecause having a skilled workforce is a vital component of a healthy economy, the Cleveland Fed, as\nwell as many of our fellow Reserve Banks, focuses a lot of attention on workforce development and what\ncommunities can do to enhance it. While the economy is very diverse and workforce development efforts\ndiffer by location, four decades of Fed research and outreach have yielded some common themes. In the\nrest of my remarks, I will highlight four lessons we have learned about what successful workforce\n\n5\n\nThe Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) are currently working together to strengthen and modernize the regulations that implement the\nCRA. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (September 21, 2020) and Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (July 20,\n2021).\n\n\f4\ndevelopment efforts have in common.\n\nLesson 1. Collaboration and commitment are essential for building effective programs.\nThe first lesson is that collaboration across public, private, and nonprofit entities is essential to a\nsuccessful workforce development program. Community development practitioners have long known\nthat effective workforce initiatives almost always require many different organizations to work together.\nThe Boston Fed examined small and mid-sized cities that had lost manufacturing employment and found\nthat resurgent cities, those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree of\nleadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private\ncitizens, corporations, and government.6 Importantly, the researchers also found that to have an effect on\neconomic outcomes, leadership and collaboration must be part of long-lasting campaigns. There are no\nshortcuts or easy fixes. It takes commitment.\n\nIn the last 10 years, much has been learned about the value of sector-led partnerships, often focused on\njust one or a few industries. Cleveland Fed analysts undertook case studies of five sector-based initiatives\nacross the Fourth District and found that successful programs involve employers who are substantively\nengaged. That engagement involves people at the highest levels of their organizations so that they can\nspeak on behalf of the firm; it includes providing advice on curricula and interacting with students.7 The\ncase studies also showed that commitment is needed so that the programs have a chance to become\nestablished and grow. Because, in many cases, the employers involved in the programs are competitors,\ntrust among the employers and program partners is an important driver of success. Our research also\n\n6\n7\n\nKodrzycki and Muñoz, et al. (2009).\n\nThese sectors were health care in western Pennsylvania, information technology (IT) in northeastern Ohio,\nadvanced manufacturing in central Ohio, marine mechanics in northwestern Ohio, and coal mining in eastern\nKentucky. Four of these five initiatives provide direct training to workers, while the IT initiative focuses on\nincreasing and enhancing the pipeline of IT talent through deep employer engagement with educational institutions\nat all levels. See Fee, Klesta, and Nelson (2016).\n\n\f5\nfound that having the technical skills required for a position is often not enough to gain employment.\nEmployers are also interested in hiring people who are motivated, aren’t daunted by uncertainty and can\nbe flexible, can work well in teams, can effectively communicate, and can learn new things. This\nunderscores the need for collaboration, because effective workforce development programs combine\npartners who can educate people on these types of skills with partners who can provide the necessary\ntechnical skills.\n\nLesson 2. Communication between employers, workers, and trainers is needed to ensure that programs\ntackle the right problems.\nThe second lesson that is clear from the Fed’s research and outreach is that to improve workforce\noutcomes there needs to be better communication between employers and workers about what each wants\nand needs. This avoids wasting effort and funding on programs that are misfocused. In the current labor\nmarket, almost every firm we speak to says it has been struggling to find the talent it needs. In a recent\nsurvey of more than 750 employers across an 18-county region of Northeast Ohio conducted by\nConxusNEO, Fund for Our Economic Future, and Team NEO, over three-quarters of the respondents said\nthey were struggling to find talent and finding it was their biggest challenge, and over 90 percent said\ntheir pool of qualified applicants was insufficient to meet their needs.8 Surveyed employers said they\nhave responded by raising wages and by offering more flexible schedules, hybrid work arrangements, and\nmore paid time off. But only 8 percent of firms have taken the simple step of actually asking workers\nwhat matters to them. The Fund for Our Economic Future is completing a region-wide survey and\nholding focus groups asking workers what they are looking for, as input into the fund’s support for\nstrategies that lead to better job outcomes.9\nBetter communication can also help employers avoid making assumptions that are unproductive in\n\n8\n\nIn the survey, which was conducted in December 2021 and January 2022, 78 percent of respondents said they were\nstruggling to find talent, citing recruitment as their biggest challenge, and 94 percent of respondents said that their\npool of qualified applicants was insufficient to meet their needs. See Burke (2022).\n9\n\nSee Burke (2022).\n\n\f6\nfostering better employment outcomes. The period before the pandemic hit was also one where labor\nmarket conditions were strong and our business contacts reported that they were having trouble finding\nthe qualified labor they needed. A few reported that current employees were sometimes not interested in\nbeing promoted to a new role at a higher wage. They did not have a good understanding of why this was\nthe case, since getting a job or a promotion was a path to better economic achievement. A few firms\nassumed it meant that people just did not want to work. But, of course, the reality was more complicated.\n\nWhile a job or promotion may put someone on the path to higher future income, in the short run, taking a\njob at the offered wage can actually cost someone more in terms of lost public benefits than he or she\nwould gain in wages from taking the job. While some public benefit programs phase out gradually,\nothers, including Medicaid, have strict income cutoffs for participation. This creates so-called benefits\ncliffs. These cliffs often differ across localities and with the person’s situation, in part, because benefit\nprograms interact with one another. So it is not a simple task for either workers or employers to calculate\nthe net financial effect on the worker of taking the job offered.\n\nTo help potential workers and employers better understand benefits cliffs, the Cleveland Fed is partnering\nwith the Atlanta Fed and the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services to provide an interactive tool\nin six counties in Ohio as part of the state’s Benefit Bridge pilot program.10 The Career Ladder Identifier\nand Financial Forecaster (CLIFF) dashboard, developed by the Atlanta Fed, allows people to compare\nthemselves with others in similar economic situations and locations to see how benefits change with\nincreases in income, taking into account local living expenses and state-specific eligibility rules for public\nbenefits.11 The tool allows workers to look at different career path scenarios to help them understand the\ntradeoffs they would be making in terms of lost benefits in the short run versus potentially higher income\n\n10\n11\n\nSee Nelson and Goran (2022) for further discussion.\n\nFor more information on benefits cliffs and CLIFF, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Advancing Careers\nfor Low-Income Families.\n\n\f7\nfrom wage gains in the future, and it allows employers and counselors to offer more informed career\nplanning advice to workers.\n\nCommunication between businesses and educational and training organizations is also vital so that they\ncan coordinate their efforts. With the workplace changing so rapidly, it is important that students and\nthose advising them know what skill sets employers are seeking now and in the future so they can prepare\nthemselves for joining the job market. In Pittsburgh, the Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment is working with businesses, educators, and students in elementary and high schools to raise\nawareness of the future job market so that curricula can be better matched to the skill sets that will be in\ndemand.\n\nThrough its own surveys and outreach, the Federal Reserve is helping to communicate the challenges\nfaced by lower-income families that hamper their ability to participate in the labor market and advance\neconomically. The Cleveland Fed’s biennial Policy Summit regularly has sessions on workforce\ndevelopment that bring together those with diverse perspectives.12 Our workforce development outreach\nefforts routinely include both business and labor market participants so that each can communicate their\nneeds and challenges. The Fed’s reputation for objectivity helps us play a role as both a convener and a\ncatalyst, aiming to increase everyone’s understanding of the issues affecting the workforce and to foster\neffective collaboration.\n\nLesson 3. Effective workforce development programs recognize that place matters.\nA third lesson drawn from Fed research and outreach is that place matters.13 Employers are often drawn\nto places that will attract workers. So those living in lower-quality neighborhoods in terms of schools;\n\n12\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2021).\n\n13\n\nSee Mester (2021).\n\n\f8\nhousing; access to healthcare, food, and public transportation; and natural amenities like parks and green\nspace typically have less access to good jobs, and without a good job, they have less ability to move to\nlocations that offer better employment prospects. A body of research has shown that economic\nopportunity is tied not only to individual circumstances but also to place. Upward mobility – the\nprobability that a child will be better off economically than his or her parents – is dependent not only on\nthe family’s characteristics but also on neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, the\nquality of schools, access to social services, access to transportation, and racial integration.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that regional economic development, which focuses on growth in\neconomic activity, and workforce development, which focuses on the skill sets of individuals, are linked\nand should be viewed as a common goal. As part of the Federal Reserve System’s Investing in America’s\nWorkforce initiative, the Fed held listening sessions across the country. During those sessions, we heard\nthat an important challenge to developing the workforce is the lack of critical support services, like\ntransportation, needed by those seeking training. These services are either inaccessible or underfunded,\nespecially for those people living in low- and moderate-income communities.14,15 Training is not as\nsimple as if you build it, they will come. Training needs to be connected to support that enables people to\naccess the training, and then once they complete the training, to be able to take advantage of job\nopportunities and to move along a career path. Cleveland Fed researchers have found that increasing\naccessibility to jobs by reducing commuting distance can make a significant difference in keeping people\nemployed, especially for African Americans, women, and older workers, whose jobs require them to be\non-site.16 The move to more remote working arrangements presents a great opportunity for bringing more\npeople into the workforce.\n\n14\n\nThe Federal Reserve System worked with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers\nUniversity, the Ray Marshall Center of the Lyndon B. Johnson School at the University of Texas, and the W.E.\nUpjohn Institute for Employment Research on the initiative, Investing in America’s Workforce.\n15\n\nPack and Fee (2019).\n\n16\n\nFee (2020, 2021), Pacetti (2018), and Barkley, Pacetti, and Bailey (2018).\n\n\f9\nSince the characteristics of firms, workers, and available infrastructure differ across localities, to be\nsuccessful, workforce development efforts need to be tailored to the specifics of the localities. The\nBoston Fed’s Working Places initiatives recognize this. Its Working Cities and Working Communities\nChallenges were developed based on the Boston Fed research I mentioned earlier on small and mid-sized\ncities that had lost manufacturing employment. Those cities in which leaders collaborated across sectors\nwith many local partners to form a localized and shared vision of long-term success were more successful\nat reinvigorating their economies. Informed by this research and designed in partnership with the Boston\nFed’s network of community development stakeholders, the challenges are grant competitions aimed at\nstrengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help struggling post-industrial cities and rural towns\nin an enduring way. The funding comes from philanthropic, public-sector, and private-sector partners,\nwith the Boston Fed administering the program and providing technical assistance, including\nopportunities to learn from other participants.\n\nLesson 4. Programs should be regularly and objectively evaluated based on data and informed by\nresearch.\nThis brings me to the last lesson I will discuss today: evaluation is essential. No matter how well\nintentioned, some workforce development programs will be less effective than others. And because place\nmatters, some programs that work in one region may be less effective in another. Funding is scarce, so it\nis important that initiatives be regularly evaluated, based on objective evidence and informed by research,\nto help ensure that the investment in workforce development is money well spent and that programs are\ndesigned to be effective so that they can help the most people.\n\nIt is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of a program without the data to do it. So initiatives should\ncollect complete data on the programs and outcomes by geography and by the race, ethnicity, education,\nincome, and other characteristics of the participants. And initiatives should be willing to share these data\nso that objective third parties can evaluate the programs.\n\n\f10\n\nThe Cleveland Fed and colleagues around the Federal Reserve System are creating and using data to\nsupport workforce development. For example, the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Reserve Banks’\nproject to identify “opportunity occupations,” those occupations that pay higher than the median wage but\ndo not require a bachelor’s degree, grew out of our hearing repeatedly through our outreach of the need\nfor these types of jobs.17 The Cleveland and Philadelphia Feds have created an Occupational Mobility\nExplorer tool, which helps workers, particularly those without a college degree, identify good-paying jobs\nbased on the skills they have.18 It covers 33 of the largest metropolitan areas in the country and allows an\nindividual to see what other occupations that use similar skills are available and what the pay differentials\nare across these occupations. For example, cashiers would find that customer service representatives have\nskills similar to theirs but get paid more. With this type of information, people are better equipped to\nexplore alternative career paths that could enhance their economic outcomes.19 They can also use the tool\nto determine how much better off they might be financially if they obtained training to enhance their skill\nsets given current and future employment demands.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve has been supporting workforce development efforts for more than four\ndecades by providing research and data, doing outreach to all the stakeholders with an interest in\nworkforce development, and convening these stakeholders so that they can share their perspectives on\nwhat is needed to ensure a highly skilled workforce. Through our efforts, we have learned that\ncollaboration, commitment, communication, recognition that place matters, and objective evaluation are\nall important ingredients in designing and maintaining effective workplace development initiatives that\nhelp individuals and communities prosper economically.\n\n17\n\nWardrip, et al. (2015).\n\n18\n\nThe tool is available at the Occupational Mobility Explorer web page.\n\n19\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2020) and Nelson, Fee, and Wardrip (2019).\n\n\f11\n\nIn today’s rapidly changing world, the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those\njobs are also changing. That is why many people talk about the need for life-long learning. That applies\nnot only to individuals but also to institutions. In that vein, the Cleveland Fed is committed to expanding\nits knowledge and working with all stakeholders to help support efforts to develop a highly skilled\nworkforce, an essential ingredient in maintaining a strong economy in which everyone can benefit.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nBarkley, Brett, Emily Garr Pacetti, and Layisha Bailey, “A Long Ride to Work: Job Access and the\nPotential Impact of Ride-Hailing in the Pittsburgh Area,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, September\n5, 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/a-look-behind-the-numbers/albtn20180905-a-long-ride-to-work-job-access-and-the-potential-impact)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Issues Advance Notice of\nProposed Rulemaking on an Approach to Modernize Regulations That Implement the Community\nReinvestment Act,” September 21, 2020.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200921a.htm)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Interagency Statement on Community Reinvestment Act Joint Agency\nAction,” July 20, 2021.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210720a.htm)\nBraunstein, Sandra F., “The Community Reinvestment Act,” testimony before the Committee on\nFinancial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, February 13, 2008.\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/braunstein20080213a.htm)\nBurke, Bethia, “New Survey Reveals What Employers Are (or Aren’t) Doing to Mitigate Talent\nChallenges,” Fund for Our Economic Future, February 2, 2022.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nLyons Companies and the Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship,\nAlfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, University of Delaware\nNewark, DE\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Lyons Companies and the University of Delaware for inviting me to speak at today’s forum on\nthe outlook for the U.S. economy. I had the opportunity to speak at this event in 2019 and enjoyed being\non campus. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to meet in person soon.\n\nIn my remarks three years ago, I characterized 2019 as a year of transition for the economy and monetary\npolicy. At that time, economic growth was expected to transition to a more sustainable pace after abovetrend growth in 2018, and we were completing a monetary policy transition that had been underway for\nsome time: a transition away from the emergency monetary policy settings needed in the wake of the\nGreat Recession to more normal policy.\n\nToday, we are at the start of another monetary policy transition, this time away from the extraordinary\naccommodation that was necessary earlier in the pandemic. I will spend my time discussing the\neconomic rationale for the transition and the implications for monetary policy going forward. As a\nreminder, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year. Real\nGDP grew at about a 5-1/2 percent rate, the highest annual pace since 1984; firms added a record 6.7\nmillion jobs to their payrolls; and the unemployment rate moved down to about 4 percent, close to its prepandemic level. The economy’s strength reflected very robust demand by households and businesses.\nThis demand was supported by extraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy, as well as the deployment\nof vaccinations, which allowed the economy to reopen more fully. But this strong demand came at the\nsame time that there were constraints on product supply and labor supply. The imbalances between\nsupply and demand have put significant upward pressures on prices and wages. Inflation readings in the\n\n\f2\nU.S. are at their highest levels in about 40 years, and nominal wages are accelerating at a faster pace than\nwe have seen in decades.\n\nThere are risks and uncertainty around the outlook, including those engendered by the geopolitical events\nunfolding today. My modal outlook continues to be that the strong economic expansion continues this\nyear. Just as the Delta variant did last autumn, the Omicron variant has weighed on activity in highcontact services. But new case counts and hospitalizations are declining sharply, so I expect that\nhouseholds and businesses will once again prove to be resilient in the face of the virus. Once Omicron is\nbehind us, demand should rebound fairly quickly because both business and household balance sheets are\nvery healthy. But compared to last year, demand is likely to moderate this year as the support from the\npandemic stimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative. Nevertheless,\nthe economy should still expand at an above-trend pace despite facing some challenges.\n\nOne challenge is the imbalance between supply and demand I mentioned earlier. While earlier in the\npandemic, the economic effects of the virus were mainly on the demand side, now the effects are seen\nmainly on the supply side. Differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across the\nglobe have disrupted global supply chains. Firms are struggling to get necessary parts and materials\nthrough clogged ports and transportation channels. Many businesses are facing significantly higher costs\nfor available inputs. Rather than abating over last year, the disruptions continued to constrain economic\nactivity. But now, there are some hopeful signs. Anecdotal reports suggest that some of the constraints\nmay be stabilizing and delivery times appear to be improving. We routinely speak with a large number of\nbusiness and community contacts in our District, which comprises Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania,\nKentucky, and West Virginia. Manufacturers take as a hopeful sign that deliveries have become more\npredictable even though lead times remain very long, and half of our business contacts expect some\neasing of the supply disruptions in the second half of this year. Still, more than a third of our contacts do\nnot expect improvement until 2023.\n\n\f3\n\nBusinesses are also struggling to find workers. By a number of measures, labor markets are very strong\nand the demand for workers is well outstripping labor supply. While payroll employment is still nearly 3\nmillion jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic level, job gains have been very strong, averaging over\n550 thousand per month last year. Broad-based gains continued in January, despite the effects of\nOmicron, and the November and December payroll gains were revised up, suggesting continued positive\nmomentum in the labor market. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent, down nearly 2-1/2 percentage\npoints from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it was before the pandemic.\nAccording to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per unemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors, including child and elder care responsibilities and fear of the virus, have\ncontributed to the undersupply of workers. These factors should fade over time, though the precise timing\nand magnitude are open questions. Over a longer horizon, labor force participation has been trending\ndown since early 2000 due to demographics, and many more people retired during the pandemic than\npredicted solely by demographics. So labor markets are likely to remain tight for some time.\n\nIn response to labor shortages, businesses have been raising wages, offering signing and retention\nbonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and speeding up automation.\nAverage hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure on wages continues,\nalthough, in many cases, the wage increases are not keeping up with inflation.\n\nThe imbalances between demand and supply in both product and labor markets are contributing to the\nvery high inflation readings. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached almost 6 percent in\nDecember, and core PCE inflation reached almost 5 percent. Both are at their highest levels since the\nearly 1980s. The Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure and the median CPI and trimmed-mean\nCPI measures are useful indicators of the underlying inflation trend and all have moved well above 2\n\n\f4\npercent.1 As inflationary pressures rose last year, they also broadened considerably across a wider range\nof goods and services. Inflation forecasts were revised up all year. In the December 2020 Summary of\nEconomic Projections of FOMC participants, the median projection of PCE inflation for 2021 was 1.8\npercent. By the December 2021 SEP, that projection had risen to 5.3 percent.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity\nconstraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. Nonetheless, I expect inflation to remain\nabove 2 percent this year and next, and I see the risks to inflation as tilted to the upside. Geopolitical\nevents add upside risk to the inflation forecast even as they put some downside risk to the near-term\ngrowth forecast. My projection of some moderation in inflation is conditioned on the FOMC taking\nappropriate action to recalibrate monetary policy to an economy in which inflation has been running well\nabove our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid momentum in underlying\ndemand is expected to continue.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThe FOMC’s policy decisions reflect its strong commitment to achieving its dual-mandate goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. The task before the Fed is to remove accommodation at the pace\nnecessary to bring inflation under control while sustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy\nlabor markets. Monetary policy cannot alleviate the constraints on supply. But it can help to moderate\ndemand by making broader financial conditions less accommodative, thereby reducing inflationary\npressures. Doing so will help sustain the expansion in activity and healthy labor markets.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure reached 3.6 percent in December. In January, the Cleveland\nFed’s median CPI inflation measure rose to 4.2 percent, its highest level since 1991, and its trimmed-mean CPI\ninflation measure rose to 5.4 percent, its highest level since the series began in 1983. These inflation measures are\nmaintained by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research and are available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n1\n\n\f5\nThe FOMC is beginning the process of reducing accommodation. Since March 2020, the FOMC has\nmaintained the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent to support the economy. At our\nJanuary meeting, the Committee announced that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range.\nBarring an unexpected turn in the economy, I believe it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up in\nMarch and follow with further increases in the coming months. The ultimate pace at which monetary\npolicy accommodation is removed will need to be data driven and forward looking. If, by mid-year, I\nassess that inflation is not going to moderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation\nat a faster pace over the second half of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than\nexpected, then the pace of removal could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half.\nThe implications of the unfolding situation in Ukraine for the medium-run economic outlook in the U.S.\nwill also be a consideration in determining the appropriate pace at which to remove accommodation.\n\nThroughout the pandemic we have also used our balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large volumes of\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These asset purchases were an important\npolicy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and throughout the\npandemic, they have helped to support the economy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock.\nBut now, markets are functioning and a solid expansion is underway, so the FOMC has been winding\nthese purchases down. Last September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to moderate the\npace of asset purchases; in November, it began reducing the monthly pace of purchases; and in December,\nit sped up the reductions. This January, the FOMC announced that the purchases would end in March and\nreleased a set of principles it plans to follow as it significantly reduces the size of its balance sheet.\n\nAt nearly $9 trillion in assets, the Fed’s balance sheet is now about double the size it was before the\npandemic. The last time the Fed undertook a process to reduce the size of its balance sheet was after the\nGreat Recession. That process started nearly two years after liftoff of the funds rate from zero and when\nthe target range had risen to 1 to 1-1/4 percent; the reduction process went on for almost two years. This\n\n\f6\ntime, the balance sheet is much larger and inflation is much higher. So barring a material change in the\neconomy, I support our beginning to reduce the size of the balance sheet soon and to go at a faster pace\nthan we did last time. I would also support selling some of our mortgage-backed securities at some point\nduring the reduction process, something we did not do last time, in order to speed the conversion of our\nportfolio’s composition to primarily Treasury securities. Holding mainly Treasuries minimizes the effect\nof our balance-sheet assets on the allocation of credit across economic sectors, which is one of the guiding\nprinciples the FOMC released in January.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this year the FOMC will be transitioning monetary policy away from the emergency levels\nof accommodation needed earlier in the pandemic and recalibrating policy to today’s economic\nchallenges. Accommodation will be removed at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control while\nsustaining the expansion in activity and healthy labor markets. As last year clearly shows, the economy\ncan evolve differently than expected. We are not through the pandemic yet and other risks, including\nunfolding geopolitical events, could affect the U.S. economy. So I will be carefully monitoring economic\nand financial developments and assessing their implications for the outlook and the risks around the\noutlook, as the FOMC recalibrates monetary policy in pursuit of its goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Transitioning Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNew York University Stern Center for Global Economy and Business\nNew York, NY\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the New York University Stern Center for Global Economy and Business for the opportunity to\nspeak with you this afternoon. I have fond memories of being an adjunct professor of finance at NYU in\nthe late 1990s and co-teaching the Ph.D. Seminar in Financial Institutions. So it feels good to be back in\nthe classroom, so to speak. I am looking forward to the interactive part of today’s program, but let me\nstart the session with some remarks about the economy and monetary policy. As a reminder, the views I\npresent today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThis year will be one of transition for monetary policy. We will be transitioning away from the\nextraordinarily accommodative monetary policy that was needed earlier in the pandemic and recalibrating\npolicy to today’s economic challenges. The FOMC is taking steps to begin that process. Our main policy\ntool is the federal funds rate. Since March 2020, the FOMC has maintained the target range of the fed\nfunds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent to support the economy. At our January meeting, the Committee announced\nthat it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have also used our balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large volumes of\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These asset purchases were an important\npolicy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and they have\ncontinued to support the economy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. But now, markets are\nfunctioning and a solid expansion is underway, so the FOMC has been winding down these purchases.\nLast September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to moderate the pace of asset purchases;\nin November, it began reducing the monthly pace of purchases; and in December, it sped up the\nreductions. This January, the FOMC announced that the purchases would end in March and released a set\nof principles it plans to follow as it significantly reduces the size of its balance sheet.\n\n\f2\nToday, I will frame my remarks about the monetary policy transition around three key points:\n1. There is a very compelling case for transitioning monetary policy away from the current\nemergency levels of accommodation.\n2. This monetary policy transition will differ from the last time because the economy is in a very\ndifferent place.\n3. As monetary policy transitions, communications will need to transition as well.\n\nThe Case for Transitioning Away from Emergency Levels of Monetary Policy Accommodation\nThe FOMC’s policy decisions reflect its strong commitment to achieving its dual-mandate goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, economic growth\nwas very strong last year, and the outlook is for continued solid growth this year. Last year, real GDP\ngrew at a 5.5 percent rate, its highest annual pace since 1984. The Omicron variant has weighed on\nactivity in high-contact services and has put a strain on hospitals, healthcare workers, and other essential\nservices employees. But, thankfully, Omicron is less virulent than earlier strains, and new case counts\nand hospitalizations are declining sharply in many parts of the U.S. Households and businesses are once\nagain proving to be resilient in the face of the virus.\n\nAlthough there continue to be risks and uncertainty around the outlook, when we get beyond Omicron,\ndemand should rebound quickly because the balance sheets of businesses and households are very\nhealthy. I expect some moderation in demand this year compared to last year, as the support from the\npandemic stimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative. But the\neconomy should still expand at an above-trend pace despite facing some challenges.\n\nOne challenge is the imbalance between demand and supply. The effects of the pandemic on the\neconomy have shifted over time. Early in the pandemic, when the economy shut down, the effects were\nmainly on the demand side. Now, with the economy reopened, the effects are mainly on the supply side.\n\n\f3\nDemand is strong and supply is struggling to keep up. It turns out that shutting down the economy can\nhappen pretty quickly but starting the economy back up again is slower and more complicated. And this\nhas implications for both parts of the FOMC’s dual mandate.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, and firms are still struggling to get necessary parts and\nmaterials through clogged ports and transportation channels. Many businesses are facing significantly\nhigher costs for available inputs. Rather than abating over last year, the disruptions continued to constrain\neconomic activity. Anecdotal reports suggest that some of the constraints may be stabilizing, delivery\ntimes appear to be improving, and half of our business contacts tell us that they expect some easing of the\nsupply disruptions during the second half of this year. Still, more than a third of our contacts do not\nexpect improvement until 2023.\n\nBusinesses are also struggling to get workers. By a number of measures, labor markets are very strong\nand the demand for workers is well outstripping labor supply. While payroll employment is still nearly 3\nmillion jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic level, job gains averaged over 550 thousand per\nmonth last year. The January jobs report showed continuing broad-based gains, with Omicron mainly\naffecting hours worked and absences. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent, down nearly 2-1/2\npercentage points from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it was before the\npandemic. According to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per unemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors, including child and elder care responsibilities and fear of the virus, have\ncontributed to the undersupply of workers. These factors should fade over time, but the precise timing\nand magnitude are open questions. Over a longer horizon, participation has been trending down since\nearly 2000 due to demographics, and many more people retired during the pandemic than predicted solely\nby demographics. So labor markets are likely to remain tight for some time. Businesses cite the shortage\nof labor as a very significant issue and have responded by raising wages, offering signing and retention\n\n\f4\nbonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and speeding up automation.\nAverage hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure on wages continues as\nfirms scramble to retain and attract workers.\n\nThe imbalances between demand and supply in both product and labor markets are contributing to the\nvery high inflation readings. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached 5.8 percent in December,\nand core PCE inflation reached 4.9 percent. Earlier last year, inflationary pressures were confined to a\nhandful of the most pandemic-affected categories. As the year wore on, the inflationary pressures\nbroadened considerably. In December 2020, about one-third of the components used to compute the\nCleveland Fed’s median CPI measure had inflation rates of 3 percent or more; that share has now risen to\nabout three-quarters of the components.\n\nHigh inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the\nwherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. Allowing inflation to remain at high levels can\nlead firms, households, and financial market participants to expect higher inflation over the longer term.\nSuch a rise in longer-term inflation expectations could then spill over into wage- and price-setting\ndynamics, leading to even more persistent inflation. And persistently high inflation would undermine\nsustaining a strong and inclusive expansion.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity\nconstraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. Nonetheless, I expect inflation to remain\nabove 2 percent this year and next, and I see the risks to inflation as tilted to the upside. My projection of\nsome moderation in inflation is conditioned on the FOMC taking appropriate action to transition away\nfrom the current emergency levels of accommodation and recalibrate to an economy in which inflation\nhas been running well above our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid\nmomentum in underlying demand is expected to continue.\n\n\f5\nThe Economy Is in a Different Place Than During the Last Transition\nThis brings me to my next point on what the transition will look like. The last time we began a transition\nto less accommodative monetary policy was after the Great Recession. The economy is in a very\ndifferent place now than it was then, so this transition will need to be different, too.\n\nThe recovery from the Great Recession was a slow one. While the recession officially ended in June\n2009, the FOMC held the funds rate at zero until December 2015, when it raised the rate by 25 basis\npoints. At that time, inflation was running below 1 percent, the unemployment rate was 5 percent, and\nreal GDP growth was under 2 percent. The FOMC did not raise the funds rate again until a year later.\nThereafter, the funds rate was gradually raised, with three 25-basis-point increases in 2017 and four more\nin 2018, the last one in December of that year, bringing the funds rate target range to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2\npercent.\n\nWith respect to the balance sheet, the FOMC engaged in sizable asset purchases in the wake of the Great\nRecession, increasing its asset holdings to about $4.5 trillion. The Fed did not begin reducing the size of\nits balance sheet until October 2017, nearly two years after liftoff and when the target range of the funds\nrate had risen to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. At that point, the unemployment rate was about 4-1/4 percent, real\noutput growth was near 2.7 percent, and inflation was still running slightly below 2 percent. Gradual\nreductions in assets continued until August 2019.\n\nThis time is very different. Instead of running below target, inflation has been running well above target\nfor some time and is now at a nearly 40-year high. Labor markets are tight and the economy grew at a\n5-1/2 percent pace last year. In addition, at nearly $9 trillion in assets, our balance sheet is now about\ndouble the size it was when the last reduction process began.\n\n\f6\nSo, barring a material change in the economy, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to move the funds\nrate up at a faster pace this time and to begin reducing the size of the balance sheet soon and more quickly\nthan last time. In terms of the balance sheet, I would also support selling some of our mortgage-backed\nsecurities at some point during the reduction process, something we did not do last time. Sales would\nhelp to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to primarily Treasury securities, which would\nminimize the effect of our balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of credit across economic sectors, one\nof the FOMC’s principles for reducing the size of our balance sheet.\n\nThe ultimate path policy takes will depend on the evolution of the economy, which brings me to my final\npoint which concerns monetary policy communications.\n\nMonetary Policy Communications\nAs you know, there was a substantial shift in the FOMC’s view of appropriate policy over the last year.\nIn last March’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median path of FOMC participants\nindicated that no change in the policy rate would be appropriate in 2022. By the December SEP, the\nmedian appropriate policy path showed the federal funds rate moving up by 75 basis points this year.\nThis change in projections reflected economic and financial developments and the resulting evolution of\nthe FOMC’s economic outlook and the risks around the outlook. For example, last March, the SEP’s\nmedian projections for unemployment and inflation for 2021 were 4.5 percent and 2.4 percent,\nrespectively, and the majority of participants saw the risks to each as broadly balanced. Instead, by the\nfourth quarter of 2021, the unemployment rate had actually fallen to 4.2 percent and year-over-year\ninflation had risen to 5.5 percent. And as indicated in the December SEP, the majority of participants\nnow saw the inflation risks as weighted to the upside. These economic developments informed the\nchange in the FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate policy.\n\n\f7\nAs the FOMC begins the process of reducing accommodation, its communications will need to transition\nas well. Earlier in the pandemic, in addition to the extraordinarily accommodative settings of our policy\nrate and asset purchases, we also provided fairly explicit forward guidance about our future policy\nsettings. In extraordinary economic times, forward guidance is more than a communications device. It is\nalso a monetary policy tool that has the potential to increase the degree of monetary policy\naccommodation, especially when interest rates are essentially at their zero lower bound. By reducing\nuncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance can help lower interest rates by reducing the\npremiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty. In addition, at least in\ntheory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be low for a long\ntime – perhaps lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central bank’s past\nbehavior – this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby spurring current\neconomic activity.\n\nBut now, instead of wanting to increase accommodation, the FOMC will be reducing it, so policy\ncommunications need to transition away from providing explicit forward guidance. Instead, we will need\nto convey the overall trajectory of policy and give the rationale for our policy decisions based on our\nassessment of the outlook and risks around the outlook, which are informed by economic and financial\ndevelopments. This change in communications will provide a better sense of the FOMC’s policy reaction\nfunction and should not be interpreted as the FOMC backing away from transparency. Clear\ncommunications are a very important part of monetary policymaking. First, to the extent that households,\nbusinesses, and financial market participants understand how policymakers are likely to react to economic\nand financial developments – whether the developments are anticipated or unanticipated – their policy\nexpectations will better align with those of policymakers. This means their decisions will be better\ninformed and monetary policy will be more effective. Second, policy transitions are often met with\nvolatility in financial markets, and this time is no exception. By keeping financial market participants’\n\n\f8\nexpectations aligned with those of policymakers, clear communications can mitigate the volatility that\nwould occur if there were a rapid or sizable realignment.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, I believe the case for transitioning monetary policy away from emergency levels of\naccommodation and recalibrating policy to today’s economic challenges in pursuit of our dual-mandate\ngoals is very compelling. While the experience after the Great Recession will inform this transition, the\neconomy is in a very different place, so the transition will be different, too. As monetary policy\ntransitions, our policy communications will also need to transition away from explicit forward guidance\nand toward conveying a sense of our policy trajectory and explaining the rationale for our policy\ndecisions in terms of economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and\nrisks around the outlook.\n\nThe task before the Fed is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary to bring inflation under\ncontrol while sustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy labor markets. Barring an\nunexpected turn in the economy, I believe it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up in March and\nfollow with further increases in the coming months. If by mid-year, I assess that inflation is not going to\nmoderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation at a faster pace over the second\nhalf of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than expected, then the pace of\nremoval could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half. So, the pace at which\nmonetary policy accommodation is removed will need to be data driven and forward looking. The\ncommunications challenge will be to convey a good sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional\non how the economy evolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular path\nregardless of how the economy evolves.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Rebalancing the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe European Economics and Financial Centre\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\nLondon, U.K.\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a real pleasure to join you again in the European Economics and Financial Centre’s Distinguished\nSpeakers Seminar series. I do hope we will be able to meet together in London sometime soon. But\nregardless of whether it is held in-person or virtually, I always enjoy this speaking opportunity because\nyour questions present interesting perspectives, which I contemplate long after the session is over. So I\nwill try to keep my prepared remarks on the U.S. economy and what’s ahead for monetary policy\nrelatively brief. As a reminder, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Activity\nIn an outlook talk at the beginning of the year, it is usually very safe to say that last year was an\ninteresting one and this year is shaping up to be an interesting one as well. That sentiment definitely fits\nour current situation. When we met early last year, I said that I thought the prospects were good for a\nmuch more favorable U.S. economy in 2021 than we had in 2020. That prediction came to pass, but the\nimprovements in the economy obscure the many challenges households, businesses, and policymakers\nfaced because of the ongoing pandemic. Indeed, economic developments continue to reflect the influence\nof the virus, as well as the extraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy put in place in response to the\npandemic.\n\nDespite the challenges, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year. Real GDP grew at a 5.5 percent\npace, the highest annual pace since 1984. Firms added a record 6.7 million jobs to their payrolls and the\nunemployment rate moved down to about 4 percent, close to its pre-pandemic level. The economy’s\nstrength reflected very robust demand by households and businesses. This demand was supported by\nextraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy, as well as the deployment of vaccinations, which allowed\nthe economy to reopen more fully. But this strong demand came at the same time there were constraints\non product supply and labor supply. The imbalances between supply and demand have put significant\n\n\f2\nupward pressures on prices and wages. Inflation readings in the U.S. are at their highest levels in nearly\n40 years, and nominal wages are accelerating at a faster pace than we have seen in decades.\n\nAlthough there continue to be risks and uncertainty around the outlook, I expect the strong economic\nexpansion to continue this year. Just as the Delta variant did last autumn, the Omicron variant is\nweighing on activity in high-contact services such as travel, dining, and leisure and hospitality. This\nvariant has put a strain on hospitals, healthcare workers, and other essential services employees. Because\nOmicron is so transmissible, it has exacerbated the labor shortages many businesses have been facing, and\nin response, many have had to reduce their operating hours. Thankfully, Omicron is less virulent than\nearlier strains, and new case counts and hospitalizations are declining sharply in many parts of the U.S.\nSince the start of the pandemic, as vaccination rates have risen and households and businesses have\nlearned to navigate the virus, each new wave of the virus has had less of an economic impact. My\nexpectation is that the immediate economic effects of the Omicron wave will be relatively small and\nshort-lived, and that households and businesses will once again prove to be resilient in the face of the\nvirus.\n\nWhen we get beyond Omicron, demand should rebound quickly. Business balance sheets are healthy.\nMany consumers have the wherewithal to continue to spend because household balance sheets are also\nvery healthy, bolstered by accumulated savings, higher earnings, and rising net worth. I expect growth to\nbe above trend this year, but to moderate from last year’s robust pace, as the support from the pandemic\nstimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative.\n\nSince the economy reopened, supply has struggled to keep up with demand. While shutting the economy\ndown at the start of the pandemic happened very quickly, starting the economy back up again has proved\nto be slower and more complicated. Differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across\nthe globe have disrupted global supply chains. Firms have struggled to get necessary parts and materials\n\n\f3\nthrough clogged ports and transportation channels and are facing significantly higher costs for available\ninputs. As last year wore on, rather than abating, the disruptions continued to constrain economic\nactivity. A recent sign of improvement comes from manufacturers in our Federal Reserve District, who\nreport that while lead times remain long, deliveries have become more predictable. Nonetheless, while\nhalf of our business contacts expect some easing of the supply disruptions during the second half of this\nyear, more than a third do not expect improvement until 2023.\n\nLabor Market Conditions\nBy a number of measures, labor markets are very strong and the demand for workers is well outstripping\nlabor supply. Payroll employment is still nearly 3 million jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic\nlevel, but job gains averaged over 550 thousand per month last year. Despite the effects of Omicron, the\nJanuary jobs report showed continuing broad-based gains. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent,\ndown nearly 2-1/2 percentage points from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it\nwas before the pandemic. According to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per\nunemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors have contributed to the undersupply of workers. Some people, especially\nwomen, left the workforce during the pandemic because of child or elder care responsibilities. Some may\nbe waiting until virus conditions improve before reentering the workforce. Others likely took the\nopportunity that their accumulated savings gave them to retrain for better jobs. These pandemic-related\nfactors that are holding back labor supply should fade over time, but when and by how much are open\nquestions. Over a longer horizon, participation has been trending down since early 2000 due to\ndemographics. In addition, during the pandemic, many more people retired than predicted solely by\ndemographic factors, and in previous business cycles, retirees have not tended to return to the workforce.\nThis means that it will likely take some time before labor demand and labor supply come into balance.\n\n\f4\nBusinesses cite the shortage of labor as a very significant issue and have responded by raising wages,\noffering signing and retention bonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and\nspeeding up automation. Average hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure\non wages continues as firms scramble to retain and attract workers. Seventy percent of our business\ncontacts reported increasing wages in the past month, and the share raising their wages has been 60\npercent or higher since last July.\n\nInflation\nCurrently, the imbalances between demand and supply in product and labor markets are contributing to\nthe very high inflation readings. Firms tell us that they are having little trouble passing on their higher\ncosts to their customers. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached 5.8 percent in December, and\ncore PCE inflation reached 4.9 percent. Both are at their highest levels since the early 1980s. The\nCleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation, median CPI, and trimmed-mean CPI are useful measures of the\nunderlying inflation trend and all have moved well above 2 percent. 1\n\nInflation levels began moving up last year as the economy reopened. At first, inflationary pressures were\nconfined to a handful of the most pandemic-affected categories, like lumber and durable goods. But as\nthe year wore on, the inflationary pressures broadened considerably. In December 2020, one-third of the\ncomponents used to compute the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure had inflation rates of 3 percent or\nmore; that share has now risen to three-quarters of the components.\n\nAt the end of 2020, many forecasters, including those at the Fed, thought that as the economy reopened\nmore fully in 2021, inflation rates would move up but remain slightly below our 2 percent target for the\nyear. As supply constraints pushed inflation rates above 2 percent early in 2021, most forecasters\n\nThese measures are maintained by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research and are available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n\n1\n\n\f5\nexpected inflation to move back down as constraints eased. But the supply constraints have persisted,\ndemand has been very strong, and inflation has continued to rise. As a result, inflation forecasts had to be\nrevised up over the year.\n\nYou can see this in our own FOMC projections. As its name suggests, the FOMC’s Summary of\nEconomic Projections – or SEP – gives a summary of the economic projections submitted by each FOMC\nparticipant. In the December 2020 SEP, the median projection of what PCE inflation would be in 2021\nwas 1.8 percent. By the December 2021 SEP, that projection had risen to 5.3 percent. In my view, even\nwith the upward revisions, the risks to inflation are still tilted to the upside.\n\nHigh inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the\nwherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. The nominal wage increases over the past year\nhave benefited many families, but for many of them, the increases have not kept up with inflation.\nAllowing inflation to remain at high levels can lead firms, households, and financial market participants\nto expect higher inflation over the longer term. A rise in longer-term inflation expectations could then\nspill over into wage- and price-setting dynamics, leading to even more persistent inflation. And\npersistently high inflation would undermine sustaining a strong and inclusive expansion.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity\nconstraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. But the timing and magnitude of that easing\nof constraints remain uncertain. My expectation is that inflation will moderate but remain above 2\npercent this year and next, but this forecast is conditional on the FOMC taking appropriate action.\n\nMonetary Policy\nJust as demand and supply need rebalancing, so does monetary policy. Inflation has been running well\nabove our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid momentum in underlying\n\n\f6\ndemand is expected to continue. So the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy that was needed\nearlier in the pandemic is no longer appropriate. Moreover, as inflation rates have risen, real interest rates\nhave moved down, meaning financial conditions have become even more accommodative, further raising\ndemand amid constrained supply. While monetary policy cannot alleviate the constraints on supply, it\ncan help to moderate demand by making broader financial conditions less accommodative, thereby\nreducing inflationary pressures.\n\nThe FOMC is now taking steps toward beginning the process of reducing accommodation. In November,\nthe FOMC started reducing the monthly pace at which it had been purchasing Treasury securities and\nagency mortgage-backed securities; in December, it sped up the reductions; and in January, it announced\nthat the purchases would end in March. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the\nsevere strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and they have continued to support the\neconomy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. But now, markets are functioning and a solid\nexpansion is underway, so these purchases are no longer needed.\n\nThe Fed’s main policy tool is the federal funds rate. Since March 2020, the FOMC has maintained the\ntarget range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. This January, the Committee announced that it will\nsoon be appropriate to raise the target range. While the Omicron variant may weigh on activity in the\nnear term, the high levels of inflation and the tightness in labor markets make a compelling case to begin\nrecalibrating the stance of monetary policy. Barring an unexpected turn in the economy, I support\nbeginning to remove accommodation by moving the funds rate up in March.\n\nWhat about the future course of monetary policy? It is clear that removing the extraordinary monetary\npolicy accommodation is needed to help rebalance the economy. The last time we began such a process\nwas in December 2015, and it was a very gradual process, with the target range of the fed funds rate\nreaching 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in December 2018. This time, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to\n\n\f7\nmove the funds rate up at a faster pace because inflation is considerably higher and labor markets are\nmuch tighter than in 2015. In my view, increases in the fed funds rate in the coming months will be\nneeded, but the ultimate path of the fed funds rate in terms of the number and pace of increases will\ndepend on how the economy evolves. For example, if by mid-year, I assess that inflation is not going to\nmoderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation at a faster pace over the second\nhalf of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than expected, then the pace of\nremoval could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half.\n\nIn terms of our balance sheet, we currently hold nearly $9 trillion in assets, which is about 36 percent of\nnominal GDP. This is double the asset holdings at the start of the pandemic. In January, the FOMC\nreleased a set of principles to guide the planned significant reduction in the size of our balance sheet.\nThese principles affirm that the federal funds rate is our main tool for adjusting monetary policy, that\nreductions in the balance sheet will commence after the process of increasing the policy rate has begun,\nand that we intend to reduce our security holdings in a predictable way over time. The principles also\nreaffirm that in the longer run, the FOMC will hold primarily Treasury securities in its portfolio to\nminimize the effect of the Fed’s holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.\nToday, as a result of our purchases, about a third of our portfolio, over $2.5 trillion, comprises agency\nsecurities. While our principles state that we will reduce balance-sheet assets primarily by adjusting the\nreinvestment amounts of the principal payments we receive on our assets, I would support selling some of\nour mortgage-backed securities at some point during the reduction period to speed the conversion of our\nportfolio’s composition to primarily Treasuries.\n\nThe FOMC has begun to discuss the plan to implement balance-sheet reduction in accordance with the\nguiding principles. We have the benefit of having done this once before. In the wake of the Great\nRecession, the FOMC engaged in sizable asset purchases, increasing its asset holdings to about $4.5\ntrillion, or about 25 percent of nominal GDP at its peak. In October 2017, nearly two years after liftoff of\n\n\f8\nthe fed funds rate from zero and with the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent, the FOMC began shrinking its\nbalance sheet at a gradual pace. The reductions lasted until August 2019. While this experience will\ninform our plans, this time, things are different. First, the balance sheet is about double the size it was\nthen, and even in our ample-reserves operating regime, it is considerably larger than the size needed to\nimplement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Second, inflation is much higher and labor\nmarkets are much tighter than they were then. So in my view, conditions warrant that we start balancesheet reductions soon and go at a faster pace than we did last time.\n\nWhen to stop the reductions will depend on the banking sector’s demand for reserves, as well as the\ndistribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. As the process to reduce the\nsize of the balance sheet progresses, we will be monitoring developments in money markets to determine\nthe appropriate levels of reserves and balance-sheet size at which to stop the reductions. We will remain\nprepared to adjust the plan in light of economic and financial developments, if necessary.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, in setting monetary policy, the Fed is committed to achieving both parts of its dual mandate:\nprice stability and maximum employment. While the current extraordinarily accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy was needed to support the economy earlier in the pandemic, that stance is no longer\nappropriate. Strong demand in both product and labor markets is outpacing constrained supply, and\ninflation is at its highest level in nearly 40 years. Inflation well above our goal undermines sustaining a\nstrong and inclusive expansion. So the task before us is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary\nto bring inflation under control. Doing so will help sustain the expansion in activity and healthy labor\nmarkets.\n\nThe process of transitioning to a less accommodative monetary policy stance in the U.S. is beginning. As\nthis process continues, our monetary policy decisions will need to be data driven and forward looking.\n\n\f9\nEconomic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the\noutlook will inform the pace at which we remove accommodation in pursuit of our goals.\n\nWhile their actions are not coordinated, other central banks, including the Bank of England, have also\nbegun to move to a less accommodative monetary policy stance as economic conditions have improved\nand inflation has risen. Policy transitions are often met with some volatility in financial markets, and this\ntime is no exception. Clear communications can help keep the public’s policy expectations aligned with\nthose of policymakers during the policy transitions underway. Despite the challenges and risks, my\nexpectations are that these transitions will be successful, inflation will come under control, and the\neconomic expansion will be sustained.\n\n\f"
