Kaufman Center for Financial Policy Studies\nQuinlan School of Business, Loyola University Chicago\nChicago, IL\nNovember 29, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Doug Evanoff and the George G. Kaufman Center for Financial Policy Studies at Loyola\nUniversity Chicago for inviting me to speak today. It is a particular honor to be part of a program\norganized by the Kaufman Center. As a researcher working on banking issues, I had the great\nopportunity to meet George Kaufman early in my career. He was generous with his advice about how to\nestablish a productive research agenda and the importance of participating in conferences like this one.\nEven though I was not one of his students, George was a role model who inspired me and other\nresearchers to do their best work to help further the safety and soundness of the banking system and foster\nfinancial stability.\n\nToday I will speak about financial system resilience, its interactions with monetary policy in the context\nof today’s economy, and some recommendations for increasing the resilience of the banking system. The\nviews I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIn less than two decades, the world has experienced two historically deep negative shocks to the global\neconomy and financial system. While their causes were different, the global financial crisis of 2008 and\nthe COVID-19 pandemic that hit in 2020 each necessitated the intervention of central banks in ways not\ncontemplated in earlier decades. This spring, the Fed was required to intervene again to address stresses\nin the banking system that were precipitated by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature\nBank. This stress episode was a painful reminder that whether we are operating in a low-interest-rate\nenvironment or in a high-interest-rate environment, financial system vulnerabilities can lead to adverse\nshocks being propagated across the financial system and sometimes very quickly. The episode also\nunderscored that to promote financial system resilience, financial institutions must properly manage risks\nand supervisors must effectively monitor risks. In the wake of the SVB failure, the Federal Reserve is\ncurrently evaluating and taking appropriate steps to improve its supervision, including its speed, force,\n\n\f2\nand agility.1 An underlying factor in SVB’s failure was the bank’s poor management of interest rate risk.\nThis poor management was revealed as the Fed raised interest rates in response to very high inflation in\nthe aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nThe Economy\nAlthough the pandemic is over, in many ways its effects are still with us. The changes in household and\nbusiness spending patterns, workforce participation, housing demand, and supply chains, all of which\narose during the pandemic, are in many ways still shaping the economy.\n\nThese changes led to a situation in which demand in both product markets and labor markets became out\nof balance with supply in those markets. These imbalances occurred in an environment of\naccommodative fiscal and monetary policy, which helped to sustain the significant increase in inflation\nthat started in 2021. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9\npercent, depending on the measure.\n\nTo combat high inflation, the Fed has tightened monetary policy, raising the fed funds rate, starting in\nMarch 2022, by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s balance\nsheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022.\nThis balance-sheet reduction is also firming the stance of monetary policy through its effect on the term\npremium on long-term bond yields.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions, which has been\ntransmitting through the economy, helping to moderate demand. At the same time, supply conditions\n\nFor further discussion, see Michael S. Barr, “Supervision and Regulation,” testimony before the Committee on\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C., November 14, 2023.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/barr20231113a.htm)\n1\n\n\f3\nhave improved. Economic activity and employment growth have slowed, although they have remained\nmore resilient than most forecasters, including FOMC participants, had expected earlier this year.\n\nInflation has been running well above the Fed’s goal for more than two years. While it is still above our 2\npercent goal, there has been discernible progress on inflation even while the overall economy has\nremained relatively strong. It will take some time to get inflation back down to 2 percent, but the FOMC\nis committed to doing so. Monetary policy is in a good place for policymakers to assess incoming\ninformation on the economy and financial conditions and judge whether policy is well calibrated to\nensure that inflation is on a timely path back to 2 percent. Whether the fed funds rate needs to go higher\nthan its current level and for how long policy needs to remain restrictive will depend importantly on\nwhether the economy is evolving as expected, how the risks are changing, and the progress being made\non our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The Israel-Hamas war is a human tragedy, as is\nthe ongoing war in Ukraine. Heightened geopolitical tensions pose risks to the medium-run outlook, with\nimplications for financial markets, oil prices, and global demand. The slowdown in the Chinese economy\nalso poses a risk to the outlook.\n\nAs the FOMC has communicated, two important considerations for calibrating monetary policy going\nforward are how much of the past tightening is yet to transmit through the economy and how restrictive\nmonetary policy is. There is some uncertainty around both of these. Monetary policy transmits to the\nbroader economy by affecting overall financial conditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with\nwhich it affects the economy vary with the nature of the shocks that have hit the economy and other\naspects of the economic environment.2 While the policy stance is currently widely viewed as restrictive,\n\n2\n\nRomer and Romer provide estimates of the effects of contractionary monetary policy shocks on real GDP, the\nunemployment rate, and inflation in various tightening cycles. See Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer,\n\n\f4\nthe resilience the economy has shown in the face of high interest rates has underscored the difficulty of\nknowing precisely how restrictive policy is partly because of the uncertainty about the level of the neutral\nreal interest rate, so-called r-star.\n\nWhen policymakers are confronted with uncertainty, scenario analysis can be a helpful guide. In an\nuncertain economic environment, it is important to look at various models and various scenarios, because\nthe economy could evolve quite a bit differently than expected. If it does, monetary policy will need to be\nnimble and respond appropriately to the evolving outlook and to the risks to achieving both parts of our\ndual mandate. I believe the current level of the funds rate positions us well to do that.\n\nFinancial System Vulnerabilities\nThe stress in the banking industry generated by the bank failures in March has subsided, but the\nunderlying conditions and causes of this stress remain. As interest rates began rising in 2022, funding\nrisks for banks increased and they remain elevated.\n\nMany banks are holding longer-term securities, which if they had to be sold and marked-to-market would\nresult in losses. Some of these banks have sizable exposure to the segments of commercial real estate that\nare particularly under stress, such as office buildings, and over the next year many of the CRE assets at\nbanks will need to be refinanced at higher interest rates.\n\nAt some banks, the declines in the fair value of fixed-rate assets have been large relative to their\nregulatory capital levels, especially for some large but non-globally-systemically-important banks and\n\n“Presidential Address: Does Monetary Policy Matter? The Narrative Approach after 35 Years,” American Economic\nReview 113, 2023, pp. 1395-1423. (https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.113.6.1395)\n\n\f5\nsome regional banks. A portion of these banks have above-average reliance on uninsured deposits,\nmaking them particularly vulnerable to shocks.\n\nOf course, it isn’t only banks that are vulnerable to shocks. After the bank failures this spring, some\nmoney market funds also experienced high redemptions. Reforms adopted by the SEC in July aim to\nincrease the resilience of money market funds, but they have not yet been put to the test.3\n\nFinancial System Resilience\nIn times of banking and financial stress, regulators find themselves with a time-inconsistency problem.\nForcing one bank to take actions to raise capital or address other risk-management concerns during a\nperiod of stress could precipitate a widespread reevaluation of the banking industry by investors and\ndepositors resulting in a systemic event. In such cases, regulators and supervisors might lean toward\nforbearance even if this creates bad incentives for financial institutions to manage risks in the future.\n\nAvoiding this potential bias requires fostering a financial system that is resilient to shocks across the\nbusiness and financial cycles. Financial system resilience supports the attainment of our macroeconomic\ngoals. A resilient financial system is one in which banks may tighten their credit standards but they are\nable to continue lending to creditworthy businesses and households during economic downturns, financial\nmarkets are able to continue intermediating in an orderly fashion during periods of stress, and monetary\npolicy continues to transmit to the broader economy and is not disrupted by financial system stresses.\n\nIncreased resilience has the added benefit of limiting the times in which monetary policy and financial\nstability goals come into conflict. Usually, these goals are complementary. An unstable financial system\ncan propagate adverse macroeconomic shocks over broad economic sectors and over time to the detriment\n\n3\n\nSee the SEC press release announcing the reforms at https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-129.\n\n\f6\nof macroeconomic stability. In the other direction, well-formulated and well-communicated monetary\npolicy supports financial stability by allowing households, firms, and financial institutions to make better\ninvestment, saving, borrowing, and lending decisions, and price stability eliminates a source of asset-price\nvolatility.\n\nBut there may be times when the goals come into conflict. Since monetary policy actions affect financial\nconditions, they can also affect financial stability risks. For example, a prolonged period of very low\ninterest rates may contribute to financial vulnerabilities by spurring search-for-yield behavior,\nencouraging higher debt levels, or eroding lending standards. Similarly, a period of rapidly tightening\nfinancial conditions raises the risk of increased volatility, market dysfunction, and the potential that a\nshock could be amplified by known vulnerabilities in the financial system or reveal previously unknown\nvulnerabilities, including high levels of leverage. This means that, at times, policymakers may be faced\nwith intertemporal tradeoffs between their monetary policy and financial stability policy goals, and these\ntradeoffs will vary over the business and credit cycles.\n\nThe question is how best to limit these tradeoffs. A general consensus has emerged that it is better to use\nsupervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools to address financial stability concerns and monetary\npolicy tools to address macroeconomic stability concerns. This is a desirable separation; indeed, it is\noptimal in some theoretical models. Increased financial system resilience will help limit the times this\nseparation cannot be maintained.\n\nIn March, financial stability tools were used to address stresses in the banking system. This allowed the\nFed to continue to use its monetary policy tools for macroeconomic purposes, and we proceeded with an\n\n\f7\nincrease in the federal funds rate at our March meeting. But those financial stability tools involved\nregulators invoking the systemic risk exception and implementing a new lending facility.4\n\nIncreasing the overall resilience of the financial system would diminish the need for the Fed and other\nregulators to have to step in, whether it be to reduce market dysfunction by buying Treasury assets, as we\nhad to do in October 2019 and March 2020, or having to set up special facilities to serve as the lender of\nlast resort, actions that have the potential to change us into the lender of first resort.\n\nRecommended Steps to Increase the Resilience of the Banking System\nThe stresses in the banking system earlier this year underscored the challenge of ensuring that financial\ninstitutions have enough capital when their assets decline in value. Cyclical macroprudential tools aim to\nsolve this problem by mitigating the systemic risk that can build up over the business cycle. In the U.S.,\nthese tools are basically limited to the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) and the stress test. The\nCCyB is intended to require banks to hold more capital during periods of high credit growth, which often\ncoincides with the accumulation of system-wide risk.\n\nHowever, the lead times needed to use this tool limit its effectiveness in addressing vulnerabilities that\nmay develop rapidly or that can be detected only after they are far along. This suggests the need to raise\nthe buffer in good times before we see the vulnerabilities, yet we have never raised the CCyB above zero\nin the U.S.\n\nTo make the CCyB more effective and time consistent, it should be recalibrated to be at a positive level in\nnormal times, and then raised when credit growth moves up and lowered when credit growth moves down\n\n4\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) on March 12, 2023.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm)\n\n\f8\nbased on a systematic rule. In my view, being systematic about financial stability policy, including\nsupervision and regulation, is perhaps even more important than it is for monetary policy because of the\nimportant role played by incentives and asymmetric information in financial markets and institutions.\nApplying policy systematically could help tame some of the moral hazard and time-inconsistency\nproblems that policymakers face when promoting financial resilience.5\n\nWith respect to the other main macroprudential tool, I believe that the current stress tests should be\nredesigned with an eye to making them a more effective countercyclical capital tool so that banks would\nneed to build up their capital buffers when they are better able to do so.\n\nUntil we create more effective macroprudential tools and show that we are willing to use them, we should\nset standards for the through-the-cycle structural resilience tools, including capital and liquidity\nrequirements, somewhat higher than they otherwise would be. I view the Basel III endgame capital\nproposal as aligned with this view.6\n\nBanks’ capital positions affect their lending, which in turn affects the macroeconomy. Research indicates\nthat well-capitalized banks tend to lend more than poorly capitalized ones, to grow their loan and deposit\nmarket shares during crises by purchasing assets from less well-capitalized banks,7 and to have more\naccess to market funding during downturns than do less capitalized banks.8 A well-capitalized banking\n\nI discuss the benefits of systematic financial stability policy in Loretta J.

This is not to say that ever-increasing\nlevels of required capital would be optimal. There would come a point where the requirement would so\nthwart risk-taking and beneficial innovation that it would undermine longer-run economic growth.9\nIndeed, a recent research paper presents a theoretical model in which the distribution of capital across\nbanks and not just the level determines the socially optimal capital structure for the banking system.10\nBut in my view, we are still below the level of capital where increasing it would be counterproductive.\n\nThe stresses in the banking system earlier this year point to other reforms that should be considered.\nFirst, much of bank regulation is tied to book values instead of market values. Moving toward marketvalue accounting for more of a bank’s balance sheet and basing more of bank regulation on market values\nwould help align regulation and supervision with market forces. Even if regulations are not changed,\nhaving supervisors pay more attention to market values would likely spur earlier actions to ensure\nadequate risk management at banks and would help focus supervisory attention on areas of highest\nvulnerability.11\n\nSecond, much of bank regulation aims to lower the probability of financial system instability. But we\nshould also take steps to reduce the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the\nfinancial system. Resilience is a combination of both of these. More effort needs to be expended on\ncreating an effective, credible, and time-consistent bank resolution mechanism. If regulators were able to\n\nSee Paul Tucker, “Microprudential versus Macroprudential Supervision: Functions That Make Sense Only as Part\nof an Overall Regime for Financial Stability,” remarks at the 59 th Economic Conference: Macroprudential Monetary\nPolicy, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 2-3, 2015.\n(https://www.bostonfed.org/macroprudential2015/agenda/index.htm;\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/macroprudential2015/papers/Tucker.pdf)\n9\n\nFenghua Song and Anjan V. Thakor, “Market Freeze and Bank Capital Structure Heterogeneity,” Management\nScience 69, 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4374)\n10\n\n11\n\nHow best to do this is not straightforward. See, e.g., Philip Bond, Itay Goldstein, and Edward Simpson Prescott,\n“Market-Based Corrective Actions,” The Review of Financial Studies 23, 2010, pp. 781–820.\n(https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhp059)\n\n\f10\nconfidently resolve systemically important financial institutions in a way that avoids causing system-wide\ninstability, they would be in a much better position when the inevitable shock hits the financial system.\n\nThird, while much regulation and supervision focuses on credit risk, more attention should be given to\nliquidity risk and interest rate risk. SVB lost over $40 billion of deposits, about one-quarter of its total\ndeposits, in a day, showing that money can flow out of a bank much more quickly than ever imagined.\nAs lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve System promotes financial stability by lending against good\ncollateral to healthy banks facing temporary liquidity problems. Currently, the Reserve Banks are\nencouraging eligible financial institutions to ensure that they have the legal agreements and collateral in\nplace and have tested their ability to use the discount window in a timely way should the need arise.\nTesting at this time is not mandatory, but requiring such testing as part of sound liquidity management is\nworth considering, as is tightening the liquidity coverage ratio requirement so that banks have to hold\nhigher levels of liquid assets to cover potential cash outflows. Another idea worth consideration is\nrequiring banks to post collateral in proportion to their short-term funding, so they would be ready to\nborrow at the discount window should that funding start to run.\n\nI have been speaking mostly about banks, but we also need to take steps to increase the structural\nresilience of nonbank financial firms and markets, ensure that the financial system’s supervisory and\nregulatory structure keeps pace with innovations, and improve our visibility in the nonbank financial\nsector. Not having the data needed to adequately measure the risks and vulnerabilities in a particular\nsegment of the financial system should not lure us into thinking that the vulnerabilities are small or don’t\nexist. For example, there is a general lack of transparency and lack of verifiable information around the\nassets backing many stablecoins, leading to the possibility of sharp changes in prices and substantial\nlosses for their investors. Stablecoins are one example, but there are several parts of the financial system\non which we do not have sufficient data to make a clear assessment of the risks. This includes data on\ncentral counterparties’ member concentrations, principal trading firms, and nonbank funders. The fact\n\n\f11\nthat we can’t put the risks on a dashboard doesn’t mean the risks don’t exist. The Financial Stability\nBoard has recognized the need to better understand the interconnections between bank and nonbank\nintermediation, the amplification of shocks, and the overall resilience of the nonbank financial sector.12\n\nCyber resilience is also an area that requires continued focus. All aspects of the financial system,\nincluding markets, nonbanks, and banks, are subject to cyber risk and to operational risks more generally.\nThese are not potential risks; these risks are actually being realized. Continued supervisory focus on\nensuring that financial institutions are making the investments needed to prevent cyber incidents and the\ninvestments needed to ensure they can recover in a timely way when the inevitable cyber event occurs is\nvery important, especially in the current environment when bank profits are under pressure and banks are\ntaking actions to cut costs.\n\nAs with monetary policy, scenario analysis can play an important role in understanding the financial\nsystem’s vulnerabilities to various shocks. Looking at various stress scenarios involving relevant risks\ncan make policymakers better prepared for what could happen even if it is not viewed as the most likely\nsituation at the time. And the more uncertain the environment, the wider the set of possible scenarios that\nshould be examined.\n\nIt is important to remember that in a situation of significantly increasing financial stability risks, the\nblurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals increases as well: if the risks to\nfinancial stability are sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also be\nin jeopardy over the medium run. More work needs to be done to determine how best to handle the nexus\nbetween monetary policy and financial stability. The FOMC’s current statement on its monetary policy\n\nSee Financial Stability Board, “Promoting Global Financial Stability: 2023 FSB Annual Report,” October 11,\n2023. (https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P111023.pdf)\n12\n\n\f12\nstrategy says that “sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable\nfinancial system” and that the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions do reflect its “assessments of the\nbalance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the\nCommittee’s goals.”13 I would like the FOMC’s next framework review, which Chair Jay Powell has\nrecently indicated will start in the latter half of 2024,14 to develop that further. The revised statement\nshould clarify the strategy for handling the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability\npolicy, shedding more light on how the FOMC takes into account the potential impact of monetary policy\non financial stability risks and how those risks influence the Committee’s monetary policy decisions.\n\nFinally, I would also like to encourage the Kaufman Center to continue furthering research on the\nfinancial system and its role in promoting economic growth and financial stability. Good policymaking is\ninformed by good research. Advances in research will help ensure that our financial system remains\nresilient, which is fundamental for a strong economy.\n\nSee “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012; as\nreaffirmed effective January 31, 2023.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\n13\n\nJerome H.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nShadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting\nNew York, NY\nOctober 20, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Shadow Open Market Committee for inviting me to speak today. The SOMC is known for\nfostering an active exchange of diverse views on the economy and monetary policy, with the aim of\ncontributing to better policy decisions. I believe robust policy discussions and deliberations are very\nconstructive, and I am looking forward to the question-and-answer portion of this session. To help frame\nthat discussion, let me start with a review of economic developments and my perspectives on monetary\npolicy. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nJane Austen is often (erroneously) credited with having written: “It isn’t what we say or think that defines\nus, but what we do.” That sentiment is only partially true in monetary policymaking. It is true in the\nsense that a central bank will lose its credibility with the public if it merely says it is committed to 2\npercent inflation but does not take action to bring high inflation down. In this case, high inflation could\nbecome embedded in people’s view of the economy and affect their behavior in ways inconsistent with\nprice stability, making it much harder for the central bank to achieve its policy goals. But the quote does\nnot fully apply to monetary policymaking because how and what policymakers communicate are very\nimportant in aligning the public’s expectations with policy actions, and this alignment can make these\nactions more effective.\n\nThe FOMC’s policy actions and communications have contributed to discernible progress on inflation.\nAs we calibrate policy to finish the job, both word and deed will continue to be important. This is\nparticularly true because the economic environment is quite uncertain. The events in the Middle East are\nstill unfolding, adding uncertainty to what was already an uncertain geopolitical environment. The IsraelHamas War is a human tragedy. It is too soon to determine the full economic and financial market\nramifications of the war for the global economy, but they will need to be considered as we chart the future\npath of monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate goals.\nOver the past three years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been a major source of uncertainty.\n\n\f2\nWhen the pandemic hit, the economy shut down in March 2020, and fiscal and monetary policymakers\ntook aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow and\nlimiting lasting damage to the economy. When public health statistics began to improve in May 2020, the\neconomy began to reopen. But it was not business as usual. Spending patterns had shifted from services\nto goods early in the pandemic and have only gradually been shifting back to pre-pandemic trends. Many\npeople decided to leave the workforce when the pandemic hit and only gradually decided to rejoin. The\nparticipation rate of workers between the ages of 25 and 54 has now surpassed what it was in 2019, but\nthe overall participation rate is still below its pre-pandemic level. Remote work became much more\ncommon. This led to changes in the demand for housing, and sales of new and existing single-family\nhomes surged in 2020 and 2021. In addition, supply chains were disrupted, making it much harder for\nfirms to keep up with the demand for their products.\n\nThe changes in spending patterns, workforce participation, housing demand, and supply chains that arose\nduring the pandemic are in many ways still shaping the economy. They led to a situation in which\ndemand in both product markets and labor markets became out of balance with supply. Those imbalances\noccurred in an environment of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, which helped to sustain the\nsignificant increase in inflation that started in 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,\nanother ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and\nother commodities. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9 percent,\ndepending on the measure.\n\nEconomic Developments in Response to Monetary Policy\nWhen inflation began moving up in April 2021, the FOMC communicated in its post-meeting statements\nthat elevated inflation largely reflected factors that the Committee expected would be transitory. By\nDecember 2021, the FOMC’s view had changed and it no longer referred to inflation as transitory. In\nJanuary 2022, the FOMC said that with inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the\nCommittee expected it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.\n\n\f3\nFinancial conditions tightened in reaction to this forward guidance. Following through on its guidance,\nthe Fed took action by raising the fed funds rate by 25 basis points in March 2022 and has now raised the\nfed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May\n2022. This balance-sheet reduction is also firming the stance of monetary policy through its effect on the\nterm premium on long-term bond yields.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions and, in response,\naggregate demand has begun to moderate. At the same time, supply chain disruptions have improved and\nimbalances between supply and demand are easing. While demand has moderated, economic activity has\nbeen considerably more resilient than most forecasters, including FOMC participants, were expecting.\nConsumer spending makes up about 70 percent of GDP. It has been increasing at a solid pace, supported\nby strong income growth and the still-elevated savings accumulated during the pandemic. Bankers in the\nFourth District report there has been an uptick in usage of home equity lines of credit and credit card debt,\nsuggesting that some households have exhausted ready balances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have\nalso edged up, although they are still at historically low levels. As savings balances normalize and credit\nconditions remain restrictive, consumer spending is expected to moderate.\n\nBusinesses have slowed their spending on equipment and software this year, and it is expected to continue\nto moderate given restrictive credit conditions. In the housing market, activity has slowed but the longerterm shortage of available housing has meant less of a slowdown than one would have expected given\nthat the 30-year mortgage rate is near 8 percent. The shortfall in housing supply has kept rents and house\nprices high.\n\n\f4\nIn response to the evolving picture, FOMC participants’ projections of economic growth this year were\nrevised up in September.1 Earlier in the year, FOMC participants projected that growth would be well\nbelow trend in 2023. In September, the median projection was that growth will be a bit over 2 percent,\nwhich is somewhat above trend. Still, growth is expected to slow to below trend next year as tighter\ncredit and financial conditions and waning fiscal support for households weigh on spending.\n\nLabor market conditions also paint a picture of moderation and resilience. Firms have reduced their job\npostings and more people are coming back into the job market. Firms report it is easier to find the\nworkers they need. Still, labor market conditions remain quite strong. The unemployment rate is low, at\n3.8 percent. Job growth has slowed over the course of the year, but the strong reading in September and\nrevisions to the July and August data suggest the slowdown has been less than once thought. Payroll\ngains averaged about 300 thousand per month over the first three months of the year compared with about\n270 thousand per month on average over July through September. Restrictive financial conditions should\nhelp to continue to moderate labor demand, bringing demand into better balance with supply. The\nunemployment rate is likely to move up somewhat as this rebalancing occurs, but I expect overall labor\nmarket conditions to remain solid.\n\nDespite strong job growth in September, wage pressures are easing by some measures. Our business\ncontacts expect wage increases to be less over the coming year than last year, except for workers with\nhard-to-find skills. But at 4 percent, expected wage increases are higher than before the pandemic and\nwell above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation, based on current estimates of trend productivity\ngrowth. Wage-price dynamics can be quite complicated. An open question is whether inflation leads\nwage growth or whether it is the other way around. One wage Phillips curve model from the Cleveland\nFed suggests that inflation leads wage growth, with the model attributing much of the high wage growth\n\nFour times a year, the FOMC summarizes Committee participants’ projections of output growth, the\nunemployment rate, inflation, and the associated appropriate policy path.

That\nsaid, it is important to acknowledge the discernible progress that has been made on inflation even while\nthe overall economy has remained relatively strong. As of August, the headline PCE inflation rate is\nrunning at 3-1/2 percent, which is half of its peak rate in June of last year. The underlying measures of\ninflation, including the core, median, and trimmed-mean measures, have also moved down from their\npeaks. The progress is easier to see when you look at the price changes over shorter time horizons, such\nas three-month or six-month annualized inflation rates. But the CPI report for September is a reminder\nthat we cannot count on the progress continuing at the same good pace we have seen in recent months.\nThe larger declines in inflation have come in goods prices. Inflation in housing services, measured by\nrents and the imputed rents for owner-occupied housing, has begun to come down, but the recent CPI\ninflation report suggests that the adjustment could be gradual. The most stubborn part of the index has\nbeen inflation in core services excluding housing. This component, which makes up about half of the\nconsumption basket, has shown little improvement over time.\n\nSee Martin DeLuca and Willem Van Zandweghe, “Postpandemic Nominal Wage Growth: Inflation Pass-Through\nor Labor Market Imbalance?” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Economic Commentary, No. 023-13, August 14,\n2023.

When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level\nis moving up faster than we would like and households and businesses are having to pay those higherthan-desired prices. In addition, high inflation distorts investment decisions, imposing longer-run costs\non the economy.4 In my view, the risks to the inflation forecast remain tilted to the upside. Oil prices are\nup, on net, since July and may pass through to other core prices. In addition, gasoline prices are higher\nthan at the start of the year and are particularly prominent for households that have to fill up their cars or\ntrucks once or twice a week. Rising gasoline prices could begin to make consumers think inflation will\nbe rising again. I don’t expect that this is going to move inflation back up to the very high levels we saw\nlast year, but it could stall the progress we have seen over the past few months.\n\nA distinguishing feature of this high-inflation episode compared with those in the 1970s and early 1980s\nhas been the fact that despite high inflation rates, medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have\nremained reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. There\ncould be several reasons for this, but one likely factor is that the Fed now has an explicit numerical\nlonger-term inflation goal of 2 percent. In addition, over this episode, we have communicated our\ncommitment to achieving this goal, and we have taken actions to support this commitment. Our\ncommunications have been an important policy tool, reinforcing the actions we have taken and making\nthem more effective by anchoring inflation expectations. Ensuring that the public views the commitment\nas credible can reduce the costs of disinflation. Indeed, research indicates that the disinflation that thenFed Chair Paul Volcker had to engineer in the 1980s was costly in terms of cumulative output losses not\nonly because the Fed had to tighten monetary policy enough to get inflation down from high levels, but\nalso because the Fed had to make the public understand that it would not abandon its commitment to price\nstability as inflation started to come down. Regaining credibility was important in moving the public’s\n\nL’Huillier Bowles and DeLuca discuss some of the channels through which high inflation can affect economic\nwelfare and impose longer-run costs on the economy.

Appropriate words and deeds will continue to be crucial as we finish the job. This\nbrings me to monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy Calibration\nAt its September meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Fed’s securities holdings. In determining the extent of\nadditional policy firming that may be appropriate, the FOMC will be assessing incoming economic and\nfinancial developments, as well as the cumulative effects of the tightening done so far, since we know that\nmonetary policy affects the economy with a lag. The economic projections released by the FOMC in\nSeptember indicated that the median participant thought that another rate increase would be appropriate\nthis year and that monetary policy would likely have to be held sufficiently restrictive for a while in order\nto get inflation back down to 2 percent. This is consistent with my own reading of economic conditions,\nthe outlook, and the risks to the outlook.\n\nBut whether the fed funds rate needs to go higher than its current level and for how long policy needs to\nremain restrictive will depend importantly on how the economy evolves relative to the outlook and how\nthe risks are changing. To guide my policy views, I will be carefully assessing incoming evidence to\ndetermine whether the economy is evolving as expected. Risk management considerations are becoming\nincreasingly important as we set monetary policy in a way that balances the costs over time of potentially\nover-tightening vs. under-tightening monetary policy. Tightening too much would slow the economy\nmore than necessary and entail higher costs than needed to get inflation back to our goal. Tightening too\nlittle would allow high inflation to persist, with short- and long-run consequences, and would necessitate\na much longer and more costly journey back to price stability.\n\nMarvin Goodfriend and Robert G. King, “The Incredible Volcker Disinflation,” Journal of Monetary Economics\n52, pp. 981-1015, 2005. (https://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2011/01/GKcr2005.pdf)\n5\n\n\f8\n\nThere is always uncertainty around the outlook, but uncertainty is higher in the current environment. In\naddition to upside risks to inflation, geopolitical uncertainty has risen, with implications for financial\nmarkets, oil prices, and global demand. The slowdown in the Chinese economy, the possibility of an\nextended UAW strike, and the potential for a government shutdown later this year all pose some risks\naround the outlook. The structural changes to the economy since the pandemic, including changes to the\nlabor market and supply chains, also complicate the picture. Indeed, our models are trained on past data,\nbut the pandemic was unprecedented and that has complicated forecasting. Post-pandemic, it has become\neven more important to look at several models, examine different scenarios, and collect real-time\ninformation from regional contacts to inform policymaking.\n\nLags and Stance\nAs the FOMC has communicated, two important considerations for calibrating monetary policy going\nforward are how much of the past tightening is yet to transmit through the economy and how restrictive\nmonetary policy is. Monetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial\nconditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature\nof the shocks that have hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment.6 It is possible\nthat the Fed’s use of forward guidance has sped up the transmission of monetary policy to the broader\neconomy, affecting financial conditions before the actual changes in monetary policy have occurred.7 For\nexample, tightening in financial conditions occurred several months in advance of the first Fed rate\nincrease in March 2022. Other research suggests that even controlling for the increased use of forward\nguidance and balance-sheet policy, the lag in the effect of monetary policy on inflation shortened in the\n\n6\n\nRomer and Romer provide estimates of the effects of contractionary monetary policy shocks on real GDP, the\nunemployment rate, and inflation in various tightening cycles.

(https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.113.6.1395)\nSee Stefania D’Amico and Thomas B. King, “Past and Future Effects of the Recent Monetary Policy Tightening,”\nChicago Fed Letter, Number 483, September 2023. (https://doi.org/10.21033/cfl-2023-483)\n7\n\n\f9\npost-2009 period.8 On the other hand, there is a large volume of outstanding corporate debt and\ncommercial real estate debt that will need to be repriced at higher interest rates over time. This suggests\nthat past changes in monetary policy may be felt for some time to come in the economy. Since the lags\nvary across cycles, the benchmark against which “shorter” or “longer” is evaluated is not well defined; so\na definitive conclusion about the length of the lag in this tightening cycle will remain elusive.\n\nA second policy consideration is the stance of monetary policy. While monetary policy is currently\nwidely viewed as restrictive, the resilience the economy has shown in the face of high interest rates has\nunderscored the difficulty of knowing precisely how restrictive policy is partly because of the uncertainty\nabout the level of the neutral real interest rate, so-called r-star. In economic models, the longer-term\nneutral real interest rate is determined by the long-run growth rate of consumption and, therefore, output,\nand is influenced by the trend rate of productivity growth, the growth rate of the labor force, and the\ndemand for safe assets, among other factors. Before the pandemic, estimates showed that the longer-run\nneutral rate in advanced economies had been declining for more than two decades, reflecting the aging of\nthe population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth.9 But in the aftermath of the\npandemic, estimates of the short-run neutral rate rose; whether the increase will persist is an open\nquestion. Projected longer-run fiscal imbalances are unlikely to be sustainable, and the government will\nneed to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced benefits, increased taxes, and\nprogram restructuring. In the meantime, higher projected U.S. fiscal deficits, requiring higher\ngovernment debt issuance, will put upward pressure on the neutral rate. If new technologies like\ngenerative AI produce significant productivity gains, this would also put upward pressure on the longer-\n\nSee Taeyoung Doh and Andrew T.

I think the jury is still out. I have not yet raised my\nestimate of the long-run equilibrium interest rate but will consider doing so depending on how the\neconomy evolves.\n\nIn light of the cyclical and structural uncertainties and the need to balance risks, policy decisions will\nneed to be guided by actual progress on our dual mandate goals, in particular, whether the rate of progress\nwe have seen on inflation in recent months is sustained and whether labor market conditions remain\nhealthy as they moderate. Because the outlook and balance of risks can change, policymakers will need\nto be nimble in order to appropriately calibrate policy in the midst of such changes. This will require us\nto carefully monitor economic, banking, and financial market developments.\n\nHigher long yields\nOne such recent development is the tightening in financial conditions since our September FOMC\nmeeting. Restrictive monetary policy is intended to tighten financial conditions, but the increase in the\nnominal 10-year Treasury yield since the last meeting was larger than expected and reflects several\nfactors. Like the Fed, market participants have revised up their expectations for growth this year. They\nhave also likely taken on board the communications from the FOMC that monetary policy is likely to\nremain restrictive for some time based on the outlook for inflation and employment. Both of those factors\nsuggest a higher expected path of short-term real interest rates and therefore higher longer-term yields.\nRising term premia, the compensation that investors require to hold longer-term debt, have also\ncontributed to the increase in Treasury yields. The New York Fed’s estimate of the term premium on 10year Treasuries, which had been in negative territory since mid-2021, turned positive toward the end of\n\n10\n\nCurrent estimates suggest that trend productivity growth remains relatively low, in the 1 to 1.5 percent range. See\nthe website https://sites.google.com/view/james-a-kahn-economics/home/trend-productivity-update, which provides\nthe latest estimates of trend productivity growth based on the model in James A. Kahn and Robert W. Rich,\n“Tracking the New Economy: Using Growth Theory to Detect Changes in Trend Productivity,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 54, September 2007, pp. 1670-1701. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2006.07.008)\n\n\f11\nSeptember.11 The recent focus on the U.S. fiscal situation, which will likely necessitate higher issuance\nof Treasury debt, likely contributed to the rise in the term premium. One factor that does not appear to\nhave contributed to the rise in yields since September is inflation expectations, which have remained\nrelatively stable. If sustained, the increase in longer-term yields will help to moderate demand, and as one\nof the financial conditions we monitor, it will be one of the factors I consider when evaluating the\nappropriate path of monetary policy going forward.\n\nPhases of Monetary Policy and Communications\nRegardless of the decision made at our next meeting, if the economy evolves as anticipated, in my view,\nwe are likely near or at a holding point on the funds rate as we accumulate more information on economic\nand financial developments and assess the effects of the tightening in financial conditions that has already\noccurred. I think it is useful to think of monetary policy during this tightening cycle in phases, although\nthe shifts from one phase to another depend on the evolution of the economy.\n\nPhase one: How fast to raise the policy rate\nDuring the first phase of this tightening cycle, the monetary policy narrative centered on how fast we\nshould raise the policy rate. We began with a 25-basis-point increase in March 2022, then moved the\nfunds rate up by 50 basis points at our next meeting, and then followed with 75-basis-point increases at\neach of our next four meetings. We then slowed rate increases, with a 50-basis-point increase at the\nDecember 2022 meeting and a 25-basis-point increase at the first meeting of this year. Over this phase,\nthe Committee communicated that it anticipated that ongoing increases in the funds rate target would be\nappropriate.\n\n11\n\nSee Treasury Term Premia, Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/data_indicators/term-premia-tabs#/overview)\n\n\f12\nPhase two: How high to raise the policy rate\nAt that point, the policy narrative entered a second phase, which centered on how high rates would have\nto go. The policy language changed to signal that the FOMC would be assessing the extent to which\nadditional policy firming may be appropriate. If the economy evolves as expected, I believe we are\nnearing the end of this phase.\n\nPhase three: How long will monetary policy need to remain restrictive\nThe narrative would then be entering a third phase focused on how long monetary policy will need to\nremain restrictive. Getting away from the meeting-to-meeting guessing game of will they or won’t they\nincrease the funds rate would seem to add some beneficial stability allowing firms and financial markets\nto absorb the increases in the pipeline. But communicating how the FOMC is thinking about the\neconomy and monetary policy in this policy phase will be a challenge because it requires some nuance.\nThe FOMC is committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal, and we would not be content with\ninflation settling in at a level above our goal. But as we travel the last mile of getting inflation back to 2\npercent, the balance of risks to our dual mandate goals will continue to shift and it is important that the\npublic understand that the commitment to price stability doesn’t mean ignoring the maximum\nemployment part of the mandate or deliberately taking actions to drive the economy into recession for the\nsake of achieving price stability as soon as possible. The balance of risks will change over time, and the\nFed will continue to calibrate its policy in pursuit of both goals.\n\nGiven the outlook, I anticipate it will be appropriate to keep the funds rate at its peak for some time.\nSome commentators have suggested that this will result in a passive tightening of policy as inflation\nmoves down. Essentially, they are measuring the real fed funds rate as the nominal funds rate minus\nactual inflation, which is backward looking. A better measure is the nominal rate minus expected\ninflation, which is forward looking. While I expect year-ahead inflation expectations to move down as\ninflation declines, this may take some time, and maintaining the nominal funds rate in order to achieve\nthat decline in inflation expectations is appropriate. Indeed, the projected decline in inflation is\n\n\f13\nconditioned on maintaining restrictive monetary policy. A failure to do so could jeopardize achieving that\ndecline.\n\nPhase four: Reducing the fed funds rate and moving monetary policy toward a more neutral stance\nEventually, policy will enter a fourth phase, in which it is appropriate to begin reducing the fed funds rate\nand moving monetary policy toward a more neutral stance. Given the lags with which monetary policy\naffects the economy, monetary policymakers will need to be forward looking and begin reducing the\nfunds rate when inflation is still somewhat above our goal. At that point, it will be important for the\nFOMC to communicate that the Fed is not abandoning its 2 percent target and is not content with inflation\nremaining persistently above target. Rather, the message will be that the Fed is more confident that\ninflation is on its way back down to 2 percent so less policy restraint is needed.\n\nLonger-term improvements in communications\nLonger term, I believe communications could be more effective if the FOMC’s post-meeting statement\nprovided more information on the Committee’s economic outlook, its view of the risks around the\noutlook, and its evaluation of progress on its goals. Doing so would give the public a better sense of the\nFOMC’s reaction function. This would be particularly helpful in uncertain times, like today, when it is\nimportant to maintain some policy optionality. Policy decisions should be guided in a systematic way by\nhow the economy is evolving relative to our outlook, as well as the shifting risks around the outlook. But\nbecause the economy could evolve differently than expected, we need to preserve some policy\noptionality. This “systematic optionality” is different from setting monetary policy in a discretionary\nmanner in which the policy reaction function is changing. A fuller post-meeting statement would help the\npublic understand this difference and give them a sense of how the FOMC is likely to react if some of the\nrisks are realized or new risks emerge.\n\nLastly, when uncertainty is high, as it has been during and since the pandemic, scenario analysis, as\nadvocated by SOMC members Mike Bordo, Andy Levin, and Mickey Levy, can be a helpful guide to\n\n\f14\nmonetary policymaking and communications.12 The FOMC does look at alternative scenarios and\nalternative interpretations of intermeeting economic developments as part of our meeting preparations,\nwhich can help us avoid “group-think” and be better prepared if the economy evolves differently than\nanticipated. But recasting our SEP submissions to incorporate participants’ views of potential salient\nscenarios rather than focusing only on the modal outlook could be quite helpful, especially in uncertain\ntimes. I essentially did this with my SEP submissions during the pandemic. In this period, forecasting\nhow the economy would evolve was particularly challenging given the uncertainties about the course of\nthe virus and how households and businesses might respond. Indeed, in March 2020, given the immense\nuncertainty to the outlook, the FOMC refrained from collecting and publishing the SEP. When the SEP\nresumed in June 2020, I began formulating my outlook conditional on different scenarios on the path of\nthe pandemic and our success at containing it. This approach gave a clearer picture of my view on the\neconomy as distinct from my views on the course of the disease. A similar type of scenario analysis for\ndifferent kinds of uncertainty would not be too difficult to incorporate into the SEP, and it could form a\nbasis for policy communications that preserve optionality without suggesting that policy is being set in a\ndiscretionary manner.\n\nTo conclude, word and deed are important monetary policy tools. And the Fed will be using both to\nachieve its dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. This concludes my prepared\nremarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\nMichael D. Bordo, Andrew T. Levin, and Mickey D.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe 50 Club\nCleveland, OH\nOctober 2, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Dan Walsh and the 50 Club for inviting me to speak this evening. The FOMC, which sets\nmonetary policy in the U.S., met less than two weeks ago. So this is an excellent time to give you an\nupdate on the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed is only a couple of blocks away from here. We are celebrating the 100th anniversary\nof our building this year, and we are very proud to be part of the architectural history of Cleveland. We\nare even prouder to be part of the civic landscape. I feel privileged to represent the Fourth Federal\nReserve District, which comprises the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West\nVirginia, at our policy meetings in Washington. Many of you also play an important role in the monetary\npolicymaking process because you generously provide us with insights into economic conditions, whether\nit be through our surveys, as members of our advisory councils, or as directors. The reconnaissance that\nyou provide on business activity, the labor market, and financial conditions is often more timely than the\nofficial data, so it helps us evaluate not only where the economy is but where it is going. This kind of\ninformation helps me formulate my economic outlook and my views on monetary policy to foster the\nFed’s statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. Thank you for this public service.\n\nThe Journey So Far\nBefore I turn to the outlook for the economy, it’s good to recap where we’ve been. Before the pandemic\nhit in early 2020, the U.S. economy had been on very solid ground. It was the 11th year of the expansion\nand the labor market was very strong. The unemployment rate was at historically low levels, jobs were\ngrowing at a strong pace, and participation in the labor force was solid. After being too low for some\ntime, inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nOf course, the pandemic changed all that.\n\n\f2\nThe economy shut down in March 2020, and fiscal and monetary policymakers took aggressive actions to\nsupport households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow and limiting lasting damage to\nthe economy. When public health statistics began to improve in May 2020, many parts of the country\nbegan to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, and the economy began to reopen.\n\nBut it was not business as usual. The mandated shutdowns and the voluntary pullback in demand for\nhigh-contact services led consumers to shift spending from services to goods early in the pandemic. As\nhealth conditions improved and the economy reopened, demand surged and was supported by fiscal\ntransfers and accommodative monetary policy. Spending has been shifting back from goods to services,\nalthough the spending levels in both of these sectors are not yet back to their pre-pandemic trends. The\npandemic also led many people to leave the workforce, making it much more difficult for firms to find the\nworkers they needed. Remote work became much more common. This led to changes in the demand for\nhousing, and sales of new and existing single-family homes surged in 2020 and 2021. In addition, supply\nchains were disrupted, making it much more difficult for firms to keep up with demand for their products.\nThe changes in spending patterns, workforce participation, housing demand, and supply chains led to a\nsituation in which demand in both product markets and labor markets became out of balance with supply.\nThose imbalances occurred in an environment of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, which led to\na significant increase in inflation starting in the spring of 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February\n2022 added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and other commodities. In\n2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9 percent, depending on the\nmeasure.\n\nEconomic Developments\nIn response to the sharp rise in inflation, the Fed began tightening the stance of monetary policy in March\nof last year. Since then, the FOMC has raised the target range of the federal funds rate, its policy rate, by\n5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to\nroll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022. This balance-sheet reduction\n\n\f3\nis also firming the stance of monetary policy. The tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader\ntightening in financial conditions. Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and credit spreads have risen. Banks\nhave been tightening their credit standards, making credit less available to businesses and households, but\nthe contraction in credit has not been sharper than what one might expect given the rise in interest rates.\n\nAs this tighter monetary policy has transmitted to the broader economy, demand has begun to moderate.\nAt the same time, supply chain disruptions have improved. Our business contacts report that bottlenecks\nhave eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have shortened. Businesses have also told us that\nthey have learned how to better navigate supply issues. So demand and supply are adjusting and coming\ninto better balance.\n\nReal output growth has slowed from its robust pace in 2021, but the economy appears to have more\nunderlying momentum than was apparent at the end of last year. Consumers have been particularly\nresilient. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of GDP; it has been increasing at a solid pace\nthis year, supported by strong income growth and savings accumulated during the pandemic. Businesses\nhave moderated their spending on equipment and software as demand has slowed, but our business\ncontacts are more optimistic than they were at the beginning of the year that the economy will avoid a\nrecession. In the housing market, there is a longer-term shortage of available housing; so despite the\nsharp increase in mortgage rates over the past two years, with the 30-year rate now nearing 8 percent,\nhousing starts and sales of existing homes have stabilized and sales of new single-family homes are\nbeginning to pick up again. This overall performance suggests there is more underlying momentum in the\neconomy than we thought even just three months ago. In fact, FOMC participants’ projections of\neconomic growth this year were revised up at our recent meeting.1 Now, instead of projecting that growth\nwill be well below trend this year, the median projection is that growth will be a bit over 2 percent, which\n\nFour times a year, the FOMC summarizes Committee participants’ projections of output growth, the\nunemployment rate, inflation, and the associated appropriate policy path. For the September 2023 Summary of\nEconomic Projections, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20230920.htm.\n1\n\n\f4\nis somewhat above trend. Growth is expected to slow to below trend next year as tighter credit and\nfinancial conditions and waning fiscal support for households weigh on spending.\n\nLabor market conditions remain strong but are moderating, bringing labor demand and supply into better\nbalance. The unemployment rate in Ohio is 3.4 percent, near its historical low. But our business contacts\nsay they are seeing some easing in the labor market, with increases in job applications and in the number\nof candidates coming in for interviews. Only a small number of firms told us that they plan to lay off\nworkers this year. But many firms said they are slowing their hiring and fewer businesses are hoarding\nworkers since it has become easier to hire. We are seeing the same thing in the national job market. The\nnational unemployment rate is low, at 3.8 percent, with August’s rise in the unemployment rate mainly\nreflecting an increase in labor force participation. Job growth has slowed over the course of the year, with\npayroll gains averaging 150 thousand per month over the past three months compared to about 300\nthousand per month over the first three months of the year. The number of job openings has also been\ndeclining, but the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is 1.5, which is still above the 1.2 level\nseen in the strong labor market conditions in 2019.\n\nWage pressures are easing by some measures. Firms in our District tell us they are not having to adjust\ncompensation as frequently as in the last few years except for those workers with specialized skills and in\nsectors with shortages, including nursing. Expected wage increases among our contacts have moved\ndown, but at 4 percent, they remain higher than wage gains seen before the pandemic. In the nation, wage\ngrowth is still well above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation given current estimates of trend\nproductivity growth. While increased labor force participation by prime-age workers is helping to ease\nthe imbalance between labor demand and supply, it seems likely that labor demand conditions will also\nneed to ease further to bring wage growth down to levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. In the\nSeptember FOMC projections, the median participant expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next\nyear, but only a little, to 4.1 percent, which is consistent with a moderating but still solid labor market.\n\n\f5\nInflation\nThe Fed’s inflation goal is 2 percent, measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. Inflation has been running well above the Fed’s goal for\nmore than two years. The good news is that the overall economy remains relatively strong, and at the\nsame time, we are making discernable progress on the journey back to price stability. Inflation levels,\nboth the headline numbers, which include food and energy prices, and measures of underlying inflation,\nincluding the core, median, and trimmed-mean measures, have moved down from their peaks. Measured\nyear-over-year, total PCE inflation peaked at 7 percent in June of last year. As of this August, it has\nfallen to about 3-1/2 percent, despite the recent rise in oil prices. Other measures that strip out the\ncomponents with the most extreme price movements each month and which tend to give a better\nindication of the inflation trend are also improving. The Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research\nproduces and tracks a number of inflation indicators.2 The Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation\nmeasure peaked at just over 6 percent in March and is now down to 4-1/2 percent. And core PCE\ninflation, which omits food and energy prices, peaked at over 5-1/2 percent last year and moved down to\nunder 4 percent in August. The progress is even easier to see when you look at the price changes over\nshorter time horizons, such as three-month or six-month annualized inflation rates, and when you look at\ninflation in the prices of goods excluding food and energy.\n\nDespite the progress, inflation remains too high. We will need to see continued progress on inflation in\ngoods prices. Since consumers spend a larger share of their income on services, services have a higher\nweight in the inflation indices.3 So we also need to see more progress on inflation in the prices of\nservices. Inflation in housing services, measured by rents and the imputed rents for owner-occupied\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses\nof inflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/center-for-inflation-research).\n2\n\n3\n\nAbout 65 percent of the total consumption basket is core services compared to about 23 percent for core goods.\nThe rest of the basket comprises energy (4 percent) and food at home (8 percent). Housing services, a component of\ncore services, constitute about 15 percent of consumers’ total spending.\n\n\f6\nhousing, remains elevated but has begun to slow, reflecting moderating rent inflation in new leases. But\ninflation in core services excluding housing has shown little improvement over time.\n\nMoreover, the risks to the inflation forecast remain tilted to the upside. We have been helped on the\ninflation journey by the fact that despite high inflation rates, medium- and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent\ninflation. But oil prices are now increasing. There is the potential that they will pass through to other\ncore prices and stall progress. In addition, because gasoline prices are particularly salient for households\nthat have to fill up their cars or trucks once or twice a week, rising gasoline prices could begin to make\nconsumers think inflation will be rising again. If so, higher inflation could become embedded in people’s\nview of the economy and affect their behavior in ways inconsistent with price stability.4 In fact, when we\nasked our regional business contacts their expectations for inflation, the mean response was nearly 4\npercent for the year ahead and 3.2 percent for the next five years, considerably higher than our target.\n\nWhile we have not yet completed the journey back to price stability, there should be no doubt that the\nFOMC will get the job done. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation in a sustainable and\ntimely way, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation and that will likely require further\nmoderation of demand in both product and labor markets. This brings me to monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAt its recent meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Fed’s securities holdings. In determining the extent of\nadditional policy firming that may be appropriate, the FOMC will be assessing incoming economic and\n\n4\n\nCleveland Fed researchers find that households form their expectations of inflation based on their lifetime\nexperience of inflation, which means that acting to bring down inflation in a timely way to limit experience with\nhigh inflation will yield longer-term benefits. See Mathieu O. Pedemonte, Hiroshi Toma, and Esteban Verdugo,\n“Aggregate Implications of Heterogeneous Inflation Expectations: The Role of Individual Experience,” Working\nPaper No. 23-04, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, January 2023. (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202304)\n\n\f7\nfinancial developments as well as the cumulative effects of the tightening done so far, since we know that\nmonetary policy affects the economy with a lag. The economic projections released by the FOMC in\nSeptember indicate that the median participant thinks another rate increase will be appropriate this year\nand that monetary policy will have to be held sufficiently restrictive for a while in order to get inflation\nback down to 2 percent.\n\nThis is consistent with my own reading of economic conditions, the outlook, and the risks to the outlook.\nAt this point, I suspect we may well need to raise the fed funds rate once more this year and then hold it\nthere for some time as we accumulate more information on economic developments and assess the effects\nof the tightening in financial conditions that has already occurred. But whether the fed funds rate needs to\ngo higher than its current level and for how long policy needs to remain restrictive will depend on how\nthe economy evolves relative to the outlook. There is considerable uncertainty around the outlook: for\nexample, the slowdown in the Chinese economy, the possibility of an extended UAW strike, and the\npotential for a government shutdown later this year all pose some risks around the outlook. So policy\ndecisions will need to be guided by actual progress on our dual mandate goals, in particular, whether the\ngood rate of progress we have seen on inflation over the past three months is sustained and whether labor\nmarket conditions remain healthy as they moderate. This will require us to carefully monitor economic,\nbanking, and financial market developments and to collect reports from our regional contacts, so that we\ncan set monetary policy in a way that balances the costs over time of over-tightening vs. under-tightening\nmonetary policy. Tightening too much would slow the economy more than necessary and entail higher\ncosts than needed to get inflation back to our goal. Tightening too little would allow high inflation to\npersist, with short- and long-run consequences, and would necessitate a much longer and more costly\njourney back to price stability.\n\nA Timely Return to Price Stability\nLet me conclude by explaining why I think it is important that we return the economy to price stability in\na timely way. I want to guard against becoming complacent with moderating inflation if the pace of that\n\n\f8\nmoderation implies it is going to take longer and longer to achieve the Fed’s 2 percent goal. Many\nforecasters have been underestimating the persistence of inflation since the beginning of this highinflation episode. FOMC participants have been pushing out the date of when inflation is expected to\nreturn to our goal. For example, the June 2021 median FOMC projection had core inflation moving down\nto 2.1 percent in 2022. A year later, the median projection had core inflation not reaching our goal until\nafter 2024, and now, according to the median projection in September, our 2 percent goal is not expected\nto be reached until 2026.\n\nWhen inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is moving up faster than\nwe would like and households and businesses have to pay those higher-than-desired prices. Since the first\nquarter of 2021, when inflation began to rise, inflation has been running at an annualized pace of nearly\n5-1/2 percent, while worker compensation (as measured by the employment cost index for private\nworkers’ compensation) has risen less, at an annualized rate of just over 4-1/2 percent. This means that\ndespite sizable increases in nominal wages, compensation adjusted for inflation hasn’t been keeping up\nwith the high rate of inflation over this episode. This is likely part of the reason Cleveland Fed surveys\nfind that people have a strong dislike of high inflation.5\n\nHigh inflation also imposes longer-run costs on the economy. It makes it harder to plan for the future,\nand it affects people’s decisions about getting an education or training for a new job and businesses’\ndecisions about whether to invest in new plants and equipment. These types of investments in human and\nphysical capital help determine our economy’s pace of innovation and productivity growth and therefore\nits potential growth rate and our longer-run standard of living. It is costly to our economy in both the\nshort and the long run to allow inflation to remain so high for so long.\n\n5\n\nSee Ina Hajdini, Edward S. Knotek II, John Leer, Mathieu Pedemonte, Robert W. Rich, and Raphael S. Schoenle,\n“Low Passthrough from Inflation Expectations to Income Growth Expectations: Why People Dislike Inflation,”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper No. 22-21R, March 2023 (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp202221r).\n\n\f9\nFinally, getting inflation back to 2 percent in a timely way puts the economy in a better position to\nweather the next shock, whenever it occurs. An economy that is at maximum employment and price\nstability is a stronger economy and one that is more resilient to shocks.\n\nSummary\nSo, in summary, the economy is on a good path. Demand is moderating and supply conditions are\nimproving. Labor market conditions remain strong, but the imbalance between labor demand and supply\nis narrowing and firms are finding it easier to find the workers they need. Progress is being made on\ninflation, but the level of inflation remains too high. We are likely near or possibly at the peak of the fed\nfunds tightening cycle. Now our task turns to ensuring that we keep monetary policy restrictive for long\nenough to be confident that inflation returns to our 2 percent goal in a timely way. We are not there yet,\nbut we will get there because price stability is critical for the long-run health of the labor market, the\noverall economy, and the stability of the financial system.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nClosing Remarks\nInflation: Drivers and Dynamics Conference 2023\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research and the European Central Bank\nFrankfurt am Main, Germany\nSeptember 1, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI appreciate the opportunity to present closing remarks at the Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics\nConference. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me start by thanking the organizers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the European\nCentral Bank for putting together such a strong program and the ECB for its hospitality. It has been a\nvery productive two days focused on frontier research on inflation. High inflation has been the major\nchallenge facing many central banks over the past two years. Returning the economy to price stability in\na sustainable and timely way has driven monetary policy decisions.\n\nThe U.S. Economy\nIn the U.S., since early last year, the Federal Reserve has been tightening the stance of monetary policy.\nWe have raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing\nthe size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan\nannounced in May 2022, which also helps to firm the stance of monetary policy. The tightening of\nmonetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions. Banks, which play an important\npart in monetary policy transmission, have been tightening their credit standards, making credit less\navailable to businesses and households. In addition, Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and credit spreads\nhave risen.\n\nThe monetary policy actions taken to date are helping to moderate demand in both product and labor\nmarkets and to alleviate some of the imbalances that have contributed to price pressures. Real output\ngrowth has slowed from its robust pace in 2021. Supply is also adjusting, with disruptions in supply\nchains having generally improved over time. In the labor market, some progress is being made in\nbringing demand and supply into better balance, but the job market is still strong. Job growth has slowed\nand job openings are down, but the unemployment rate is low, at 3.8 percent, and the vacancy-to-\n\n\f2\nunemployment ratio is still above its level during the strong labor market conditions in 2019. Labor\nsupply conditions are helping to rebalance the labor market; the labor market participation rate of\nworkers between the ages of 25 and 54 is above what it was before the pandemic.\n\nProgress continues to be made on inflation, with total PCE inflation down significantly from its\npeak. Underlying measures of inflation have also improved but less so. Despite high inflation rates,\nmedium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent\nwith the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. Although there has been some progress, inflation\nremains too high. The FOMC is committed to moving inflation down to 2 percent. The monetary policy\nquestions are whether the current level of the federal funds rate is sufficiently restrictive and how long\npolicy will need to remain restrictive to keep inflation moving down in a sustainable and timely way to\nour goal of 2 percent. Future policy decisions will be about managing the risks and the intertemporal\ncosts of over-tightening vs. under-tightening monetary policy. This assessment will require close\nmonitoring of economic, banking, and financial market developments and using all of that economic\nreconnaissance to determine whether the economy is evolving in line with the outlook or not. The\noutlook will need to be informed not only by the incoming data but also by our models of and\nunderstanding of inflation dynamics, which has been the topic of this conference.\n\nInflation Research\nThe period of high inflation has highlighted that there are many things we do understand about inflation.\nIn particular, when demand is outpacing supply, in an environment of very accommodative fiscal and\nmonetary policy – the conditions that characterized the economy in 2021 after the pandemic-induced\nshutdown – inflation will begin to rise and it will remain persistent until monetary policy is recalibrated to\nmoderate demand. Nonetheless, making such assessments in real time is difficult, especially when supply\nconditions are not stable, and forecasting inflation remains challenging. Indeed, FOMC participants\nunderestimated inflation for much of the high-inflation period. But policymakers are required to make\ndecisions based on the available, albeit limited information.\n\n\f3\n\nFurther research is needed on many facets of inflation and inflation dynamics. Since I am in a room full\nof researchers, I want to highlight some of the questions whose answers would help inform monetary\npolicy decisions. I took the same route when I presented keynote remarks at this conference in 2014, and\nit turns out that several of the questions I asked are still relevant.1 Don’t be too discouraged: Progress has\nbeen made in addressing them. But the period of high inflation and structural changes to the economy\nduring the pandemic and its aftermath have presented new questions and different takes on old questions.\nFurther research will be needed to answer these questions, furthering our understanding of inflation as an\naid to monetary policymaking.\n\nResearch Questions\nThe first question I asked in 2014 remains relevant: How can we best estimate the underlying trend in\ninflation?\n\nMonetary policymakers are charged with keeping inflation at its longer-run goal and monetary policy\naffects the economy with long and variable lags. Both factors mean that policymakers need to be able to\nforecast inflation over the medium and longer run. So they need a method to separate temporary changes\nfrom changes that are more persistent. When the economy reopened after the pandemic-induced\nshutdown, U.S. monetary policymakers attributed much of the increase in inflation to supply shocks that\nwere expected to be transitory, with inflation expected to return to its low pre-pandemic trend. It took\nsome time and repeated under-forecasts of inflation for policymakers to realize that the conditions for\nhigh inflation were in place and that aggressive policy action was required. Better understanding of the\nfactors that affect the medium-run inflation trend and ways to separate temporary changes from changes\nthat are more persistent would have helped to avoid the situation.\n\n1\n\nSee Mester (2014).\n\n\f4\nSeparating temporary from more persistent factors is challenging to do in real time, not only because\nsome of the inflation data get revised (including the PCE inflation measure that the Fed targets), but also\nbecause measured inflation reflects a combination of factors: idiosyncratic factors, broader but temporary\nmacroeconomic factors, and more persistent movements that affect the underlying inflation trend. One\napproach to estimating the underlying trend is to remove items that are often the sources of temporary\nmovements in inflation. The traditional core measures of inflation in the U.S. exclude the prices of food\nand energy because they are thought to be very volatile. Another approach recognizes that other\ncomponents can show more volatility than food and energy and derives measures that exclude\ncomponents with the most extreme movements each month. The median and trimmed-mean inflation\nrates are of this type.2 Some papers have shown that these types of measures can help to identify the\nunderlying trend and may outperform measures of core inflation in forecasting total (aka headline)\ninflation.3\n\nThere are also statistical models that try to isolate the trend from the noise and identify the cyclical and\nacyclical components of core inflation, where the cyclical components are, by definition, those associated\nwith labor market tightness.4\n\nThe literature has not discerned a best way to isolate the inflation trend; so, in practice, to forecast\ninflation, policymakers tend to look at all the measures of inflation, data on the real side of the economy,\nanecdotal reports from community and business contacts, and various models. Many of the forecasting\nmodels being used are informed by theoretical models of inflation dynamics.\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/center-for-inflation-research).\n3\n\nSee Bryan and Pike (1991), Bryan and Cecchetti (1993), and Bryan, Cecchetti, and Wiggins (1997) for CPI, and\nMeyer, Venkatu, and Zaman (2013), Meyer and Zaman (2019), and Smith (2004) for PCE. An exception is Crone,\net al. (2013), who find that headline PCE inflation can beat the core measure in predicting future PCE inflation.\n4\n\nSee Stock and Watson (2020) and Zaman (2019).\n\n\f5\n\nWhich brings me to my second question: Can we reconcile the actual pricing behavior of firms with\npredictions from the New Keynesian model, the workhorse inflation model used by many central bank\neconomists?\n\nIn recent years, a considerable amount of research has examined the real-world pricing behavior of firms\nand incorporated these facts into macroeconomic models.5 In fact, several papers presented at the\nconference explicitly incorporate micro data into macro models.6 I view this as a continuation of the\ndesirable approach of ensuring that our macro models are based on sound micro foundations.\n\nThe availability of data on individual prices has made advances possible. New surveys are also being\nused to better understand firms’ pricing behavior. For example, a survey conducted by researchers from\nthe Cleveland, Atlanta, and New York Feds found that firms’ prices are strongly influenced by their\nperceptions about demand for their products, a desire to maintain steady profit margins, and their labor\ncosts.7 The paper based on the survey, and included in the conference’s poster session, estimates that\ncost-price passthrough at firms was about 60 percent on average, but that there was considerable\nheterogeneity across the firms. Interestingly, although firms do tend to raise their prices when wages rise,\nother research from the Cleveland Fed indicates that consumers do not expect their wage growth to keep\nup with inflation. The researchers find that a 1 percentage point increase in inflation expectations causes\nexpectations of income growth to rise by only two-tenths of a percentage point; in other words,\nrespondents expect rising inflation to hurt their real income. This might help to explain why people\ndislike high inflation even when the labor market is strong.8\n\n5\n\nKlenow and Malin (2010) review the literature.\n\n6\n\nThese papers include Adam, Alexandrov, and Weber (2023), Gagliardone et al. (2023), Lan, Li, and Li (2023), and\nSara-Zaror (2021).\n7\n\nSee Dogra, et al. (2023).\n\n8\n\nSee Hajdini, et al. (2023).\n\n\f6\nResearch such as this can help to close the gap between the macro models we use to inform our monetary\npolicy decisions and the microeconomic data. In addition, research on actual pricing behavior can also\ninform the framework for setting monetary policy. For example, at first blush it might seem that having a\nhigher inflation target, all else equal, gives monetary policymakers more room to move the nominal\ninterest rate down before hitting the effective lower bound; they could then provide more stimulus to the\neconomy, if needed. But Cleveland Fed research suggests that all else would not be equal.9 In particular,\na higher inflation target would not provide as much policy room as one might expect; raising the inflation\ntarget would be subject to the Lucas critique. With higher steady-state inflation, firms would change their\nprice-setting behavior and adjust their prices more frequently. Because monetary policy’s ability to affect\nreal activity depends on the degree of price stickiness, a higher inflation target would make monetary\npolicy less effective because firms would be changing their prices more frequently. The research’s\nquantitative result suggests that to increase policy space by 2 percentage points, instead of increasing the\ninflation target from 2 percent to 4 percent, one would need to increase the target to 5 percent. If you add\nto this the costs of having to change posted prices more often, the higher level of relative price distortions\nbecause everything is not indexed, higher shoe-leather costs from searching for the lowest prices, and the\nhigher inflation volatility associated with higher inflation, the benefits of setting a higher inflation target\nare not compelling.\n\nThe Fed’s inflation target is 2 percent, and we are committed to returning inflation to 2 percent in a\nsustainable and timely way. This explicit target was first established in the FOMC’s statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy in January 2012, and it has been reaffirmed every year since then.\nThe 2 percent target was taken as given when the FOMC undertook its review of the monetary policy\nframework in 2019. The revised statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which\nreflects the outcome of the review, recognizes the importance of keeping inflation expectations well-\n\n9\n\nSee L’Huillier and Schoenle (2023).\n\n\f7\nanchored at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.10 And by “well-anchored” I mean longer-term\ninflation expectations that are insensitive to data.\n\nOne of the big lessons from the 1970s is that it is much more difficult and costly to bring inflation down\nonce it has become embedded in the economy, that is, once businesses and households expect inflation to\nremain elevated and those expectations influence their savings and investment decisions and price-setting\nand wage-setting behavior. Indeed, inflation expectations have been a central factor in models of\ninflationary dynamics since the 1960s and 1970s.11 The theory indicates that well-anchored longer-term\ninflation expectations can help to mitigate the pull of resource gaps on inflation, and therefore, the\ncyclical movements in interest rates that policymakers induce to maintain price stability need not be as\nlarge as when inflation expectations are not well-anchored.\n\nPutting the theory into practice brings me to my third question: For the purposes of setting monetary\npolicy, how should inflation expectations be measured and over what time horizon?\n\nOne difficulty in moving from theory to practice is that while the models talk about “inflation\nexpectations,” these expectations are not directly observable. So policymakers look at a number of\nmeasures that differ by type of agent and time horizon. These include measures based on surveys of\nconsumers, businesses, and professional forecasters; measures derived from financial markets; and\ncomposite indices that combine various measures. A clear signal is not always forthcoming because the\ninflation expectations of different groups of agents can behave differently from one another. Even within\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, revised in 2020 and reaffirmed since\nthen, says that the Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well-anchored at 2 percent\ncontribute to achieving its monetary policy goals. See Federal Open Market Committee (2023).\n10\n\n11\n\nSee Phelps (1967), Friedman (1968), and Lucas (1972). For further discussion see Mester (2022a,b).\n\n\f8\ngroups there can be variation, and the literature has not firmly established whose expectations are most\nimportant for inflation dynamics.12\n\nHouseholds may find it challenging to answer questions about the economic concept of inflation. Recent\nCleveland Fed research found that when consumers are asked about what they think inflation will be in\nthe future for the various categories of consumer spending, their answers do not aggregate up using any\nplausible weighting scheme to what they expect overall inflation will be.13 Aggregated inflation\nexpectations over categories tend to be lower than expectations of overall inflation, and the bottom-up\naggregated expectations explain a greater share of planned consumer spending. This inconsistency\nreinforces the approach taken by policymakers to look at various measures of inflation expectations.\n\nIndeed, several new measures are increasing our understanding of inflation expectations. Researchers at\nthe Cleveland Fed have developed a measure of inflation expectations that does not require the\nrespondents to understand the economic concept of aggregate inflation. The Cleveland Fed’s indirect\nconsumer inflation expectations (ICIE) measure, which started in 2021, is based on a nationwide survey\nwith more than 10,000 responses and is updated on a weekly basis. Instead of asking consumers directly\nabout overall inflation, the survey asks consumers how they expect the prices of the things they buy to\nchange over the next 12 months and how much their incomes would have to change for them to be able to\nafford the same consumption basket and be equally well-off.14 According to this measure, women’s\ninflation expectations have tended to run higher than those of men, and older respondents and more\neducated respondents also have reported higher inflation expectations than their counterparts.\n\n12\n\nCandia, Coibion, and Gorodnichenko (2021) find that the mean inflation forecasts of firms often deviate\nsignificantly from those of professional forecasters and households.\n13\n14\n\nSee Dietrich, et al. (2022).\n\nThe ICIE series is available on the Central Bank Research Association (CEBRA) website at\nhttps://cebra.org/indirect-consumer-inflation-expectations/. For background on the survey and results using the\nsurvey, see Hajdini, et al. (2022a,b).\n\n\f9\nLess information has been available on firms’ inflation expectations, even though firms are the price\nsetters. But new data series are being developed. For example, the Cleveland Fed has begun publishing\nthe Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE), a nationally representative, quarterly survey of\nCEOs and other top business executives, which was started by academics in 2018.15 The survey data\nindicate that the year-ahead inflation expectations of these business executives rose as inflation increased\nin 2021 and 2022. Their expectations began to decline in 2023 but remain elevated at 4.3 percent as of\nJuly. Perhaps more troubling is that when respondents were asked in April what they thought the Fed’s\ninflation target was, the mean response was 3.1 percent. This is higher than our target of 2 percent and\nalso nearly a percentage point above the mean response before the pandemic.\n\nMonetary policymakers typically focus on medium- to longer-term inflation expectations because this is\nthe time horizon over which monetary policy can be expected to affect the economy and is more\nreflective of consumers’ perceptions of the Fed’s commitment and ability to return the economy to price\nstability. Ample research shows that changes in the prices of particular salient items, including gasoline\nand food, which are independent of monetary policy, can have an outsized effect on households’ shorterrun inflation expectations.16 However, recent research by Cleveland Fed economists indicates that\npolicymakers should not ignore persistently elevated levels of shorter-term inflation expectations and\nfocus only on longer-term expectations. The researchers find persistent differences in inflation\nexpectations across consumers of different ages and that households form their expectations of inflation\nbased on their lifetime experience of inflation.17 When this mechanism is incorporated into a\nconventional New Keynesian model, inflation shocks are more persistent than otherwise, and the optimal\nresponse is for monetary policy to tighten when short-run inflation expectations rise even if longer-run\n\nThe Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE) was created by Professors Olivier Coibion and Yuriy\nGorodnichenko; it is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/survey-of-firms-inflation-expectations. For background on the\nsurvey, see Garciga et al. (2023).\n15\n\n16\n\nFor the effect of salient prices on inflation expectations, see Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), Cavallo, Cruces,\nand Perez-Truglia (2017), D’Acunto, et al. (2021), and Campos, McMain, and Pedemonte (2022).\n17\n\nSee Pedemonte, Toma, and Verdugo (2023).\n\n\f10\nexpectations are stable. Doing so helps to limit the experience households have with high inflation, which\nhelps to keep inflation expectations anchored in the future.\n\nBetter understanding of how households and firms form their inflation expectations will help inform how\nmonetary policymakers should respond when inflation deviates from the target. This brings me to my\nfourth and final question: How should monetary policymakers respond to supply shocks?\n\nThe current episode of high inflation has been a challenging one. In the U.S., inflation began rising in the\nspring of 2021. A sequence of supply shocks, driven first by the pandemic and then the war in Ukraine\ncontributed to the high inflation. These supply shocks were concentrated in the goods sector, which was\nalready seeing a surge in demand as consumers shifted spending from services to goods during the\npandemic-induced shutdown and when they continued to take social distancing measures once the\neconomy reopened. The supply shocks exacerbated the imbalances between demand and supply, which,\nin an environment of very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, led to a significant and persistent\nincrease in inflation.\n\nThe episode has called into question the conventional view that monetary policy should always look\nthrough supply shocks. The thinking is that supply shocks tend to be transitory, and while they raise the\nprice level for a time, they do not lead to a persistent increase in inflation or inflation expectations.\nMoreover, since monetary policy acts with a lag, if policymakers were to react to a transitory supply\nshock, it would be counterproductive, affecting the economy after the supply shock had dissipated. But to\nthe extent that supply shocks are more persistent or there is a sequence of supply shocks, this thinking\nneed not apply because such shocks can threaten the stability of inflation expectations and this would\nrequire policy action. Indeed, when inflation expectations are not firmly anchored, if monetary policy\n\n\f11\nfails to react in an appropriate way, what starts out as a potentially temporary shock could lead to more\npersistent effects on inflation.18\n\nThis brings up the possibility that monetary policy may want to react differently depending on the nature\nof the shock that has led to a rise in inflation, with the reaction dependent on the size and persistence of\nthe shock, because different shocks have different implications for inflation expectations. An interesting\npaper presented at the conference suggests that in an environment where prices are more flexible than\nwages and agents have bounded rationality rather than fully rational expectations with respect to inflation,\npolicy may want to respond more aggressively to supply shocks when inflation is already high and less\naggressively when inflation is low.19 This can lead policymakers to first look through supply shocks and\nthen respond more aggressively as inflation moves up, which arguably characterizes the current highinflation episode. However, other interesting research shows that optimal monetary policy responses\ndepend critically on how inflation expectations are formed and how well they are anchored. In one\nmodel, when expectations differ from rational expectations and are not well-anchored, policymakers are\nbetter off responding earlier to signs that inflation is rising rather than delaying and only then responding\naggressively.20 The implication is that when there is uncertainty, policymakers should overestimate the\ndegree of persistence of inflation shocks rather than underestimate it.\n\nMore research on the timing and magnitude of the optimal monetary policy response in the face of\ndifferent types of shocks and when inflation expectations deviate from rational expectations would be\nhelpful to policymakers.\n\n18\n\nReis (2021) and Walsh (2022) discuss the importance of anchored inflation expectations, drawing on the\nexperience of the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s.\n19\n\nSee Beaudry, Carter, and Lahiri (2022).\n\n20\n\nSee Walsh (2022)\n\n\f12\nConclusion\nTo conclude, let me again thank the organizers at the European Central Bank and at the Cleveland Fed for\nputting together such a strong conference program. When we started the Cleveland Fed’s Center for\nInflation Research in December 2018, some people raised an eyebrow. They questioned the center’s\nfocus because inflation had been so benign for quite some time. It turned out to be precisely the right\ntime to further the research agenda on inflation. Maintaining price stability is the responsibility of the\ncentral bank and only the central bank can deliver on this goal over time. While considerable progress\nhas been made on developing inflation models and measures that can better inform monetary\npolicymaking, we still have much to learn about inflation dynamics. I encourage the researchers\nparticipating in this conference to continue furthering their research agendas because good policymaking\ndepends on the research that informs it.\n\n\f13\nReferences\nAdam, Klaus, Andrey Alexandrov, and Henning Weber, “Inflation Distorts Relative Prices: Theory and\nEvidence,” CEPR Discussion Paper DP18088, April 18, 2023.\n(https://cepr.org/publications/dp18088)\nBeaudry, Paul, Thomas J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nSummer Institute 2023\nMacro, Money, and Financial Frictions\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\nCambridge, MA\nJuly 12, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to update you on the FedNow® Service, the Federal Reserve’s new\ninstant payments service. When the FedNow Service begins to roll out later this month, it will be the first\nnew Fed payments rail in 50 years. Before I continue, I note that the views I present will be my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\nFigure 1. The Fed’s Role in Payments\nThe payment system is a crucial part of the infrastructure of the U.S., and a well-functioning and secure\npayment system is vital for a sound economy. The Federal Reserve System has responsibility for\nfostering a safe, efficient, and widely accessible payments infrastructure, and the Reserve Banks have\nprovided payments and settlement services alongside the private sector for more than 100 years. The Fed\nhas this responsibility because as the country’s central bank, it can uniquely provide interbank settlement\nwithout introducing liquidity or credit risks. Settlement refers to the debiting and crediting of accounts to\ntransfer funds for a payment. Settlement is the foundation for most payment systems, allowing the\nsender’s depository institution to settle a payment by moving funds to the receiver’s depository\ninstitution. The Fed’s payment services include check processing, automated clearinghouse (ACH)\nservices, and wire transfers. In addition to settlement, these services include clearing, which refers to the\nexchange of information about a payment.\n\nThe Fed offers its payment services on behalf of the public in competition with and in support of similar\nservices provided by the private sector. Unlike central banks in other countries, the Fed has not been\ngiven complete regulatory or supervisory authority over the U.S. payment system. But by offering\npayment services, the Fed has been able to promote accessibility, safety, efficiency, and innovation in the\npayment system.\n\n\f2\nFigure 2. Demand for faster digital payments: Value of noncash payments\nOne of those innovations has been technology, which has been driving the increased use of electronic\npayments. Because the current payment system works well, most people have spent little time thinking\nabout the backbone that makes these payments possible and ensures that the payment system is reliable\nand secure. But with new technologies and new service providers, more people are seeking new ways to\nexecute transactions and they want to execute them much faster.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Federal Reserve Payments Study, the value of noncash payments has accelerated\nsignificantly over time. These payments grew at an annualized rate of 9.5 percent between 2018 and\n2021, reaching a value of $128.5 trillion in 2021.1 In 2021 about 205 billion noncash transactions were\nmade in the U.S., over 600 payments for every American.2 According to a Fed survey, in 2022 nearly 75\npercent of consumers used mobile payment devices to send or receive payments, and usage spanned\nconsumers of all ages.3 This is a considerable increase from 2013, when only 10 percent of consumers\nhad made a mobile payment. Over half of the consumers surveyed in 2022 are using nonbank mobile\napps to make faster payments, and 38 percent are using digital wallets.4\n\nFigure 3. Demand for faster digital payments: Share of retail sales made electronically\nThe share of retail sales made electronically jumped during the pandemic, but this share began increasing\nmuch earlier. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales accounted for about 6 percent of\ntotal U.S. retail sales in 2013. That share has now risen to 15 percent.5 Consumers have become more\n\n1\n\nNoncash payments include debit and credit card transactions, checks, and direct deposit and automatic payment\ntransactions that go through the automated clearinghouse system. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2023a).\n2\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023a).\n\n3\n\nSee FedPayments Improvement (2023).\n\n4\n\nIn the survey, faster payments include instant payment services, same-day ACH, push to card, and digital wallet\napps. See FedPayments Improvement (2023).\nSee U.S. Census Bureau (2023). In this report, e-commerce sales are defined as “sales of goods and services where\nthe buyer places an order, or the price and terms of the sale are negotiated over an Internet, mobile device (M5\n\n\f3\ncomfortable making online payments, but they also want up-to-the minute information on their payments\nand accounts, including information on when their payments have cleared and what their account balance\nis in real time. Businesses are also demanding quicker access to their funds and the ability to automate\ntheir accounting processes.\n\nThis demand is being met by private-sector services and providers, including banks and fintech\ncompanies, that are offering consumers and businesses more modern and convenient methods for making\npayments. But while it appears that the payments are moving in real time, in most cases, the actual\nclearing and settlement of payment instructions on both sides of these transactions take place through the\ntraditional system: transactions are settled in periodic batches, processed one or more days later, and\navailable only during regular banking hours. Of course, this creates some risk because banks might\nchoose to make final funds available to the customer before receiving the covering funds from the payer’s\nbank.\n\nFigure 4. The FedNow® Service\nAfter several years of planning and consulting with the payment industry and other stakeholders, in 2019,\nthe Fed announced it was developing the FedNow® Service.6 FedNow will provide the infrastructure for\ninstant payments, linking banks and credit unions of all sizes. FedNow will not be offered directly to\nindividuals and businesses, but it will allow the customers of financial institutions offering the service to\nsend and receive payments within seconds around the clock on every day of the year and to get full access\nto those funds immediately, with instant finality of payment. The service is being designed as a flexible\nand neutral cloud-based platform, which is unique among central bank instant payment services, and that\n\ncommerce), extranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) network, electronic mail, or other comparable online\nsystem. Payment may or may not be made online.”\n6\n\nMester (2022) discusses the path that led to the decision to move forward with FedNow. The FedNow website and\nthe FedNow blog contain additional information on the new service.\n\n\f4\ndesign will make it easier to reach scalability and geographic resiliency. Cloud-based does not mean it is\ndesigned using distributed ledger technology. Instead, the FedNow Service settles payments in Federal\nReserve Bank master accounts, so it relies on a centralized ledger.\n\nThe FedNow Service is expected to yield several economic benefits for individuals and businesses and\nthese benefits were taken into account when deciding to move ahead with the service. FedNow will\nprovide the public with more flexibility to manage their money and to make time-sensitive payments\nwhenever needed. This may be especially beneficial for households and businesses that are less liquid,\nhelping them avoid late fees when making payments. It could help individuals who aren’t on a regular\npayroll, such as gig workers, get faster access to their wages. It could help the federal government\ndisburse support payments faster during emergencies. It is expected to provide the public benefit of\nincreased resiliency by offering an alternative payments rail. FedNow is also expected to increase access\nto instant payments for more people because the country’s more than 10,000 banks and credit unions of\nall sizes will be able to use their existing electronic connections to the Fed and their existing Fed\nsettlement accounts to process real-time retail payments for consumers and businesses. Because the\nplatform is flexible and neutral, the FedNow instant payments rail is also expected to spur additional\ninnovations from banks, payment processors, and other providers of payment services to meet the specific\nneeds of their customers.\n\nFedNow will operate alongside the private sector’s instant payments service, The Clearing House’s RealTime Payments (RTP®) service. This competition is expected to help promote efficiency in instant\npayments. Consistent with its public-service mission, in addition to FedNow, the Fed is providing direct\nsupport for the development of private-sector faster payments. For example, in 2017, the Board of\nGovernors approved final guidelines for evaluating requests for joint accounts at the Reserve Banks.7\n\n7\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017).\n\n\f5\nThese joint accounts facilitate the settlement of payments between and among the banks that participate in\nthe private sector’s instant payments service. The Fed has also worked to expand the operating hours of\nits current ACH and funds systems.\n\nFigure 5. Features included in the FedNow Service at rollout\nThe FedNow Service is being tested and certified with a diverse group of first adopters that were part of\nthe pre-launch pilot program; the group includes financial institutions, processors, service providers, and\nthe U.S. Treasury.8\n\nAt rollout, the FedNow Service will include features that focus on clearing and settlement.9 At its most\nbasic level, the FedNow platform provides interbank settlement that enables funds to be transferred from\na payment sender’s bank account to a receiver’s bank account immediately and at any time. No\nprefunding is required. The limit per customer credit transaction will be $500,000, but the initial setting\nof the transaction limit will be $100,000. A participating institution will be able to adjust that default\nlimit down or up, to a maximum of $500,000, depending on its preferences. Participants will be able to\ndecide whether they want to both receive and send payments or whether they want to only receive\npayments. And they will be able to specify a list of suspicious accounts to and from which they neither\nwant to send or receive payments.\n\nAlso included at the rollout will be request-for-payment functionality that will support bill payment; the\nability to include information about a payment along with the payment, e.g., invoice information; and\ncertain fraud-mitigation tools.\n\n8\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023b).\n\n9\n\nSee Federal Reserve Financial Services, “FedNow Service,” Product Sheet.\n\n\f6\nWhen the FedNow Service rolls out, the Fed will also offer liquidity management transfers that will allow\nfinancial institutions to move funds between their Federal Reserve accounts during hours when the\ntraditional payment and settlement services and the discount window are not open.10 These transfers will\nsupport both FedNow and private-sector real-time settlement.\n\nThe Fed intends to build in more features as the FedNow Service develops and matures.\n\nFigure 6. Steps in a FedNow transaction\nFinancial institutions will be able to connect to the service either directly, via their core processors, or\nthrough a technology service provider. Let me walk you through a simple FedNow transaction in which\nboth sending and receiving banks are directly connected to the service.\n\nFirst, an individual or business uses an end-user interface to initiate a payment with their financial\ninstitution. The sender’s bank validates the payment according to its own internal processes and\nrequirements.\n\nSecond, the sender’s bank submits the payment message to the FedNow Service.\n\nThird, the FedNow Service validates the payment message, checking to see that it meets the proper format\nspecifications and complies with applicable controls.\n\n10\n\nLiquidity management transfers will be available from 7 pm to 7 am Eastern time on weekdays, and 24 hours per\nday on weekends and holidays. The transaction value limit will be $2.5 million, although financial institutions can\nset their send limit at a lower level if they prefer. A financial institution’s cumulative daily send limit will be $10\nmillion. For more information on liquidity management and account balance reporting, see Federal Reserve\nFinancial Services (2021) and Federal Reserve Financial Services.\n\n\f7\nFourth, the FedNow Service sends the payment information to the receiver’s financial institution and asks\nthat bank to confirm that it intends to accept the payment message. It can accept, or reject, or accept\nwithout posting, which means some of the pre-checks of the transaction are pending or delayed. In this\nstep, the receiver bank will want to verify that it maintains an account for the recipient identified in the\ncontents of the payment message.\n\nFifth, if the payment is accepted, the receiving bank sends notification to the FedNow Service confirming\nthat it intends to accept the payment message.11\n\nSixth, the FedNow Service settles the payment, debiting and crediting the designated master accounts of\nthe sender and receiver banks, respectively.\n\nAll of this is expected to be completed within a few seconds. (The Fed has set an upper limit of 20\nseconds to give banks clarity on the maximum time allowed for a payment to either settle or be rejected.)\n\nFinally, to complete the process, the FedNow Service sends an advice to the receiver bank and an\nacknowledgement to the sender bank, executing the payment order and notifying each that the Federal\nReserve Banks have settled the payment. The receiving financial institution makes funds immediately\navailable to the recipient.\n\nFigure 7. Next steps on the agenda\nThe rollout of the FedNow Service is only the beginning of the journey. Enhancements will be made to\nthe FedNow Service over time to support safety, resiliency, and innovation. There are several items on\n\n11\n\nSteps 4 and 5 are intended to reduce the number of misdirected payments and resulting exception cases that can\noccur in high-volume systems.\n\n\f8\nthe agenda after the official rollout. Some of these are near- to medium-term efforts and others longerterm considerations. So let me conclude with a few of these.\n\nGrowing the number of financial institutions using the FedNow Service\nSince the value of a payment service ultimately depends on the number of users, the Fed will be focused\non growing the number of institutions that use the FedNow Service for sending and receiving payments.\nThe U.S. does not have a mandate that financial institutions offer the service, unlike other countries,\nincluding Brazil, which mandated that banks offer its Pix instant payments service. In addition, we have a\ncomplex financial industry, with a variety of different types and sizes of institutions. For many financial\ninstitutions, getting ready to use FedNow will take some investment. Some organizations will need to\nupgrade older payment infrastructures, accounting procedures, and other back-office processes to\naccommodate the expanded 24×7 operating hours. But these investments will allow them to offer this\nnew instant payment service to customers, who are increasingly demanding faster payments.\n\nEducating the public and financial institutions: Fraud mitigation and depositor runs\nGrowing the network will also require increasing public awareness so that it understands not only the\nbenefits of instant payments but also the implications of fast finality of payments. Financial institutions\nthat participate in FedNow, as in other payment services, serve as a primary line of defense in protecting\ntheir customers against fraud. The initial release of the FedNow Service will include features to help\nbanks manage fraud risk and mitigate fraud losses. It will include tools that allow participants to reject\npayments to and from accounts they have designated as suspicious and to put limits on the amount of the\ntransaction. In addition, there will be tools that help a financial institution investigate erroneous or\nsuspected fraudulent transactions. Combating fraud is a dynamic endeavor, so the service will be offering\nmore fraud-prevention tools over time.\n\n\f9\nEducating financial institutions about the value of the service and all tools offered within the service is\nalso on the agenda. For example, in the aftermath of the bank closures earlier this year, some have raised\nconcerns that the ability to move money quickly at all times of the day and night might exacerbate a bank\nrun. It is true that FedNow and other payment services can be used to move money; however, banks have\ntools they could use to mitigate large outflows of deposits. For example, within FedNow they could\nlower their transaction limit, restrict access to the service to certain non-wholesale customers, or change\nto “receive payments only” status. They could also design their own controls to limit the total volume of\ntransfers to manage their risks while serving their customers. Future releases of the FedNow Service may\nallow configurable transaction limits by customer type, if such limits are deemed useful. In addition to a\nbank being able to borrow from the Fed during the hours the discount window is open, a bank could use\nliquidity management transfers to replenish its master account balance from private funding sources on\nthe weekend when the discount window is not accessible, which would help to mitigate the effects of\ndeposit outflows on the health of the bank.\n\nInteroperability\nAnother issue on the agenda is interoperability. The Fed is committed to working toward interoperability\nbetween instant payment systems. FedNow is designed on the ISO 20022 standard, which is already used\nby RTP and other payment systems globally, and that will help support interoperability through routing.\nPayment industry stakeholders have told us they want a real-time payment capability so that any payer\ncan reach any payee, regardless of which faster payment system their banks use. Such interoperability\nhas not always been a given in the U.S.; it took decades to achieve that for ACH and credit and debit\ncards and no doubt it will be a challenge for instant payments. But the Fed continues to engage with RTP\nto discuss how best to accomplish this goal.\n\n\f10\nPerson-to-person and cross-border payments\nFinancial institutions would like to be able to use FedNow to offer person-to-person (P2P) payment\nservices whereby customers can originate a payment using an alias such as an email address or phone\nnumber. The initial release of FedNow will not include a directory service that would be needed for P2P\npayments. Instead, a bank could use a private-sector directory to access routing information in order to\ntransmit alias-based payments on FedNow. The Fed is looking at various approaches to provide aliasbased payments as a way to enhance the FedNow Service in the future.\n\nAnother use case is cross-border payments. There continue to be frictions in moving retail payments\nacross borders. FedNow is for domestic payments, but it has the potential to be used for cross-border\npayments in the future if legal, policy, and operational challenges can be solved.\n\nPayment rails\nA longer-run issue has to do with the payment rails themselves. It seems likely that over time those\npayments that are time-sensitive will shift from the traditional payment rails of check, ACH, and wire to\nthe instant payment rails of FedNow and RTP. The timing and extent of such movements across payment\nrails are difficult to predict and will be affected by the pricing of payments services by market\nparticipants, as well as other factors. In thinking about the evolution of the payment rails, it may seem\nmore efficient to have fewer rails for smaller-transaction payments, but those efficiencies need to be\nbalanced with ensuring that the payment system has sufficient redundancy to remain resilient.\n\nConclusion\nA well-functioning and secure payment system is vital to our economy. As we modernize the payment\nsystem, it is important to remember that the foundation of a successful payment system is the public’s\nconfidence in it. The public needs to be confident that the system will be: available whenever the\ncustomer needs it; efficient at routing and settling payments; resilient against cyberattacks and fraudulent\n\n\f11\nactors; and reliable without the public having to know the intricacies of the infrastructure behind it. As\nthe payment system evolves, the Fed, the industry, and end users will need to continue to collaborate to\nensure that the modern payment system lives up to its promise of being efficient, safe, resilient, and\navailable to all. That’s the best way to maintain the confidence of the public the Fed serves.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidelines for Evaluating Joint Account Requests,” 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/joint_requests.htm)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The Federal Reserve Payments Study: 2022 Triennial Initial\nData Release,” April 21, 2023a.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fr-payments-study.htm)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Names Organizations Certified as Ready for\nFedNow® Service,” press release, June 29, 2023b.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230629a.htm)\nFedNow blog.\n(https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/blog)\nFedNow website.\n(https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow)\nFedPayments Improvement, “Faster Mobile Payments Go Mainstream as Gen X Usage Catches Up to Millenials,”\nFederal Reserve Market Readiness Brief, May 18, 2023.\n(https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/051823-consumer-research-brief-1.pdf)\nFederal Reserve Financial Services, “FedNow Features: Settlement, Reporting, and Liquidity Management,”\nFedNow blog, July 9, 2021.\n(https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/blog/fednow-features-settlement-reporting-liquiditymanagement.html)\nFederal Reserve Financial Services, “FedNow Service Guide to Liquidity Management Transfers.”\n(https://explore.fednow.org/resources?page=11&id=84&resourceRole=fi&resourceTitle=guide-to-liquiditymanagement-transfers)\nFederal Reserve Financial Services, “FedNow Service,” Product Sheet.\n(https://www.frbservices.org/binaries/content/assets/crsocms/financial-services/fednow/fednow-product-sheet.pdf)\nMester, Loretta J., “An Update on the Federal Reserve’s Efforts to Modernize the Payment System,” 2022 Chicago\nPayments Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, October 4, 2022.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/collections/speeches/2022/sp-20221004-an-update-on-the-federal-reserves-efforts-tomodernize-the-payment-system)\nU.S. Census Bureau, “Quarterly Retail E-Commerce Sales Report,” May 18, 2023.\n(https://www.census.gov/retail/ecommerce.html)\n\n\fFigures for\n“An Update on the Federal Reserve’s Instant Payments Service:\nFedNow®”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2023 UC San Diego Economics Roundtable\nSan Diego, CA\n(via videoconference)\nJuly 10, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Jim Hamilton and the University of California San Diego for inviting me to speak today. I am\nlooking forward to your questions because hearing what is on your minds helps me hone my own views\nabout the economy. But let me start with a review of economic developments and my perspectives on\nmonetary policy. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n[Figure 1. Federal funds rate and SLOOS]\nSince early last year, the Federal Reserve has been tightening the stance of monetary policy. We have\nraised the target range of the federal funds rate by 5 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced\nin May 2022, which also helps to firm the stance of monetary policy. At its meeting last month, the\nFOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5 to 5-1/4 percent to allow the\nCommittee time to assess incoming economic information and the cumulative effects of the tightening\ndone so far. The tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions.\nBanks have been tightening their credit standards, making credit less available to businesses and\nhouseholds, and Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and credit spreads have risen.\n\nThe FOMC has taken these policy actions to combat high inflation, which is well above our policy goal of\n2 percent. While higher interest rates have made it harder for some households and businesses to borrow,\nhigh inflation is a hardship for everyone. In fact, at our recent Fed Listens1 event, we heard from many\ncommunity development practitioners that lower-income workers are now able to find jobs paying\n\n1\n\nThe Fed Listens initiative began in 2019. It includes a series of events held across the country with a wide variety\nof participants to provide Fed policymakers with information on how monetary policy affects people in their daily\nlives. Our recent Fed Listens event was held with Federal Reserve Governor Miki Bowman in Cleveland as part of\nthe Cleveland Fed’s Policy Summit, a conference that focuses on issues affecting low- and moderate-income\ncommunities and households. More information on the Fed Listens initiative is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/fedlistens.htm. More information on the Policy Summit is available at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/events/policy-summit/2023/ev-20230621-policy-summit-2023.\n\n\f2\nconsiderably more than what they earned before the pandemic, but those higher wages haven’t kept up\nwith inflation. These workers are having to make some hard choices to make ends meet.\n\nHigh inflation also imposes longer-run costs on the economy. It makes it harder to plan for the future,\naffecting people’s decisions about getting an education or training for a new job, and businesses’\ndecisions about whether to invest in new plants and equipment. These types of investments in human and\nphysical capital help determine our economy’s pace of innovation and productivity growth and therefore\nits potential growth rate and our longer-run standard of living. It is costly to our economy in both the\nshort and the long run to allow inflation to remain so high for so long. And the Fed is committed to\nreturning the economy to price stability.\n\nThe monetary policy question is whether the current level of the federal funds rate is sufficiently\nrestrictive to keep inflation moving down in a sustainable and timely way to our goal of 2 percent. To\nassess that, let’s review how the economy got to where it is today and the progress that’s been made.\n\nEconomic Developments\nAt the start of 2020, before the pandemic, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. It was the 11th\nyear of the expansion, and things looked quite good from the perspective of our monetary policy goals.\nThe unemployment rate was at historically low levels, employment growth was strong, participation in\nthe labor force was solid, and inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nBut the pandemic changed all of that. The economy shut down in March 2020. Fiscal and monetary\npolicymakers took aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit\ncontinued to flow, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. When public health statistics began to\nimprove in May 2020, many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions,\nand the economy began to reopen. But spending patterns had changed, people had left the work force,\nand supply chains were disrupted. These forces are still affecting the economy today. The imbalances\n\n\f3\nbetween demand and supply, in an environment of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, led to an\nincrease in inflation starting in the spring of 2021.\n\n[Figure 2. GDP growth and sectors]\nThe good news is that the monetary policy actions taken to date are helping to moderate demand and\nalleviate some of the imbalances that have contributed to price pressures. Real GDP grew at a belowtrend pace of less than 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021.\nThe slowdown in activity is most apparent in interest-rate sensitive sectors, including housing,\nmanufacturing, and business investment. For example, some business contacts in Cleveland’s Federal\nReserve District, which includes the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West\nVirginia, tell us that they are pulling back on construction projects due to high interest rates and general\neconomic uncertainty.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, disruptions in supply chains have generally improved. Our contacts\nreport that bottlenecks have eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have shortened.\nBusinesses also say that over time they have learned how to better navigate supply issues. This is\nwelcome news because price pressures can be alleviated through both further moderation in demand and\nfurther improvement in supply.\n\nIn many respects the economy has been more resilient than many people were anticipating late last year.\nAt that point, many of our business contacts were telling us they expected the economy to enter a\nrecession this year. Now, most think there won’t be a recession this year, and many think that, even if\ndemand slows down some more, a recession will be avoided or will be very mild.\n\nThe economic outlook has been difficult to pin down partly because the pandemic and the responses to it\nfrom households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers are still affecting the economy. For\nexample, consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of GDP, has been particularly resilient. It\n\n\f4\nhas been growing at an annualized pace of about 3-1/2 percent so far this year, a pickup from last year’s\npace. Spending has been supported by strong income growth and the savings accumulated during the\npandemic.\n\n[Figure 3. Goods and services spending]\nThe pandemic also affected the pattern of spending. The mandated shutdowns and the voluntary pullback\nin demand for high-contact services led to a shift in spending from services to goods early in the\npandemic. When the economy reopened, demand surged and was supported by fiscal transfers and\naccommodative monetary policy. Since early 2021, spending has been shifting back from goods to\nservices, but neither spending level is back to its pre-pandemic trend. Adjusted for inflation, spending on\ngoods remains elevated and spending on services remains below its trend level.\n\n[Figure 4. Housing starts and sales]\nHousing has also behaved somewhat differently than might have been expected. Many people wanted to\nchange their living arrangements early in the pandemic, and sales of new and existing single-family\nhomes surged in 2020 and 2021. In response, new home construction also moved up sharply. Last year,\nhigher mortgage rates led to a sharp decline in housing starts. But now, conditions appear to be\nbottoming out and housing activity has started to move up again. This likely reflects structural issues,\nincluding a long-term shortage of available housing. So housing construction and prices have held up\nbetter than one might have expected given the level of interest rates. Contacts in construction tell us that\nthey expect public-sector and infrastructure spending to also support construction activity.\n\n[Figure 5. Employment growth and the unemployment rate]\nThe pandemic has had profound effects on the labor market. When the economy reopened, labor demand\nwell outpaced labor supply, putting upward pressure on wages and price inflation. Progress is now being\nmade in bringing demand and supply into better balance, but it is slow progress and demand is still\noutpacing supply. The monthly pace of job growth has been slowing over the past year. However, it\n\n\f5\nremains robust, with payroll gains averaging more than 240 thousand per month from April to June. The\nunemployment rate is 3.6 percent, near its 50-year low, and it has been basically at that level for over a\nyear. The number of job openings has been moving down but the ratio of job openings to the number of\nunemployed workers is more than 1.6. That is well above the 1.2 level seen in the strong labor market\nconditions in 2019.\n\n[Figure 6. Labor force participation]\nWe have seen an adjustment in labor supply over time. When the pandemic hit, many people left the\nwork force. Some needed to take on the responsibilities of caring for children or elderly members of the\nfamily and others chose to retire. Since then, labor force participation rates have been improving. While\nthe total labor force participation rate is below what it was before the pandemic, the participation rate of\nprime-age workers, i.e., workers between the ages of 25 and 54, is now higher than its pre-pandemic level\nand this has helped to ease some of the imbalance between labor demand and supply.\n\nThese strong labor market conditions are not necessarily a problem; in fact, they provide a basis for a\nscenario in which inflation moves back down to 2 percent without a recession. The question is whether\nthe current strength in labor demand relative to supply is consistent with price stability.\n\n[7. Employment cost index and average hourly earnings]\nHere we need to look at wage trends. By some measures, wage pressures have moderated, and firms tell\nus they are not expecting the outsized wage gains of the last couple of years to persist except for those\nwith skills particularly in demand. Nonetheless, wages are still growing at an annual rate of about 4-1/2\nto 5 percent. This is well above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation given current estimates of\ntrend productivity growth. Indeed, for wage growth at the current pace to be consistent with price\nstability, trend productivity growth would need to be 2-1/2 to 3 percent, instead of the current estimates of\n1 to 1-1/2 percent. We have not seen any evidence that trend productivity growth is rising; in fact,\nproductivity has declined over the past year.\n\n\f6\n\n[Figure 8. Total PCE inflation, and energy and food inflation]\nThe pandemic and the response to it by households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers\nalso had profound effects on inflation in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., inflation began to move up\nsharply in the spring of 2021, reflecting pandemic-induced imbalances in supply and demand in an\nenvironment of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February\n2022 led to additional inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and other commodities.\nThis high and broad-based inflation is very different from what the U.S. experienced during the long prepandemic expansion. Until late in that expansion, the concern was that inflation was running below our\nlonger-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nProgress is being made on inflation. Inflation levels, both the headline numbers, which include food and\nenergy prices, and measures of underlying inflation, including the core, median, and trimmed-mean\nmeasures, have moved down from their peaks. Measured year-over-year, total PCE inflation peaked at 7\npercent in June of last year. As of May of this year, it has fallen to just under 4 percent, reflecting sharp\ndeclines in energy prices and a deceleration in food prices.\n\n[Figure 9. Core inflation and components]\nUnfortunately, we see less progress with core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. Core\nPCE inflation peaked in February 2022 at 5.4 percent. It has moved down a bit since then, but progress\nhas stalled, with core inflation running about 4.6 percent over the past six months. Of course, food and\nenergy prices matter for consumers. The Fed’s inflation target is defined in terms of total PCE inflation,\nwhich includes food and energy prices. But economists look at measures that exclude these components\n\n\f7\nbecause they often give a better reading on where inflation is headed. And currently the core measure\nindicates that inflation is stubbornly high and broad-based.\n\nWhen we look at components, we see that inflation in both core goods and core services remains high.\nThis is very different from the pre-pandemic expansion, when core goods inflation was slightly negative\non average and falling goods prices were pulling inflation down. Currently, while core goods inflation\nhas declined over the past year, it remains above 2 percent.\n\nConsumers spend a larger share of their income on services than on goods: about 65 percent of the total\nconsumption basket is core services compared to about 24 percent for core goods. (The rest of the basket\ncomprises energy (4 percent) and food at home (7 percent).) Because its expenditure share is higher,\nservices have a higher weight in the inflation indices than goods. Services inflation also tends to be more\npersistent than goods inflation. Housing services, measured by rents and the imputed rents for owneroccupied housing, constitutes about 15 percent of people’s total consumption spending, and it is a large\nand cyclically sensitive component of services inflation.\n\nHousing services inflation remains elevated. When the economy reopened in 2021, housing demand\nsurged and so did rents. Last year, rent inflation began to come down, and the growth rate of rents in new\nleases, which helps predict housing services inflation, fell and has remained low. Cleveland Fed research\nindicates that it typically takes about a year for this deceleration to show up in the measures of housing\ninflation.2 So we are expecting to see housing services inflation to move down this year.\n\n2\n\nResearchers at the Cleveland Fed have produced a new tenant repeat-rent index, which they show leads the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics’ rent inflation measure by four quarters. For the data and analysis see Brian Adams, Lara\nLoewenstein, Hugh Montag, and Randal J. Verbrugge, “Disentangling Rent Index Differences: Data, Methods, and\nScope,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Working Paper No. 22-38, December 2022.\n(https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202238).\n\n\f8\nInflation in core services excluding housing, which accounts for 50 percent of total consumption, tends to\nbe sticky and correlated with wage inflation and the strength in the labor market. Although inflation in\nthis component slowed in May, it has shown little improvement over time. To achieve our longer-run\ngoal of 2 percent inflation, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation in the prices of goods,\nhousing, and core services excluding housing. And to achieve that we will need to see further moderation\nof demand in both product and labor markets. This brings me to monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThe FOMC has come an appreciable way in moving policy from a very accommodative stance to a\nrestrictive one. We are closer to the end of our tightening phase than the beginning. Because monetary\npolicy affects the broader economy with a lag, some of the tightening already in place will help to further\nmoderate demand in both product and labor markets, thereby easing price and wage pressures. So I do\nexpect inflation to move down further this year, although it will take longer to reach our 2 percent goal.\n\nThat said, the economy has shown more underlying strength than anticipated earlier this year, and\ninflation has remained stubbornly high, with progress on core inflation stalling. In order to ensure that\ninflation is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent, my view is that the funds rate will need to\nmove up somewhat further from its current level and then hold there for a while as we accumulate more\ninformation on how the economy is evolving.\n\n[Figure 10. SEP federal funds rate path]\nThis view accords with the median view among FOMC participants in the June Summary of Economic\nProjections.3 Those projections indicate that all but two participants anticipate that further rate increases\nwill be appropriate this year.\n\nFour times a year, the FOMC summarizes Committee participants’ projections of output growth, the\nunemployment rate, inflation, and the associated appropriate policy path. For the June 2023 SEP, see\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20230614.htm.\n3\n\n\f9\n\nIn addition to the current economic situation, risk management considerations also influence my current\nthinking that policy will need to tighten somewhat further to put inflation on a sustainable and timely path\nback to 2 percent.\n\n[Figure 11. Real rates]\nFirst, while policy is now in restrictive territory, it is less restrictive compared to many historical\ntightening cycles. That partly reflects the fact that when we started tightening in March 2022, policy was\nvery accommodative; so much of the tightening was to move policy to a neutral stance. Until recently,\nthe real policy rate, i.e., the nominal rate adjusted for inflation, has been below 0.5 percent, the median\nprojection among FOMC participants of the long-run real fed funds rate. As inflation falls, the real rate\nwill rise even without further increases in the nominal fed funds rate. Waiting for that passive tightening\nto happen, though, risks allowing inflation to remain elevated for longer.\n\n[Figure 12. SEP inflation]\nInfluencing my view is that inflation has surprised us on the upside for some time. According to the June\nSEP, the median FOMC participant now expects inflation to remain slightly above 2 percent at the end of\n2025, which is the farthest out the projections go. If so, then inflation will have been above our goal for\nover 4 years. And that is ignoring the risks that could play out, which most participants see as tilted to the\nupside for inflation.\n\n[Figure 13. Inflation expectations]\nA more timely path back to 2 percent inflation, which would be encouraged by somewhat tighter\nmonetary policy, is desirable because the longer inflation remains elevated, the higher the risk that\ninflation expectations could become unanchored from our 2 percent goal. Once households and\nbusinesses believe that inflation will remain elevated, those expectations influence their savings and\n\n\f10\ninvestment decisions, and wage- and price-setting behavior, and this makes it much harder to bring\ninflation down.\n\nSo far, most measures of medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have remained reasonably well\nanchored in a range consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, although they are at the upper end of that\nrange. These measures suggest that even though inflation is high, people are expecting it to return to 2\npercent over time. However, other evidence suggests some caution. As part of the Cleveland Fed’s\nSurvey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations, in April, we asked top business executives what they thought the\nFed’s inflation target was. The mean response was 3.1 percent. This is higher than our target of 2 percent\nbut also nearly a percentage point above the response before the pandemic.4\n\nIn addition, recent research by Cleveland Fed economists indicates that although short-run inflation\nexpectations tend to move with gasoline prices and the prices of other salient items like food, we\nshouldn’t ignore their persistently elevated levels entirely and focus only on longer-term expectations.\nThe researchers find persistent differences in inflation expectations across consumers of different ages\nand that households form their expectations of inflation based on their lifetime experience of inflation.5\nWhen this mechanism is incorporated into a conventional New Keynesian model, inflation shocks are\nmore persistent than otherwise, and the optimal response is for monetary policy to tighten when short-run\ninflation expectations rise even if longer-run expectations are stable. Doing so helps to limit the\nexperience households have with high inflation, which helps to keep inflation expectations anchored in\nthe future.\n\nThe Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE) was created by Professors Olivier Coibion and Yuriy\nGorodnichenko, and is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/survey-of-firms-inflation-expectations.\n4\n\nFor background on the survey, see Christian Garciga, Edward S. Knotek II, Mathieu Pedemonte, and Taylor\nShiroff, “The Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary,\nMay 22, 2023. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/ec-202310-the-survey-of-firmsinflation-expectations)\nMathieu O. Pedemonte, Hiroshi Toma, and Esteban Verdugo, “Aggregate Implications of Heterogeneous Inflation\nExpectations: The Role of Individual Experience,” Working Paper No. 23-04, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\nJanuary 2023. (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202304)\n5\n\n\f11\n\nI believe a somewhat tighter policy stance will help achieve a better balance between the risks of\ntightening too much against the risks of tightening too little. Tightening too much would slow the\neconomy more than necessary and entail higher costs than needed to get inflation back to our goal.\nTightening too little would allow high inflation to persist, with short- and long-run consequences, and\nnecessitate a much more costly journey back to price stability. A slightly higher policy rate would\nroughly equate the probabilities that the next policy move will be a tightening move versus a loosening\nmove. This would be a good holding point as we accumulate more information about whether the\neconomy is evolving as expected. If it is not, then we can adjust our policy rate either up or down, as\nappropriate.\n\nOf course, while this is my current assessment, there continues to be uncertainty about the outlook, and\nthe economy could evolve differently than anticipated. My policy views will be informed by all of the\nincoming economic and financial information, not only official government statistics but also regional\ninformation gathered from our business, labor market, and community contacts; a variety of surveys on\neconomic and banking conditions; and higher-frequency data such as credit card spending. All of this\ninformation can help determine not only where the economy is but also where it is going, and therefore,\ninform our policy decisions.\n\nI also recognize that others may assess the outlook and the risks to the outlook somewhat differently than\nI do. One benefit of attending FOMC meetings is hearing how other policymakers are evaluating things.\nWhile individual FOMC participants may at times have different assessments of appropriate policy, there\nshould be no doubt that we all share a strong commitment to setting monetary policy to achieve our\nstatutory goals of price stability and maximum employment on behalf of the public.\n\nThat concludes my summary of economic and policy developments. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\fFigures for\n“An Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy”\nLoretta J.

Although we bring\ndifferent perspectives to the table, we share a common goal: to strengthen communities by improving the\nopportunities for all people to productively engage in our economy. I thank all of the organizers for\nputting together such a strong program.\n\nThe discussions over the last two days have focused on many of the challenges that face our communities,\nboth long-standing ones and new ones that reflect our changing economy. There are still significant\nimpediments limiting those in low- and moderate-income households and communities from fully\nbenefiting from a strong economy. Not everyone has access to affordable education, transportation,\nbroadband, housing, credit, and other financial services, which are the foundational elements that allow\npeople to achieve the American dream and secure a better living standard for their children. I applaud\neach and every one of you for persevering in your efforts to improve our economy for all. At times it\nmust be quite discouraging given what still needs to be done. But I have decided to end the summit on a\npositive note by providing some examples of the progress that has been achieved in supporting\ncommunities through partnership and perseverance. Before I continue, I note that the views I present will\nbe my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nCommunity Development and the Federal Reserve System\nMy examples of progress come from two areas in which the Federal Reserve System has been particularly\ninterested: housing and workforce development. As many of you know, the origin of the Fed’s\ncommunity development work lies with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in\n\n\f2\n1977.1 The CRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which\nthey are chartered to do business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and\nneighborhoods. The Fed and other federal financial supervisory agencies were charged with\nimplementing the act. Today, through its research and outreach efforts, the community development\nfunction within the Fed provides information about the economic health of low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds and communities, and small businesses. This information is particularly helpful in tracking\nemerging developments and monitoring the economy in real time, since this information is available\nbefore many of the official statistics are released. It proved particularly useful during the pandemic,\nwhich had a disproportionately negative effect on lower-income people and people of color, as well as the\npost-pandemic economy, which has been characterized by high inflation, a particularly onerous burden\nfor people and businesses with fewer resources. Some of the information gathered is now included in the\nBeige Book, which is published two weeks before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nwhich sets monetary policy.\n\nAnother important source of information is the Federal Reserve Banks’ Small Business Credit Survey,\nwhich the Cleveland Fed now leads on behalf of the System.2 The survey provides information from a\nlarge sample of small businesses on their credit performance, financing needs and choices, and borrower\nexperiences.3 The survey allowed the Fed to document the disparate impact the pandemic had on small\nBlack-owned and women-owned businesses, track the post-pandemic recovery of small businesses, and\nsee how differences in access to credit have changed over time. The data on access to credit have\n\n1\n\nThis survey was launched in 2010 by the New York Fed and has been a collaboration among all 12 Reserve Banks\nsince 2016. For more discussion, see Mester (2017).\n2\n\nBetween September and November 2022, almost 14,000 small business owners participated in the survey, almost\n8,000 employer firms – small businesses with between 1 to 499 employees – and almost 6,000 nonemployer firms –\nsmall businesses without employees. The survey’s web page at www.fedsmallbusiness.org provides background on\nthe survey, survey data, and analyses using the data. See Federal Reserve Banks (2023a and 2023b).\n3\n\nSee Federal Reserve Banks (2023a, 2023b, and 2023c).\n\n\f3\ninformed the work being done by the federal banking regulators to modernize the regulations to\nimplement the CRA in light of the changes in banking since the 1970s.4\n\nIn addition to real-time reconnaissance, the Fed’s community development function also works to\nunderstand the longer-run trends that present challenges and opportunities for lower-income households\nand communities. At the Cleveland Fed we collect information in a variety of ways, including meeting\nwith our community contacts and our Community Advisory Council, conducting surveys of nonprofits\nand small businesses, and convening listening sessions and roundtables. An example is yesterday’s Fed\nListens event, which allowed Governor Bowman and me to directly hear how lower-income communities\nare experiencing the post-pandemic economy. Equally important for our work is the collaboration we\nhave with many of your organizations. We have learned over the years that much more can be\naccomplished by bringing together diverse perspectives to identify problems and then working together as\npartners with perseverance to solve them.\n\nProgress\nLet me turn to examples of progress, first, in the area of housing and neighborhood development.\nHousing and neighborhood development: A modern land bank and lead remediation\nSince the urban decline of the 1970s, vacant and abandoned properties have posed a problem for\nneighborhood revitalization. The global financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-2009 exacerbated\nthis challenge.5 Ohio had one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country during this time. In Slavic\nVillage, a neighborhood in southeast Cleveland, foreclosures affected as many as one in four homes.\n\nFor the latest information on the rulemaking process, see the section titled “Interagency Community Reinvestment\nAct Proposed Rulemaking,” on the Community Reinvestment Act web page of the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System.\n4\n\n5\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2008).\n\n\f4\nBetween 1990 and 2010, the number of vacant properties more than doubled in places like Cleveland,\nDetroit, and Baltimore, but increases were also seen in Sun Belt cities, including Atlanta and Miami.6\n\nTo help solve the large number of vacant and abandoned properties in Ohio in the 2000s, a “next\ngeneration” land bank was set up, the Cuyahoga Land Bank. Instead of relying on government agencies,\nthis land bank entrusted nongovernmental entities to acquire distressed properties and they were able to\nconvert these properties to alternate uses more efficiently than local governments could.7 This land bank\ncontinues to be an important avenue for revitalizing neighborhoods in Cleveland.\n\nAnother example of progress is the remediation of lead in the housing stock in Cleveland. While in some\nparts of the country lead contamination has come through the drinking water system, in Cleveland, a\ndeteriorating housing stock in distressed neighborhoods was the main contributor to high levels of lead\ntoxicity in children. Even though it has been 45 years since lead paint was banned in 1978, in the mid2000s, lead testing in Cleveland revealed that a significant share of the city’s children had elevated levels\nof lead in their bloodstream, and these children disproportionately lived in lower-income and majority\nminority neighborhoods.8 At elevated levels, lead can cause brain damage that is irreversible and has\nsignificant adverse effects on a child’s ability to learn, which can threaten the child’s attachment to the\nworkforce and long-term economic well-being. Lead is a health problem, but it is also an educational\nproblem, a workforce and economic development problem, and a barrier to economic opportunity and an\ninclusive economy.\n\n6\n\nSee Finn, Nelson, and Stein (2021), pp. 7-23.\n\n7\n\nThe Cuyahoga Land Bank was modeled after one in Genesee County, Michigan. See Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland (2008) and Finn, Nelson, and Stein (2021).\n8\n\nSee Nelson (2016), Johnson (2019), and Coulton, et al. (2020). A study of Chicago neighborhoods found that even\nthough the incidence of lead poisoning in children has fallen significantly over time as a result of public health\npolicy, it is still the case that those neighborhoods with the highest levels of toxicity are predominantly Black\nneighborhoods. See Sampson and Winter (2016).\n\n\f5\nAs more people became aware of the dangerous effects of lead in homes, research institutions, hospitals,\nnonprofits, and foundations joined with the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County to form a publicprivate partnership called the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition. For the past six years, the Coalition has\nhelped with screening, testing, public outreach, and engagement with residents and landlords, as well as\nlead paint remediation in homes and clearance. Over time, the group has expanded to include more\norganizations and state and local governments, and families affected by lead. Many of our Policy Summit\npartners, including the United Way, Enterprise Community Partners, Cleveland Neighborhood Progress,\nand the Urban League, are members.9\n\nIn 2016, the Cleveland Fed convened parties interested in solving the lead problem, and in 2022 we\nhosted a Lead Safe Home Fund investor forum at the Bank. It was clear that a lot of tangible progress had\nbeen made over those six years. As of January 2022, $115 million of funding has been designated for\nmaking Cleveland homes lead-safe and the City of Cleveland requires all rental properties built before\n1978 to have a Lead Safe certification, which requires the property to have been inspected by a certified\nprofessional and not have any current lead hazards. The share of tested children who have elevated blood\nlevels of lead has also fallen substantially since the 2000s.10 Still, we should not tolerate any level of\ntoxicity. There is more work to be done, but I am convinced that with perseverance and continued\npartnership we can make even more progress.\nWorkforce development: Training and early childhood education\nThe second set of examples is in the area of workforce development. Workforce development plays a\ncritical role in helping people and communities further their economic well-being. Currently, our\neconomy is experiencing a skills gap: not enough workers have the skills necessary to fill the jobs in\ndemand. This means that the country is not living up to its economic potential. A skilled workforce that\n\n9\n\nSee the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition’s website.\n\n10\n\nData from the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition show that from 2017 to 2021, this share has fallen from about 13\npercent to about 9 percent. See the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition’s dashboard.\n\n\f6\ncan adapt to change is an essential ingredient in a healthy economy. The Federal Reserve System has\nworked on several initiatives to promote investment in workforce development and encourage\npartnerships.11 I use the word “investment” on purpose. There is a growing understanding among\nbusinesses that expenditure on employees should not just be viewed as a short-run input cost. Employees\nare important assets to an organization and investing in employees can pay off in the long run by creating\na more attached and productive workforce. Regions are also realizing that investments to draw a highly\nskilled workforce can pay off by attracting more employers to the region and making the region more\ncompetitive when opportunities arise. Workforce development and regional economic development are\nlinked and should be viewed as a common goal.\n\nEven before the pandemic, technological change, automation, and digitalization were driving rapid\nchanges in the nature of work: what we do and how we do it.12 The types of jobs and the skills needed for\ndoing them are changing. Over the past decade, skills-based hiring has become more common and has\nprovided a practical solution for matching employers with workers who have the necessary skills and\nproviding better career paths for more people. According to a Fed survey of young workers, more than 30\npercent of young adults did not get information about jobs and careers in high school or college.13 The\nFederal Reserve has been working to fill this information gap. For example, recognizing that a majority\nof adults, disproportionately people of color, do not have at least a bachelor’s degree, researchers at the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, and Philadelphia have been documenting the types of\n\n11\n\nThe Federal Reserve System worked with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers\nUniversity, the Ray Marshall Center of the Lyndon B. Johnson School at the University of Texas, and the W.E.\nUpjohn Institute for Employment Research on an initiative called Investing in America’s Workforce. The Federal\nReserve Banks have also participated in recent national initiatives, including the Worker Voices Project, which\nraised the public’s awareness of the experiences of lower wage workers during the pandemic, and the Advancing\nCareers for Low-Income Families Initiative, based at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which is raising the\npublic’s awareness about benefits cliffs, which refer to situations in which families lose access to some public\nassistance benefits as their income rises.\n12\n\nSee Mester (2021).\n\n13\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016).\n\n\f7\noccupations that do not require a four-year college degree but that do pay a decent wage (at or above the\nmedian wage).14 Examples of these types of “opportunity occupations” include nurses, sales\nrepresentatives, truck drivers, carpenters, and electricians. An examination of the skills in demand for\nlower-wage and for opportunity occupations led to the development of the Occupational Mobility\nExplorer tool.15 This tool helps workers in 33 different metro areas learn how the skills used in their\ncurrent occupation are similar to those used in a higher-paying occupation in their same labor market. For\nexample, if you are a cashier in Cleveland, you have the skills to be a customer service representative, a\njob that pays, on average, 135 percent more.16\n\nAs the skills gap has widened, community colleges and businesses have partnered to tailor training and\ncurriculums. The Federal Reserve and other evaluators have identified several examples of successful\npartnerships that have increased opportunity, reduced worker turnover, and increased productivity and\nwages.17 Many of these programs are sector specific. The Cuyahoga County Workforce Funders Group,\na public-private partnership, is working with various local partners on programs in information\ntechnology, healthcare, manufacturing, and hospitality. Towards Employment, a nonprofit workforce\ndevelopment organization involved in this effort, bases its work on the WorkAdvance model to help build\ncareer paths in high-demand sectors. This model includes pre-screening to ensure that participants\nunderstand a sector’s job requirements, occupational skills training, placement services, and postemployment coaching. The model has been shown to be effective, with participants working more\nregular hours, staying in the workforce, and earning higher salaries.18\n\n14\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\n\n15\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\n16\n\nThis is based on using the Occupational Mobility Explorer tool, which is available at\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/community-development-data/occupational-mobility-explorer.\n17\n\nSee Fee, Klesta, and Nelson (2016) and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia (2021).\n18\n\nSee Fund for Our Economic Future and Hendra, et al. (2016).\n\n\f8\n\nOf course, to be able to perform well at a job or in a skills-based development program, one needs to have\nhad a good foundation. It has become increasingly clear through research and experience that early\nchildhood education is critically important for advancement. The benefit comes not only from acquiring\nskills like reading and math but also from behavioral skills.19 We now know that when children fall\nbehind early on, it is difficult to catch up, and progress has been made in identifying which type of early\nchildhood education programs work.20 The research has shown that well-focused investment in early\nchildhood development pays off for both individuals and the community overall,21 that enrollment in\npre-K programs has helped to lower racial and income disparities in students’ readiness for\nkindergarten,22 and that home environment matters, too. For example, a study by a Cleveland Fed\neconomist showed that the number of books at home has a significant impact on achievement in\nelementary school.23\n\nThe research findings have driven action and the action has led to progress. In 2014, the Cleveland\nMetropolitan Area School District (CMSD) expanded pre-K education through its PRE4CLE program.\nIn the year prior to its establishment, only 16 percent of children were entering kindergarten fully\nprepared, as measured by Ohio’s Kindergarten Readiness Assessment, and only about 26 percent of\npreschool-age children in Cleveland were participating in high-quality preschool. From the program’s\nlaunch through 2019, enrollment in high-quality preschool increased by 72 percent, with nearly half of\nCleveland’s 3- to 5-year-olds enrolled. Unfortunately, as was true for many childhood education\n\n19\n\nOne study found that a main way in which the influential Perry Preschool Program, which predates HeadStart,\naffected longer-run outcomes was by affecting the social skills of the participants, e.g., lowering aggressive and antisocial behaviors. See Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev (2013).\n20\n\nSee, for example, Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev (2013), and Almond and Currie (2010).\n\n21\n\nSee Rolnick and Grunewald (2003).\n\n22\n\nSee Reardon and Portilla (2016).\n\n23\n\nSee Aliprantis (2014).\n\n\f9\nprograms, the pandemic caused the enrollment in PRE4CLE to fall significantly, but it did begin to\nrecover last year.\n\nThe Cincinnati Preschool Promise is also working to expand access to high-quality preschool to prepare\nstudents for kindergarten. And Akron’s I Promise School has also been successfully implementing a\nwrap-around approach that ensures that students have access not only to education but also to healthy\nfood and transportation to get to school. Another sign of progress is that policymakers increasingly\nrecognize that they need to take a holistic approach to effectively address the challenges facing lowerincome households.\n\nWhat is critically important now is to persevere in educating our children, make up the ground lost during\nthe pandemic, and increase access, so that all of our children will be ready for the changing workforce of\nthe future.24\n\nConclusion\nThese are only a few examples of progress. I could point to many others that show what can be achieved\nthrough partnership and perseverance. I hope that what you have learned and who you have met at this\nyear’s Policy Summit will inspire you to form new partnerships and to persevere with the important work\nyou are doing. If we remain committed and work together, I am convinced we will make further progress\ntoward a more inclusive economy in which all people benefit. Thank you again for participating in this\nyear’s Policy Summit.\n\n24\n\nThe pandemic was a setback for childhood education. It had significant negative effects on the math and reading\nachievement scores of elementary school students in the U.S. See Kuhfeld, Soland, and Lewis (2022).\n\n\f10\nReferences\nAdvancing Careers for Low-Income Families, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n(https://www.atlantafed.org/economic-mobility-and-resilience/advancing-careers-for-low-incomefamilies.aspx)\nAliprantis, Dionissi, “When Should Children Start School?” Journal of Human Capital 8 (Winter 2014),\npp. 481-536.\n(https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/679109)\nAlmond, Douglas, and Janet Currie, “Human Capital Development Before Age Five,” in Handbook of\nLabor Economics, vol. 4B, Orley Ashenfelter and David Card, eds., Amsterdam: Elsevier, North-Holland,\n2010, pp. 1315–1486.\n(http://www.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-labor-economics-vol-4b/ashenfelter/978-0-444-53452-1)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Community Reinvestment Act web page.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/cra_about.htm)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Experiences and Perspectives of Young Workers,”\nDecember 2016.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2016-survey-young-workers-executive-summary.htm)\nCoulton, Claudia, Francisca García-Cobián, Youngmin Cho, Jiho Park, and Robert Fischer, “Downstream\nConsequences of Childhood Lead Poisoning: A Longitudinal Study of Cleveland Children from Birth to\nEarly Adulthood,” Case Western Reserve University Center on Urban Poverty and Community\nDevelopment, July 2, 2020.\n(https://case.edu/socialwork/povertycenter/sites/case.edu.povertycenter/files/202007/Downstream_06182020_rev07082020.pdf)\nFederal Reserve Banks, “2023 Report on Employer Firms: Findings from the 2022 Small Business Credit\nSurvey,” March 2023a.\n(https://doi.org/10.55350/sbcs-20230308)\nFederal Reserve Banks, “2023 Report on Nonemployer Firms: Findings from the 2022 Small Business\nCredit Survey,” May 2023b.\n(https://doi.org/10.55350/sbcs-20230531)\nFederal Reserve Banks, “2023 Report on Startup Firms Owned by People of Color: Findings from the\n2022 Small Business Credit Survey,” June 2023c.\n(https://doi.org/10.55350/sbcs-20230616)\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Workforce Realigned: How\nNew Partnerships Are Advancing Economic Mobility, Social Finance, 2021.\n(https://www.philadelphiafed.org/community-development/workforce-andeconomic%20development/workforce-realigned)\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, “Breaking the Housing Crisis Cycle,” 2008 Annual Report,\nDecember 31, 2008.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/annual-report/2008/ar-2008-breaking-housing-crisis-cycle)\n\n\f11\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, “Opportunity Occupations: A Way Ahead for People Without\nCollege Degrees.”\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/community-development/opportunity-occupations)\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Occupational Mobility Explorer tool.\n(https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/community-development-data/occupational-mobilityexplorer)\nFee, Kyle, Matt Klesta, and Lisa Nelson, “Addressing Employment Needs through Sector Partnerships:\nCase Studies from Across the Federal Reserve’s Fourth District,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\nAugust 15, 2016.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/special-reports/sr-20160815addressing-employment-needs-through-sector-partnership)\nFinn, Robert, Lisa Nelson, and Sarah Stein, “Tackling Vacancy and Abandonment: Strategies and\nImpacts after the Great Recession,” Center for Community Progress, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\nand the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, September 2021.\n(https://communityprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-09-Tackling-Vacancy-andAbandonment-Book-Publication.pdf)\nFund for Our Economic Future, “Redefining Workforce Development in Northeast Ohio: How National\nWorkAdvance Demonstration Made Local Impact.”\n(https://www.towardsemployment.org/wp-content/uploads/WorkAdvance_LocalReport_112216.pdf)\nHeckman, James, Rodrigo Pinto, and Peter Savelyev, “Understanding the Mechanisms Through Which an\nInfluential Early Childhood Program Boosted Adult Outcomes,” American Economic Review 103, 2013,\npp. 2052- 2086.\n(https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.103.6.2052)\nHendra, Richard, David H.

        "content": "Longer-Run Trends and the U.S. Economy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nDublin, Ireland\nMay 16, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak in its Central Banking Series and the\nCentral Bank of Ireland for hosting this event. I have had many great opportunities to participate in GIC\nprograms. So when I was offered the chance to speak at this event I jumped at it because I knew that\nwhat I learn today will give me insights into the economy, which will prove valuable in setting monetary\npolicy.\n\nToday, rather than focus on the current economic outlook and monetary policy, I will focus on the longer\nrun. While I will frame my discussion in terms of the U.S. economy, many of the trends I will discuss\naffect other advanced economies, too. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nPolicy economists often talk about the longer run as if it were a destination, but we speak less frequently\nabout the factors that will influence what that destination will look like and how it will evolve. These\nslower-moving trends include longer-run potential output growth, labor force growth, demographic\nchanges, and productivity growth. While these trends might get less attention in current policy\ndiscussions, they have significant implications for the future health of the U.S. economy. And while\nmonetary policy cannot directly affect these longer-run trends, it needs to take them into account.\n\nLong-Run Growth\nLet me start with long-run potential growth. Living standards, as measured by income per person, are\ninextricably tied to an economy’s long-run growth rate. Over time, even small differences in growth can\ntranslate into large differences in average income per person. For example, if real GDP were to grow at\n2-1/4 percent per year over the next 20 years, instead of 1-3/4 percent, the difference in income at the end\n\n\f2\nof that period would amount to about $10,000 per person in today’s dollars, which is about 13 percent of\ntoday’s per capita income level in the U.S.1\n\nOver the long term, the U.S. economy has enjoyed solid economic performance. Save for the Great\nDepression, sustained growth of per capita real GDP of around 2 percent per year has been a hallmark of\nthe U.S. economy over the past 150 years.2 But this average obscures the fact that long-run growth in the\nU.S. has been falling over time. From the end of World War II through the end of the 1990s, real GDP\ngrowth averaged 3-1/2 percent per year. If we concentrate on recent economic expansions, we see that\ngrowth averaged about 4-1/4 percent over the 1982-1990 expansion and about 3-1/2 percent over the\n1991-2001 expansion. In contrast, average growth over the pre-pandemic expansion and the current\nexpansion, excluding the rebound quarter after the economic shutdown, has been about 2-3/4 percent.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that real GDP will grow by about 2-1/4 percent per year\nfrom 2025 to 2030. This is somewhat above the CBO’s 1-3/4 percent estimate of maximum sustainable\nor potential growth over that period.3 And that estimate of potential growth is considerably lower than the\nCBO’s potential growth estimate of 2-3/4 percent for the 1991-2007 period, a period prior to the Great\nRecession.4\n\nIndeed, economists have been revising down their estimates of longer-run growth since the start of the\nGreat Recession. When the FOMC began releasing longer-run economic projections in January 2009, the\ncentral tendency of the participants’ projections of longer-run real GDP growth was 2-1/2 to 2-3/4\n\n1\n\nThis calculation is based on Census Bureau projections of population growth.\n\n2\n\nSee Jones (2016).\n\n3\n\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2023).\n\n4\n\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2023), Figure 2.5.\n\n.\n\n\f3\npercent. In the projections released in March of this year, the central tendency was down to 1-3/4 to 2.0\npercent.\n\nLabor Force Growth\nThe key determinants of an economy’s longer-run growth rate are structural productivity growth – how\neffectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output – and labor force growth.\nDuring the pandemic many people left the workforce. Some found it necessary to leave for health reasons\nor because they had to take care of children or other family members, and many decided to retire. In fact,\nthe share of the U.S. population that is retired is about 1-1/2 percentage points above what it was before\nthe pandemic, an increase of more than 3-1/2 million people.5 While prime-age labor force participation\nhas now returned to pre-pandemic levels, total labor force participation has not, partly reflecting these\n“excess retirements.”\n\nBut even before the pandemic, labor force growth had been slowing. In the 1970s, the labor force grew\nabout 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered the workforce. Labor\nforce growth has slowed since then, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over the prepandemic expansion, from 2009-2019. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that labor\nforce growth will average 1/2 percent per year over 2021-2031.6\n\nThe downward trend in labor force growth largely reflects slower population growth, which results from\ndemographic factors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, as well as reduced net\ninternational migration when compared to earlier decades. Demographic change can have significant\neffects on the economy, influencing not only population and labor force growth, but also savings rates,\n\n5\n\nSee Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).\n\n6\n\nSee U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (September 8, 2022) and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (November 2022).\n\n\f4\nthe long-run unemployment rate, the equilibrium interest rate, and the demand for financial assets.7 The\nBLS estimates that the U.S. population will grow less than 3/4 percent a year on average from 2021 to\n2031, one of the slowest paces since the series started in the 1960s. The median age of the U.S.\npopulation is about 37 years old, about 10 years older than in 1970.8 By 2050, the U.N. projects that the\nmedian age in the U.S. will be over 43 years old and that the number of people age 65 or older per 100\nworking-age people (those ages 25 to 64) will be more than double what it was in 1970.9\n\nIncreased immigration can partially offset the effects of an aging domestic population. According to the\nBLS, about 18 percent of the U.S. labor force is foreign born and those who are foreign-born participate\nin the labor force at a higher rate than native-born Americans.10 Yet immigration flows to the U.S. have\nslowed since the 2000s.11\n\nProductivity Growth\nThe dampening effect of slower labor force growth on the potential growth of the economy could be\noffset by more rapid increases in productivity growth. Indeed, sustained increases in output and\nincreasing standards of living are determined by productivity growth.12 Over the five years prior to the\npandemic, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, grew\nat an annual rate of only about 1-1/2 percent; over the current expansion productivity has not grown much\n\n7\n\nSee Mester (2018).\n\n8\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the median age in the U.S. was 27.2 in 1970 and 43.1 in 2020, and it is estimated\nto be 43.1 in 2050. See United Nations (2022).\nThis is the inverse of the United Nation’s potential support ratio. Calculations based on the data in United Nations\n(2022) indicates that the number of people age 65 or older per 100 working-age people (those ages 25 to 64) was 22\nin 1970 and 31 in 2020, and it is expected to rise to 47 by 2050.\n9\n\n10\n\nCalculated as the average of the monthly shares for 2022. In 2022, the labor force participation rate for foreignborn workers was 65.9 percent compared with 61.5 percent for native-born people. Data are from the U.S. Bureau\nof Labor Statistics, “Employment Situation” (monthly).\n11\n\nFor example, the number of persons obtaining legal permanent resident status per 1,000 residents has fallen to\naround 2.2 from about 3.5 over 2000-2009. See U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n12\n\nMester (2017) discusses the endogenous growth model.\n\n\f5\nat all. This is quite a step down from the 2-1/4 percent pace seen over the two expansions prior to the\nGreat Recession. Some of the slowdown in productivity growth during the current expansion likely\nreflects the difficulty in measuring productivity given the unusual effects of the pandemic on the labor\nmarket. Some of those effects will likely abate over time, but structural factors have likely been weighing\non productivity growth, as well.\n\nEconomic dynamism\nOne such factor is a reduced level of economic dynamism. New firms play a particularly important role\nin the U.S. economy. In fact, young firms disproportionately contribute to both overall job creation and\njob destruction in the U.S.13 An enviable aspect of the U.S. economy around the globe has been our spirit\nof innovation, entrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility. This\ndynamism has contributed to economic growth and well-being in the U.S. by allowing resources to be\nreallocated from less-productive to more-productive businesses and allowing workers to move up the\ncareer ladder.\n\nBefore the pandemic, a cause for concern about the U.S. economy was that the start-up rate of new\nbusinesses had been generally declining at least since 2000.14 Business start-ups were accounting for a\nsmaller share of firms and a smaller share of employment than they once did.15 This slow pace of startups and more general decline in business and labor market dynamism likely contributed to the slowdown\n\n13\n\nFor further discussion of the role of small businesses in the U.S. economy, see Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda\n(2013) and Mester (2022). Additional information on small businesses is available in the Federal Reserve System’s\nSmall Business Credit Survey, an annual national survey of small-business owners, which is led on behalf of the\nSystem by a team from the Cleveland Fed.\n14\n15\n\nFor further discussion of the decline in dynamism, see Haltiwanger (2015).\n\nOver the 1990s to the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 10 percent of all firms and an\naverage of over 2-1/2 percent of total employment each year. Over 2010 through 2019, those numbers fell: start-ups\naccounted for about 8 percent of all firms and an average of under 2 percent of total employment each year. (My\ncalculations are based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics and its Firm Age Table,\nBDSFAGE.)\n\n\f6\nin productivity growth of the American economy.16 Indeed, by some estimates, if the pace of job\nreallocation had remained the same as in the 1980s, total factor productivity growth in the U.S. would\nhave been a third higher.17\n\nThe onset of the pandemic hit many small businesses very hard. From February to April 2020, the\nnumber of active small business owners dropped by 3.3 million, a record 22 percent decline.18 But\nsurprisingly, starting in May 2020, there has been a significant increase in new business registrations.19\nWhile down from the May 2021 level, monthly business applications remain considerably higher than\nthey were before the pandemic. Some of these new businesses were likely established out of necessity by\npeople who had lost their jobs during the pandemic or by people who felt dissatisfied with their work\nsituation. Others were likely formed by people who saw and took advantage of an opportunity. It is not\nclear at this point how many of these new businesses will prosper and whether this represents a\nresurgence of dynamism in the U.S. economy.20 If it does, that will be a positive sign.\n\nInvestment in technology and human capital\nIn addition to dynamism, productivity trends can be influenced through investment. Indeed, economists\nhold different views about the future growth prospects of the U.S. economy largely because they have\ndifferent assessments of the prospects for investments in technology and human capital, factors that\ninfluence productivity growth.21\n\n16\n\nSee Haltiwanger (2015).\n\n17\n\nSee Decker, et al. (2020).\n\n18\n\nSee Fairlie (2020).\n\n19\n\nHaltiwanger (2021) and Lettieri and Fikri (2022) discuss the increase in start-ups during the pandemic.\n\n20\n\nSee Dinlersoz, et al. (2021)\n\n21\n\nFor further discussion about the pessimistic and optimistic camps, see Mester (2015).\n\n\f7\nThere have been significant advances in technology, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum\ncomputing, and machine learning. But not all technological change is obviously productive: note the\ncurrent discussions about artificial intelligence. However, changes in technology with widespread\napplicability can lead to higher levels of productivity growth and output growth.22 But even with\nproductive technology, it takes time to adapt to the change. Indeed, the disruption caused by technology\ncan have negative effects at first. Workers need to retrain and some industries may be pushed out by the\nnew technology. Eventually, as the economy adapts, there are gains, but not all people, industries, and\ncommunities will automatically share in the benefits. It is still too early to tell whether the pandemic has\nchanged trend productivity growth. There has been some speculation that the increased investments in\ntechnology that enabled remote work necessitated by the pandemic might eventually do so, but the\noffsetting effect is the increase in resources needed to manage remote workers.23\n\nHuman capital\nHuman capital and technology are linked. For technology to enhance productivity, workers need to have\nthe abilities and knowledge to apply it. So, technological change can spur increased investments in\nhuman capital. The reverse is true, too. The availability of a more highly skilled workforce can induce\nhigher investment in innovation and new technology, since firms know they will be able to hire workers\nwith the requisite skills to use it.\n\nMany studies have documented the importance of investment in human capital to a nation’s economic\ngrowth and well-being. Individuals benefit as well, since higher levels of education are correlated with\n\n22\n\nEichengreen (2015) distinguishes between two dimensions of technology: the range of applicability and the range\nof adaptation. A technology that has only a limited range of applicability won’t have a large effect on productivity\nand growth because it is used only in a narrow range of sectors or activities. A technology that requires a large\nrange of adaptation of other processes in the economy will take longer to have a positive effect on productivity and\ngrowth.\n23\n\nSee Fernald, Inklaar, and Ruzic, 2023.\n\n\f8\nhigher wages – a skill premium – and lower unemployment rates.24 Cleveland Fed economists\ninvestigated the overall increase in U.S. wage inequality in the last 30 years and found not only that\ndifferences in educational attainment are a key driver of wage inequality, but that education has become\nfundamental to boosting worker productivity.25\n\nTechnological change is not only driving a rising skill premium but also shifting the distribution of jobs.\nComputers are less suited to replacing workers in occupations that require abstract thinking, high levels of\ncognition, and higher levels of education or workers in non-routine manual types of work. But computers\ncan replace medium-skill jobs that involve routine non-physical work.26 This shift in the distribution of\njobs helps to explain the rising gap in wages for highly skilled vs. low-skill workers, and the increasing\nreturn to gaining the education needed to acquire those skills. The adoption of artificial intelligence apps\nmay speed up these distributional changes.\n\nDespite the benefits of education, the U.S. is likely under-investing in it. Educational attainment levels,\nwhich had been rising over successive generations in the first half of the twentieth century, have now\nflattened out for recent cohorts.27 The U.S. is lagging behind other advanced economies in terms of\neducational achievements and skill levels. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment’s (OECD) latest available survey assessing adult skills indicates that the U.S. ranks 15th in\nterms of literacy and 24th in terms of numeracy among the 32 OECD countries that participated in the\nassessment of these skills, and 15th in terms of problem-solving out of the 29 OECD countries that\n\n24\n\nSee Mester (2021).\n\n25\n\nSee Pinheiro and Tasci (2019).\n\n26\n\nSee Acemoglu and Restrepo (2022) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011).\n\n27\n\nSee Goldin and Katz (2007).\n\n\f9\nparticipated in that part of the assessment.28 You may be interested in the comparable rankings for\nIreland. Ireland ranks 22nd in terms of literacy and 23rd in terms of both numeracy and problem-solving.\nIn a different OECD survey of the skills of 15-year-olds, the U.S. ranked 9th out of 36 OECD countries in\nreading, 31st out of 37 OECD countries in math, and 13th out of 37 OECD countries in science. Irish\nstudents did considerably better in terms of reading and math, ranking 4th in terms of reading and 15th in\nterms of math; Irish students ranked 17th in terms of science.29 The pandemic has also had significant\nnegative effects on the math and reading achievement scores of elementary school students in the U.S.30\n\nThese results are troubling given the higher skills that will be needed to drive innovation and productivity\ngrowth, and they suggest that investments in making high-quality education and training available at all\nage levels would reap important benefits for the longer-run health of the economy and increased living\nstandards.\n\nLonger-Run Trends and Their Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Policy\nLet me now turn to some implications of longer-run trends for monetary policy and financial stability\npolicy.\n\nMonetary policy implications\nMonetary policy cannot directly affect the long-run growth rate of the economy, but it can contribute to\nthe economy’s ability to reach that potential growth rate by achieving and maintaining price stability.\n\nA sharp rise in inflation in the U.S. began in the spring of 2021, reflecting both demand and supply\n\n28\n\nThe survey was conducted in three rounds: 2011-2012, 2014-2015, and 2017-2018. See the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development’s PIAAC and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(2019).\n29\n\nThe latest results from this triennial survey are from 2018. See the OECD’s PISA.\n\n30\n\nSee Kuhfeld, Soland, and Lewis (2022).\n\n\f10\nfactors. In the wake of high and persistent inflation, the FOMC began raising the target range of its\npolicy rate, the federal funds rate, in March of last year. Including the 25-basis-point increase made two\nweeks ago, the cumulative increase in the fed funds rate is 5 percentage points in a little over a year. In\naddition, the Fed has been allowing assets to run off its balance sheet in a systematic way according to the\nplan announced last May, and this is also helping to firm the stance of monetary policy. The Fed is\ncommitted to returning inflation to its 2 percent goal. We all know that high inflation makes it very hard\nfor people to make ends meet. It is a particularly onerous burden for people and businesses with fewer\nresources.\n\nBut high inflation also has long-run costs. High inflation diverts the attention of households and\nbusinesses from productive activities to having to protect the purchasing power of their money, and it\ninterferes with their ability to make long-term plans and commitments because of uncertainty about the\nvalue of their money. High inflation distorts the decisions individuals make about getting an education or\ntraining for a new job and the decisions firms make about investing in R&D or plants and equipment. As\nI just discussed, these investments in human and physical capital determine the pace of innovation in our\neconomy, productivity growth, and the potential growth rate, and our longer-run standard of living.\nWhile these longer-run impacts of high inflation are not always discussed, they underscore the imperative\nof getting the economy back to price stability in a timely way.\n\nMonetary policy also needs to consider longer-run trends in the economy because these trends affect the\ngeneral level of interest rates consistent with stable prices and maximum employment. In economic\nmodels, the longer-term equilibrium interest rate is determined by the long-run growth rate of\nconsumption and, therefore, output. In the near term, the equilibrium interest rate can fluctuate around its\nlonger-run trend, and this equilibrium interest rate is an important benchmark for monetary policymakers\nin assessing the stance of monetary policy.\n\n\f11\nFor advanced economies, empirical estimates of the longer-run equilibrium real policy rate, so-called rstar, while highly uncertain, have been declining for more than two decades.31 This decline reflects\nseveral factors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity\ngrowth. In the aftermath of the pandemic, estimates of the short-run equilibrium interest rate rose.\nWhether the equilibrium rate will revert to the low level we saw prior to the pandemic remains an open\nquestion, but some current estimates suggest that it will.32 If trend productivity growth were to pick up, it\nwould have a positive effect on the long-run equilibrium interest rate, all else equal. Higher productivity\ngrowth would increase the potential return on new investment, and raise firms’ demand for capital,\nthereby raising the equilibrium interest rate. But demographic forces could offset that. Static analysis\nsuggests that as longevity increases, people want to accumulate more assets to fund their retirements,\nputting upward pressure on asset prices and, therefore, downward pressure on returns. Moreover, because\npeople prefer to reduce their exposure to risk as they age, we could see a shift toward assets with fixed\nreturns, putting upward pressure on risk premia and downward pressure on risk-free rates.33 One\ncountervailing effect is that older people tend to save less because once people reach retirement age, they\nneed to draw down their savings and perhaps sell assets to fund their retirement. This dissaving puts\nupward pressure on interest rates.34\n\nAnother factor that could put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer run is fiscal financing.\nThe rising share of older people will put significant pressure on Social Security and Medicare in the U.S.,\nwhich are structured as pay-as-you-go programs, with current workers providing support for current\n\n31\n\nSee Mester (2020).\n\n32\n\nSee Bailey (2022).\n\n33\n\nBernanke (2005) discusses how a global savings glut could push down longer-term interest rates.\n\n34\n\nThe simulation results in Fehr, Jokisch, and Kotlikoff (2008) show an increase in interest rates along the baseline\npath of demographic change projected for the U.S., the European Union, and Japan. Goodhart and Pradhan (2017)\nargue that demographic change will lead to increases in the equilibrium interest rate. Bailey (2022) discusses\nsimulation results for the U.K. economy in which the demographic trends exert their influence mainly through\nincreased longevity, with relatively higher wealth accumulated by older people putting downward pressure on the\nequilibrium interest rate.\n\n\f12\nretirees. According to CBO projections, under current policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will\nmore than double over the next 30 years, from almost 4 percent in 2022 to about 11 percent in 2052.35\nFederal debt held by the public as a percent of GDP rises dramatically in the CBO estimates, from 98\npercent in 2022 to 185 percent in 2052, well above its historical high of 106 percent during World War II.\nRising debt-to-GDP levels would raise the general level of interest rates, potentially crowd-out productive\ninvestments, and lower economic growth. It would also mean that countercyclical fiscal policy would be\nconstrained, increasing business cycle volatility. These projected longer-run fiscal imbalances are\nunlikely to be sustainable and will need to be addressed by some combination of policies to increase\nrevenues and reduce costs. Policies that increase the growth and productivity of the workforce and that\nencourage R&D, innovation, and investment would help address fiscal imbalances and also partly offset\nthe downward pressure on longer-run growth from demographics or other sources.\n\nFinancial stability policy implications\nLonger-run trends also need to be considered in policies aimed at ensuring the stability of our financial\nsystem. Technological change and innovation are apparent in the financial services industry, with the\nrapid digitalization that is occurring and the entry of fintech and big data firms. Digitalization holds the\npromise of increasing the efficiency, productivity, and inclusiveness of the financial sector, thereby\nincreasing the economic welfare of households and businesses. But these digital tools need to be welldesigned so that they do not have unintended effects and customers need to have sufficient financial\nliteracy to be able to assess their value.\n\nThe changing landscape will require a rethinking of the regulatory framework to ensure that the financial\ninnovations led by digitalization are a net positive. Such innovations do not reduce the need for risk\nmanagement, financial regulation and supervision, and good governance, although the form each takes is\n\n35\n\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2022).\n\n\f13\nlikely to be different than what has been effective in the past. Existing regulatory and supervisory\nstructures will need to adapt to keep up with the new ways that financial services are being delivered and\nthe new players delivering them. Under the principle “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s\na duck,” a regulatory approach that shifts the focus from the type of institution offering the service to the\ntype of activity would likely be more effective in fostering the stability of the financial system by\nimproving our ability to monitor risks in the nonbank financial sector and limiting regulatory arbitrage.\n\nWith the entry of big data and fintech firms into the financial services field, the public policy approach\nwill need to change to include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data\nprivacy regulation. To ensure that the benefits of technological innovation are captured and the risks\nmanaged will require not only cooperation across these types of regulators within each country, but also\neffective international coordination among regulators and supervisors through the Financial Stability\nBoard and other international entities.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, current trends point to slow long-run growth for the U.S. economy. But steps can be taken\nto address some of the factors underlying these trends in order to improve the economic health of\nindividuals and communities and to maintain and enhance our future standard of living. Government\npolicies, if they are well-designed and focused on spurring productive investments in human and physical\ncapital, R&D, and innovation, can lead to higher productivity growth and higher longer-run growth.\nEnsuring a resilient financial system, through appropriate regulation and supervision that keeps up with\nchanges in technology, is also an essential part of a healthy economy. While monetary policy cannot\naffect the economy’s long-term growth rate, it can do its part by returning the economy to price stability,\nwhich is necessary for the longer-run health of labor markets, the financial system, and the overall\neconomy.\n\n\f14\nReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, and David Autor, “Skills, Tasks, and Technologies: Implications for Employment and\nEarnings,” in Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 4B, David Card and Orley Ashenfelter, eds.,\nAmsterdam: Elsevier-North Holland, 2011, pp. 1043-1171.\n(https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-7218(11)02410-5)\nAcemoglu, Daron, and Pascual Restrepo, “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality,”\nEconometrica 90 (September 2022), pp. 1973-2016.\n(https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA19815)\nBailey, Andrew, “The Economic Landscape: Structural Change, Global R*, and the Missing-Investment\nPuzzle,” speech at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, London, U.K., July 12, 2022.\n(https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2022/july/andrew-bailey-speech-at-omfif-the-economiclandscape)\nBernanke, Ben S. “The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit,” remarks at the\nSandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, Virginia, March 10, 2005.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/)\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO), “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2023 to 2033,” February 15,\n2023.

        "content": "Progress and Prudence:\nAn Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Akron Roundtable Signature Series\nAkron, OH\nApril 20, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Akron Roundtable for inviting me to speak in the Signature Series today about the economy\nand monetary policy. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Akron Roundtable’s work to foster community dialog aligns very well with the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland’s own efforts to engage with the public. I like that word “dialog.” At the Cleveland\nFed we strive to provide our communities with useful research, data, and analysis. For example, our\nCenter for Inflation Research provides various resources to policymakers, researchers, and the general\npublic on inflation and its drivers.1 And in return, we receive economic reconnaissance from a wide\nvariety of contacts from throughout our region. I firmly believe that the Fed’s engagement with the\npublic leads us to make better policy decisions. I also believe that the structure of the Federal Reserve\nSystem supports that engagement. So before turning to the outlook, I will give a brief overview of the\nFed’s structure.\n\nThe Structure of the Federal Reserve System\nCongress established the Fed in 1913 after a period of financial instability as an institution to promote the\nhealth of the U.S. economy and the financial system. Congress designed the Fed to operate in the public\ninterest as a decentralized central bank: the Fed is independent within the government but not independent\nfrom the government. At the time, there were concerns that the central bank would become dominated by\nfinancial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. So the Fed was designed to include\nrepresentation from across the country and to balance public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall\nStreet and Main Street concerns.\n\nFor more information, see the web pages of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research\nat https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C. that oversees those Banks. The governors are appointed by the president of the United\nStates and confirmed by the Senate.2\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks are distributed around the country in locations that were the centers of economic\nactivity back when the Fed was established. Each Reserve Bank has a board of directors whose nine\nmembers are chosen in a nonpolitical process, with three representing banks and six representing\nbusiness, agricultural, industrial, and public interests in the Districts they serve. One important\nresponsibility of the nonbank directors on a Reserve Bank’s board is selecting the Bank’s president, who\nis subject to approval by the Fed’s Board of Governors. Some Reserve Banks also have Branches with\nfive- to seven-member boards. The Cleveland Fed represents the Fed’s Fourth District and includes the\nstate of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia; we have Branches in Cincinnati\nand Pittsburgh. In addition, we have a number of advisory councils that draw their membership from\nvarious sectors and geographies in our District.3\n\nThis regional structure of the Fed has served the country well for more than 100 years. The U.S. is very\ndiverse, encompassing large cities, small towns and communities, and rural areas, with a mix of different\nindustries and occupations, and some places more prosperous than others. The Fed’s structure helps to\nensure that a variety of information from all sectors of the economy and all parts of the country is taken\n\n2\n\nGovernors serve staggered terms of up to 14 years. These terms span several terms of the president and members\nof Congress, a structure that is intended to insulate the governors from short-term political influence and which\nallows them to take a longer-run perspective when setting monetary and financial regulatory policy. The chair and\nvice chair of the Board of Governors, and the governor who serves as vice chair of supervision, are chosen by the\npresident and confirmed by the Senate from among the sitting governors for four-year terms. The chair and vice\nchairs can be reappointed until their terms as governors expire.\n3\n\nMore information about the Cleveland Fed’s board of directors and advisory councils is available on our web site\nat https://www.clevelandfed.org/about-us/directors and https://www.clevelandfed.org/about-us/advisory-councils,\nrespectively.\n\n\f3\ninto account in our monetary policy decisions.4 The Cleveland Fed is continuously gathering information\nfrom a diverse group of business, consumer, community, and labor contacts throughout our District. This\ninformation helps me to formulate my views on the regional and national economies and monetary policy,\nand I bring this information to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is\nthe body within the Fed that is responsible for setting monetary policy.5 Other Reserve Bank presidents\nare doing the same thing. So the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a mosaic of economic\ninformation and analysis from all parts of the country. And this regional information, along with\neconomic and financial data and analysis, informs the FOMC’s setting of national monetary policy in\npursuit of its statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.6\n\nThe Economic Journey So Far\nSo, what does the economic information we have been gathering tell us about the economy and what are\nthe implications for monetary policy? I titled my remarks today “Progress and Prudence.” It may sound\nlike the title of a Jane Austen novel, but I think it is a good characterization of where we are and what will\nbe needed to ensure that the economy returns to price stability. To see the progress, it will help to briefly\nreview how the economy got to where it is today.\n\n4\n\nThe regional structure also allows the Fed to carry out its other responsibilities including supervising and\nregulating certain banks, promoting the stability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the\nnation’s payments system, providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, and promoting economic\nprogress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and the people who live there.\n5\n\nThe FOMC holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year in Washington, D.C. The FOMC was established by\nthe Banking Act of 1935 and has 12 members: the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the\nNew York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. As president of the\nCleveland Fed, I vote every other year, rotating my vote with that of the president of the Chicago Fed. Other than\nNew York, Cleveland, and Chicago, the other presidents vote every third year. All presidents, whether voting or\nnonvoting, participate in FOMC meetings.\nThe Federal Reserve Act says that the Fed should conduct monetary policy to “promote effectively the goals of\nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” When prices are stable and the\neconomy is at maximum employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels, so it is often said that\nCongress has given the Fed a dual mandate.\n6\n\n\f4\nAt the start of 2020, before the pandemic, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. It was the 11th\nyear of the expansion, and things looked quite good from the perspective of our monetary policy goals.\nThe unemployment rate was at historically low levels, employment growth was strong, participation in\nthe labor force was solid, and inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nThe pandemic changed all of that. The economy shut down in March 2020. Fiscal and monetary\npolicymakers took aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit\ncontinued to flow, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. When public health statistics began to\nimprove in May 2020, many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions,\nand the economy began to reopen. As the reopening progressed, it became clear that shutting down an\neconomy can happen much more swiftly than reopening one. Spending patterns had changed, people had\nleft the workforce, and supply chains were disrupted. And these forces are still having an effect on the\neconomy today.\n\nThe economy expanded rapidly in 2021 as demand rebounded. But that strong demand confronted very\nconstrained supply in both product and labor markets. The imbalances in demand and supply led to\nsignificant upward pressures on prices in an environment of very accommodative monetary and fiscal\npolicy. A sharp rise in inflation began in the spring of 2021. Russia’s war against Ukraine, which began\nin February of last year, led to sizable increases in food and commodity prices, also contributing to rising\ninflation.\n\nHigh inflation makes it harder for people to make ends meet, and it also imposes longer-run costs on our\neconomy by affecting the decisions people make about getting an education or training for a new job, and\nthe decisions businesses make about undertaking R&D or investing in new plants and equipment. These\ntypes of investments in human and physical capital help determine our economy’s pace of innovation and\nproductivity growth and its potential growth rate, and so our longer-run standard of living.\n\n\f5\n\nThe Fed is responsible for ensuring price stability. So in March of last year in the wake of high and\nstubborn inflation, the Fed began significantly increasing its policy rate, the fed funds rate. The rate has\nmoved up a cumulative 4-3/4 percentage points and the target range of the funds rate is now 4-3/4 to 5\npercent. The Fed has also been allowing assets to run off its balance sheet in a systematic way according\nto the plan announced last May, which is also helping to firm the stance of monetary policy. These\nmonetary policy actions aim to tighten financial conditions to moderate demand, which will help to\nreduce price pressures and bring inflation down.\n\nProgress Is Being Made\nThe good news is that progress is being made. Underlying demand remains resilient but economic\nactivity has begun to slow. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a\nvery robust pace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021. The slowdown in activity is seen most clearly in the\nhousing sector, which is quite sensitive to interest rates, but also in manufacturing and business\ninvestment. Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, has been supported by strong\nhousehold balance sheets and income growth, but it too is moderating. On the supply side of the\neconomy, disruptions in supply chains have generally improved. Our contacts report that bottlenecks\nhave eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have shortened. This is welcome news because\nprice pressures can be alleviated both through further moderation in demand and further improvement in\nsupply.\n\nProgress is also being made in rebalancing the labor market. Overall labor market conditions remain\nstrong. Payroll job gains averaged 345 thousand per month over the first three months of this year, a\npickup from the average monthly gain in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment rate remains\na very low 3-1/2 percent, near where it has been for much of the past year. These tight labor market\nconditions have made it challenging for businesses to attract and retain all the workers they need to meet\n\n\f6\ndemand for their products and services. But we are beginning to see some moderation. Employment\ngrowth has slowed over the past year and firms report that it is somewhat easier to find workers now. In\naddition, the rate at which people are quitting their jobs is moving down, which is usually a sign of a\nmoderating labor market. On the supply side, there have been gains in prime-age labor force\nparticipation. So progress is beginning to be made in rebalancing labor demand and supply. As this\ncontinues, it should ease wage pressures, which have contributed to high inflation.\n\nTurning to inflation, the good news is that progress is being made here as well. In February, the yearover-year measures of both total PCE inflation and core PCE inflation were in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent\nrange. They had peaked last year in the 5-1/4 to 7 percent range. Similarly, CPI inflation is also down.\nMeasured year-over-year, CPI inflation was 5 percent in March, down sharply from its peak of 9 percent\nlast summer. Core CPI inflation is now about 5-1/2 percent, down about 1 percentage point from its peak.\n\nDespite this progress, inflation is still too high. And it is proving to be stubborn. Some measures of\nunderlying inflation, such as the median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, have shown little\nimprovement since their peaks.7 The disaggregated data show that the stubbornness is due mainly to the\nprices of services. Inflation in core PCE services excluding shelter has not improved. It tends to be\nsticky, is correlated with wage inflation, and is a much larger share of the overall index than goods or\nhousing, since consumers spend a larger share of their income on these services.\n\n7\n\nMedian and trimmed-mean inflation measures exclude components with the most extreme movements each month.\nMeasured year-over-year, as of February, the median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation measures are still between\n4-1/2 and 6 percent, and as of March, the median CPI measure is around 7 percent. These rates are all about where\nthey were at their recent peaks. As of March, the trimmed-mean CPI measure is now slightly above 6 percent, down\nabout 1 percentage point from its peak. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmedmean CPI inflation rate and the median PCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the\ntrimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. See more data and information about inflation on the web pages of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research at https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/centerfor-inflation-research.aspx.\n\n\f7\nMonetary Policy and the Outlook\nSo, what are the implications for monetary policy? We have moved interest rates up significantly over\nthe past year and it is yielding progress. Yet demand is still outpacing supply in both product and labor\nmarkets and inflation remains too high. In order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2\npercent, I anticipate that monetary policy will need to move somewhat further into restrictive territory this\nyear, with the fed funds rate moving above 5 percent and the real fed funds rate staying in positive\nterritory for some time. Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and\nfor how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on economic and financial developments.\n\nWith tighter financial conditions, I expect that demand in product and labor markets will continue to\nmoderate and inflation will continue to move down. Output growth will likely be well below trend this\nyear and pick up a bit next year. I expect that employment growth will continue to slow and the\nunemployment rate, which is very low, will begin to rise, to about 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent by the end of the\nyear. I expect to see meaningful improvement in inflation this year, with inflation moving down to about\n3-3/4 percent this year, continuing to improve next year, and reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025.\n\nThe Economy in Ohio\nIn Ohio, I expect to see similar trends. Ohio is the seventh largest economy in the nation in terms of real\ngross state product. The path of a regional economy reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the\nshocks that hit the broader U.S. economy. Manufacturing and, within manufacturing, auto and auto parts\nstill constitute an important sector of Ohio’s economy. Compared to the nation, manufacturing represents\na larger share of payroll jobs in Ohio, but that differential has fallen over time.8 Ohio’s economy has\nbeen transitioning from one that is largely dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one that is\n\n8\n\nOver the past decade (2013Q1 through 2022Q4), the share of jobs in manufacturing was 8.6 percent for the U.S.\nand 12.5 percent for Ohio. In the 1990s (1990Q1 through 1999Q4), the share of jobs in manufacturing was 14.8\npercent for the U.S. and 19.9 percent for Ohio.\n\n\f8\ndiversifying into health care and education. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 20 percent of\nOhio’s jobs and “eds and meds” represented about 12 percent. Those shares have now nearly reversed.\nIn the past decade, the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen to under 13 percent and the share in “eds\nand meds” has risen to nearly 17 percent. Regions that have diversified their industrial base have\ngenerally fared better over time. And in general, since the pandemic, the economy in Ohio has performed\nsimilarly to the national economy. Employers have struggled to find workers throughout the postpandemic expansion, and since workforce growth tends to be slower in Ohio than in the nation because of\nslower population growth, it has been a quite challenging period for our employers. Rising inflation has\nalso plagued businesses and households here, too. But as is true in the nation, progress is being made.\nEmployers tell us they are finding it a bit easier to hire and retain workers now and their input costs are\nbeginning to moderate.\n\nPrudence\nOf course, I think we all recognize that there is heightened uncertainty around the economic outlook. We\nhave come a long way in tightening monetary policy, and some of those effects are yet to be felt in the\neconomy. In such an environment a policymaker has to be very prudent in collecting and assessing the\nwhole panoply of incoming information, not only official government statistics but also regional\ninformation gathered from our business, labor market, and community contacts; a variety of surveys on\neconomic and banking conditions; and higher-frequency data such as credit card spending. All of this\ninformation helps to determine not only where the economy has been but also where it is going, which is\nimportant since monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. As we gather and assess this\ninformation, I am prepared to change my views on the economy and appropriate monetary policy as\nchanges in conditions warrant.\n\nOne of the developments I will be particularly looking at is lending conditions. The U.S. banking system\nis sound and resilient. But in March, stresses emerged in a small number of banks, and Silicon Valley\n\n\f9\nBank and Signature Bank failed. The Fed, the Treasury, and the FDIC took swift action to ensure that\nthese stresses did not spill over to the rest of the U.S. banking and financial system.9 Had such contagion\noccurred, it could have undermined the public’s confidence in healthy banks and prevented them from\ndoing their important work to support the savings and credit needs of households and businesses. Banks\nnow have access to liquidity through a new Fed lending facility, as well as the traditional discount\nwindow, where they can borrow against sound collateral to ensure that they have sufficient liquidity to\nserve their customers.10 The stresses experienced in the banking system in March have eased, but the Fed\nis prepared to take further steps as necessary to ensure financial stability. In addition, Chair Powell has\ndirected the Federal Reserve Board’s vice chair of supervision, Michael Barr, to conduct an internal\nreview and to report by May 1 on Silicon Valley Bank’s failure, including the Federal Reserve’s\nsupervision and regulation of the bank.\n\nEven before the recent stresses, as interest rates moved up, banks had begun to tighten their credit\nstandards, making credit less available. This is the typical way in which monetary policy tightening\ntransmits to the broader economy. The recent tensions in the banking system could well result in banks\ntightening their credit standards even more, which could result in slower spending by households and\nbusinesses and a pullback in hiring. This would work in the same direction as tighter monetary policy.\nSo we will need to continue to assess the magnitude and duration of these effects on credit conditions to\nhelp us calibrate the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward. This is the prudent thing to do.\n\nSee the “Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC,” March 12, 2023.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm)\n9\n\n10\n\nMore information on the Bank Term Funding Program is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bank-term-funding-program.htm. More information on the discount\nwindow is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discountrate.htm.\n\n\f10\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, there has been significant tightening of monetary policy over the last year, and as a result,\nwelcome progress is being made in bringing demand into better balance with supply in product and labor\nmarkets and reducing inflation. This is good news. But inflation remains too high.\n\nGiven that some of the increases in rates and tightening in financial conditions have yet to be felt in the\neconomy, we need to be prudent in assessing all of the incoming economic and financial information\nwhen determining the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward. We are much closer to the end\nof the tightening journey than the beginning, and how much further tightening is needed will depend on\neconomic and financial developments and progress on our monetary policy goals.\n\nThat said, price stability is critical for the long-run health of the labor market, the overall economy, and\nthe stability of the financial system. So it would be a mistake to declare victory before the job is done.\nHere, I am reminded of the words of former Fed Chair Paul Volcker when he fought inflation in the\n1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation will only make any subsequent effort\nmore difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”11\n\nPaul A Volcker, “No Time for Backsliding,” remarks at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C., September\n25, 1981, p. 2.\n(https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/statements-speeches-paul-a-volcker-451/time-backsliding-8243)\n11\n\n\f"

        "content": "A Diligent and Judicious Return to Price Stability\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMoney Marketeers of New York University, Inc.\nNew York, NY\nApril 4, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to speak this evening. I look\nforward to hearing what is on your minds, but first, I would like to present some prepared remarks on the\neconomy and monetary policy. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nAt its meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. Since the Fed began raising rates in March of last year, the cumulative\nincrease has been 475 basis points. In addition, the Fed has been allowing assets to run off its balance\nsheet in a systematic way according to the plan announced last May, and this is also helping to firm the\nstance of monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed has taken these monetary policy actions because inflation is too high and it is eroding U.S. living\nstandards. High inflation makes it hard for people to make ends meet. High inflation also imposes\nlonger-run costs on our economy. It distorts the decisions households and businesses make about getting\nan education or training for a new job, or investing in R&D or plants and equipment. In this way, high\ninflation can harm the pace of innovation, productivity growth, and the potential growth rate of the\neconomy. So it can have lasting detrimental effects on the economy.\n\nThe Fed is responsible for ensuring price stability. Fed policymakers are committed to bringing inflation\nback to our 2 percent goal. Given where we are on that journey, I plan to remain diligent in setting\nmonetary policy to return the economy to price stability in a timely way and to be judicious in balancing\nthe risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nThe U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. But during the two weeks leading up to the March\nFOMC meeting, stresses emerged in a small number of banks. The Fed, the Treasury, and the FDIC took\n\n\f2\nswift action to ensure that these stresses did not spill over to the rest of the U.S. banking and financial\nsystem. Had such contagion occurred it could have undermined the public’s confidence in healthy banks\nand prevented them from doing their important work to support the savings and credit needs of\nhouseholds and businesses. Banks now have access to liquidity through a new Fed lending facility, as\nwell as the traditional discount window, where they can borrow against sound collateral to ensure that\nthey have sufficient liquidity to serve their customers. The stresses experienced in the banking system in\nMarch have eased, but the Fed continues to carefully monitor conditions and is prepared to take further\nsteps as necessary to ensure financial stability.\n\nIn the past, when tensions like this have arisen in banking and financial markets, banks have tended to\ntighten credit availability, making it harder for households and businesses to borrow. In addition, if\nhouseholds and businesses become concerned about the outlook for the banking sector or the overall\neconomy, they could become more cautious in their spending. Going forward, Fed policymakers will\ncontinue to assess the magnitude and duration of these effects and their implications for the outlook for\ninflation and employment and, therefore, for appropriate monetary policy.\n\nEconomic Growth\nIncoming economic information over the first part of the year has pointed to resilience in underlying\ndemand in product and labor markets and persistence in inflation. Partly in response to higher interest\nrates, tighter lending standards at banks, and tighter overall financial conditions, economic activity has\nbegun to slow. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust\npace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021. Growth in the final quarter of last year was over 2-1/2 percent, but\nmuch of that was due to firms rebuilding inventories. Inventories aside, growth in real final sales was\nmore modest, just over 1 percent. The slowdown in activity is seen most clearly in the housing sector.\nResidential investment continues to decline sharply in response to higher mortgage rates, but real estate\nagents and homebuilders have told us that demand has begun to stabilize. There is still a longer-run\n\n\f3\nstructural shortage of available housing, which suggests less downward pressure on prices than one might\nexpect given the rise in interest rates. Construction contacts also indicated that they expect public-sector\nspending and future infrastructure spending to support activity.\n\nBusiness fixed investment in equipment and manufacturing activity have slowed, but a few of our\nbusiness contacts have said that they thought investment has been more resilient than expected given\nhigher interest rates. Indicators suggest that consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP,\ngrew at a relatively strong pace in the first quarter. This spending has been supported by strong\nhousehold balance sheets and income growth. Debt-to-income levels of households have been fairly\nstable, and, in the aggregate, households have been able to service their debt in the rising interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, disruptions in supply chains have generally improved, although not\nuniformly. Contacts report that bottlenecks have eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have\nshortened. This is welcome news because price pressures can be alleviated both through further\nmoderation in demand and further improvement in supply.\n\nLabor Markets\nEmployment growth has slowed over the past year, firms report that it is somewhat easier to find workers\nnow, and the rate at which people are quitting their jobs is moving down, which is usually is a sign of a\nmoderating labor market. Nonetheless, overall labor market conditions remain strong, with demand for\nworkers outpacing supply. Payroll job gains averaged over 400 thousand per month in January and\nFebruary, a pickup from the average monthly gain in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment\nrate remains a very low 3.6 percent, near where it has been for much of the past year. The number of job\nopenings has varied from month to month. They are down from their level a year ago, but the ratio of\n\n\f4\nopenings per unemployed worker has been running between 1.7 to 1.9 over the six months that ended in\nFebruary, compared with 1.2 in the six months before the pandemic started.\n\nRecent gains in prime-age labor force participation may be helping to ease the imbalance between labor\ndemand and supply. But this imbalance has put upward pressure on wages, and because labor costs\nconstitute a significant share of a business’s expenses, especially in the service sector, this imbalance has\nalso contributed to high inflation. Since workers’ wage gains generally have not kept up with inflation,\nmany workers are not better off in real terms. By some measures, wage pressures are beginning to ease,\nbut wages are still growing at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 to 5 percent. This is well above the level\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation given current estimates of trend productivity growth. Indeed, for wage\ngrowth at this pace to be consistent with price stability, trend productivity growth would need to be 2-1/2\nto 3 percent, instead of the current estimates of 1 to 1-1/2 percent. We have not seen any evidence that\ntrend productivity growth is rising; in fact, productivity growth has declined over the past year. So,\nworkers are still falling behind in their purchasing power and will continue to do so until we get the\neconomy on a sustained path back to price stability.\n\nInflation\nSeveral factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation that began in the spring of 2021 in the U.S. These\nfactors include the pandemic and how households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers\nresponded to it, and Russia’s war against Ukraine, which led to sharp increases in food and commodity\nprices. Imbalances arose between strong demand and constrained supply, and these led to significant\nupward pressures on prices in an environment of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nInflation remains too high and too stubborn. The February PCE inflation data showed some\nimprovement, but recall that, in January, the data were a bit stronger than analysts expected. So while the\nlevel of inflation is lower than it was last summer, in February, the year-over-year measures of both total\n\n\f5\nPCE inflation and core PCE inflation were in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent range, which is well above our 2\npercent goal. The story is the same with other measures of underlying inflation, such as the median and\ntrimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each\nmonth. Measured year-over-year, both of these measures are between 4-1/2 and 6 percent and have\nshown little to no improvement since their peaks last August.1\n\nThe disaggregated data show that the inflation stubbornness is due mainly to the prices of services.\nGoods inflation has been moving down over time, although it remains considerably above where it was\nbefore the pandemic. Shelter price inflation has not improved but the slowdown in housing activity and\nthe deceleration in rents in new leases will eventually show up in the inflation statistics. Inflation in core\nservices excluding shelter has not improved either. It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage inflation,\nand is a much larger share of the overall index than goods or housing, since consumers spend a larger\nshare of their income on these services.\n\nFor much of the pre-pandemic expansion, core goods inflation was slightly negative, on average, and\nfalling goods prices were pulling inflation down. By the end of that expansion, inflation was nearing our\ntarget. In January 2020, PCE inflation had reached 1.8 percent and core inflation had risen to 1.7 percent.\nThat reading reflected 0.75 percent deflation in core goods prices and 2.5 percent inflation in core\nservices prices. That is very different from today. Since the current period of high inflation started in the\nspring of 2021, core goods prices have been rising, and through last September, inflation in core goods\nexceeded inflation in core services. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation, we will need to\nsee continued sustained disinflation in both components.\n\n1\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx).\n\n\f6\n\nMy expectation is that with tighter financial conditions, demand in product and labor markets will\ncontinue to moderate. Output growth will likely be well below trend this year and pick up a bit next year.\nEmployment growth will slow, with the unemployment rate rising to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent by the end of\nthe year. So far, high inflation has not unanchored medium- and longer-term inflation expectations,\nwhich remain at levels reasonably consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The continued anchoring\nof inflation expectations is an important factor underpinning my outlook that we will see a meaningful\nimprovement in inflation this year, with inflation moving down to about 3-3/4 percent this year,\ncontinuing to improve next year, and reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. In my modal projection, to put\ninflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent and to keep inflation expectations anchored,\nmonetary policy moves somewhat further into restrictive territory this year, with the fed funds rate\nmoving above 5 percent and the real fed funds rate staying in positive territory for some time.\n\nMy forecast is similar to the modal forecasts of FOMC participants released two weeks ago, although I\nsee somewhat more persistent inflation pressures than the median forecast among participants. Of course,\nI also recognize that there is heightened uncertainty around the outlook and, in such an environment, it\nwill be particularly important to continue to collect and assess the whole panoply of incoming\ninformation, not only official government statistics but also regional information gathered from our\nbusiness, labor market, and community contacts; a variety of surveys on economic and banking\nconditions; and higher-frequency data such as credit card spending. All of this information can help us\ndetermine not only where the economy has been but where it is going, which is important when setting\nappropriate monetary policy since it affects the economy with a lag. The FOMC likes to say that its\npolicy decisions are “data dependent.” It would be wrong to interpret this phrase as saying that we will\nreact to one or two data points. Instead, I view “data dependent” as shorthand for saying that incoming\neconomic information informs my economic outlook and my assessment of risks, which, in turn, inform\nmy view of appropriate monetary policy. (You can see why we needed shorthand!)\n\n\f7\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has come an\nappreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one. We have taken\nactions to address the stresses that emerged last month in the banking system. Our decision in March to\nraise the fed funds rate by another 25 basis points reflected the persistence in underlying inflation and the\nneed to move policy into a sufficiently restrictive stance to return inflation to 2 percent over time.\n\nPrecisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and for how long policy will\nneed to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down,\nand that will depend on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being resolved, and price\npressures are easing. The FOMC indicated in its March statement that it anticipates that some additional\npolicy firming may be appropriate. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the\nFOMC will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary\npolicy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\n\nEven before the recent stresses, banks had begun to tighten their credit standards. Credit has become less\navailable as interest rates have risen. This is the typical way in which monetary policy tightening\ntransmits to the broader economy. The recent tensions in the banking system could well result in banks\nfurther tightening their credit standards, and households and businesses may become more cautious in\ntheir spending. Directionally, we know that credit conditions are likely going to be somewhat tighter, and\nwe will be assessing the magnitude and duration of these effects on the economic outlook to help us\ncalibrate the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward.\n\n\f8\nFinancial Stability\nLet me conclude by noting that this is standard operating procedure for monetary policy: evaluating the\nimplications of economic and financial developments for the economic outlook and adjusting the\nmonetary policy path if needed. This is different from using monetary policy to address the stresses in the\nbanking or financial system instead of pursuing our monetary policy goals.\n\nIn fact, both price stability and financial stability are important for a healthy economy, and I do not see a\ntradeoff between the two. Well-formulated and well-communicated monetary policy that achieves our\ndual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability supports financial stability by allowing\nhouseholds, firms, and financial institutions to make better investment, saving, borrowing, and lending\ndecisions. A healthy financial system provides valuable credit, risk-management, payment, and liquidity\nservices to households and businesses in support of a sound economy. An unstable financial system can\npropagate adverse macroeconomic shocks over broad economic sectors and over time to the detriment of\nmacroeconomic stability.\n\nBecause a safe, sound, and resilient banking system is of first-order importance to our economy, it is vital\nthat we effectively use our microprudential tools of regulation and supervision and our macroprudential\ntools, including stress tests, to keep the banking system safe, sound, and resilient. Doing so has the\nbenefit of allowing monetary policy to remain focused on bringing inflation back down to 2 percent in a\ntimely way. This is a very important duty because returning to price stability is necessary for the long-run\nhealth of the labor market, the overall economy, and the stability of the financial system.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\f"

Schoenholtz\nwith Matthew Luzzetti and Justin Weidner\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2023 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nSponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets\nAt the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to participate in this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum. I have\nattended many of the forums, and this is the fourth time I have had the honor of being on the program. So\nI can say based on experience that the forum always chooses a topic of utmost importance for monetary\npolicymaking and always successfully delivers a paper combining solid research and policy\nrecommendations. This year is no exception.\n\nOver the past year, in the wake of rising inflation, the FOMC has taken deliberate action to remove\nmonetary policy accommodation by raising the federal funds rate by 4-1/2 percentage points and reducing\nthe size of the Fed’s balance sheet through asset run-off. Returning the economy to price stability is an\nimperative for sustaining healthy labor markets and the U.S. standard of living. The very high inflation\nthe economy has experienced for almost two years has been painful for households and businesses,\nespecially those with fewer resources. High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy\nbecause it distorts the decisions households and businesses make about building human capital and\ninvesting in R&D, plants and equipment, and other forms of physical capital. These decisions ultimately\naffect the pace of innovation, productivity growth, the potential growth rate of the economy, and\nimprovement in our living standards.\n\nIncoming economic information shows that our monetary policy actions are having the intended effect of\nslowing demand and reducing price pressures. In addition, supply chain disruptions are easing. But\ninflation remains too high. So the paper is highly relevant for the task at hand as the FOMC manages the\nnecessary disinflation back to our 2 percent goal while minimizing the pain of the journey back to price\nstability.\n\nIn the time I have, I will comment on three aspects of the paper: the empirical estimation of the Phillips\ncurve, the role of inflation expectations, and the lessons for policymakers operating in an uncertain\n\n\f2\nenvironment. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Phillips Curve\nIn many inflation models used by central banks, inflation is driven by three key factors: a resource\nutilization gap or marginal cost of production; lagged inflation; and expectations of inflation. Different\nmodels put different weights on these fundamental factors, but empirical work across many specifications\nof such a Phillips curve relationship generally finds that inflation expectations matter and the resource\nutilization gap or slack matters when it is large. The finding that inflation expectations matter is an\nimportant reminder that estimates of a Phillips curve are dependent on the conduct of monetary policy and\nthat reduced-form Phillips curves are not structural.\n\nIt is not surprising that the estimated inflation dynamics over the period that includes the high inflation of\nthe 1960s and 1970s and the Volcker disinflation over 1979-1984 differ from those over the period of the\nGreat Moderation from 1985 through 2019 because inflation expectations were not well anchored in the\nearlier period but were in the latter period. Some of the difference could reflect the nature of the shocks\nthat hit the economy in each period, but it also reflects differences in how monetary policy was\nconducted. The experience of the 1960s and 1970s taught Fed policymakers the importance of setting\npolicy to prevent the unanchoring of inflation expectations and the role that an explicit numerical inflation\ntarget can play in keeping expectations anchored. Now, more generally, there is a greater appreciation of\nmonetary policy independence coupled with transparency and accountability, although that appreciation\ncan ebb and flow with economic developments and should not be taken for granted.\n\n[Figure 1]\nThe forum paper investigates inflation dynamics by estimating a nonlinear Phillips curve and then\nembedding that relationship in a simple economic model to simulate inflation since 2019. The authors’\n\n\f3\npreferred specification is estimated over the sample period from 1962 through 2019. It relates core PCE\ninflation to a measure of slack based on the vacancy-to-unemployment gap, v/u – (v/u)*, allowing the\ncoefficient on the gap to differ in hot labor markets (when the v/u gap is positive) and in cold labor\nmarkets (when the v/u gap is negative).\n\nThey find a statistically and economically significant positive relationship between inflation and the v/u\ngap in a hot labor market and a very small statistically insignificant negative relationship in a cold labor\nmarket.\n\n[Figure 2]\nThis result is the opposite of the findings of several papers in the literature. Two examples are Stock and\nWatson (2010) and Ashley and Verbrugge (2023). Stock and Watson (2010) documented a key stylized\nfact, namely, that inflation tends to decline during recessions. In their preferred inflation forecasting\nmodel, inflation is related to a stochastic trend inflation rate and an unemployment recession gap, the\ndifference between the current unemployment rate and the minimum unemployment rate over the current\nand previous 11 quarters. This gap variable measures the severity of economic contractions and the\nstochastic trend in their Phillips curve is meant to capture longer-term inflation expectations. While their\npaper is silent on what happens to inflation in booms, they find that inflation is lower in recessions, i.e.,\nwhen the labor market is cold. In normal times when the gap is small, inflation is driven by its stochastic\ntrend.\n\nIn a recent Cleveland Fed working paper, Ashley and Verbrugge (2023) estimate what they call a\npersistence-dependent Phillips curve, in which the unemployment gap is decomposed into a transitory\ncomponent, a moderately persistent component, and a highly persistent component. The moderately\npersistent component behaves similarly to the Stock and Watson unemployment recession gap, while the\nhighly persistent gap captures low-frequency movements in the business cycle, slowly turning positive\n\n\f4\nduring recessions and then negative during expansions. In their preferred empirical specification, these\nauthors find that inflation is lower when the moderately persistent component turns up during recessions.\nIn contrast, the highly persistent component of the unemployment gap typically has little association with\ninflation except when the unemployment rate is far below the natural rate. So in contrast to today’s paper,\na cold labor market is associated with lower inflation, and the labor market has to be very hot to boost\ninflation to the same degree.1\n\nBut even within the forum paper itself there is a tension between the estimated Phillips curve findings and\nthe historical analysis presented in Section 2. The historical analysis documents that the vast majority of\ndisinflations in the U.S. and in other advanced economies have been accompanied by recessions, a finding\nthat differs from the estimated Phillips curve results. Perhaps there is one way to reconcile at least part of\nthe tension. It could be that when labor markets are overheating and inflation is high, policymakers\ntighten monetary policy to bring labor demand into better balance with supply to alleviate inflation\npressures without intending to push the economy beyond that and into recession. Because this is a\ndifficult calibration exercise, policy tends to overshoot and the economy does end up in recession in most\ndisinflations. The implication is that policymakers need to be attentive to the lagged effects of policy\nactions as they bring inflation down.\n\nIf we take the forum paper’s estimated Phillips curve results at face value, another implication is that once\nthe economy overheats, it is going to be difficult for monetary policymakers to bring inflation down. This\nsupports the authors’ conclusion that monetary policy should be pre-emptive to avoid spurring a hot labor\nmarket in the first place.\n\n1\n\nOther examples of papers that estimate nonlinear Phillips curves include Barnes and Olivei (2003), Peach, Rich,\nand Cororaton (2011), and Harding, Lindé, and Trabandt (2023).\n\n\f5\nThe persistence of inflation underscores the important role inflation expectations play in inflation\ndynamics, which is my next topic.\n\nThe Role of Inflation Expectations\nInflation expectations have been a central factor in models of inflationary dynamics since the 1960s and\n1970s, with the seminal work of Phelps, Friedman, and Lucas, and they play a key role in New Keynesian\ndynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models used to inform and evaluate monetary policy.2, 3\nIn addition to their role in helping to forecast inflation, inflation expectations are also an indicator of how\ncredible the public finds the central bank’s commitment to achieving its policy goals.\n\nThe forum paper uses a behavioral equation for inflation expectations in which those expectations are\nhighly inertial and strongly anchored, unlike they were in the 1960s and 1970s, and it measures these\nexpectations using the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Anchored inflation expectations are highly\ndesirable; they mean that the public finds the longer-run inflation target credible and that fluctuations in\ninflation will eventually die out. But during a period of very high inflation, the stability of inflation\nexpectations cannot be taken for granted: the real world does not always cooperate with our modeling\nassumptions.4 Research indicates that there is considerable heterogeneity across and even within different\ngroups of agents.5 And inflation remains a challenging construct for consumers to fully understand.\n\n2\n\nSee Phelps (1967), Friedman (1968), Lucas (1972), Fuhrer and Olivei (2009), and Clark and Davig (2009).\n\n3\n\nWork done at the Cleveland Fed and by other researchers finds that including measures of inflation expectations in\ninflation forecasting models reduces the size of forecast errors. See Faust and Wright (2013), Zaman (2013), Chan,\nClark, and Koop (2018), and Tallman and Zaman (2020).\nMester (2022) discusses the role of inflation expectations in monetary policymaking from a practitioner’s\nperspective.\n4\n\n5\n\nFor example, the inflation expectations of consumers appear to vary with demographic and socioeconomic factors.\nAccording to the Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations measure, women’s inflation expectations\ntend to be higher than men’s and older respondents and more educated respondents also report higher inflation\nexpectations. The Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations measure, which started in 2021, is\nbased on a nationwide survey with more than 10,000 responses and is updated on a weekly basis. Instead of asking\nconsumers directly about overall inflation, the survey asks consumers how they expect the prices of the things they\nbuy to change over the next 12 months and how much their incomes would have to change for them to be able to\nafford the same consumption basket and be equally well-off. See Hajdini, et al. (2022).\n\n\f6\nCleveland Fed research finds that consumers regularly report higher forecasts for aggregate inflation than\nthey do for the disaggregated components of inflation and that their future spending plans are tied more to\ntheir forecasts for the components than for overall inflation.6\n\n[Figure 3]\nOver the past two years, short-term inflation expectations moved up with gasoline and food prices, which\ntend to have an outsized effect on households’ inflation expectations.7 As energy prices have fallen in\nrecent months, short-term inflation expectations have eased, although they remain well above their prepandemic levels. This also raises the possibility that if energy and food prices rise again, short-run\ninflation expectations could also rise again. Most measures of medium- and longer-term expectations are\nalso somewhat above their pre-pandemic levels, but they appear to be reasonably well anchored at levels\nconsistent with our 2 percent target.\n\n[Figure 4]\nIdentifying when longer-term expectations are becoming unanchored is not easy. Changes in the\nskewness of the distribution of responses to surveys of inflation expectations or increases in the\ndispersion between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the distribution can provide some indication that\nexpectations are becoming unmoored.8 As inflation rose, dispersion measures also rose. They are\nmoving back down now, suggesting that inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored. But that\nshould not be taken for granted.\n\n6\n\nSee Dietrich, et al. (2022).\n\n7\n\nFor the effect of salient prices on inflation expectations, see Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), Cavallo, Cruces,\nand Perez-Truglia (2017), D’Acunto, et al. (2021), and Campos, McMain, and Pedemonte (2022).\n8\n\nReis (2021) analyzes the degree and timing of the unanchoring of inflation expectations during the 1960s and\n1970s in the U.S. and discusses the use of dispersion as a sign of unanchoring.\n\n\f7\nIt is good to remember that inflation expectations are determined not only by movements in inflation but\nalso by policymakers’ actions to follow through on their strongly stated commitment to return inflation to\nits longer-run goal. The conduct of monetary policy matters, and research indicates that if policymakers\nare going to make an error, it is more costly to set policy assuming that inflation expectations are well\nanchored when they aren’t rather than the other way around.9 If inflation expectations were to become\nunanchored, their influence would offset the effect of any beneficial change in the resource gap.\nMonetary policy would then have to act more forcefully, and the return to price stability would be more\npainful and costly.\n\nThis brings me to my last topic, which concerns monetary policymaking in a world of uncertainty.\n\nMonetary Policymaking under Uncertainty\n[Figure 5]\nUncertainty is the norm, not the exception.10 The economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks that\ncan lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated. Economic data are measured with\nerror and can be revised over time. As the forum paper demonstrates, policymakers also have to contend\nwith model uncertainty. Competing models can be consistent with the observable data but can interpret\nthe data in different ways, producing different dynamics that are relevant for policymaking. Moreover,\nthe underlying structure of the economy can change over time, making some models more relevant in\ncertain periods than in others and complicating forecasting and policy setting in real time. In addition,\neven if one knew the correct model, some of the important conceptual elements in the model are not\ndirectly observable, e.g., the equilibrium interest rate, r*; slack, like the output gap or v/u gap used in the\n\n9\n\nSee De Pooter, et al. (2016).\n\n10\n\nMester (2016) discusses the role of uncertainty in monetary policymaking.\n\n\f8\npaper; the natural rate of unemployment, u*; and inflation expectations. These constructs have to be\nproxied and are subject to mismeasurement, which can affect policy decisions.11\n\n[Figure 6]\nBecause of these uncertainties, one should expect economic forecasts, and therefore the associated\nmonetary policy paths, to change over time. Those changes can reflect economic developments, a better\nunderstanding of the underlying structural elements of the economy, or a combination of both. For\nexample, in the pre-pandemic expansion, the FOMC learned over time that employment growth could be\nstronger and the unemployment rate lower without generating inflation than one would have thought\npossible based on the experience of past decades. As the FOMC learned, its assessments of the longerrun unemployment rate came down significantly over time. During this expansion, inflation moved\nhigher and proved to be more persistent than anticipated.\n\nBecause of uncertainty, it is useful for policymakers to look at a variety of models that fit the data and\nconsider policy prescriptions that perform well across those models. It is also helpful to look at the\nprescriptions from a variety of policy rules that are robust across various models and economic\ncircumstances.12\n\nScenario analysis should also play a larger role in policymaking. It is helpful to contemplate different\nways the economy could evolve and think about subjective probabilities across the scenarios. Hansen and\nSargent’s robust control approach confronts head-on the fact that models are only an approximation to\nreality and they show the benefit of choosing the policy that produces the best outcome in the worst-case\n\n11\n\nOrphanides has laid out a convincing case that mismeasurement of slack and other unobservables like the natural\nrate of interest led to monetary policy mistakes that contributed to the Great Inflation of the 1970s. See, for\nexample, Orphanides and Van Norden (2005) and Orphanides (2015).\n12\n\nThe Cleveland Fed publishes quarterly updates of the outcomes of a set of simple monetary policy rules across\nseveral forecasts. See Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2022).\n\n\f9\nscenario across models.13 I found scenario analysis particularly useful during the pandemic when the\nexpected path for the economy depended critically on how the pandemic would evolve.\n\nIn terms of the appropriate policy responses in a highly uncertain environment, some results in the\nliterature suggest that when policymakers confront more uncertainty either in their data or in their models,\nthey should be more cautious in acting, i.e., they should be more inertial in their responses.14 However,\nsubsequent research has shown that this is not generally true. Inertial policies can reduce the direct effect\nof the mismeasurement, but they can also carry forward policy errors generated by mismeasurement.\nSargent (1999) points out that caution does not necessarily mean doing less. When there is uncertainty, it\ncan be better for policymakers to act more aggressively because aggressive and pre-emptive action can\nprevent the worst-case outcomes from actually coming about.15 Indeed, I agree with the forum paper’s\nauthors that the FOMC acted appropriately to move the policy rate up quickly last year. A more languid\nreaction to high inflation would have led to worse outcomes.\n\nThe forum paper also makes a strong argument that policy should act pre-emptively to prevent inflation\nfrom rising and points out that because the FOMC failed to act pre-emptively in 2021 as inflation rose, it\nthen needed to act decisively in 2022 to stabilize inflation expectations. I agree that, in hindsight, the\nFOMC should have acted sooner, but I do not attribute the inaction to a change in views about the value\nof pre-emptive monetary policy as suggested by the authors.16 Even policy that is explicitly forward\n\n13\n\nSee Sargent (1998) and Hansen and Sargent (2001, 2007, and 2011).\n\n14\n\nMester (2016) discusses some of the literature.\n\n15\n\nGiannoni (2002 and 2007) shows policymakers who are averse to uncertainty will react more strongly to\nfluctuations in inflation and the output gap than if there were no uncertainty. They would put more weight on\nstabilizing inflation and the output gap and less weight on stabilizing the nominal interest rate. Walsh (2003, 2022)\npoints out that better economic outcomes are achieved by assuming that high inflation will be persistent and acting\naccordingly.\n16\n\nSome commentators have suggested that the revised monetary policy strategy adopted by the FOMC in August\n2020 and reaffirmed annually since then took a step back from pre-emptive policy. (See, e.g., Levy and Plosser,\n2020.) Instead, I view the changes in the strategy statement as an acknowledgment of the uncertainty around\nassessments of the level of maximum employment. Given that we don’t know where u* is, policymakers should not\n\n\f10\nlooking may end up not being appropriate ex post if the forecasts on which such policy is based are much\ntoo optimistic about the likely path for inflation. The FOMC’s inflation forecasts were overly optimistic\nabout inflation moving back down, and this contributed to maintaining a highly accommodative stance for\nmonetary policy. Indeed, inaction on the funds rate meant that policy was becoming even more\naccommodative as inflation rose.\n\nPutting these pieces together for the current economic environment, while it is welcome news to see some\nmoderation in inflation readings since last summer, the level of inflation matters and it is still too high.\nPolicy decisions need to consider the risk around the forecast but also the costs of continued high inflation\nto households, businesses, and the longer-run health of the economy. The forum paper’s projections and\nrecent research from the Cleveland Fed suggest that inflation could be more persistent than currently\nanticipated by many forecasters.17 I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the\ncosts of continued high inflation as being significant. So in my view, at this point with the labor market\nstill strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs\nof overshooting. But policy also needs to be forward looking, and as inflation comes down, I anticipate\nthat the balance of risks will shift.\n\nTo conclude, I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this fine paper, and I recommend that\neveryone read it. The authors draw several lessons from their work. Let me add another one, namely,\nthat the economy can evolve differently than expected and monetary policymakers should be prepared for\nthat.\n\nbase policy solely on what could be an outdated estimate of this construct. But if inflationary pressures are building,\npolicy can and should take pre-emptive action. As the strategy statement continues to acknowledge, monetary\npolicy actions tend to influence the economy with a lag. This means it can be costly if monetary policy allows an\naccommodative stance to remain in place when price pressures rise.\n17\n\nSee Verbrugge and Zaman (2023).\n\n\f11\nReferences\nAshley, Richard, and Randal J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nUkraine: One Year Later – Session I: Monetary Policy and Market Implications\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nUniversity of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee College of Business\nSarasota, FL\n(via videoconference)\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me begin by thanking David Kotok and the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak at\ntoday’s conference. The GIC has a long tradition of organizing sessions to inform us about the important\nissues affecting the world’s economies. I am grateful that I have been able to participate in many GIC\nevents over the years.\n\nToday, my topic will be the outlook for the U.S. economy and the appropriate monetary policy settings\nthat will return our economy to price stability. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nBecause the Super Bowl was played just this past Sunday, I titled my talk “In It to Win It” because the\nFed is committed to getting inflation back to our 2 percent goal. But, of course, returning the economy to\nprice stability is not a game: it is an imperative for sustaining healthy labor markets and our standard of\nliving. The very high inflation the economy has experienced for almost two years has been painful for\nhouseholds and businesses, especially those with fewer resources, as they have had to cope with\nincreasing costs and make hard choices about where to spend their money. Organizations that offer\nservices to lower-income households have also been struggling with higher costs, limiting their ability to\noffer aid to as many people. High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy because it\ndistorts the decisions households and businesses make about building human capital and investing in\nR&D, plants and equipment, and other forms of physical capital. These decisions ultimately affect the\npace of innovation, productivity growth, the potential growth rate of the economy, and improvement in\nour living standards. Because of the negative costs of high inflation, the Fed is resolved and focused on\nreturning to price stability in a timely way: we are in it to win it.\n\nLast year, in the wake of very high inflation, the Fed took deliberate action to remove monetary policy\naccommodation. Over the course of 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, our policy rate, by\n\n\f2\n4-1/4 percentage points and began reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll\noff. At the meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC took another step and raised the target range of the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent and the balance-sheet reduction continues.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation, which started in the spring of 2021 in the U.S.,\nbut has also occurred in other advanced economies around the globe. These factors include the pandemic\nand how households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers responded to it, as well as\nRussia’s war against Ukraine. An imbalance arose between strong demand and constrained supply, which\nled to significant upward pressures on prices in an environment of accommodative monetary and fiscal\npolicy.\n\nIncoming economic information shows that our monetary policy actions are having the intended effect of\nslowing demand and reducing price pressures. In addition, supply chain disruptions are easing, which is\nalso helping to alleviate some of the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This is\ngood news, but further monetary policy action is needed to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\nEconomic growth slowed considerably last year, and I expect that growth will be well under trend this\nyear. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about\n5-3/4 percent in 2021. Growth in the final quarter of last year was almost 3 percent, but much of that was\ndue to firms rebuilding inventories. Abstracting from inventories, growth in real final sales was a more\nmodest 1-1/2 percent, suggesting some dampening in underlying momentum.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive sectors have been experiencing the sharpest slowdown. Residential investment\ncontinues to decline sharply in response to higher mortgage rates. Business fixed investment and\n\n\f3\nmanufacturing activity have slowed. Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, has held\nup, reflecting the strength in household balance sheets. But it has slowed from the robust pace seen in\n2021.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, supply chain disruptions have improved but not uniformly across\nsectors and products. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index fell\nappreciably during 2022, although it remains above its pre-pandemic level.1 Some of the improvement in\nthis index last month reflects better delivery times from China, consistent with China easing its zeroCOVID policy and reopening its economy. Our business contacts tell us that transportation bottlenecks\nand delivery times have improved compared to last year but that certain products, including computer\nchips and electric generators, remain difficult to source.\n\nLabor Markets\nDespite the slowdown in growth, labor market conditions remain strong, with labor demand continuing to\noutpace labor supply. After some moderation over the past year, there was a sizable gain in payrolls in\nJanuary, with the economy adding over 500 thousand jobs. The number of job openings moved down\nsomewhat over the past year, but there are still 1.9 openings per unemployed worker. The unemployment\nrate has been running at about 3.5 percent for the past year, a 50-year low, and it actually edged down in\nJanuary. Despite these strong numbers, anecdotal reports from our business contacts suggest that\nconditions are easing in the labor market, except in healthcare where significant hiring challenges remain\ndue to a national shortage of skilled and unskilled healthcare workers. Although they do not intend to\nreduce their workforces, many of our business contacts have tempered their demand for workers and\nthose that are hiring say it has become easier to find the workers they need.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index is available at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/overview.\n1\n\n\f4\nOn the supply side, labor force participation has stabilized below its pre-pandemic level. Over time, it has\nbecome apparent that this lower level of participation reflects structural factors such as the high level of\nretirements over the pandemic, reduced immigration, changes in preferences, and the difficulty in finding\naffordable childcare.\n\nAn indication that labor demand is outpacing labor supply is strong wage growth. Labor costs constitute\na significant share of a business’s expenses, especially in the service sector. The strong increase in wages\nhas contributed to higher inflation, yet workers’ wage gains generally have not kept up with inflation. So,\nin real terms, many workers are not better off. Recent data and reports from business contacts suggest\nthat as the economy has slowed, wage growth has started to moderate from its peak last summer.\nNonetheless, nominal wage growth is still around 4-1/2 percent. Given current estimates of trend\nproductivity growth of between 1 and 1-1/2 percent, this means wage growth is still about 1 to 1-1/2\npercentage points above the level consistent with price stability.\n\nThe imbalance between labor demand and supply will need to continue to shrink to alleviate wage\npressures. Since there is little reason to think that labor force participation will increase significantly in\nthe coming months, labor demand will need to moderate further to reduce the imbalance. I expect that\nwith the economy growing well below trend, the labor market will cool off, with slower employment\ngrowth and a rise in the unemployment rate. But this moderation in labor demand could come mainly\nfrom firms deciding not to add to their payrolls rather than cutting their staffs. Indeed, many contacts\nhave told me they plan to do all they can to retain workers through the slowdown, given how hard hiring\nhas been over the past couple of years. This suggests we will see less of an increase in the unemployment\nrate than is typical in an economic slowdown.\n\nInflation\nInflation remains well above our goal of 2 percent. Recent monthly readings show inflation has eased\n\n\f5\nfrom its high point last summer, and short-term inflation expectations have moved down with it. In\nDecember, the year-over-year measure of headline PCE inflation moderated to 5 percent, compared to 7\npercent in June, with declining energy prices contributing to the decline in overall inflation. Underlying\ninflation measures have also shown some improvement. In December, core PCE inflation was about\n4-1/2 percent compared to 5 percent in June. Looking at the most recent 3-month period, core PCE\ninflation is down to 3 percent. The median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, which exclude\ncomponents with the most extreme movements each month, have also improved in recent months but to a\nlesser extent.2\n\nThe improvement in the monthly readings in core inflation has come from the goods sector, where PCE\ngoods prices fell about 3 percent, annualized, over the past three months. Some of that decline reflected\nan unsustainably sharp drop in used car prices. So goods inflation is likely to move up in coming months.\nShelter price inflation has not improved, but it is expected to ease later in the year as housing activity\ncontinues to weaken and the deceleration in rents in new leases passes through to the inflation measures.\nCore services inflation excluding shelter has not improved. It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage\ninflation, and has a large share in the overall index, since consumers spend a larger share of their income\non services than on goods.\n\nFor much of the pre-pandemic expansion, core goods inflation was slightly negative, on average, and\nfalling goods prices were pulling inflation down. By the end of that expansion, inflation was nearing our\ntarget. In January 2020, PCE inflation had reached 1.8 percent and core inflation had risen to 1.7 percent.\nThat reading reflected 0.75 percent deflation in core goods prices and 2.5 percent inflation in core\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx).\n\n\f6\nservices prices. That is very different from today. In the current period of high inflation, which began in\nthe spring of 2021, core goods prices have been rising, and for much of this period until recently, inflation\nin core goods has exceeded inflation in core services. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent\ninflation, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation in both components.\n\nMy expectation is that we will see a meaningful improvement in inflation this year and further\nimprovement over the following year, with inflation reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. But my outlook\nis contingent on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has come an\nappreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one, but I believe\nwe have more work to do. Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go and for how\nlong policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations\nare moving down, and that will depend on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being\nresolved, and price pressures are easing. At this juncture, the incoming data have not changed my view\nthat we will need to bring the fed funds rate above 5 percent and hold it there for some time to be\nsufficiently restrictive to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent. Indeed, at our\nmeeting two weeks ago, setting aside what financial market participants expected us to do, I saw a\ncompelling economic case for a 50-basis-point increase, which would have brought the top of the target\nrange to 5 percent.\n\nMy view of appropriate policy is contingent on my economic outlook, which is informed by incoming\ndata, the real-time reconnaissance provided by our regional contacts, and a variety of economic models\nand analyses. The FOMC likes to say that its policy decisions are data dependent, but that doesn’t mean\n\n\f7\nwe react to one or two data points. Instead, I view “data dependent” as shorthand for saying that\nincoming economic information informs my economic outlook and assessment of risks, which, in turn,\ninforms my view of appropriate monetary policy.\n\nIn addition to my economic outlook, my policy views are also importantly influenced by riskmanagement considerations, including the risks to the economic outlook and my assessment of the costs\nof continued high inflation to households, businesses, and the longer-run health of the economy.\n\nIt is welcome news to see some moderation in inflation readings since last summer, but the level of\ninflation matters and it is still too high. January’s CPI inflation report showed a jump in the monthly rate\nof overall inflation and no improvement in underlying inflation. The report provides a cautionary tale\nagainst concluding too soon that inflation is on a timely and sustained path back to 2 percent.\n\nI continue to see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside for a number of reasons. Russia’s\ncontinuing war in Ukraine adds uncertainty to the inflation picture, particularly for food and energy\nprices. While energy prices have moved down, partly because of mild winter weather in Europe, they\ncould move up again, as could food prices. Indeed, in January, energy prices in the CPI rose strongly and\nfood prices also advanced. These items constitute a sizable share of the consumption basket for many\nhouseholds, particularly those with lower incomes. They also influence short-term inflation expectations.\n\nChina is another source of risk. On the one hand, the reopening of China is helping to ease supply chain\ndisruptions. But China is also a major world economy and increasing demand there will put upward\npressure on commodity prices.\n\nSeveral private-sector forecasters do not expect inflation to return to 2 percent until sometime next year.\nAccording to the median in the December FOMC Summary of Economic Projections, this goal will not\n\n\f8\nbe reached until 2025.3 If that comes to pass, it means that inflation will have been above 2 percent for\nover 4 years, and well above 2 percent for much of that time. Even that forecast could turn out to be\noptimistic. Some recent research by economists at the Cleveland Fed presents a plausible case, based on\na model and historical relationships in the data, that inflation could end up being much more persistent\nthan current projections, despite the actions the FOMC has taken.4 While this research has not altered my\nview that there will be material improvement in inflation this year, it does inform my view that the risks\nto inflation remain on the upside.\n\nThe upside risks to inflation and historical experience suggest to me that the costs of undershooting on\npolicy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting. Under-tightening raises\nthe risk that inflation will settle in stubbornly above our goal, imposing both short-run and long-run costs\non households and businesses. It could result in longer-term inflation expectations moving higher, which\nwould make it much harder and more costly to return to price stability. Over-tightening also has costs,\nbut if inflation begins to move down faster than anticipated, we can react appropriately.\n\nGiven the risks and costs, we need to be prepared to move the federal funds rate higher if the upside risks\nto inflation are realized and inflation fails to moderate as expected or if the imbalances between demand\nand supply in product and labor markets persist longer than anticipated.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, inflation remains too high and it is the responsibility of the FOMC to bring it down. So the\nFOMC is resolute in continuing to bring monetary policy to a sufficiently restrictive stance to ensure that\n\n3\n\nThe December 2022 Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20221214.pdf.

Tighter financial conditions will result in growth\nwell below trend this year and some cooling off in labor markets, with slower employment growth and an\nincrease in the unemployment rate from its very low level. These developments will help to alleviate\nprice and wage pressures. As a result, I expect to see good progress on inflation this year.\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain environment and economic conditions can evolve in unexpected ways.\nWith growth well below trend, it wouldn’t take much of a negative shock to push growth into negative\nterritory for a time. Most of our business contacts are preparing for a mild recession. Similarly, inflation\ndynamics over this expansion have been influenced in important ways by the pandemic and the war in\nUkraine, and we need to be very open to the idea that inflation can evolve differently than we expect. To\nhelp me formulate my economic outlook and policy views over the year, I will be looking at a variety of\nincoming data and collecting economic and financial information from our business, labor market, and\ncommunity contacts.\n\nThe transition back to price stability will take some time and will not be without some pain. There will be\nsome bumps along the way as the economy slows, but high inflation is also very painful. I do not view\nthe current situation as one in which there is a tradeoff between our two monetary policy goals because\nreturning to price stability in a timely way is the best way to ensure a healthy labor market over the longer\nrun. So I plan to remain diligent in setting monetary policy to return the economy to price stability and to\nbe judicious in balancing the risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nIn short, I remain in it to win it.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nFinancial Executives International of Northeast Ohio\nand\nThe Association for Corporate Growth Cleveland\nCleveland, OH\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\nThe remarks on the national economy and monetary policy are the same as those delivered earlier on\nFebruary 16, 2023.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Financial Executives International of Northeast Ohio and the Association for Corporate Growth\nCleveland for inviting me to speak this evening. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland. As you know, the Cleveland Fed represents the Federal Reserve System’s Fourth\nDistrict, which comprises the state of Ohio and portions of Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.\nAs president of the Cleveland Fed, I like to engage with a variety of people from around the District to get\na better sense of what is happening on the ground in our economy. These insights are more timely than\nthe official government statistics, and I share the economic reconnaissance gathered from our business,\nlabor, consumer, and community contacts with my colleagues at Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) meetings so that it can inform the setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThis evening, my topic will be the outlook for the U.S. and Ohio economy and the appropriate monetary\npolicy settings that will return our economy to price stability. The views I present will be my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nBecause the Super Bowl was played just this past Sunday, I titled my talk “In It to Win It” because the\nFed is committed to getting inflation back to our 2 percent goal. But, of course, returning the economy to\nprice stability is not a game: it is an imperative for sustaining healthy labor markets and our standard of\nliving. The very high inflation the economy has experienced for almost two years has been painful for\nhouseholds and businesses, especially those with fewer resources, as they have had to cope with\nincreasing costs and make hard choices about where to spend their money. Organizations that offer\nservices to lower-income households have also been struggling with higher costs, limiting their ability to\noffer aid to as many people. High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy because it\ndistorts the decisions households and businesses make about building human capital and investing in\n\n\f2\nR&D, plants and equipment, and other forms of physical capital. These decisions ultimately affect the\npace of innovation, productivity growth, the potential growth rate of the economy, and improvement in\nour living standards. Because of the negative costs of high inflation, the Fed is resolved and focused on\nreturning to price stability in a timely way: we are in it to win it.\n\nLast year, in the wake of very high inflation, the Fed took deliberate action to remove monetary policy\naccommodation. Over the course of 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, our policy rate, by\n4-1/4 percentage points and began reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll\noff. At the meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC took another step and raised the target range of the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent and the balance-sheet reduction continues.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation, which started in the spring of 2021 in the U.S.,\nbut has also occurred in other advanced economies around the globe. These factors include the pandemic\nand how households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers responded to it, as well as\nRussia’s war against Ukraine. An imbalance arose between strong demand and constrained supply, which\nled to significant upward pressures on prices in an environment of accommodative monetary and fiscal\npolicy.\n\nIncoming economic information shows that our monetary policy actions are having the intended effect of\nslowing demand and reducing price pressures. In addition, supply chain disruptions are easing, which is\nalso helping to alleviate some of the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This is\ngood news, but further monetary policy action is needed to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable\ndownward path to 2 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\n\f3\nEconomic growth slowed considerably last year, and I expect that growth will be well under trend this\nyear. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about\n5-3/4 percent in 2021. Growth in the final quarter of last year was almost 3 percent, but much of that was\ndue to firms rebuilding inventories. Abstracting from inventories, growth in real final sales was a more\nmodest 1-1/2 percent, suggesting some dampening in underlying momentum.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive sectors have been experiencing the sharpest slowdown. Residential investment\ncontinues to decline sharply in response to higher mortgage rates. Business fixed investment and\nmanufacturing activity have slowed. Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, has held\nup, reflecting the strength in household balance sheets. But it has slowed from the robust pace seen in\n2021.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, supply chain disruptions have improved but not uniformly across\nsectors and products. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index fell\nappreciably during 2022, although it remains above its pre-pandemic level.1 Some of the improvement in\nthis index last month reflects better delivery times from China, consistent with China easing its zeroCOVID policy and reopening its economy. Our business contacts tell us that transportation bottlenecks\nand delivery times have improved compared to last year but that certain products, including computer\nchips and electric generators, remain difficult to source.\n\nLabor Markets\nDespite the slowdown in growth, labor market conditions remain strong, with labor demand continuing to\noutpace labor supply. After some moderation over the past year, there was a sizable gain in payrolls in\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index is available at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/overview.\n1\n\n\f4\nJanuary, with the economy adding over 500 thousand jobs. The number of job openings moved down\nsomewhat over the past year, but there are still 1.9 openings per unemployed worker. The unemployment\nrate has been running at about 3.5 percent for the past year, a 50-year low, and it actually edged down in\nJanuary. Despite these strong numbers, anecdotal reports from our business contacts suggest that\nconditions are easing in the labor market, except in healthcare where significant hiring challenges remain\ndue to a national shortage of skilled and unskilled healthcare workers. Although they do not intend to\nreduce their workforces, many of our business contacts have tempered their demand for workers and\nthose that are hiring say it has become easier to find the workers they need.\n\nOn the supply side, labor force participation has stabilized below its pre-pandemic level. Over time, it has\nbecome apparent that this lower level of participation reflects structural factors such as the high level of\nretirements over the pandemic, reduced immigration, changes in preferences, and the difficulty in finding\naffordable childcare.\n\nAn indication that labor demand is outpacing labor supply is strong wage growth. Labor costs constitute\na significant share of a business’s expenses, especially in the service sector. The strong increase in wages\nhas contributed to higher inflation, yet workers’ wage gains generally have not kept up with inflation. So,\nin real terms, many workers are not better off. Recent data and reports from business contacts suggest\nthat as the economy has slowed, wage growth has started to moderate from its peak last summer.\nNonetheless, nominal wage growth is still around 4-1/2 percent. Given current estimates of trend\nproductivity growth of between 1 and 1-1/2 percent, this means wage growth is still about 1 to 1-1/2\npercentage points above the level consistent with price stability.\n\nThe imbalance between labor demand and supply will need to continue to shrink to alleviate wage\npressures. Since there is little reason to think that labor force participation will increase significantly in\nthe coming months, labor demand will need to moderate further to reduce the imbalance. I expect that\n\n\f5\nwith the economy growing well below trend, the labor market will cool off, with slower employment\ngrowth and a rise in the unemployment rate. But this moderation in labor demand could come mainly\nfrom firms deciding not to add to their payrolls rather than cutting their staffs. Indeed, many contacts\nhave told me they plan to do all they can to retain workers through the slowdown, given how hard hiring\nhas been over the past couple of years. This suggests we will see less of an increase in the unemployment\nrate than is typical in an economic slowdown.\n\nInflation\nInflation remains well above our goal of 2 percent. Recent monthly readings show inflation has eased\nfrom its high point last summer, and short-term inflation expectations have moved down with it. In\nDecember, the year-over-year measure of headline PCE inflation moderated to 5 percent, compared to 7\npercent in June, with declining energy prices contributing to the decline in overall inflation. Underlying\ninflation measures have also shown some improvement. In December, core PCE inflation was about\n4-1/2 percent compared to 5 percent in June. Looking at the most recent 3-month period, core PCE\ninflation is down to 3 percent. The median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, which exclude\ncomponents with the most extreme movements each month, have also improved in recent months but to a\nlesser extent.2\n\nThe improvement in the monthly readings in core inflation has come from the goods sector, where PCE\ngoods prices fell about 3 percent, annualized, over the past three months. Some of that decline reflected\nan unsustainably sharp drop in used car prices. So goods inflation is likely to move up in coming months.\nShelter price inflation has not improved, but it is expected to ease later in the year as housing activity\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces the median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate and the median\nPCE inflation rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research produces inflation measures and analyses of\ninflation and inflation expectations to inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx).\n\n\f6\ncontinues to weaken and the deceleration in rents in new leases passes through to the inflation measures.\nCore services inflation excluding shelter has not improved. It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage\ninflation, and has a large share in the overall index, since consumers spend a larger share of their income\non services than on goods.\n\nFor much of the pre-pandemic expansion, core goods inflation was slightly negative, on average, and\nfalling goods prices were pulling inflation down. By the end of that expansion, inflation was nearing our\ntarget. In January 2020, PCE inflation had reached 1.8 percent and core inflation had risen to 1.7 percent.\nThat reading reflected 0.75 percent deflation in core goods prices and 2.5 percent inflation in core\nservices prices. That is very different from today. In the current period of high inflation, which began in\nthe spring of 2021, core goods prices have been rising, and for much of this period until recently, inflation\nin core goods has exceeded inflation in core services. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent\ninflation, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation in both components.\n\nMy expectation is that we will see a meaningful improvement in inflation this year and further\nimprovement over the following year, with inflation reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. But my outlook\nis contingent on appropriate monetary policy. Before I turn to monetary policy, let me discuss the Ohio\neconomy.\n\nOhio Economy\nOhio is the seventh largest economy in the nation in terms of real gross state product. The path of a\nregional economy reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks that have hit it and the broader\nU.S. economy. Manufacturing, and within manufacturing, autos and auto parts, still constitute an\nimportant part of Ohio’s economy. Indeed, Ohio is still one of the largest producers of motor vehicles\namong states, and the recent investment announcements from Intel and LG Energy Solution suggest that\n\n\f7\nautos will remain an important sector here. But the state has become more diversified over the past 40\nyears.\n\nThe share of employment in manufacturing has been on a longer-term downward trend, at both the\nregional and the national level. Compared to the nation, manufacturing represents a larger share of\npayroll jobs in Ohio, but that differential has fallen over time.3 And Ohio’s economy has been\ntransitioning from one that is largely dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one that is\ndiversifying into healthcare and education. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 20 percent of\nOhio’s jobs and “eds and meds” represented about 12 percent. Those shares have now nearly reversed.\nIn the past decade, the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen to under 13 percent and the share in “eds\nand meds” has risen to nearly 17 percent. Regions that have diversified their industrial base have\ngenerally fared better over time. And in general, over the pandemic, the economy in Ohio has performed\nsimilarly to the national economy. Both Ohio and the U.S. experienced sharp drops in activity when the\neconomy shut down, and since the trough in activity in the second quarter of 2020 through the third\nquarter of last year, both experienced similar annualized growth rates of between 6 and 7 percent.\n\nAs in the nation, employers in Ohio have struggled to find workers throughout the pandemic. And in\nOhio, workforce growth tends to be slower than in the nation due to slower population growth. So this\nhas been a very challenging period for employers. The Ohio labor market remains very tight. Ohio’s\nunemployment rate was about 4-1/4 percent in December, the lowest it has been in two decades. And\nthere were almost one-and-a-half jobs available for every unemployed worker in Ohio, well above the\nlevel in the pre-pandemic expansion when the labor market was also tight. The rising cost and wage\npressures experienced by businesses in Ohio have led them to raise the prices they charge to their\n\n3\n\nOver the past decade, the share of jobs in manufacturing was 8.6 percent for the U.S. and 12.5 percent for Ohio. In\nthe 1990s, the share of jobs in manufacturing was 14.8 percent for the U.S. and 19.9 percent for Ohio.\n\n\f8\ncustomers, and most say they have had little pushback in this high inflation environment. This gives me a\nnatural segue to discuss monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has come an\nappreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one, but I believe\nwe have more work to do. Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go and for how\nlong policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations\nare moving down, and that will depend on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being\nresolved, and price pressures are easing. At this juncture, the incoming data have not changed my view\nthat we will need to bring the fed funds rate above 5 percent and hold it there for some time to be\nsufficiently restrictive to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent. Indeed, at our\nmeeting two weeks ago, setting aside what financial market participants expected us to do, I saw a\ncompelling economic case for a 50-basis-point increase, which would have brought the top of the target\nrange to 5 percent.\n\nMy view of appropriate policy is contingent on my economic outlook, which is informed by incoming\ndata, the real-time reconnaissance provided by our regional contacts, and a variety of economic models\nand analyses. The FOMC likes to say that its policy decisions are data dependent, but that doesn’t mean\nwe react to one or two data points. Instead, I view “data dependent” as shorthand for saying that\nincoming economic information informs my economic outlook and assessment of risks, which, in turn,\ninforms my view of appropriate monetary policy.\n\n\f9\nIn addition to my economic outlook, my policy views are also importantly influenced by riskmanagement considerations, including the risks to the economic outlook and my assessment of the costs\nof continued high inflation to households, businesses, and the longer-run health of the economy.\n\nIt is welcome news to see some moderation in inflation readings since last summer, but the level of\ninflation matters and it is still too high. January’s CPI inflation report showed a jump in the monthly rate\nof overall inflation and no improvement in underlying inflation. The report provides a cautionary tale\nagainst concluding too soon that inflation is on a timely and sustained path back to 2 percent.\n\nI continue to see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside for a number of reasons. Russia’s\ncontinuing war in Ukraine adds uncertainty to the inflation picture, particularly for food and energy\nprices. While energy prices have moved down, partly because of mild winter weather in Europe, they\ncould move up again, as could food prices. Indeed, in January, energy prices in the CPI rose strongly and\nfood prices also advanced. These items constitute a sizable share of the consumption basket for many\nhouseholds, particularly those with lower incomes. They also influence short-term inflation expectations.\n\nChina is another source of risk. On the one hand, the reopening of China is helping to ease supply chain\ndisruptions. But China is also a major world economy and increasing demand there will put upward\npressure on commodity prices.\n\nSeveral private-sector forecasters do not expect inflation to return to 2 percent until sometime next year.\nAccording to the median in the December FOMC Summary of Economic Projections, this goal will not\nbe reached until 2025.4 If that comes to pass, it means that inflation will have been above 2 percent for\n\n4\n\nThe December 2022 Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20221214.pdf. The FOMC will release a new set\nof projections after its March meeting.\n\n\f10\nover 4 years, and well above 2 percent for much of that time. Even that forecast could turn out to be\noptimistic. Some recent research by economists at the Cleveland Fed presents a plausible case, based on\na model and historical relationships in the data, that inflation could end up being much more persistent\nthan current projections, despite the actions the FOMC has taken.5 While this research has not altered my\nview that there will be material improvement in inflation this year, it does inform my view that the risks\nto inflation remain on the upside.\n\nThe upside risks to inflation and historical experience suggest to me that the costs of undershooting on\npolicy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting. Under-tightening raises\nthe risk that inflation will settle in stubbornly above our goal, imposing both short-run and long-run costs\non households and businesses. It could result in longer-term inflation expectations moving higher, which\nwould make it much harder and more costly to return to price stability. Over-tightening also has costs,\nbut if inflation begins to move down faster than anticipated, we can react appropriately.\n\nGiven the risks and costs, we need to be prepared to move the federal funds rate higher if the upside risks\nto inflation are realized and inflation fails to moderate as expected or if the imbalances between demand\nand supply in product and labor markets persist longer than anticipated.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, inflation remains too high and it is the responsibility of the FOMC to bring it down. So the\nFOMC is resolute in continuing to bring monetary policy to a sufficiently restrictive stance to ensure that\ninflation returns to our 2 percent goal in a timely way. Tighter financial conditions will result in growth\nwell below trend this year and some cooling off in labor markets, with slower employment growth and an\n\nSee Randal J.

As a result, I expect to see good progress on inflation this year.\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain environment and economic conditions can evolve in unexpected ways.\nWith growth well below trend, it wouldn’t take much of a negative shock to push growth into negative\nterritory for a time. Most of our business contacts are preparing for a mild recession. Similarly, inflation\ndynamics over this expansion have been influenced in important ways by the pandemic and the war in\nUkraine, and we need to be very open to the idea that inflation can evolve differently than we expect. To\nhelp me formulate my economic outlook and policy views over the year, I will be looking at a variety of\nincoming data and collecting economic and financial information from our business, labor market, and\ncommunity contacts.\n\nThe transition back to price stability will take some time and will not be without some pain. There will be\nsome bumps along the way as the economy slows, but high inflation is also very painful. I do not view\nthe current situation as one in which there is a tradeoff between our two monetary policy goals because\nreturning to price stability in a timely way is the best way to ensure a healthy labor market over the longer\nrun. So I plan to remain diligent in setting monetary policy to return the economy to price stability and to\nbe judicious in balancing the risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nIn short, I remain in it to win it.\n\n\f"
