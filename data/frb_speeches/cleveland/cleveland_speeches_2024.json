        "content": "Forward Guidance and Monetary Policy Communications:\nUse Your Words and Connect the Dots\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Bank of Japan-Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies Conference\nPrice Dynamics and Monetary Policy Challenges – Lessons Learned and Going Forward\nTokyo, Japan\nMay 28, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Governor Ueda, the Bank of Japan, and its Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies for\ninviting me to participate on this panel. In the brief time allotted for my prepared remarks, I will discuss\nforward guidance. My basic point will be that the effectiveness of forward guidance as a policy tool in\nextraordinary times can be enhanced by improving monetary policy communications in normal times.\nTwo phrases you often hear in real life are “use your words” and “connect the dots.” In my view, both\nshould be applied to the FOMC’s monetary policy communications. Of course, the views I will present\nas a panelist will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nForward Guidance as a Policy Tool\nIn extraordinary times, in particular, when the policy rate has been lowered to its effective lower bound,\ntheory suggests that explicit forward guidance about the future path of policy can be used as a policy tool\nand not just for the purpose of transparency and communications. It has the potential to increase the\ncurrent degree of monetary policy accommodation by influencing the public’s expectations. By reducing\nuncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance can help lower interest rates by reducing the\npremiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty. In addition, in theory, if the\ncentral bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be held lower and for longer\nthan would be consistent with the central bank’s past behavior, this can put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, thereby adding accommodation. It has the potential to spur current economic activity\nbecause if people believe that the central bank is committed to keeping interest rates very low, they will\nexpect higher economic activity and higher inflation in the future and that will induce them to make\ninvestments in capital and labor today. Note, though, that for forward guidance to have this effect, the\npublic must believe that the central bank is committed to setting policy differently than it has in the past.\nIf the public doesn’t understand this but, instead, believes that the central bank is behaving as usual, it\n\n\f2\ncould misinterpret a very low policy rate as suggesting a gloomier outlook, and this misinterpretation\nwould work to depress current activity – the exact opposite of the intended effect.1\n\nThe Fed, along with other central banks, used forward guidance as a policy tool during the global\nfinancial crisis and during the pandemic.2 As the FOMC gained experience, the form of its forward\nguidance during the global financial crisis changed over time, from qualitative guidance giving a\nqualitative characterization of the length of time economic conditions would warrant keeping the policy\nrate exceptionally low, to calendar-date guidance, to state-contingent guidance giving thresholds for the\nunemployment rate and inflation that would need to be met before moving off of the effective lower\nbound on the policy rate.3 In the pandemic, the FOMC used state-contingent forward guidance, indicating\nthat it expected to keep the funds rate target at 0 to 1/4 percent until the economy had reached maximum\nemployment, and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for\nsome time. It put this guidance in place in September 2020, after the August release of the results of the\nFOMC’s framework review and revised long-term strategy statement. And it kept this guidance in place\nuntil December 2021, when PCE inflation had been running over 3 percent since April 2021.\n\nChallenges to Using Forward Guidance as a Policy Tool\nReviews undertaken after the global financial crisis suggest that forward guidance was, in general, a\nuseful monetary policy tool, partly as a communications device and partly because it helped to support\nother unconventional actions taken by central banks.4 But the reviews also suggest that forward guidance\n\n1\n\nSee Woodford (2012).\n\nThese were not the Fed’s first experiences of providing some communication about future interest rates. The\nFOMC began releasing policy statements in 1994, and 2003 was the first time it included forward guidance on the\nexpected future path of the policy rate. For a discussion of earlier episodes of very low interest rates in the U.S., see\nCarlson, Eggertsson, and Mertens (2008).\n2\n\nOther central banks used forward guidance before the global financial crisis, including the Bank of Japan, which\nintroduced forward guidance in April 1999, two months after lowering its policy rate to zero in the wake of\ndeflation. See Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS, BIS) (2019).\n3\n\nFor a timeline of the forward guidance that the Fed used during the global financial crisis, see Mester (2018).\n\n4\n\nSee Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS, BIS) (2019).\n\n\f3\nwas challenging to design and estimates of the resultant reduction in long-term interest rates differ over\nstudies. The changing nature of the forward guidance used during the global financial crisis and the\nformulation of forward guidance during the pandemic when inflation rose to unanticipated levels support\nthe view that implementing the guidance is not an easy thing to do.\n\nTwo inherent difficulties come to mind. First, theory suggests that to be effective as a policy tool,\nforward guidance involves committing the policymaker to a future policy path that differs from one\nimplied by the policymaker’s usual policy reaction function. In other words, it commits the policymaker\nto using a different reaction function. But policymakers are loath to make those types of commitments –\ntime-inconsistency problems loom large.5 Contingencies can be included in the guidance, but that tends\nto limit the commitment, thereby watering down the potential effectiveness. Also, it is not clear that\nmarket participants pay enough attention to the conditional nature of the guidance. If they do not, then a\nchange in policy, even if implicit in the guidance, could lower the central bank’s credibility. Given the\ntime-inconsistency problems, it is challenging for central banks to credibly commit to a policy path that\ndiffers from normal policy without a temporary change in the framework, e.g., price-level targeting. This\nsuggests that explicit forward guidance about the rate path should be used judiciously and only in\nextraordinary times.\n\nA second difficulty is that the effectiveness of forward guidance in extraordinary times depends on the\npublic understanding that the policy path in the forward guidance is a deviation from normal behavior,\nwhich means the public needs to understand the policymakers’ normal reaction function, which conveys\nhow policy normally reacts to changes in economic conditions, whether those changes were anticipated or\n\n5\n\nEvans (2017) discusses the time-inconsistency problems inherent in what he calls Odyssean forward guidance,\nwhich involves commitment, in contrast to Delphic forward guidance, which central banks use in normal times.\nThe literature has suggested different mechanisms for increasing the credibility of the commitment inherent in\nforward guidance, including temporarily increasing the inflation target, targeting nominal GDP instead of inflation,\nand targeting the price level instead of inflation. See the discussion of forward guidance and other policies at the\nzero lower bound in Woodford (2012).\n\n\f4\nnot. It has been challenging to convey how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy\nevolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular policy path regardless of how the\neconomy actually evolves.\n\nEnhancements to Monetary Policy Communications in Normal Times\nThe Fed has been enhancing its communications over time. Still, there are times when market\nparticipants’ policy expectations differ from the FOMC’s, which raises the question about the\neffectiveness of our communications in terms of their transparency and/or credibility. Market\nparticipants’ expectations of the path of policy can differ from policymakers’ expected path because\nmarket participants have a different economic outlook despite seeing the same data or because they don’t\nunderstand policymakers’ reaction function or don’t view it as credible. Similarly, research suggests that\nthe public also doesn’t necessarily understand or pay attention to central bank communications, thus\nlimiting the effectiveness of those communications.6 But recent research using randomized trials suggests\nthat the general public’s belief that the central bank will maintain price stability can be enhanced with\neffective policy communication.7 To the extent that enhancements to policy communications strengthen\nthe public’s understanding of the Fed’s reaction function in normal times, it would make explicit forward\nguidance more effective when it is used in extraordinary times. I will make two recommendations for\nFOMC communications: use your words and connect the dots.\n(1) Use your words: The FOMC policy statements have become shorter over time, giving less\ninformation about the FOMC’s medium-run outlook and risks around that outlook, which form the basis\nof our policy decisions. While simpler is often seen as a virtue, it can also be a detriment, since\npolicymaking has to be done in an uncertain world, one in which the economy is constantly being\nbuffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated.8 With short\n\n6\n\nSee Knotek, et al. (2024).\n\n7\n\nIn a study using randomized information treatments in the six largest euro area countries, Ehrmann, Georgarakos,\nand Kenny (2024) find that communicating information about the inflation target can increase the central bank’s\ncredibility to maintain price stability over the medium term, even in periods in which inflation has risen.\n8\n\nI discuss uncertainty and monetary policymaking in Mester (2016).\n\n\f5\nstatements, each word takes on added significance. Short statements suffer from what I call a “Hotel\nCalifornia” problem: we are reluctant to change particular words because of the possible signal that doing\nso may send. Words “check in” but it is hard to get them to “check out” even when it is desirable. One\ncould argue that the use of “transitory” to describe inflation stayed in the FOMC statement far too long,\ngiven economic conditions.9 Short statements also make it harder for the public to see the linkage\nbetween economic developments and policy action or inaction. When members of the public don’t\nunderstand the rationale for policy decisions, it can leave them with the impression that policymakers are\nacting in a discretionary manner and that lessens credibility.\n\nIn my view, it would be preferable for policymakers to take control of the narrative by using more words\nto describe the current assessment of economic developments, how they have influenced the outlook, and\nthe risks to that outlook. Putting somewhat less weight on the modal outlook and more on potential risks\nto the outlook would help the public understand that if certain risks are realized, policy may have to\ndeviate from the previously communicated modal path. It would give market participants and the general\npublic a better sense of the contingent, data-dependent nature of policymaking and would raise the central\nbank’s credibility in that a change in policy would be seen less as a breach of promise. Scenario analysis\nshould also be incorporated as a standard part of communications.10 This could be particularly useful in\nperiods like today when the underlying structural elements of the economy may have changed.\n(2) Connect the dots: My second suggestion is for the FOMC to connect the participants’ policy\npath dots and their economic projections in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).11 In other\nwords, the FOMC should publish the anonymized matrix of economic and policy projections so that\n\n“Transitory” was removed as a characterization of inflation in the FOMC’s December 2021 statement. Year-overyear PCE inflation had been running above 3 percent since April 2021.\n9\n\n10\n\nI discussed this recommendation in Mester (2023).\n\nIn his review of the Bank of England’s forecasting and communications, Bernanke (2024) suggests including\nanalyses of alternative scenarios in both internal discussions and as part of communications to the public. Such\nalternative scenarios could illuminate salient risks to the outlook when economic conditions evolve differently than\nexpected or the underlying structure of the economy differs from what is assumed in the models.\n11\n\nI discussed this recommendation in Mester (2018).\n\n\f6\nmarket participants can see the linkage between each participant’s outlook and his or her view of\nappropriate monetary policy associated with that outlook. Currently, the variables in the SEP are not\nlinked across participants, and the median paths provided don’t necessarily represent a coherent forecast.\nFor example, there is no guarantee that someone projecting the median inflation path would necessarily\nbe projecting the median output path. There is no way for the public to know whether a person low in the\nrange of unemployment rate forecasts is high in the range of inflation projections. And two participants\ncould project the same federal funds rate paths, but those paths could be associated with very different\neconomic forecasts. If we were to connect the dots to the forecasts within the SEP, the public would get a\nbetter sense of each individual policymaker’s reaction function.\n\nOf course, broader enhancements to communications should be considered, including reconsidering the\nformulation of a consensus forecast of the FOMC, providing more information on how the FOMC\nconsiders financial stability issues when setting monetary policy, the interplay between balance-sheet\npolicy and interest-rate policy, and the use of simple monetary policy rules as benchmarks for explaining\npolicy decisions.12 Enhancements to communications would make monetary policy more effective in\nnormal times and also improve the effectiveness of nonconventional policy tools, such as forward\nguidance, in extraordinary times. I expect that the FOMC will consider communications as part of its\nnext monetary policy framework review, given the central role communications play in the\nimplementation of monetary policy.\n\n12\n\nIn 2012, the FOMC experimented with developing a forecast representing the consensus of the Committee. I\ndiscuss the benefits and challenges of formulating a consensus FOMC forecast in Mester (2016).\n\n\f7\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., “Forecasting for Monetary Policy Making and Communication at the Bank of England:\nA Review,” April 12, 2024.\n(https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/independent-evaluation-office/forecasting-for-monetary-policymaking-and-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review/forecasting-for-monetary-policy-makingand-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review)\nCarlson, Mark, Gauti Eggertsson, and Elmar Mertens, “2.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBriefings for Business\nWayne Economic Development Council\nWooster, OH\nMay 16, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Wayne Economic Development Council for inviting me to speak on the economy and\nmonetary policy in the council’s Briefings for Business series. The council’s work to foster economic\ndevelopment in the region aligns with the Federal Reserve’s mission to foster a strong economy.\n\nEddie Steiner is an active member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Board of Directors, and\nchairs the Board’s Audit Committee, and Steve Matthew, who will be moderating the question-andanswer portion of today’s session, is an active member of our Northeast Ohio Business Advisory Council.\nI will take this opportunity to thank them for their public service, which helps our Bank fulfill its mission.\nI also thank the many others in this room who regularly provide us with insights into economic\nconditions. These insights help to inform the Cleveland Fed’s section of the Beige Book, the summary of\nregional economic developments published by the Federal Reserve prior to each FOMC meeting. The\nreconnaissance that you provide on business activity, the labor market, community conditions, and\nfinancial conditions is often more timely than the official data, and it helps us evaluate not only where the\neconomy is but where it is going. You play a role in monetary policymaking because the information you\nprovide informs my views of the economy and monetary policy, and it helps the FOMC make more\ninformed monetary policy decisions in pursuit of its statutory goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment.\n\nI am especially looking forward to the question-and-answer portion of our session because I learn a lot\nfrom hearing what is on your mind. But before we get into today’s dialogue, I thought it would be helpful\nto frame the discussion by offering some remarks about the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the\nviews I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f2\nEconomic Developments\nAt our FOMC meeting about two weeks ago, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the\nfederal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings. We have held our policy rate at this restrictive level since July of last year.\n\nThe FOMC reiterated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until the\nCommittee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our goal of 2\npercent. Substantial progress has been made on the inflation front since inflation peaked in 2022, in the\nrange of 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure. In the second half of last year, inflation readings came\nin lower than expected, and PCE inflation was running at about our 2 percent goal over those six months.\nBut the year-over-year measures of inflation remained elevated, and we knew it was too soon to declare\nvictory over inflation. Over the first three months of this year, we have seen no further progress on PCE\ninflation. In fact, measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation moved up to 2.7 percent in March and\ncore PCE inflation remained at 2.8 percent. The three-month changes are running considerably above the\nlevels seen over the second half of last year. Over the past three months, PCE inflation in core goods and\nPCE inflation in core services excluding housing have moved up, and housing services inflation has\nmoved sideways. Yesterday’s CPI inflation report is the first inflation reading for April. We saw a\nwelcome tick down in the monthly readings for total and core CPI inflation, though those readings were\nhigher than those we saw in the second half of last year.\n\nI had expected the progress on inflation to slow this year compared to last year, because I didn’t think we\nwould get as much help from supply-side adjustments. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have\nimproved over the past three years and the labor market has been normalizing. People have returned to\nthe labor force over time, and immigration has also increased the supply of labor. The healing of the\nsupply side of the economy contributed to last year’s disinflation, and we are not likely to get as much\n\n\f3\nhelp on inflation from the supply side as we saw last year. Progress will depend more on moderating\ndemand.\n\nStill, the lack of progress on inflation so far this year has been disappointing. I think it is too early to\nconclude that progress on inflation has stalled out or that inflation is poised to reverse course: the journey\nback to price stability was never expected to follow a smooth path. But the recent readings have not\ninspired greater confidence in me, and we will need to accumulate further data over the coming months to\nhave a clearer picture of the inflation outlook. I now believe that it will take longer to reach our 2 percent\ngoal than I previously thought. But the Fed remains strongly committed to returning the economy to\nprice stability.\n\nThe good news is that the economy is well positioned to allow us to accumulate those data without\nconcern that monetary policy is overly restrictive. A remarkable thing about last year’s disinflation is that\nit occurred in the midst of strong economic growth and labor markets. Last year, the economy grew at a\npace above 3 percent, which is higher than my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. Indicators point to\ncontinued underlying momentum in the economy this year. According to the advance estimate, GDP\ngrowth did moderate to a 1.6 percent pace in the first quarter. But that step down reflected the inventory\nand trade components, which are often revised in subsequent releases as more data come in. Final sales to\nprivate domestic purchasers, which is a better indicator of underlying demand, continued to rise at a pace\nof around 3 percent. Consumer spending has remained healthy, despite rising credit card delinquency\nrates, and business fixed investment in equipment and software has strengthened, consistent with the\nanecdotal evidence from business contacts. Indeed, leading up to the FOMC meeting two weeks ago,\nthere was a significant change in tone from the contacts in our District. Many reported that economic\nactivity had strengthened and by more than they had anticipated.\n\n\f4\nLabor market conditions also remain strong. Payroll job growth has been remarkably resilient. Job gains\naveraged about 270 thousand per month in the first quarter of this year compared to around 210 thousand\nper month the previous quarter. Employment did moderate last month to a still healthy gain of 175\nthousand. The unemployment rate remains low, at 3.9 percent in April. Still, the labor market has come\ninto better balance over time as demand for workers has moderated while the supply has increased. The\ngap between the number of open jobs and the number of unemployed workers has narrowed. It is now\nabout 1.3, only slightly above the 1.2 level seen in the strong labor market conditions in 2019. Our\nregional contacts report that while it remains difficult to find candidates with the skills needed for some\njobs, in general, it has become easier to hire over time.\n\nAs labor demand has come into better balance with labor supply, wage pressures have eased. Firms in\nour District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down from 5 percent a year\nago. And the wage premium workers can get from switching jobs compared to staying in their current\njobs has moved back down to pre-pandemic levels.1 It had shot up after the pandemic shutdown when\nfirms were in desperate need of workers.\n\nWhether wage growth adds to price pressures depends on whether wages adjusted for inflation are\ngrowing faster than the growth in labor productivity. Based on current estimates of trend productivity\ngrowth, which lie in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range, wage growth is still above the level consistent with 2\npercent inflation.2 But there is the possibility that changes in technology are leading to higher trend\nproductivity growth. The scarcity of workers during the pandemic gave firms a great incentive to invest\n\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker at https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growthtracker.\n1\n\n2\n\nCurrent estimates suggest that trend productivity growth remains relatively low, in the 1 to 1.5 percent range. See\nthe website https://sites.google.com/view/james-a-kahn-economics/home/trend-productivity-update, which provides\nthe latest estimates of trend productivity growth based on the model in James A. Kahn and Robert W. Rich,\n“Tracking the New Economy: Using Growth Theory to Detect Changes in Trend Productivity,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics 54, September 2007, pp. 1670-1701. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2006.07.008)\n\n\f5\nin automation, and new technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing productivity\nover the medium to longer run. If the higher productivity growth readings we saw last year are sustained,\nthen current levels of wage growth could continue without adding to price pressures.\n\nThe Economy in Ohio\nThe current developments in activity, employment, and inflation at the national level are also reflected in\nOhio’s economy. As in the nation, labor market conditions in the state remain strong but show some\nsigns of moderating. The state’s unemployment rate has ticked up this year, but stood at 3.8 percent in\nMarch, which is near its historical low. Employment growth over the first three months of the year has\nslowed from last year’s strong pace. And as I mentioned, employers in the state tell us it is easier to hire\nnow. Immigration has likely contributed to that easing. Last year, immigration was the main driver of an\nincrease in Ohio’s population, the first yearly rise in population since the pandemic.3 All in all, we have\nseen strong labor market performance in the state.\n\nOhio is the seventh largest economy in the nation in terms of gross state product. Manufacturing and,\nwithin manufacturing, auto and auto parts constitute an important sector of Ohio’s economy, and\ncompared to the nation, manufacturing represents a larger share of payroll jobs in Ohio. But that\ndifferential has fallen over time as the economy here has diversified from one largely dependent on\nmanufacturing and heavy industry to one in which healthcare and education play a significant role. In the\n1990s, manufacturing represented about 20 percent of Ohio’s jobs and “eds and meds” represented about\n12 percent. Those shares have now nearly reversed. In the past decade, the share of jobs in\n\nSee William H. Frey, “Immigration is Driving the Nation’s Modest Post-Pandemic Population Growth, New\nCensus Data Shows,” The Brookings Institution, January 4, 2024 (https://www.brookings.edu/articles/immigrationis-driving-the-nations-modest-post-pandemic-population-growth-new-census-data-shows/).\n3\n\n\f6\nmanufacturing has fallen to under 13 percent and the share in “eds and meds” has risen to nearly 17\npercent.4\n\nRegions that have diversified their industrial base have generally fared better over time and have proven\nto be more resilient. But the types of shocks that hit the economy can have differential effects on regions\nbecause of differences in their industrial makeup. For example, the healthcare sector was particularly\nhard hit by the pandemic. The labor market in healthcare remains particularly tight, with nurses expected\nto remain in short supply for some time to come. But, even within healthcare, our contacts report that\nthey have seen some improvement in hiring and some normalization in wage growth.\n\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nIn my view, the most likely scenario for the overall economy and that of the region is that the current\nrestrictive stance of monetary policy will continue to help moderate growth and labor market conditions\nand that this moderation will contribute to the further easing of price pressures. So I expect progress on\ninflation over time, but at a slower pace than we saw last year. Analysis at the Cleveland Fed indicates\nthat the past slowdown in wage growth will pass through to lower price inflation in core services and that\nthe declines that have occurred in rents in new leases will pass through to slower inflation in housing\nservices. Both of these effects will be needed in order to get back to 2 percent inflation, but they will take\nsome time.\n\nSetting monetary policy in this environment will take careful consideration of the risks to both parts of\nour dual mandate as the economy evolves. Recent data showing solid growth and labor market indicators\n\n4\n\nOver the past decade (2014Q2 through 2024Q1), the share of jobs in manufacturing was 8.5 percent for the U.S.\nand 12.5 percent for Ohio. In the 1990s (1990Q1 through 1999Q4), the share of jobs in manufacturing was 14.8\npercent for the U.S. and 19.9 percent for Ohio.\n\n\f7\nsuggest that risks to the employment part of our mandate have diminished. But the recent inflation\nreadings suggest that risks to the inflation part of our mandate have risen.\n\nI am particularly attuned to the upside risks to inflation. Geopolitical tensions have the potential to\nfurther raise oil prices and other commodity prices, or to disrupt supply chains. The shortage of housing\ncould keep housing services inflation elevated even though rents have been falling. Medium- and longerterm inflation expectations are important determinants of actual inflation. These expectations have\nremained reasonably well-anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal throughout this\nhigh-inflation episode, and that anchoring has been an important contributor to the disinflation we have\nseen over time. Nonetheless, recent readings on short-term inflation expectations have moved up again.\nWere this increase to spread to longer-term expectations, it would be considerably harder to reach our\ninflation goal. So setting monetary policy to ensure that those expectations remain well-anchored will be\nvery important.\n\nThe FOMC’s job continues to be to assess the implications of economic and financial developments for\nthe outlook and risks around the outlook and, given that assessment, to calibrate monetary policy so that\ninflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy. The actual path\nmonetary policy takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves; this is the data dependence\npolicymakers often refer to. Our current monetary policy stance puts us in a good position for managing\nthe risks that could be realized. Moving rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence to\ngive us confidence that inflation is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent would risk undoing\nthe progress we have made on inflation. And with labor markets and economic growth both being very\nsolid, we do not need to take that risk.\n\nIncoming economic information indicates that it will take longer to gain that confidence; holding our\nrestrictive stance for longer is prudent at this point as we gain clarity about the path of inflation. Once the\n\n\f8\nFOMC gains confidence that inflation is moving sustainably back to 2 percent, it will be in a position to\nbegin to gradually normalize policy back to a neutral level as the economy returns to price stability and\nmaximum employment. While it is not my base case, should developments in inflation and inflation\nexpectations warrant it, policymakers will need to be open to tightening policy further. On the other\nhand, if the labor market unexpectedly deteriorates, policy could ease sooner and by more than currently\nanticipated. So monetary policy is well positioned for risk management as we gather more evidence on\nhow the economy is evolving.\n\nThe FOMC remains fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal because price stability is\ncritical for the long-run health of the labor market, the overall economy, and the stability of the financial\nsystem. As we have seen since the pandemic, high inflation can badly affect people’s lives and their view\nof the country’s economic well being. At a recent meeting of our Business Advisory Council, we\ndiscussed the fact that even though the labor market is strong and inflation is down from its peak, many\npeople are not very happy about the economy. Indeed, consumer sentiment and confidence indices are\nwell below their pre-pandemic levels. I believe dissatisfaction with the economy partly reflects the fact\nthat even though inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been relatively high for some\npeople, prices for many things are higher now than before the pandemic and many workers’ wages\nhaven’t kept up with inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price\nlevel is moving up faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higherthan-desired prices. As inflation has been moving down, wages adjusted for inflation, that is, real wages,\nhave begun to move up. As the disinflation process continues, it will help to close the gap between the\ncumulative increase in prices and the cumulative increase in wages, and people will then begin to feel\nthey have made up for lost ground.5\n\n5\n\nSince the first quarter of 2021, when inflation began to rise, PCE inflation has been running at an annualized pace\nof 4.7 percent. Workers’ compensation (as measured by the employment cost index for civilian workers’\ncompensation) has risen at an annualized rate of 4.5 percent. So there is still a gap, but that gap has been closing\nover time as inflation has moved down.\n\n\f9\n\nI believe another reason people are not happy with the economy is that it is much harder to purchase a\nhouse than it used to be. The median price of a home in the U.S. is now almost 50 percent higher than it\nwas prior to the pandemic.6 Thirty-year mortgage rates are now over 7 percent; prior to the pandemic\nthey were under 4 percent. A recent survey of consumers by the New York Fed found that renters believe\nthe probability of their ever owning a home has fallen to 40 percent, which is the lowest level since the\nquestion was first asked in 2015.7 Owning a house is an important avenue for building wealth but many\npeople feel this part of the American dream is out of reach, at least for now, and that isn't a good feeling.\n\nI am hopeful, though, that the economy will evolve as expected and as inflation returns to our target,\neconomic conditions continue to normalize, and labor markets remain healthy, more people will be able\nto enjoy the benefits of what a strong U.S. economy has to offer.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n6\n\nAccording to data from the National Association of Realtors, the median price of an existing single-family home\nwas $272,800 in February 2020 and was $397,200 in March 2024. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price\nindex, which is a repeat-sales index and so controls for the composition of single-family homes sold, is also up\nalmost 50 percent over its pre-pandemic level.\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations Housing Survey at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/housing%20.html#/.\n7\n\n\f"

        "content": "An Update on the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNational Association for Business Economics, Cleveland Association for Business Economics,\nand Team NEO\nCleveland, OH\nApril 2, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a real pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. I thank the National\nAssociation for Business Economics, its Cleveland Chapter, Team NEO, David Altig, and Bill Koehler\nfor the opportunity to speak with you about the economy. Dave and I go back a long way – perhaps too\nlong for me to admit to. We worked together when we were both research directors, Dave at the Atlanta\nFed and me at the Philadelphia Fed. Dave is a first-rate economist, so I know he will keep me on my toes\nas he moderates this session.\n\nBefore we get into today’s question and answer portion, I thought it would be helpful to frame the\ndiscussion by offering a few brief remarks about the economy and monetary policy. I will start by\nreminding everyone that what I say today will be my views and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Developments\nSubstantial progress has been made on the inflation front since inflation peaked in 2022, in the range of 7\nto 9 percent, depending on the measure. But inflation is still above our 2 percent objective. PCE\ninflation is now running about 2-1/2 percent, whether it is measured year-over-year or over the past six\nmonths, annualized. And core PCE inflation is running about 2-3/4 percent, measured year-over-year,\nand near 3 percent, annualized, over the past six months. The monthly inflation readings in January and\nFebruary came in firmer than the readings over the second half of last year and are a good reminder of\nwhat we already knew: that the disinflation process will not be a smooth path back to 2 percent.\n\nIn my view, the inflation picture has not changed very much since the start of the year, because I had\nalready thought that the pace of disinflation would slow down this year. I continue to think that the most\nlikely scenario is that inflation will continue on its downward trajectory to 2 percent over time. But I\nneed to see more data to raise my confidence. Some further monthly readings will give us a better sense\n\n\f2\nof whether the disinflation process is stalling out or whether the start-of-the-year readings reflect a\ntemporary detour on the downward path back to price stability. I do not expect I will have enough\ninformation by the time of the FOMC’s next meeting to make that determination.\n\nA remarkable thing about the disinflation is that it has occurred in the midst of strong labor markets and\neconomic growth. While the broader tightening in financial conditions over time has led to some\nmoderation in the growth of output and employment, both have remained stronger than expected. That\nrelatively strong demand confronts a supply side of the economy that is healing. Supply chain disruptions\nand bottlenecks have improved over the past three years and the labor market is normalizing. People have\nreturned to the labor force over time, and immigration has also increased the supply of labor. With\nimbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets easing, inflation has\nbeen easing as well. Now that pressures on supply chains are approaching normal and the labor market is\ncoming into better balance, we are not likely to get as much help on inflation from the supply side as we\nsaw last year.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nI have revised up my projection of growth for the year based on the incoming economic information,\nincluding the official statistics and also the reports we receive from our directors and regional contacts,\nwhich are forward looking. In the most likely scenario, I still expect growth to moderate compared to last\nyear’s very rapid pace. But instead of the economy growing under trend this year, I now expect it will\ngrow a bit above my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. I expect the labor market to continue to come\ninto better balance this year, with a slight uptick in the unemployment rate from its current very low level.\nAnd I expect further progress on inflation but at a slower pace than we saw last year. If the economy\nevolves as expected, then in my view it will be appropriate for the FOMC to begin reducing the fed funds\nrate later this year, as inflation continues on its downward path toward 2 percent, and labor markets and\neconomic growth remain solid. These reductions should be viewed as a normalization of policy back to a\n\n\f3\nneutral level as the economy returns to price stability and maximum employment. But, of course, the\nactual path of policy will depend on how the economy actually evolves.\n\nMy forecast is similar to the median among the FOMC participants in the Summary of Economic\nProjections that were released after our March meeting,1 except that I see somewhat higher inflation this\nyear. In my projection, I have also raised my estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate to 3 percent\ncompared with 2.5 percent, which had been my estimate for some time. I raised my estimate to reflect the\ncontinued resilience in the economy despite high nominal interest rates and higher model-based estimates\nof the equilibrium interest rate, r-star.\n\nI have been discussing my view of the most likely scenario, but there are several risks to the forecast,\nincluding continued heightened geopolitical tensions, slow growth of the Chinese economy, potential\ndeterioration in conditions in commercial real estate markets, renewed stresses in financial markets, and,\non the upside, the possibility of stronger than expected productivity growth.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAt its meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to keep the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and reiterated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until\nthe Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\n\nWith inflation now moving closer to our goal, the risks to achieving both parts of our dual mandate have\nbecome more balanced. When we were tightening policy, we needed to focus on the inflation part of our\nmandate, because inflation was so high and the labor market was strong. Now, risk management with\nrespect to both parts of our mandate will need to be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going\n\n1\n\nSee Summary of Economic Projections, March 20, 2024.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20240320.pdf)\n\n\f4\nforward. If year-ahead inflation expectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the\nnominal fed funds rate for too long would effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would\npose an increasing risk to the maximum employment part of our mandate. On the other hand, moving\nrates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence to give us confidence that inflation is on a\nsustainable and timely path back to 2 percent would risk undoing the progress we have made on inflation.\nAt this point, I think the bigger risk would be to begin reducing the funds rate too early. And with labor\nmarkets and economic growth both being very solid, we do not need to take that risk.\n\nOur current monetary policy stance puts us in a good position for managing risks that could manifest\nthemselves on either side. If the labor market deteriorates, we can move rates down sooner and more\nquickly than in our baseline. Rather than view this as a normalization, the intention would be to return to\nan accommodative stance of monetary policy to support the economy. On the other hand, if inflation\nappears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we can hold our restrictive stance for longer than in the\nbaseline.\n\nIn contrast to where we are now, our policy was not well positioned when we started our tightening cycle\nbecause the policy rate was so low and inflation was moving up persistently. We needed to raise rates\nfairly aggressively. At this point, we are seeking to calibrate our policy well to economic developments\nso we can avoid having to act in an aggressive fashion. Indeed, if the economy evolves as I expect, I\nanticipate that we will be able to move rates down gradually as inflation and inflation expectations move\ndown, allowing us to continue to manage the risks to both sides of our mandate.\n\nBut let me reiterate: the actual path of policy will depend on how the economy actually evolves. The\nFOMC’s job continues to be to assess the implications of economic and financial developments for the\noutlook and risks around the outlook and, given that assessment, to calibrate monetary policy so that\ninflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy.\n\n\f5\n\nThis concludes my brief prepared remarks. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe European Economics and Financial Centre\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\nLondon, U.K.\n(via videoconference)\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a real pleasure to speak with the European Economics and Financial Centre once again. I especially\nlook forward to taking your questions because I learn a lot from hearing what is on your mind. Let me\nhelp frame our discussion by giving some brief remarks about the U.S. economy and monetary policy. Of\ncourse, these will be my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe economy and monetary policy have been on quite a journey since I last spoke to you two years ago.\nToday, I would say that both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place. Inflation is still\nabove our goal of 2 percent, but it has moved down a lot from its peak in 2022, when inflation hit a 40year high, in the range of 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure. Remarkably, this disinflation has\noccurred in the midst of strong labor markets and economic growth. The FOMC’s job now is to ensure\nthat the economy reaches an even better place by calibrating monetary policy so that inflation returns\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy.\n\nEconomic Developments\nOver the past four years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been the major forces shaping economic\ndevelopments and the major sources of uncertainty about the economy. Those forces have made it hard to\ntrack the economy because both supply and demand have been affected. Usually, it’s all about demand.\nBut the pandemic affected global supply chains, the supply of and demand for labor, and the mix of\nhousehold and business spending on housing, goods, and services.\n\nImbalances between supply and demand in both product and labor markets led to significant upward\npressure on prices, and inflation began to rise in April 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February\n2022, an ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and\nother commodities. In response to the high inflation, the FOMC began raising its policy rate, the federal\nfunds rate, in March 2022, and over the two years since, the Committee significantly tightened the stance\n\n\f2\nof monetary policy by raising the fed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. The Fed is also\nreducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the\nplan announced in May 2022. The tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in\nfinancial conditions over time, and, in response, aggregate demand has begun to moderate. The supply\nside of the economy is also healing. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have improved\nsignificantly, and firms have invested in diversifying their supply chains, making them more resilient to\ndisruptions. The labor market is normalizing. People have returned to the labor force over time, and the\nlabor force participation rate of people aged 25 to 54 is now slightly above its pre-pandemic level. With\nimbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets easing, inflation has\nbeen easing, too.\n\nI expect growth to moderate this year compared to its strong pace last year. Consumer spending has held\nup well, but in the wake of high prices, many families, especially those with lower incomes, are being\nmore cautious with their spending. There has been an uptick in credit card debt, suggesting that some\nhouseholds have exhausted their ready cash balances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have also edged\nup, although they are still at low levels. Businesses also slowed their spending on equipment and\nsoftware last year, and this spending is expected to continue to moderate given restrictive credit\nconditions. Tighter financial conditions have restrained investment in housing. Sales of existing homes\nare at low levels, but sales of new single-family homes were fairly resilient given the longer-term\nshortage of available housing. The shortfall in housing supply has kept home prices relatively high, but\nrents, especially for new tenants, have moved down and that should lead to the continued tempering of\ninflation in housing services.\n\nJob growth has been remarkably resilient. The unemployment rate has been 3.7 percent over the past\nthree months and it has been within range of its 50-year low for almost two years. I expect conditions in\nlabor markets to remain healthy but to moderate a bit. Our contacts tell us that, except for the healthcare\n\n\f3\nsector, it is easier to hire than it was a year ago and that they are getting more applicants per job opening.\nThe pace of job quits has also declined since peaking in 2022.\n\nBetter balance between the supply and demand for workers has meant wage growth has slowed. Firms in\nour District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down from 5 percent a year\nago, but still above pre-pandemic levels. Based on current estimates of trend productivity growth, wage\ngrowth is still a bit above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation. But it could be that trend\nproductivity growth has moved higher than what it was before the pandemic. Workers were scarce during\nthe pandemic, giving firms a great incentive to do more with fewer workers; many companies invested in\nautomation. New technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing productivity over the\nmedium to longer run. If so, then wages would be able to rise at a faster rate and still be consistent with\nprice stability.\n\nIt is interesting that despite the labor market’s strong performance, until recently, surveys of consumers\nindicated that most people were not very happy about the economy. I believe that partly reflects the fact\nthat even though inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been relatively high, prices for\nmany things are higher than they were before the pandemic and many people’s wages haven’t kept up\nwith inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is moving\nup faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higher-than-desired prices.\nWith inflation moving down, wages adjusted for inflation, that is, real wages, have begun to move up, and\nthis is helping to close the gap between the cumulative increase in prices and the cumulative increase in\nwages. This may be partly why consumers are feeling better about the economy now.\n\nInflation\nInflation moved down faster than expected last year even as the economy remained strong. Measured\nyear-over-year, as of January, total PCE inflation was 2.4 percent, core PCE inflation was 2.8 percent, and\nthe Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure was 3.5 percent.\n\n\f4\n\nBut the January inflation report shows that we need to be cautious in assuming that inflation will continue\nto fall at the same pace as last year. Restrictive monetary policy has played an important role in moving\ninflation down, but supply-side adjustments have also been important. Now that pressures on supply\nchains are approaching normal and the labor market is coming into better balance, I don’t think we should\ncount on as much help from the supply side as we saw last year.\n\nEven so, I do expect inflation to continue to move down over time to our 2 percent goal, even if it proves\nto be somewhat more persistent this year than last year. Anchored inflation expectations are an important\ncomponent of that forecast. Medium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably wellanchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. One-year-ahead inflation\nexpectations have also moved down over time but are still above their 2019 averages. Continued progress\non inflation will help ensure that these expectations move down to our goal. Progress depends on\nappropriate monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAt its meeting in January, the FOMC kept the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent,\nwhere it has been since last July. The Committee said that it does not expect it will be appropriate to\nreduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2\npercent. The Fed has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. When we began this\ntightening cycle, inflation was far above our goal and labor markets were strong. So it was clear we\nneeded to focus on the price stability part of our mandate. Now, with inflation moving closer to our goal,\nwe need to balance the risks to achieving both sides of our dual mandate when determining the\nappropriate stance of policy.\n\nRisk management will be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going forward. If year-ahead\ninflation expectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the nominal fed funds rate for\n\n\f5\ntoo long would effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would pose an increasing risk to the\nmaximum employment part of our mandate. But at this point, I think the bigger mistake would be to\nmove rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence that inflation is on a sustainable and\ntimely path back to 2 percent. Doing so would undermine all of the good work that has gone into getting\ninflation to this point. We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where we begin easing too soon,\nundo some of the progress we have made on inflation, potentially destabilize inflation expectations, and\nthen have to reverse course. And with labor markets and economic growth both being very solid, we\ndon’t need to take that risk.\n\nMy baseline forecast is that output and employment will moderate somewhat this year and inflation will\ncontinue to move closer to our 2 percent goal over time. I will gain confidence when I see inflation\ncontinuing to move down. The FOMC will then be in a position to start reducing the level of\nrestrictiveness by moving the fed funds rate down. If the economy performs as anticipated, I expect we\nwill find ourselves in that position sometime later this year. My base case is that when we do begin to\nmove rates down, we will do so at a gradual pace so that we can continue to manage the risks to both\nsides of our mandate.\n\nBut this all depends on the economy evolving as expected. And there are a number of risks around this\nforecast. Heightened geopolitical tensions pose potential implications for financial markets, oil prices,\nand global demand and supply. Easing financial conditions could spur a resurgence in activity, leading\nonce again to imbalances that fuel inflation. The stress generated by the bank failures last March has\nsubsided and many banks have diversified their sources of liquidity, making them less vulnerable. But\nstress could come again to banks that continue to rely on uninsured deposits for their funding while\nhaving sizable exposures to commercial real estate assets that will need to be repriced at higher interest\nrates. We also know that monetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial\nconditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature\nof the shocks that have hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment. So while labor\n\n\f6\nmarkets are currently strong and are expected to only gradually moderate, we need to remain attentive to\nthe possibility that conditions could deteriorate faster than expected. On the other hand, the strong output\nand employment growth could be an indication that the neutral rate of interest, which rose during the\npandemic, might remain high. This would mean policy might be less restrictive than we think it is and\nthat restrictive policy may be needed for longer than anticipated to achieve our goals of price stability and\nmaximum employment.\n\nThe good news is that monetary policy is in a good place from which to assess and respond to these risks\nto the outlook. Because of the current strength in labor market conditions and the strong spending data,\nwe have the luxury of keeping rates where they are as we gather more evidence that inflation truly is on a\nsustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. If downside risks materialize, we would have the\nopportunity to move rates down more quickly, just as we raised rates more aggressively than usual to\ncombat rising inflation. On the other hand, if inflation appears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we\nwould have the opportunity to maintain a restrictive stance for longer. Our policy actions will depend on\nhow the economy and the risks actually evolve. When our goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment are achieved, the economy will be in an even better place than it is today.\n\nOperating Framework\nLet me conclude with some remarks about the Fed’s balance sheet. At our meeting later this month, the\nFOMC will begin to discuss reducing the pace of the runoff in its balance-sheet assets. Since June 2022,\nthe Fed has been allowing maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to run off its\nbalance sheet at a fairly good clip according to the plan announced in May 2022. The Fed’s holdings of\nsecurities total about $7 trillion and have declined by about $1.4 trillion since the runoff began.\n\nWe are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating regime. In this regime, reserve\nlevels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is\nexecuted primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates: the interest rate paid on bank reserves,\n\n\f7\nthe interest rate offered on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs), and the primary credit\nrate on discount window loans. Under this framework, active management of the supply of reserves is\nnot needed.\n\nAs assets run off our balance sheet, Fed liabilities move down. So far, rather than a reduction in reserves,\nrunoff has resulted in a reduction in ON RRPs, with balances currently under $575 billion. In aggregate,\nreserve balances are about $3.5 trillion, which is about 15 percent of banking system assets. What\nconstitutes an ample level of reserves is uncertain. It depends on the banking sector’s demand for\nreserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. The\ncurrent level is more than ample, but as balance-sheet runoff continues and ON RRP volume reaches a\nminimum level, reserves will begin declining, too, and more redistribution of reserves will need to occur\nacross institutions. So at some point the FOMC will slow the pace of runoff and then stop the runoff\nwhen reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample. This will help\nensure that we can continue to reduce our balance sheet to its efficient size for effectively implementing\nmonetary policy. It will also help us move toward our longer-run goal of holding primarily Treasury\nsecurities, thereby minimizing the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. I note that the\nrunoff pace pertains to how we implement monetary policy and not to the stance of monetary policy. Our\nmain tool of monetary policy is the fed funds rate target, and balance-sheet runoff can continue even after\nwe begin to lower the funds rate.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Address\nColumbia University/Bank Policy Institute 2024 Bank Regulation Research Conference\nColumbia University\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Trish Mosser and the organizers at Columbia University and the Bank Policy Institute for inviting\nme to speak today. I received my undergraduate degree from Barnard College, and it is nice to be back\non campus. I appreciate that this conference brings together academic researchers, industry practitioners,\nand policymakers to discuss research pertinent to financial regulation. I am a firm believer that research\nshould inform policymaking. Academic research has greatly expanded our understanding of how\nsystemic risks can build up and propagate throughout the economy. It informed the regulatory reforms\nput in place after the global financial crisis, and it should continue to guide regulatory changes going\nforward. At the same time, we know that models cannot capture all aspects of the real-world financial\nsystem. Decisions have to be made in a world that doesn’t match our models and without all the\ninformation we would like to have. So the experience of practitioners, in addition to research, has to\ninform regulation and policy. There are many open issues regarding best practices and policies to\npromote financial resilience, and my hope is that academic researchers will continue to push the frontier\nforward. This conference provides an excellent forum to capture the synergies between research,\npractice, and policy.\n\nToday I will speak about financial system resilience, with a focus on the banking system. The views I\npresent will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Resilience in a Dynamic Economy\nIn less than two decades, the world has experienced two historically deep negative shocks to the global\neconomy and financial system. While their causes were different, the global financial crisis of 2008 and\nthe COVID-19 pandemic that hit in 2020 each necessitated the intervention of central banks in ways not\ncontemplated in earlier decades. Last spring, the Fed was required to intervene again to address stresses\nin the banking system precipitated by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.\n\n\f2\n\nThe global financial crisis followed a period of low interest rates in the first half of the 2000s. The\nstresses of last March occurred in an environment of high and rising interest rates. This is a reminder that\nregardless of the interest-rate environment, financial system vulnerabilities can help propagate adverse\nshocks across the financial system and sometimes very quickly. Indeed, both bankers and supervisors\nwere caught off guard by the speed with which deposits flowed out of Silicon Valley Bank. Over $40\nbillion of deposits left the bank on March 9, 2023, and another $100 billion was expected to leave the\nnext day, making the two-day total about 85 percent of the bank’s deposits. In comparison, when\nWachovia failed in 2008, the deposit outflow was lower and slower: about $10 billion flowed out over\neight days.\n\nThe failure of SVB was a classic situation but in a new environment. An underlying factor in SVB’s\nfailure was the bank’s poor management of interest-rate risk, one of the traditional risks we look to banks\nto manage. But the poor management was revealed as the Fed raised interest rates more aggressively than\nusual in response to very high inflation: in the year before the bank failed, the Fed had raised its policy\nrate by 450 basis points. Similarly, SVB suffered a classic bank run, but instead of people lining up at the\nbank to withdraw deposits, the run was aided and abetted by social media that quickly spread news about\nthe bank and by depositors’ ability to move money electronically and very quickly.\n\nAn important lesson is that bankers’ risk management and supervisors’ risk monitoring need to be much\nmore dynamic than they used to be because the economic and financial environment has become more\ndynamic. The demarcation between illiquidity and insolvency is fluid. A temporary liquidity problem at\none institution, if not addressed in a timely manner, can morph into a solvency problem that can spread to\nother institutions and become amplified throughout the system. And this can happen more rapidly than in\nthe past given the rise in interconnectedness and changes in technology. In other words, “timely manner”\nis quicker than it used to be. Bank supervisors need to monitor not only risks that are developing at\n\n\f3\nindividual institutions but also risks that are seen across similar types of institutions throughout the\nsystem; supervisors need to emphasize both micro- and macro supervision.\n\nWhile risk management was at the heart of the bank failures of last year, weaknesses in supervision were\nalso revealed.1 As the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision noted in recent remarks at the Columbia Law\nSchool, the Federal Reserve is taking steps to improve the speed, force, and agility of its supervision so\nthat supervisors take action as risks build up and pay greater attention to changes in the environment that\ncreate new risks.2\n\nRisk management and monitoring are part of a financial resilience framework aimed at ensuring that\nindividual financial institutions are able to withstand the inevitable economic and financial shocks that hit\nover time and that the entire financial system is resilient. Better resilience means less chance of fire sales\nof assets, runs on financial firms, shortages of liquid assets, or contraction of credit in the face of\nunknown counterparty risk. Better resilience will mean banks can continue to offer their important credit,\nliquidity, and payment services to creditworthy businesses and households during economic downturns\nand financial markets can continue intermediating in an orderly fashion during periods of stress.\n\nA resilient financial system also limits the times during which monetary policy and financial stability\ngoals come into conflict, so that monetary policy is not disrupted by financial system stress and can\ncontinue to transmit to the broader economy. Last March, financial stability tools were used to address\nstresses in the banking system. This allowed the Fed to continue to use its monetary policy tools for\n\nSee Michael S. Barr, “Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank,” April\n28, 2023 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf).\n1\n\nFor further discussion, see Michael S. Barr, “Supervision with Speed, Force, and Agility,” remarks at the Annual\nColumbia Law School Banking Conference, New York, NY, February 16, 2024\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/barr20240216a.pdf), and Michael S. Barr, “Supervision\nand Regulation,” testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate,\nWashington, D.C., November 14, 2023 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/barr20231113a.htm).\n2\n\n\f4\nmacroeconomic purposes, and we proceeded with an increase in the federal funds rate at our March 2023\nmeeting. But those financial stability tools involved regulators invoking the systemic risk exception and\nimplementing a new lending facility.3\n\nA more resilient financial system would diminish the need for the Fed and other regulators to have to step\nin, whether it be to reduce market dysfunction by buying Treasury assets, as we had to do in October\n2019 and March 2020, or having to set up special facilities to serve as the lender of last resort, actions that\nhave the potential to change the Fed into the lender of first resort.\n\nThe question is: how do we design a framework that promotes financial resilience in a dynamic economy?\nI believe that three principles from monetary policy can provide a useful starting point: (1) setting a wellarticulated and achievable goal for financial resilience, (2) being more systematic and less discretionary\nas we apply the tools of supervision and regulation, and (3) being more transparent so that market\ndiscipline can work in tandem with regulation and supervision. Let me turn to each of these.\n\nFinancial Resilience Goal\nI would like to see the U.S. articulate a goal for financial resilience. Markus Brunnermeier, a professor at\nPrinceton University, defines resilience as the ability to recover from a shock, like a reed that is able to\nwithstand strong winds by bending without breaking.4 He makes a distinction between risk management,\nwhich is concerned with how to manage potential shocks of different magnitudes and frequencies, and\nresilience management, which is concerned with how to adapt and recover once a shock hits. I think this\n\n3\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) on March 12, 2023\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm). The BTFP will cease making\nnew loans on March 11, 2024 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240124a.htm).\n4\n\nSee Markus K. Brunnermeier, The Resilient Society, Colorado Springs, CO: Endeavor Literary Press, 2021\n(https://markus.scholar.princeton.edu/news/resilient-society), and Markus K. Brunnermeier, “Macrofinance and\nResilience: 2024 American Finance Association Presidential Address,” San Antonio, TX, January 6, 2024\n(https://afajof.org/2024-annual-meeting-and-panel-sessions/).\n\n\f5\nis a useful distinction, and it reminds me of the evolution in the approach taken to address cybersecurity\nrisks. In the past, efforts focused squarely on building up the defenses around IT systems to prevent an\nattack. But as systems have become more complex and the avenues of attack have multiplied, efforts now\npay equal attention to resilience. Improving cybersecurity is now viewed as a battle on two fronts. You\nmust take actions to minimize the chances that your IT systems will be infiltrated but recognize that\nregardless of your strong defenses, some attackers will infiltrate; so, design your systems so that it is\nharder for the incursion to spread and so that you can resume operations quickly. Analogously, the\nregulatory reforms instituted after the global financial crisis were framed in terms of financial “stability.”\nNow, the discussion is framed in terms of “resilience.”\n\nIn the case of the financial system, a resilience goal has to recognize that banks are able to provide their\nvaluable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services because they are designed to take on risk and\nleverage. The goal of regulation and supervision cannot be to eliminate all volatility in markets or\nprevent all bank failures, since this would negate banking’s benefits to the economy, which come through\ntaking and managing risk. Instead, the goal should be to limit tail and systemic risks so that the financial\nsystem absorbs shocks rather than amplifies them, and so that the system can recover quickly and\ncontinue to provide its services across the business and financial cycles. Regulation and supervision can\ncontribute to financial system resilience, first, by lowering the probability that a shock will become\nsystemic, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the\nfinancial system.\n\nAppropriately calibrating regulation and supervision involves recognizing a tradeoff: tight regulation will\nlimit bank failures, but it will also limit risk-taking and innovation, raise the cost of intermediation, and\nput regulated institutions at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated firms, all of which\ncould undermine the banking system’s ability to serve its customers and support longer-run economic\ngrowth. Loose regulation will lead to a higher probability of multiple failures and/or more costly\n\n\f6\nsystemic events. This adversely affects economic growth in both the short and the longer run; research\nindicates that financial crises tend to make recessions worse and lead to permanent losses of output.5 It is\nalso important to recognize that the nature of the tradeoff is affected by the degree of resilience.\nIncreasing resilience will allow for more risk-taking and innovation ex ante because the financial system\nwill be able to recover from the shock with less cost to the real economy.\n\nTailoring regulation and supervision to risk\nThe reforms in regulation and supervision since the global financial crisis have increased the resilience of\nthe U.S. financial system. But the financial system is dynamic, and the nature of the shocks can change\nover time. So, continued focus on building resilience is warranted. To get the balance right between\nregulation and innovation, capital and liquidity requirements need to be tailored to the risks a banking\norganization poses to the financial system. Research and practice suggest these risks are likely to vary\naccording to the bank’s size, range of activities and funding sources, domestic and global\ninterconnectedness, complexity, and the extent to which there is a lack of readily available substitutes for\nthe services provided by the institution. Note that a matrix of factors determines riskiness, not a single\ncharacteristic. Tailoring helps to ensure that supervisory resources and attention are allocated efficiently.\nBut because the financial system and economic environment are dynamic, periodic reviews of the\ntailoring and calibration of regulatory requirements should be undertaken to ensure that the regulatory and\nsupervisory framework still delivers the same level of resilience as new products, business models, and\npotential sources of risk are introduced.\n\nSee, e.g., Valerie Cerra and Sweta C. Saxena, “The Economic Scars of Crises and Recessions,” IMF Blog, March\n21, 2018 (https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2018/03/21/the-economic-scars-of-crises-and-recessions). Markus\nBrunnermeier points out that real GDP has not returned to its trend line since the great financial crisis. See Markus\nBrunnermeier, “Macrofinance and Resilience: 2024 American Finance Association Presidential Address,” San\nAntonio, TX, January 6, 2024 (https://afajof.org/2024-annual-meeting-and-panel-sessions/).\n5\n\n\f7\nBank capital\nIn my view, at the larger banks, current minimum capital standards are still below the level where an\nincrease would be counterproductive in terms of thwarting productive risk-taking, beneficial innovation,\nor economic growth. Bank capital forms the solid foundation for bank lending. Empirical research finds\nthat well-capitalized banks tend to lend more than poorly capitalized ones, to grow their loan and deposit\nmarket shares during crises by purchasing assets from less well-capitalized banks,6 and to have more\naccess to market funding during downturns than do less capitalized banks.7 High leverage has been\nshown to be a major contributor to the severity of financial crises, while a well-capitalized banking\nsystem – reflecting both the amount and the quality of the capital – is less likely to amplify negative\nmacroeconomic shocks and is more resilient. I view the Basel III endgame capital proposal as a\nrecalibration aligned with this view.8\n\nLiquidity\nWhile much of regulation and supervision has focused on credit risk, last year’s bank stresses shined a\nbright light on the importance of managing liquidity and interest-rate risks. Providing banks with\nincentives to choose less risky funding sources, such as tightening the liquidity coverage ratio\nrequirement so that banks have to hold higher levels of liquid assets to cover potential cash outflows,\nwould reduce the probability of a run. We have also learned that even if there is considerable liquidity in\nthe system, impediments that limit the system’s ability to effectively redistribute liquidity to banks that\nneed it can raise systemic risk. The Federal Reserve System serves as lender of last resort by lending\nagainst good collateral to healthy banks facing temporary liquidity problems, but last year’s bank failures\n\nAllen N.

This undermines the\ndiscount window’s ability to limit bank runs and promote resilience. Instead of the discount window,\nbanks have relied on the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) as a reliable source of funding. That is\npartly because FHLB advances offer some advantages to banks over discount window loans: advances\ncan be longer term; they are cheaper, especially in periods of stress; FHLBs typically give higher lendable\nvalue against collateral; and advances are not disclosed, whereas discount window loans are, with a twoyear lag. Yet as we saw, FHLB funding was not reliable during the stresses seen last March.\n\nProposed changes to the FHLBs, if enacted, will place some limits on banks’ ability to borrow, especially\nthose banks in a weakened state.9 This likely will increase banks’ demand for alternative funding sources,\nperhaps making them rely more on uninsured deposits, thereby increasing the potential for bank runs in\nresponse to a shock. This increases the need for banks to be prepared to use the discount window as a\nsource of contingency funding.\n\nCurrently, the Reserve Banks are encouraging eligible financial institutions to ensure that they have the\nlegal agreements and collateral in place and have tested their ability to use the discount window in a\ntimely way should the need arise. Testing at this time is not mandatory, but I support requiring such\ntesting as part of sound liquidity management. It is also worth considering requiring banks to pre-position\ncollateral at the window in proportion to their short-term runnable funding, including uninsured deposits,\nso they would be ready to borrow at the discount window should that funding start to run.10 This\nrequirement would be consistent with a tiered approach to regulation, since banks that are less reliant on\nrunnable funds and that therefore pose fewer risks, a category that includes many smaller banks, would be\n\nSee Federal Housing Finance Agency, “The FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future,” November 2023\n(https://www.fhfa.gov/PolicyProgramsResearch/Programs/Pages/FHLBank-Focusing-on-the-Future.aspx).\n9\n\nThe G30 makes such a recommendation. See the G30’s Working Group on the 2023 Banking Crisis, “Bank\nFailures and Contagion: Lender of Last Resort, Liquidity, and Risk Management,” January 2024\n(https://group30.org/images/uploads/publications/G30_Lessons-23-Crisis_RPT_Final.pdf).\n10\n\n\f9\nrequired to post less collateral. And it would provide some incentive for those banks that find the\nconstraint binding to adjust to a lower-risk funding structure.\n\nSystematic Financial Resilience Policy\nI am a proponent of systematic monetary policy, and I would like us to apply our regulatory and\nsupervisory tools in a more systematic manner, too. The benefit of taking a systematic approach to\nmonetary policy is well established. It allows the public to better understand the rationale for the Fed’s\npolicy decisions so that their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This\nalignment helps households, firms, and financial market participants make better financial and\nemployment decisions, thereby making monetary policy more effective.\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which\npolicymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. That is, being\nsystematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems. Incentives – those of both financial\ninstitutions and regulators – take a central role in the financial system so time-inconsistency and moral\nhazard problems loom large. This makes it even more important to be systematic in the application of\nregulatory policy and supervisory actions.\n\nIn times of financial stress, regulators find themselves with a time-inconsistency problem. Forcing one\nbank to take actions to raise capital or address other risk-management concerns during a period of stress\ncould precipitate a widespread reevaluation of the banking industry by investors and depositors resulting\nin a systemic event. In such cases, regulators and supervisors might lean toward interventions and\nforbearance even if this creates bad incentives for financial institutions to manage risks in the future.\nTime-inconsistency problems mean regulators face a tradeoff between what is better in the short run and\nwhat is better over the long run. Adherence to a systematic approach can serve as a commitment device\nfor regulators to focus on long-run goals. This would help to limit moral hazard so that banks themselves\n\n\f10\ninternalize more of the risks they are taking and self-insure against losses rather than expect government\nsupport. Of course, if the shock were large enough, policymakers would need to step in, but there would\nlikely be fewer situations in which the government would need to offer such support. But getting to this\npoint requires having the right tools in order to align regulatory incentives and reduce the timeinconsistency problem.\n\nThe stresses in the banking system last March underscored the challenge of ensuring that financial\ninstitutions can rebuild their capital when their assets decline in value. SVB’s attempt to raise capital\nafter selling assets at a loss raised concerns about the bank’s health among depositors and precipitated the\nrun. Cyclical macroprudential tools aim to solve this problem by having banks build up capital in good\ntimes that can be used in bad times. In the U.S., these tools are basically limited to the countercyclical\ncapital buffer (CCyB) and the stress test.\n\nCountercyclical capital buffer\nThe CCyB is intended to require banks to hold more capital during periods of high credit growth, which\noften coincides with the accumulation of system-wide risk. However, the lead times needed to use this\ntool limit its effectiveness in addressing vulnerabilities that may develop rapidly or that can be detected\nonly after they are far along. This suggests the need to raise the buffer in good times before we see the\nvulnerabilities, yet we have never raised the CCyB above zero in the U.S. The CCyB would be more\neffective and time consistent if it were recalibrated to be a positive level in normal times, and then raised\nwhen credit growth moves up and lowered when credit growth moves down based on a systematic rule\nthat is agreed to in advance of stress.\n\nStress tests\nSimilarly, the current stress tests should be redesigned with an eye to making them a more effective\ncountercyclical capital tool so that banks have to build up their capital buffers when they are better able to\n\n\f11\ndo so. In addition, an expanded set of risks should be incorporated into the scenarios. For example,\ntypically, the stress tests focus on recession scenarios, in which interest rates are assumed to decline.\nIncorporating rising-interest-rate scenarios into the stress tests would be prudent. To augment the stress\ntests, the Fed is now doing exploratory analysis of the effects that different economic and financial\nconditions have on the banking system, including scenarios with high inflation and rising interest rates.11\n\nResolution mechanism\nBut the most effective way to limit moral hazard problems and the time-inconsistency problem regulators\nface with an insolvent bank is to create an effective, credible, and time-consistent bank resolution\nmechanism that can be applied systematically when a bank fails. If regulators were able to confidently\nresolve large financial institutions in a way that limits spillovers and avoids causing system-wide\ninstability, they would be in a much better position when the inevitable shock hits the financial system.12\nSuch a mechanism would also provide bankers with the incentive to better manage their risks. However,\nwhile certain steps have been taken, such a credible resolution mechanism remains elusive even as it\nbecomes more important given the speed with which banks can run into problems.\n\nTransparency\nLet me finish with a few comments about transparency, another tenet of sound monetary policymaking\nthat I believe should be brought into the realm of financial system regulation and supervision. The\nfinancial system is complex, with various types of institutions and multiple regulators. In addition,\nregulators are likely to have more private information on which to base their policy decisions, making it\n\nSee Federal Reserve System, “Exploratory Analysis of Risks to the Banking System: Summary of Analysis\nParameters,” February 2024 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/exploratory-analysis-of-risks-to-thebanking-system-20240215.pdf)\n11\n\n12\n\nIn August 2023, the federal banking regulators requested comments on a proposed rule to require large banks with\ntotal assets of $100 billion or more to maintain a minimum level of long-term debt that could be used to absorb\nlosses were the bank to fail. See the announcement of the request for comment on the long-term debt proposal and\naccompanying materials at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230829a.htm.\n\n\f12\nmore difficult for the public and elected officials to assess whether the decisions are appropriate ones.\nThere has been a long-standing view that supervisory information should be kept private so as not to be a\nsource of instability, but greater transparency and more disclosure by both banks and regulators would\nprovide better incentives for risk management and would allow for more market discipline. We have seen\nmore transparency around the stress tests and that has been a positive development.\n\nMuch of bank regulation is tied to book values instead of market values. Moving toward market-value\naccounting for more of a bank’s balance sheet, basing more of bank regulation on market values, and\ndisclosing more market-value information about a bank’s balance sheet would help align regulation and\nsupervision with market discipline.13 While banks have to account for securities held in their trading\nbooks at market values, the current accounting rules allow some banks to classify securities held on their\nown books as hold-to-maturity assets and account for them according to their book value instead of their\nmarket value. In the current environment, many longer-term securities were purchased when interest\nrates were low, but when rates rose, the market value of these assets fell. Thus, many banks have\nunrealized losses on their balance sheets. This is not a problem if the bank can, indeed, hold these assets\nuntil maturity. But if a bank needs to sell the assets, it will have to realize the loss and take the hit to\ncapital. This is the position SVB found itself in.\n\nEven if accounting regulations are not changed, having supervisors pay more attention to market values\nwould likely spur earlier actions on their part to ensure sound risk management at banks and would help\nfocus supervisory attention on areas of highest vulnerability.14 Requiring banks to be transparent with\n\n13\n\nEdward L. Golding and Deborah J. Lucas have recommended that medium-size and large banks disclose\ninformation on the duration gap between their assets and liabilities. See Edward L. Golding and Deborah J. Lucas,\n“Duration Gap Disclosure: A Modest Proposal to Prevent Another SVB,” Shadow Open Market Committee,\nOctober 20, 2023 (https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/somc/Lucas-Golding-SOMC2023.pdf).\n14\n\nHow best to move to market-value accounting is not straightforward because of the difficulty of accounting for\nthe market value of deposits. See, e.g., Philip Bond, Itay Goldstein, and Edward Simpson Prescott, “Market-Based\nCorrective Actions,” The Review of Financial Studies 23, 2010, pp. 781–820 (https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhp059).\n\n\f13\ntheir supervisors about the underlying assumptions in their risk-management models would also increase\nsupervisors’ ability to better evaluate risk management at the bank. SVB assumed interest rates would be\nfalling; instead they rose, which increased the risk of SVB’s position. In addition, banks and supervisors\nshould incorporate more scenario analysis into their risk management and monitoring. Looking at various\nstress scenarios involving relevant risks can make banks and supervisors better prepared for what could\nhappen even if it is not viewed as the most likely situation at the time. And the more uncertain the\nenvironment, the wider the set of possible scenarios that should be examined.\n\nI have been speaking about the banking system today, but we also need to take steps to increase the\nstructural resilience of nonbank financial firms and markets. To do that, regulators need increased\nvisibility into the nonbank financial sector. Not having the data needed to adequately measure the risks\nand vulnerabilities in a particular segment of the financial system should not lure us into thinking that the\nvulnerabilities are small or do not exist. Better risk monitoring will require more disclosure in many\nsegments, including data on the assets backing many stablecoins, central counterparties’ member\nconcentrations, principal trading firms, and nonbank funders.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, a resilient financial system plays an important role in ensuring a strong economy. After the\nglobal financial crisis, steps were taken to shore up the resilience of the banking system. Systemically\nimportant banking institutions have higher capital and liquidity buffers and better risk-management\nsystems than they did. The sound banking system was able to lend important support to households and\nbusinesses throughout the pandemic. But the financial system is dynamic, with new products, business\nmodels, and technologies being introduced, and the economic environment can change rapidly. Last\nyear’s bank stress underscores the importance of not becoming complacent. We need to look holistically\nat the regulations, our methods of supervision, and our lender of last resort function to address the\nvulnerabilities that were revealed. This holistic approach should consider the interactions among various\n\n\f14\nregulations, leaning toward simplification when possible. Recalibration should be informed by careful\ncost-benefit analyses. Identifying and addressing weaknesses will improve the underlying resilience of\nthe financial system, so that we can continue to rely on it to provide its important services across the\nbusiness and financial cycles and limit the need for government interventions.\n\n\f"

At that time, a strong economic recovery\nwas underway, but it was an uneven one and there were still many challenges and risks, including the\nDelta variant of the coronavirus, which was emerging. People were starting to return to the workforce but\nonly slowly. The number of payroll jobs and the labor force participation rate were still well below where\nthey were prior to the pandemic, and the unemployment rate, while down from its peak of nearly 15\npercent early in the pandemic, was still near 5 percent. Inflation had moved up to over 4 percent. It was\nexpected to rise further and remain elevated until supply constraints and pent-up demand eased, which\nwould take some time. Monetary policy had not yet begun to tighten.\n\nThe economy and monetary policy have certainly been on quite a journey since then. Characterizing both\ntoday, I would say that the economy and monetary policy are in a good place. Inflation is still above our\ngoal of 2 percent, but it has moved down considerably from its high level in 2022 and labor markets and\neconomic growth remain strong. The FOMC’s job now is to ensure that the economy reaches an even\nbetter place by calibrating monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate goals of price stability and\nmaximum employment. In order to do that calibration, we will need to continue to monitor and assess\nincoming economic and financial information and its implications not only for the baseline forecast but\nalso for the risks around that forecast. Risk management will take center stage.\n\nBankers have played an important role in determining where the economy is today and where it is going.\nBy providing valuable credit, risk-management, liquidity, and payments services to your customers, you\nsupport a strong economy. Ohio bankers supported families, businesses, and communities throughout the\n\n\f2\npandemic, and they continue to do so, even as the industry faces its own challenges. I want to thank you\nfor managing through the balance-sheet impacts of the sharp rise in interest rates over the past two years\nand the liquidity stresses that manifested themselves last March. Just as the Fed will be carefully\nmanaging risks in determining its appropriate policy stance, banks will need to do so as well, so that they\ncan continue to contribute to a strong economy.\n\nI also want to thank the bankers in Ohio and throughout the Fourth District for the timely information and\ninsights on the economy and banking conditions that they have provided to me in my role as a Federal\nReserve policymaker. Several of the Cleveland Fed’s current and former directors and members of our\nCommunity Depository Institutions Advisory Council are here today, and they can attest to the rich set of\ninsights provided by our bankers. This information plays a crucial role in helping us better understand\nwhat is really happening on the ground in real time and what could be coming.\n\nSo let me now turn to my assessment of the where the economy and monetary policy are and where they\nare likely going.\n\nEconomic Developments\nOver the past four years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been the major forces shaping economic\ndevelopments and the major sources of uncertainty about the economy. When the pandemic hit, the\neconomy shut down in March 2020, and fiscal and monetary policymakers took aggressive actions to\nsupport households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow and limiting lasting damage to\nthe economy. The economy began to reopen in May 2020 when public health statistics began to improve.\nBut it wasn’t business as usual. The pandemic had affected global supply chains, the supply of and\ndemand for labor, and the composition of household and business spending on housing, goods, and\nservices. Imbalances between supply and demand in both product and labor markets led to significant\nupward pressure on prices, and inflation began to rise in April 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in\n\n\f3\nFebruary 2022, an ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil,\nfood, and other commodities. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to\n9 percent, depending on the measure. In response, the FOMC began raising its policy rate, the federal\nfunds rate, in March 2022, and over the two years since, the Committee has significantly tightened the\nstance of monetary policy by raising the fed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. The Fed\nis also reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to\nthe plan announced in May 2022.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions over time and, in\nresponse, aggregate demand has begun to moderate. In addition, the supply side of the economy has been\nhealing. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have improved significantly, and firms have invested\nin diversifying their supply chains, making them more resilient to disruptions. Growing tensions in the\nMiddle East might undermine supply-chain improvements, but our business contacts tell us that so far\nthere has been minimal effect on their operations and that they expect the increase in shipping costs\nthrough the Red Sea to be temporary, but this is a risk worth watching.\n\nThe pandemic had profound effects on the labor market, but the labor market is normalizing. People have\nreturned to the labor force over time, and the labor force participation rate of people aged 25 to 54 is now\nslightly above its pre-pandemic level.\n\nOver time, the imbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets, which\nhelped fuel high inflation, have lessened, and inflation has moved down. This disinflation has happened\neven as the economy has remained very resilient, with both economic growth and the labor market\noutperforming relative to expectations. As you’ll recall, many CEOs and economists thought that growth\nlast year would be below trend. But the economy didn’t agree. Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter\nstepped down from its very strong pace in the third quarter, but it was still a solid 3-1/4 percent annual\n\n\f4\nrate. Growth last year is estimated to have been a bit over 3 percent, above my 2 percent estimate of trend\ngrowth. The change in firms’ inventories was expected to subtract from growth last quarter, but instead\nmade a slight positive contribution. Growth in final sales, which excludes the change in inventories, was\nquite strong.\n\nConsumer spending makes up about 70 percent of GDP. Strong income growth and healthy balance\nsheets have continued to support household spending, and the savings rate has moved below its prepandemic level, reflecting strong spending. It is interesting that despite the economy’s strong\nperformance, including strong consumer spending, until recently surveys of consumers indicated that\nmost people were not very happy about the economy. I believe that partly reflects the fact that even\nthough inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been high, many people’s wages haven’t\nkept up with inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is\nmoving up faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higher-thandesired prices. With inflation moving down, wages adjusted for inflation have begun to move up, and\nthis is helping to close the gap between the cumulative increase in inflation and the cumulative increase in\nwages.1 This may be partly why consumers are feeling better about the economy.\n\nI expect household spending to moderate somewhat this year. In the wake of high prices, many families,\nespecially those with lower incomes, have spent the savings accumulated during the pandemic. There has\nbeen an uptick in credit card debt, suggesting that some households have exhausted their ready cash\nbalances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have also edged up, although they are still at low levels.\n\n1\n\nSince the first quarter of 2021, when inflation began to rise, PCE inflation has been running at an annualized pace\nof 4.8 percent. Workers’ compensation (as measured by the employment cost index for civilian workers’\ncompensation) has risen at an annualized rate of 4.5 percent. So there is still a gap, but that gap has been closing\nover time as inflation has moved down.\n\n\f5\nTighter financial conditions have restrained investment in housing and business spending. Businesses\nslowed their spending on equipment and software last year, and it is expected to continue to moderate\ngiven restrictive credit conditions. The regional manufacturing surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks\nand the national ISM survey indicate weaker manufacturing activity. Fourth District manufacturers tell us\nthat their order backlogs are diminishing. In the housing market, residential investment declined in 2022\nand was flat last year. Sales of existing homes are at low levels, but sales of new single-family homes\nwere fairly resilient given the longer-term shortage of available housing. The shortfall in housing supply\nhas kept home prices relatively high, but rents, especially for new tenants, have moved down and that\nshould lead to continued tempering of inflation in housing services.\n\nLast Friday’s labor market report for January shows that the labor market has been remarkably resilient.\nPayroll job growth rose by about 350 thousand jobs in January. Even if some of that reflects seasonal\nadjustment issues, it was an unexpectedly strong reading, and the job numbers for October, November,\nand December were revised up. The unemployment rate has been 3.7 percent over the past three months,\nnear a 50-year low. This is very strong performance. Other indicators point to some moderation in the\nlabor market. Our contacts tell us that, except for the healthcare sector, it is easier to hire than it was a\nyear ago and that they are getting more applicants per job opening. The pace of job quits has also\ndeclined since peaking in 2022. Now, workers are quitting jobs at about the same pace as before the\npandemic and the number of job openings has been declining. There are now about 1.5 openings per\nunemployed worker. This is above the level we saw in 2019, another period of strong labor market\nconditions, but it has come down a lot since March 2022 when we began to tighten monetary policy.2\nAnd on the supply side, as I mentioned, the labor force participation rate for workers aged 25 to 54 has\nnormalized.\n\n2\n\nIn 2019, the ratio of openings per unemployed workers averaged 1.2 percent; in March 2022 it was 2.0.\n\n\f6\nAs the demand for and the supply of workers have started to come into better balance, wage growth has\nmoderated. Firms in our District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down\nfrom 5 percent a year ago, but still above pre-pandemic levels. The employment cost index rose at an\nannualized rate of 3-1/2 percent over the last three months of 2023, down from about 4-3/4 percent in the\nfirst quarter of last year. And the gap between the wages of job switchers and job stayers in the Atlanta\nFed’s Wage Growth Tracker narrowed last year to about its average over 2015 to 2019, another sign that\nthe labor market is coming into better balance.3\n\nCurrent estimates of trend productivity growth suggest that the current level of wage growth is still a bit\nabove the level consistent with 2 percent inflation. But the strong recent readings on productivity raise\nthe possibility that trend productivity growth has moved higher than it was before the pandemic. The\nscarcity of workers during the pandemic gave firms a great incentive to do more with fewer workers and\nmany invested in automation. New technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing\nproductivity over the medium to longer run. If so, then wages would be able to rise at a faster rate and\nstill be consistent with price stability. At this point, though, I suspect we will see further moderation of\nwage growth, with a gradual slowing in job growth and an uptick in the unemployment rate over the year\nfrom its very low level.\n\nInflation\nWhile inflation is still above the Fed’s goal of 2 percent, the news on inflation is encouraging. Inflation\nmoved down faster than expected last year even as the economy remained strong. Measured year-overyear, as of December, total PCE inflation is 2.6 percent and core PCE inflation is 2.9 percent. Over the\npast six months, the levels are even lower. Other measures of inflation, including the median and\n\n3\n\nThe gap between the 12-month moving average wage growth of job switchers and job stayers in the Atlanta Fed’s\nWage Growth Tracker was 2.2 percentage points at the start of last year and 0.9 percentage point by the end of last\nyear. These data are available at https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.\n\n\f7\ntrimmed-mean measures, have also moved down from their peaks. Retailers in the Fourth District say\nthat consumers are more price-sensitive than they have been. Many of our contacts across sectors have\nnoted that after making frequent price adjustments over the past two years, they have reverted to their\nusual pre-pandemic practice of setting prices once a year, a sign of easing price pressures.\n\nThe largest declines in inflation have come in goods prices. In fact, core goods prices have been\ndeclining, as they were before the pandemic. Inflation in housing services, measured by rents and the\nimputed rents for owner-occupied housing, and inflation in core services excluding housing, which makes\nup about half of the consumption basket, have eased less but have improved over time.\n\nThere are reasons to be cautious in assuming that last year’s rapid pace of disinflation will be maintained\nas inflation gets closer to the 2 percent goal. While restrictive monetary policy has played an important\nrole in moving inflation down, supply-side adjustments were also important. Now that pressures on\nsupply chains are approaching normal and the labor market is coming into better balance, we should not\ncount on as much help from the supply side as we saw last year.\n\nWhile inflation may prove to be more persistent this year, my baseline forecast is that under appropriate\nmonetary policy, inflation will continue to move down over time to our 2 percent goal. Anchored\ninflation expectations are an important component of that forecast. Medium- and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent\ninflation. One-year-ahead inflation expectations from the University of Michigan and New York Fed\nsurveys have also moved down, although they are still about a quarter to a half percentage point,\nrespectively, above their 2019 averages. Continued progress on inflation will help ensure that these\nexpectations move down to our goal. And that progress depends on appropriate monetary policy.\n\n\f8\nMonetary Policy\nAt its meeting last week, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to\n5-1/2 percent and to continue running off the Fed’s securities holdings. The FOMC judges that the risks\nto achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance, but it remains highly\nattentive to inflation risks. The FOMC does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range\nuntil it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to\nachieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. When we\nbegan this tightening cycle, inflation was far above our goal and labor markets were strong. So it was\nclear we needed to focus on the price stability part of our mandate. Now, with inflation moving closer to\nour goal, we need to balance the risks to achieving both sides of our dual mandate when determining the\nappropriate stance of policy.\n\nIt would be a mistake to move rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence that\ninflation was on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. Doing so would undermine all of the\ngood work that has gone into getting inflation to this point. On the other hand, if year-ahead inflation\nexpectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the nominal fed funds rate for too long\nwould effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would pose an increasing risk to the\nmaximum employment part of our mandate.\n\nRisk management will be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going forward. Our job is to\ncalibrate monetary policy to the evolving outlook and risks around the outlook so that inflation returns\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy. My baseline forecast is that output\nand employment will moderate this year and inflation will continue to move closer to our 2 percent goal\nover time. But there are a number of risks around this forecast. Heightened geopolitical tensions have\n\n\f9\npotential implications for financial markets, oil prices, and global demand and supply. A continued\neasing in financial conditions could spur activity, leading once again to imbalances that fuel inflation.\nThe stress generated by the bank failures last March has subsided. Many banks have diversified their\nsources of liquidity, making them less vulnerable. But stress could come again to banks that continue to\nrely on uninsured deposits for their funding while having sizable exposures to CRE assets that will need\nto be repriced at higher interest rates.\n\nMonetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial conditions, but the\nmagnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature of the shocks that\nhave hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment. So while labor markets are\ncurrently strong and are expected to only gradually moderate, we need to remain attentive to the\npossibility that conditions could deteriorate faster than expected. On the other hand, the strong output and\nemployment growth could be an indication that the neutral rate of interest, which rose during the\npandemic, might remain high, which would mean restrictive policy may be needed for longer to achieve\nour goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nMonetary policy is in a good place from which to assess and respond to these risks to the outlook. The\ncurrent strength in labor market conditions and the strong spending data give us the opportunity to keep\nthe nominal funds rate at its current level while we gather more evidence that inflation truly is on a\nsustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. This is better than finding ourselves in a situation where\nwe begin easing too soon, undo some of the progress we have made on inflation, potentially destabilize\ninflation expectations, and then have to reverse course. If the economy evolves as expected, I think we\nwill gain that confidence later this year, and then we can begin moving rates down. My base case is that\nwe will do so at a gradual pace so that we can continue to manage the risks to both sides of our mandate.\nOf course, if downside risks materialize, we would have the opportunity to move rates down more\nquickly, just as we raised rates more aggressively than usual to combat rising inflation. Or if inflation\n\n\f10\nappears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we would have the opportunity to maintain a restrictive\nstance for longer. Our policy actions will depend on how the economy and the risks evolve. When our\ngoals of price stability and maximum employment are achieved, the economy will be in an even better\nplace than where it is today.\n\nOperating Framework\nLet me conclude with some remarks about the Fed’s balance sheet. As Chair Jay Powell indicated at his\npress briefing last week, the FOMC will be discussing reducing the pace of the runoff in its balance-sheet\nassets at its next meeting in March. Since June 2022, the Fed has been allowing maturing Treasuries and\nagency mortgage-backed securities to run off its balance sheet at a fairly good clip according to the plan\nannounced in May 2022. The Fed’s security holdings total about $7 trillion and have declined by about\n$1.3 trillion since the runoff began.\n\nWe are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating regime in which reserve levels are\nample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is executed\nprimarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates: the interest rate paid on bank reserves, the interest\nrate offered on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs), and the primary credit rate on\ndiscount window loans. Under this framework, active management of the supply of reserves is not\nneeded. As assets run off our balance sheet, Fed liabilities move down. So far, the balance-sheet runoff\nhas resulted in a reduction in ON RRPs, with balances currently under $575 billion, rather than a\nreduction in reserves. In aggregate, reserve balances are about $3.5 trillion, which is about 15 percent of\nbanking system assets.\n\nWhat constitutes an ample level of reserves is uncertain. It depends on the banking sector’s demand for\nreserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. The\n\n\f11\nSeptember Senior Financial Officer Survey4 indicated that for most banks, their reserve levels are above\ntheir preferred level of reserves, and money market rates and spreads suggest little in the way of funding\npressures. And the Fed’s Standing Repo Facility provides a backstop against such pressures. So the\ncurrent level and distribution of reserves are more than ample. But as balance-sheet runoff continues and\nON RRP volume reaches a minimum level, reserves will begin declining, too, and more redistribution of\nreserves will need to occur across institutions. As our balance-sheet reduction plan noted, the FOMC will\nslow and then stop the runoff when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is consistent\nwith ample. This will help ensure that we can continue to reduce our balance sheet to its efficient size for\neffectively implementing monetary policy and move toward our longer-run goal of holding primarily\nTreasury securities, thereby minimizing the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. I note that\nthe runoff pace pertains to how we implement monetary policy and not to the stance of monetary policy.\nOur main tool of monetary policy is the fed funds rate target, and balance-sheet runoff can continue even\nafter we begin to lower the funds rate.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Senior Financial Officer Survey Results,” September\n2023.
