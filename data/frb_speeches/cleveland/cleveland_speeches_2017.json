Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of Monetary Policy\nWashington, DC\nNovember 16, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to speak at the Cato Institute’s 35th annual monetary conference.\nTo some of us, 35 seems relatively young, but for a conference series, it is a ripe old age. The series’\nlongevity underscores the important contributions it has made over the years to the public discourse on\nmonetary economics and policy. Whether you interpret 35 as young or old depends on the context, which\nbrings me to my topic today: demographics and their implications for the economy and policy. This\nmight seem like an unusual topic for a Cato conference, but demographics have been on my mind, and not\njust because I had a birthday last month.\n\nThe word “demographics” comes from the Ancient Greek: “demo” meaning people and “graphics”\nmeaning measurement. There is a strong tradition of studying demography as part of economics.\nMalthus’s writings on population growth are a part of many history-of-thought courses in economics.\nMore recently, as the economy has moved from financial crisis and the Great Recession to sustainable\nexpansion, attention has shifted from cyclical aspects of the economy to structural factors. In addition, as\npolicy has begun to normalize, the question has been raised: “what is normal?” To answer such a\nquestion, we need to understand how the underlying fundamentals of the economy are evolving. A\ncritical factor is demographics. Demographic change can influence the underlying growth rate of the\neconomy, structural productivity growth, living standards, savings rates, consumption, and investment; it\ncan influence the long-run unemployment rate and equilibrium interest rate, housing market trends, and\nthe demand for financial assets. Moreover, differences in demographic trends across countries can be\nexpected to influence current account balances and exchange rates. So to understand the global economy,\nit helps to understand changing demographics and the challenges they pose for monetary and fiscal\npolicymakers.\n\nToday I will talk about some of these demographic trends and their policy implications. Of course, the\nviews I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f2\nDemographic Trends\nUntil the early 18th century, world population grew little because high mortality rates offset high fertility\nrates.1 But increased knowledge and technological change in the form of advances in medicine, public\nhealth, and nutrition began to lower mortality rates. Fertility rates also began to decline. In the U.S. there\nwere shifting preferences for smaller families because of the rising opportunity costs of having children\nand the higher costs of raising and educating them. The shift in population from rural to urban areas\nreduced the need for large families to run farms. There were changes in social norms regarding the use\nand availability of birth control. The baby boom in the U.S. after World War II, and the subsequent echo\nwhen the baby boom generation began having their own children, were exceptions to a generally\ndownward trend in the birth rate. Today, the fertility rate in the U.S. is 1.88 births per woman.2 This is\nless than the United Nations’ estimated 2.1 replacement rate needed to keep the population stable, and it\nis considerably less than the fertility rate in 1900, which was over 3.3\n\nAs these demographic changes have played out, the average life expectancy in the U.S. has risen and the\npopulation has aged. Average life expectancy at birth is now nearly 80 years old, 30 years higher than it\nwas in 1900.4 The median age of the U.S. population is approaching 38 years old, nearly 10 years older\nthan in 1970.5 By 2050, the U.N. projects that the median age in the U.S. will be 42 years old and that the\nnumber of people age 65 or older per 100 of working-age people, those age 15 to 64, will be more than\ndouble what it was in 1970.6\n\n1\n\nTwo useful survey articles on the demographic change are Lee (2003) and Bloom and Canning (2004).\n\n2\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 807).\n\n3\n\nFor the replacement rate, see United Nations (2017), p. xxvii. Note, however, that Espenshade, et al. (2003) point\nout that there is considerable variation in replacement rates across countries. Haines (1998, Table 7-2) reports that,\nin 1900, the fertility rate was 3.56 for whites and 5.61 for black and other populations.\n4\n\nLife expectancy at birth in the U.S. over 2010-2015 was 78.9 (United Nations (2017, p. 805)). The life expectancy\nat birth in the U.S. in 1900 was 47.3 (National Research Council (2012, p. 32)).\n5\n\nAccording to the United Nations (2017, p. 807), the median age in the U.S. was 28.4 in 1970, 37.6 in 2015, and it\nis estimated to be 38.3 in 2020.\n6\n\nAccording to the United Nations (2017, p. 807), this old-age dependency ratio was 16.3 in 1970, 22.1 in 2015, and\nis expected to rise to 36.4 by 2050.\n\n\f3\nReflecting projections of relatively stable fertility rates and continued aging of the population, world\npopulation growth is expected to slow.7 It averaged around 2 percent per year in the latter half of the\n1960s and slowed to 1.2 percent per year over 2010-2015.8 U.S. population growth, including net\ninternational migration, is expected to slow from about 0.8 percent in recent years to under 0.5 percent in\n2050, with nearly two-thirds of that growth coming from net migration.9\n\nA number of advanced economies are further along in this demographic transition than the U.S. is, and\nthe process of population aging is accelerating worldwide.10 In Japan, the population has been shrinking\nover the past five years, the ratio of older people to working-age people is the highest in the world, and\nthe median age is almost 47 years old.11 Across Europe, fertility rates have been below the replacement\nlevel for some time.12 In China, the growth rate of the working-age population has slowed since the late\n1980s, and partly because of its previous one-child policy, China’s population is also rapidly aging.13 The\nmedian age in China has increased from around 19 years in 1970 to 37 years in 2015.\n\nOn the other hand, many low- and middle-income countries are at a considerably earlier phase in the\ndemographic transition, with young and faster growing populations, and rising labor force participation\nrates. In India, the median age is around 27 years and the annualized growth rate of the population from\n2010 to 2015 has been 1.2 percent.14 The U.N. projects that, in seven years, the population of India will\nsurpass that of China, currently, the most populous country, and that India’s population will continue to\n\n7\n\nThe United Nations (2017, p. 807) projects that the U.S. fertility rate will vary between 1.88 and 1.92 between\n2015 and 2100. The CBO (March 2017, p. 30) projects that the U.S. fertility rate will be 1.9 children per woman\nover 2017-2047.\n8\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 3).\n\n9\n\nFor population growth projections, including projections for natural increases and net international migration, see\nU.S. Census Bureau (2014). Also see population growth projections in United Nations (2017, p. 807) and CBO\n(March 2017, p. 30).\n10\n\nSee Bloom and Canning (2004, p. 18).\n\n11\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 415). The United Nations defines this potential support ratio as the number of\npersons age 20 to 64 divided by the number age 65 or over (see United Nations (2017, p. xxxiii)).\n12\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. xxvii).\n\n13\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 191) and Peng (2011).\n\n14\n\nSee United Nations (2017, p. 383).\n\n\f4\ngrow through 2050. Much of the increase in world population between now and 2050 is projected to be\nin Africa, where fertility rates remain high.\n\nThe implications of these global demographic patterns for the future of the U.S. economy are worth\nconsidering because they pose some challenges for policymakers. Indeed, the magnitude of the effects\nwill depend on policy responses. The remainder of my talk will discuss some of the ways these changing\ndemographics could influence the U.S. economy, in particular, labor markets and economic growth. Then\nI will turn to considerations for monetary, fiscal, and other government policies.\n\nDemographic Implications for Labor Markets\nDemographics influence the supply of labor. Typically, as mortality rates decline and people live longer,\nthe supply of labor increases. We saw this pattern begin in the U.S. in the late 1960s and the 1970s,\nespecially as women and the baby boomers began entering the workforce. The result was an increase in\nthe available supply of prime-age workers, both females and males, and potential growth rates in the 3 to\n4 percent range.15\n\nEven though increased life expectancy means individuals will need to work longer in order to save more\nfor retirement, usually, population aging eventually leads to a downward trend in labor force participation\nin the aggregate.16 This is already happening in the U.S. Labor force participation peaked at 67.3 percent\nin early 2000 and fell to 66.0 percent in December 2007, as the Great Recession was beginning. Since\nthen, it has fallen further, to 62.7 percent as of October. While some of the decline represents cyclical\n\n15\n16\n\nSee CBO (June 2017).\n\nNote that, so far, we have not seen much shift in the retirement age in the U.S. In fact, since the 1970s, the\naverage retirement age has been little changed even as life expectancies have continued to rise. This means people\nare spending more time in retirement and a smaller share of their lives working, which will put pressure on pension\nplans and savings. (According to OECD estimates, the average retirement age for men in the U.S. was 66.1 between\n1980 and 1984 and 65.4 between 2010 and 2015. Life expectancy at age 65 has increased from 14.8 years in 1970\nto 19.4 years in 2015 (United Nations (2017, p. 807)). Data from Social Security (2016) indicate that the average\nage of claims for retired workers has been little changed since 1970.)\n\n\f5\nfactors, research suggests that most of the fall in the overall participation rate can be attributed to\ndemographics: the combination of an aging population and reduced participation rates at older ages.17\n\nAs a result of lower population growth and labor force participation, the growth of the U.S. labor force\nhas slowed considerably, from 2.5 percent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to around 0.5 percent per\nyear over 2010-2016. It is expected to remain near that level over the next decade.18\n\nThe changing age distribution of workers can affect not only labor force growth and participation but also\nthe longer-run natural rate of unemployment. Older workers typically have lower unemployment rates\nthan other age groups, and they tend to change jobs less frequently.19 Young people now make up a\nsmaller share of the labor force. All else equal, the combination of lower quit rates for older workers and\nlower numbers of younger workers should imply a lower natural rate of unemployment compared to the\n1990s.20 Of course, the timing and magnitude of this demographic effect are not certain because there are\nsome counterbalancing factors, including the fact that, so far, contrary to expectations, the retirement age\nfor older workers hasn’t changed much, the productivity of a worker varies with age, and policies such as\nunemployment and retirement benefits can affect labor market choices.\n\nDemographic Implications for Economic Growth\nThe expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation rates will have implications\nfor long-run economic growth and the composition of growth. The key determinants of the economy’s\nlonger-run growth rate are labor force growth and structural productivity growth – how effectively the\neconomy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output. Demographics suggest that labor force\n17\n\nSee Aaronson, et al. (2006) and Aaronson, et al. (2014).\n\n18\n\nAccording to the latest available projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that annual growth in\nthe labor force over 2016-2026 will average 0.6 percent (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017, p 2.).\n19\n\nSee Bean (2004) and Cairó and Cajner (forthcoming). Tasci (2012) documents that the job separation rate was\nrising through the early 1980s and then declining thereafter, likely due to demographic changes.\n20\n\nEstimates of the natural rate of unemployment vary depending on what one assumes about the labor force\nparticipation rate. The FOMC participants’ projections of the longer-run unemployment rate range from 4.4 to 5.0\npercent (see FOMC, September 2017). Aaronson, et al. (2015) estimate that changes in the age and gender\ncomposition of the labor force will mean that the natural rate of unemployment will be two-tenths of a percentage\npoint lower by 2020, with a similar-size decline attributed to higher educational attainment.\n\n\f6\ngrowth will be considerably slower than it has been in recent decades, and this will weigh on long-run\neconomic growth.\n\nIn addition, in theory, the aging of the population may also have a negative effect on structural\nproductivity growth. Over the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in\nthe nonfarm business sector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire\nexpansion, it has averaged 1 percent. While some part of the slowdown is likely cyclical, reflecting\npersistent effects of the Great Recession on investment spending, structural factors are also weighing on\nproductivity growth. Older workers tend to stay longer in their jobs than younger workers, who are more\nlikely to change jobs and employers. This allows older workers to gain deeper experience, which can be\npositive for productivity growth. At the same time, lower labor mobility means workers may remain in\njobs that are not the best match to their skill sets. This would be a negative for productivity growth.\nIndeed, one study finds that both short tenures and long tenures adversely affect productivity growth.21\nAnd historical evidence suggests a hump-shaped relationship between age and productivity, with\nproductivity increasing when a person enters the workforce, stabilizing, and then declining toward the end\nof a person’s work life. 22 Research also indicates that an individual’s innovative activity and scientific\noutput peaks between the ages of 30 and 40, although that age profile has been shifting older over time.23\n\nLabor mobility and business dynamism, including the number of start-ups in key innovative sectors like\nhigh-tech, have been declining for some time.24 Whether dynamism will remain low is an open question,\nbut the aging of the population is here to stay. So far, the magnitude of the negative effect of the aging\nworkforce on productivity growth appears to be quite small.25 Even so, the demographics-induced slower\n\n21\n\nSee Auer, et al. (2005).\n\n22\n\nSee Skirbekk (2008) and National Research Council (2012, Chapter 6).\n\n23\n\nOne study showed that the median age of Nobel prize winners in physics, chemistry, and medicine has increased\nabout two years per century and the mean age has risen by eight years (see National Research Council (2012,\nChapter 6)).\n24\n25\n\nSee Haltiwanger (2015).\n\nFor example, the National Research Council’s (2012, Chapter 6) review of the literature showed that a changing\nage distribution had little effect on the distribution of earnings, a proxy for productivity. Their estimation of the\neffect for OECD countries indicates that productivity increases and then decreases with age, with a maximum\n\n\f7\ngrowth of the labor force and the possible dampening effect on productivity growth suggest that longerrun output growth will likely remain below the 3 to 3.5 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s, unless\nthere is some effective countervailing policy response.26\n\nIn addition to affecting the economy’s trend growth rate, demographics will likely affect the composition\nof growth by shaping aggregate consumption, saving, and investment decisions. Increased longevity\nmeans that people will need to save more over their working life to fund a longer retirement period. This\nis especially true given the degree of underfunding of public pension plans at the state and federal levels.\nDemand for healthcare will continue to rise, and an aging population will place different demands on the\nhousing sector than a younger population, affecting the demand for single- versus multi-family properties,\nfor owning versus renting, and for residential improvements that allow older adults to age in place.27 By\naffecting the composition of output, changes in the age distribution have the potential to affect the\nbusiness cycle. Because of its cyclical and structural implications, demographic change also has\nimplications for monetary policy. Let me talk about three.\n\nDemographic Implications for Monetary Policy\nFirst, although monetary policy cannot affect the growth rate of potential output or the long-run natural\nrate of unemployment, it needs to take these into account as part of the economic environment, and to\nconsider the downward pressure demographics put on both relative to their historical levels.\n\nSecond, changes in demographics could also affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the\neconomy, in particular, the strength of wealth effects versus income effects. Older people tend to hold\nreached at about 40 years. Based on projections of the age distribution and their preferred quadratic specification,\nthey estimate that changes in the age distribution will subtract only about 0.1 percentage point per year from\naggregate productivity growth over the next 20 years (see National Research Council (2012, Chapter 6, Table 6-2,\np. 119)). Note that Feyrer (2007) finds that differences in demographics could explain as much as a quarter of the\ngap in productivity between OECD countries and low-income countries. However, the National Research Council\nsuggests that sampling error may explain the large magnitude of that finding.\n26\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office currently estimates that potential GDP growth averaged 3.4 percent per year\nover 1982-1990 and 3.3 percent per year over 1991-2001; it projects that potential growth will average 1.8 percent\nper year over 2017-2027. See CBO (June 2017).\n27\n\nSee Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University (2014).\n\n\f8\nmore assets than the young and tend to be creditors while drawing down their assets to fund their\nconsumption during retirement. Younger people tend to be borrowers but face tighter credit constraints\nthan the old because they hold fewer assets. As the share of the population shifts from young to old, the\npropagation of an interest rate change through the economy is likely to change. There will be a smaller\nshare of young borrowers able to take advantage of a decrease in interest rates but a larger share of older\npeople who benefit from higher asset prices; similar reasoning applies for an increase in interest rates.\nDemographic change may mean that wealth effects become a more important channel through which\nmonetary policy affects the economy.28\n\nA third important implication of demographic change for monetary policy is through its effect on the\nequilibrium long-term interest rate. FOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the fed\nfunds rate that will be consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run. The\nmedian estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March 2014 to 2.8 percent today. And empirical\nestimates of the equilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are lower than in\nthe past.29\n\nDemographic change may be a factor in this decline to the extent that it results in a lower long-run growth\nrate of consumption and, therefore, of output, which is a key determinant of the longer-run equilibrium\ninterest rate. The magnitude of any effect is difficult to determine because complicated dynamics are at\nwork. Static analysis might suggest that as longevity increases, people will want to accumulate more\nassets to fund their retirements and this would put upward pressure on asset prices and, therefore,\ndownward pressure on returns. Moreover, because people prefer to reduce their exposure to risk as they\nage, we might expect to see a shift toward assets with fixed returns, putting upward pressure on risk\npremia and downward pressure on risk-free rates.30 However, older people also tend to save less because\nonce people reach retirement age, they need to draw down their savings and perhaps sell assets to fund\n28\n\nSee Bean (2004) and Imam (2013).\n\n29\n\nFor FOMC projections, see FOMC (March 2014) and FOMC (September 2017). For a review of the literature on\nthe equilibrium interest rate, see Hamilton, et al. (2015).\n30\n\nBernanke (2005) discusses how a global savings glut could push down longer-term interest rates.\n\n\f9\ntheir retirement. This countervailing effect from dissaving, as well as public spending on retiree benefits,\nwould tend to put upward pressure on interest rates.31 Thus, the magnitude and even the sign of the effect\nof demographic change on interest rates are empirical questions.\n\nSo far, there is little evidence that demographic trends are driving large-scale shifts into fixed-income\ninvestments that would depress returns; indeed, the evidence suggests that people are under-saving for\nretirement.32 Historically, there appears to be only a weak correlation between age structure in the U.S.\nand asset returns.33\n\nUltimately, how demographics affect economic outcomes will also depend on how governments respond,\nso in the remainder of my time, let me discuss the implications of demographic change for fiscal and\nother government policies.\n\nDemographic Implications for Fiscal and Other Government Policies\nThe rising share of older people will put significant pressure on Social Security and Medicare in the U.S.,\nwhich are structured as pay-as-you-go programs, with current workers providing support for current\nretirees. Other developed countries’ government pension and healthcare funds will also be stressed.\nProjected longer-run fiscal imbalances are unlikely to be sustainable, and it seems likely that governments\nwill need to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced benefits, increased taxes,\nprogram restructuring, and policies intended to stem the growth rate of healthcare costs.34 Longer-run\nfiscal sustainability will depend on what combination is used, and how effective the actions are.\n\n31\n\nThe simulation results in Fehr, et al. (2008) show an increase in interest rates along the baseline path of\ndemographic change projected for the U.S., the European Union, and Japan. Goodhart and Pradhan (2017) argue\nthat demographic change will lead to increases in the equilibrium interest rate.\n32\n\nSee National Research Council (2012, chapter 7).\n\n33\n\nPoterba (2004) finds only a weak correlation between the age structure in the U.S. over the past 70 years and asset\nreturns on stocks, bonds, and Treasury bills.\n34\n\nAuerbach (2016) points out that rising healthcare costs, and not aging alone, explain some of the difference in\nprojected fiscal gaps across countries.\n\n\f10\nAccording to CBO projections, under current policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will more than\ntriple over the next 30 years, from 2.9 percent in 2017 to 9.8 percent in 2047.35 During this time period,\noutlays for Social Security and Medicare are projected to rise from 8 percent to 12.4 percent of GDP. As\na result, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio rises dramatically, from 77 percent in 2017 to 150 percent in 2047.\nThis increase dwarfs the run-up in debt to fund World War II. The extent to which such an increase, per\nse, will crowd-out productive investments and lower economic growth is debatable.36 But the sovereign\ndebt crisis in Europe over 2009-2012 shows that high debt levels can pose severe problems if investors\nlose faith in the ability of governments to service their debts, generating spikes in what had previously\nbeen viewed as risk-free rates.\n\nIf financing the funding shortfall through increased government borrowing is undesirable, raising taxes\nand reducing benefits or other expenditures are not very appealing either. Depending on how such\npolicies are implemented, they could ultimately hurt the economy’s longer-run growth prospects, leaving\nthe fiscal outlook even worse. Moreover, in a world where countercyclical fiscal policy is constrained,\nbusiness cycle volatility could rise, and monetary policy could find itself near the zero lower bound more\noften, potentially requiring the use of nontraditional policy tools such as asset purchases and forward\nguidance in order to meet monetary policymakers’ economic objectives.37\n\nMore effective policies to overcome the effects of the aging population on fiscal imbalances would focus\non reducing the rising costs of healthcare, not just on health insurance. In addition, policies that increase\nthe growth and productivity of the workforce would address not only fiscal imbalances but the downward\npressure on longer-run growth from demographics or other sources. Policies that increase immigration,\nnot reduce it, that support continuing education, that encourage R&D and innovation, and that provide\nincentives so people work longer should receive attention.\n\n35\n\nSee CBO (March 2017).\n\n36\n\nFor discussions, see Cecchetti, et al. (2011), Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2017), and Reinhart and Rogoff\n(2010).\n37\n\nSee Kiley and Roberts (2017).\n\n\f11\nSummary\nIn summary, demographic change will result in a slower-growing and older population. This transition\nwill likely put downward pressure on the growth rate of potential output, the natural rate of\nunemployment, and the long-term equilibrium interest rate. The magnitude of these effects and the\ntiming are uncertain because they depend on complicated dynamics and the behavior of consumers and\nbusinesses. Demographic change may also affect the business cycle and the monetary policy\ntransmission mechanism. Monetary policymakers will need to continually evaluate these structural and\ncyclical effects in determining appropriate policy. Demographic trends present challenges for fiscal\npolicymakers as well. Rising fiscal imbalances are projected to lead to higher government debt-to-GDP\nlevels, potentially putting upward pressure on interest rates, and crowding out productive investment. But\nsteps can be taken to offset some of the negative consequences of demographic change for the economy.\nThese include policies that focus on increasing productivity and labor force growth and that address\ngrowing fiscal imbalances.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks at “The Future of Global Finance: Populism, Technology, and Regulation” Conference\nColumbia University\nNew York, NY\nOctober 20, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis at Imperial College London and the Initiative on\nCentral Banking and Financial Policy at Columbia University, and in particular Franklin Allen and Trish\nMosser, for inviting me to speak on this panel. The views I’ll provide today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nSome of you may be too young to remember the original Star Trek – the one with William Shatner\nplaying Captain Kirk. But in a famous episode, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy find themselves on a planet\nwhose society is modeled on gangsters from Prohibition-era Chicago. 1 At one point, Kirk creates a\ndiversion by engaging the gangsters in a card game called “fizzbin,” making up the rules as he goes along.\nEach player gets six cards, except for the dealer and the player to his right, who each get a seventh card.\nThe second card is turned up, except on Tuesday. If you get two Jacks, you have a half fizzbin, which is\ngood, but if you get a third Jack, you have a shronk, which is bad. A King and a two are good, except at\nnight, when you want to get a Queen and a four instead. The aim of the game is to get a royal fizzbin, but\nthe odds are astronomically against that. I think you get the idea.\n\nAt times, the regulatory framework that has arisen since the global financial crisis can seem like the game\nof fizzbin – very complicated, seemingly without rationale, and constantly changing. In such an\nenvironment, sometimes it helps to take a step back and focus on some underlying principles that should\nserve as a foundation for any financial regulatory framework, and that can help guide any potential\nchanges to strengthen the framework and promote cross-country harmonization. 2\n\n1\n2\n\nThe Star Trek episode was “A Piece of the Action,” season 2, episode 17, January 12, 1968.\n\nA similar tack was taken in the U.S. Treasury’s recent report outlining proposed changes to financial regulations\nto promote the Administration’s core principles for the financial system. However, the principles I discuss are\nsomewhat different. (See U.S. Department of Treasury, “A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities:\n\n\f2\n\nMy first principle, similar to Star Trek’s prime directive, is that financial system regulation should be\ntailored to the risks imposed on the system, thereby fostering systemic resiliency. By resiliency I mean a\nsystem in which financial institutions remain strong enough to continue to lend and offer other valuable\nfinancial services throughout the ups and downs of the business cycle. The corollary is that if current\nregulations are not furthering this principle, they should be rethought. Similarly, if a portion of the\nfinancial system is prone to systemic problems but doesn’t have adequate oversight, this situation should\nbe rethought, too.\n\nThis principle recognizes that financial services firms provide value. Indeed, the fact that the crisis and\nits aftermath were very dark times for households, businesses, banks, and policymakers and that the\nfinancial system was at the heart of the crisis attests to the vital role a sound financial system plays in\nsupporting a vibrant economy. This principle also recognizes that bank regulation and supervision should\nconcern itself not only with the safety and soundness of individual institutions but also with the risk of the\nsystem overall. The absence of such a focus prior to the financial crisis contributed to a buildup in\nfinancial imbalances and systemic risk. The post-crisis changes made to the regulatory framework aim to\nstrengthen resiliency by lowering the probability of another financial crisis, and by reducing the costs\nimposed on the rest of the economy when a large shock hits the financial system. Important components\ninclude capital requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, living will resolution plans, and\nresolution methods that allow systemically important institutions to fail without causing problems for the\nentire financial system. As a result of the financial crisis and these regulatory changes, banks themselves\nhave also altered how they monitor risks and run their businesses.\n\nBanks and Credit Unions,” June 2017 (https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/pressreleases/Documents/A%20Financial%20System.pdf).)\n\n\f3\nFocusing on risk management makes it clear that institutions posing the most systemic risk should face\nenhanced prudential standards and supervisory attention, while institutions not imposing costs on the rest\nof the financial system or creating the kinds of contagion that can put the entire financial system at risk\nshould face a different type of oversight. Institutions should not be burdened by rules that make it more\ncostly for them to serve their customers but do little to further the goal of a healthy and resilient financial\nsystem. For large banks, the combination of risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio requirement\nas a backstop, liquidity requirements, and annual stress testing is appropriate. But there is now some\nrecognition that there may be opportunities to reduce regulatory burden without increasing systemic risk.\nIn the U.S., some increase in the thresholds at which some of the enhanced requirements kick in would be\nreasonable, as would a reduction in the regulatory burden that has been placed on community banks. 3\nSome steps are already being taken. For example, in late September, the federal banking agencies issued\nfor public comment proposed changes to the capital rules for community banks intended to simplify and\nreduce the burden of rules imposed by Dodd-Frank. 4\n\nAt the same time, it’s important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We learned during the\nfinancial crisis that bank capital standards were too low, that some forms of capital considered to be Tier\n1 by the regulators did not protect the banks when there was a severe shock, and that neither the market\nnor central bank lender-of-last-resort functions were adequate to address severe liquidity problems when\ncollateral values could not be determined. Any changes to the regulatory framework will need to heed the\n\n3\n\nDodd-Frank requires that banks with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion be subject to company-run stress\ntests and that banks with assets of $50 billion or more be subject to annual supervisor-administered stress tests,\ncapital planning, living will, and other enhanced prudential requirements. The Fed has already exempted\nnonsystemic banks with less than $250 billion in assets and less than $75 billion in nonbank activities from the\nqualitative capital planning part of the stress-testing process. See “Federal Reserve Board Announces Finalized\nStress Testing Rules Removing Noncomplex Firms from Qualitative Aspect of CCAR Effective for 2017,” Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System press release, January 30, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170130a.htm).\n4\n\nSee “Agencies Propose Simplifying Regulatory Capital Rules,” joint press release of the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, September 27, 2017 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170927a.htm).\n\n\f4\nfirst principle and preserve the strength and resiliency of the financial system, which benefit the economy.\nIt will be an ongoing challenge to strike the right balance between enhanced financial system resiliency\nand maintaining the system’s ability to deliver economic value by innovating and taking on risk.\n\nMy second principle is that the regulatory framework must recognize that it creates incentives for\nfinancial institutions, their customers, and the regulators themselves and that market forces are always at\nwork. A corollary is that regulations that align incentives with financial stability and that work with\nmarket forces rather than against them will likely be more effective than those that don’t.\n\nUnless the incentive effects are taken into account, even well-intentioned regulations can create\nunintended consequences. For example, before the crisis, some part of the strong growth in financial\nintermediation that occurred outside of the regulated banking system was driven by the desire to avoid\nregulation. Regulatory requirements that differ across sectors can create distortions and undesirable\noutcomes, especially when activity can easily be shifted from a sector that is monitored to a sector that is\ndifficult to monitor. Even within a regulated sector, distortions can creep in. The asset thresholds that\ntrigger increased regulatory requirements create incentives to remain below the thresholds. To the extent\nthat these thresholds are a good measure of systemic risk, creating such incentives can be productive. For\nexample, some banks have taken steps to decrease the complexity of their organizations. However, if the\nthresholds are only loosely connected to risk, efforts to remain slightly below the thresholds and\nregulatory attention on these triggers are not useful.\n\nRegulatory requirements that differ across countries are perhaps even more problematic, as they can result\nin cross-country regulatory arbitrage and put institutions in some countries at a competitive disadvantage.\nFor example, a growing body of research has documented that there are significant scale economies in\n\n\f5\nbanking that are driven by technological advantages and not by safety-net subsidies. 5 Suppose\npolicymakers in one country decide to put a limit on firm size because they believe that the potential costs\nof systemic risk posed by large institutions outweigh the efficiency gains. This would put the country’s\nlarge banks at a competitive disadvantage in global markets unless other countries implemented similar\nconstraints. Because the restrictions would be working against market forces given the scale economies,\nit is unlikely that size restrictions would be effective in the country imposing them. They would create\ngreat incentives for firms to try to evade them by moving activities outside of the more regulated sector\nbut they would not necessarily reduce systemic risk. Risk would migrate but not be eliminated. There\nwould need to be more intensive monitoring of both the regulated and the less-regulated sectors.\n\nThis example suggests that it is desirable to have international agreements on capital and liquidity\nrequirements for systemically important institutions, and coordination when a cross-border institution gets\ninto trouble. The Basel III rules have taken some aspects of capital regimes that were used only in a\nsubset of countries and have applied them more broadly. For example, the rules include a leverage\nrequirement, which was used in the U.S. but not in Europe prior to the crisis, and they include a liquidity\nrequirement, which was used in a few but not many countries prior to the crisis. The hope is that\ninternational coordination leads to more effective regulatory regimes rather than forces movement to the\nlowest common denominator.\n\nThe example also suggests that if regulation could benefit from understanding market forces, there may\nalso be benefits from harnessing market discipline to promote financial stability. A prerequisite for this\nwould be increased disclosure from financial firms so that their creditors and other market participants are\nin a position to exert such discipline.\n5\n\nFor a discussion of this research and the policy implications, see Joseph P. Hughes and Loretta J. Mester, “The\nFuture of Large, Internationally Active Banks: Does Scale Define the Winners?” Chapter 6 in The Future of Large,\nInternationally Active Banks, World Scientific, Hackensack, NJ, Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, Douglas D. Evanoff, and\nGeorge G., Kaufman, eds., 2017, pp. 77-96.\n\n\f6\n\nPerhaps most important to remember is that regulators also face incentives. During the financial crisis,\nregulators and policymakers faced significant time-inconsistency problems when confronting\nsystemically important financial institutions on the brink of failure. They faced a classic dilemma: either\nrescue the insolvent firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and risk causing a\ncascade of other failures. As Ben Bernanke reportedly said: “There are no atheists in foxholes or\nideologues in financial crises.” 6 Without a credible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that\nwell-intentioned policymakers will be biased toward bailouts. Said simply, policymakers and regulators\nare people, too. Recognizing regulatory incentives should guide the design of the regulatory regime.\nThis underscores the need for credible methods of resolving insolvent firms and of well-designed lenderof-last-resort functions that reduce perceived stigma.\n\nMy final principle is that the regulatory framework needs to be designed so that institutions, regulators,\nand policymakers can be held accountable for the responsibilities assigned to them. There has been a rise\nin skepticism about institutions since the financial crisis. This is understandable given the depth and\nbreadth of the crisis and its aftermath, but it also suggests there is some urgency to considering how to\nincrease accountability in productive ways. A framework that encourages regulators to be more\nsystematic and less discretionary in how they implement regulations can help, as it sets up appropriate\nexpectations.\n\nIn addition, while the regulatory framework needs to acknowledge that the financial structure is complex,\nthe framework itself should only be as complex as necessary to be effective. 7 The notion that\n\n6\n\nSee Peter Baker, “A Professor and a Banker Bury Old Dogma on Markets,” New York Times, September 20, 2008\n(http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21paulson.html).\n\n7\n\nHaldane and Madouros (2012) discuss the benefits of a less complex financial regulatory structure and argue that\nthe complexity of the financial landscape does not call for a complex financial regulatory structure, but just the\nopposite (see Andrew G. Haldane and Vasileios Madouros, “The Dog and the Frisbee,” speech at the Federal\n\n\f7\n“everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler” is often (perhaps erroneously)\nattributed to Albert Einstein. But it applies to regulatory regimes. A sometimes overlooked lesson from\nthe crisis is that regulatory complexity can complicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and\nenforcement. Too much complexity can make it harder for regulators to assess compliance and identify\nrisk-shifting behavior, which means it is difficult to impose consequences for firms that fail to meet the\nstandards.\n\nEqually important, complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the regulators and align their incentives\nto carry out effective supervision and regulation. We should always be assessing whether we would be\nbetter off with a simpler regulatory structure that is easier to implement and govern, and that is\napproximately right across various states of the world, even if it is never optimal in any particular state or\nin any particular model of the economy.\n\nIf the system is too complex to evaluate, it will be difficult for the public and their representatives to hold\nregulators accountable. Either there will be no accountability or the regulators and policymakers will be\nheld accountable for every bad outcome, regardless of whether the outcome stems from poor performance\non their part or not. A simpler system allows for more effective accountability.\n\nReserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Policy Symposium, “The Changing Policy Landscape,” Jackson Hole,\nWY, August 31, 2012 (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/Haldane_final.pdf).\n\n\f8\nAt the same time, we should not be seduced by regulations that appear to be simple but would, in fact, be\nineffective and result in unintended consequences. Because the financial system is complex and everchanging, there will need to be some complexity in the regulatory framework. As I mentioned earlier,\nproposals to break up the banks or set a size limit might seem appealing as a solution to the too-big-to-fail\nproblem, but I think this would cause unintended and counterproductive consequences.\n\nSpeaking of simplicity, the three guiding principles I have discussed – aligning regulations with systemic\nrisk, paying attention to incentives and market forces, and increasing accountability – sound simple but\nare, in fact, difficult to pull off. Still, I think they deserve attention as we strive for a regulatory\nframework that is more effective and better able to deliver the benefits of a well-functioning financial\nsystem to the public.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Economic Club of Pittsburgh, the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh,\nCFA Society Pittsburgh, and the Pittsburgh Association for Financial Professionals\nPittsburgh, PA\nSeptember 7, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to share my views on the economy and monetary policy. This is a\nvery opportune time for me to be here. The Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking\nbody within the Fed, meets in less than two weeks. Traveling to Pittsburgh allows me to hear first-hand\nfrom people in this part of the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which comprises western Pennsylvania,\nOhio, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Of course, as an economist, I look\nat data and economic models to help formulate my views, but the information on emerging issues that the\nCleveland Fed staff and I gather directly from contacts throughout the District is also very important in\nassessing how the economy is doing. The FOMC spends considerable time discussing regional economic\nconditions at our meetings, and this information from all across the country helps us set national monetary\npolicy.\n\nIn addition to providing an opportunity to hear from you, my talk today also lets me explain my views on\nmonetary policy. Congress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability. At the same time, Congress has also wisely granted the Fed independence in setting\nmonetary policy in pursuit of those goals, meaning that policy decisions are insulated from short-run\npolitical considerations. But accountability must go hand in hand with that independence. I call this\n“accountable independence.” In order for the public and Congress to have the information they need to\nhold the Fed accountable for monetary policy decisions, it is important for Fed policymakers to regularly\ncommunicate their views. So I value this time with you today.\n\nAt this point, it is probably a good idea to remind people that the views I’ll provide today are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\n\f2\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion is now in its ninth year, one of the longest on record. But as everyone knows,\nage does not always indicate maturity. It’s good to remember that the economy had to climb out of a very\ndeep hole after the financial crisis and Great Recession, and it took some time for the expansion to gain\ntraction. Of course, there have been some ups and downs along the journey. Our thoughts are with the\npeople in Texas and along the Gulf Coast, and all those coping with the destruction in the wake of\nHurricane Harvey. We are gathering information from our contacts, but it is still too early to assess the\nfull economic impact of the storm. Experience suggests that soon after the storm passes, clean-up and\nrebuilding begin, oil refineries are assessed and brought back on-line, and shipping channels reopen.\nThese are huge undertakings and I expect we will see fortitude and resilience as this hard work proceeds.\nOne help is that the underlying fundamentals supporting the economy remain sound. These fundamentals\ninclude accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, a stronger U.S. banking system,\nimproved household balance sheets and income growth, continued strength in the U.S. labor market, and\nimproving conditions in the economies of our trading partners.\n\nEconomic growth\nOver the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on\naverage, and I anticipate that GDP will expand over the next year or so at a pace somewhat above trend,\nwhich I estimate at 2 percent. The hurricane in the Gulf will likely dampen economic activity in the\ncurrent quarter, with subsequent rebuilding efforts adding to growth in subsequent quarters. Although\nstorms like Harvey and Irma are atypical – thank goodness – quarterly variation in the data is not unusual.\nConsumer spending, which makes up over two-thirds of output, slowed in the first quarter but picked up\nin the second quarter. The outlook for household spending remains sound. Readings on consumer\nsentiment and confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing\nbecause labor markets continue to improve. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the\nGreat Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings, coupled with\n\n\f3\ncumulative increases in stock and house prices. Although not true for every homeowner, in the aggregate,\nthe equity households have in housing is now back to what it was at the peak.\n\nThe recovery in the housing market has taken some time. Buyers, sellers, developers, and bankers were\nall wary about reentering the market, and rightfully so, given the fallout from the housing bust. But with\nsupport from low interest rates and the improved financial condition of households and lenders, we’ve\nseen a gradual increase in housing construction and sales over the expansion. In some places, demand for\nhousing is outpacing supply, putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at about a 6\npercent pace, on average, nationally. 1 Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to\nexpand at a sustainable pace.\n\nAn encouraging sign in the economy is the strengthening in business activity and investment this year,\nafter subdued readings in 2015 and 2016. In recent years, oil prices and the value of the dollar have been\nimportant influences on business spending. You’ll recall that there was a sharp drop in oil prices from\nover $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $30 in early 2016. This led to a sharp pullback in activity in\nthe mining and drilling sector and its suppliers, including the steel industry. At the same time, a sharp 20\npercent appreciation of the dollar hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Since then,\nconditions supporting business spending have improved. The rebound in oil prices to around $50 per\nbarrel and the rise in natural gas prices have spurred a strong recovery in mining and drilling activity.\nThe modest appreciation in the dollar over the second half of 2016 and depreciation since the start of this\nyear reflect improved conditions in the economies in our trading partners. This has led to a pickup in U.S.\nmanufacturing activity and in our exports to other countries.\n\n1\n\nAs has been typically the case, house prices in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area are growing less rapidly than the\nnational average, in the 3 to 4 percent range.\n\n\f4\nCurrently, business sentiment remains at high levels and supportive of continued spending, but some of\nmy business contacts report that mounting political and fiscal policy uncertainty has begun to temper\nsome of that optimism. There are scattered reports from a few firms that they are delaying some of their\nplanned investment until the picture becomes clearer. We’ll need to keep a watch on whether this waitand-see attitude spreads and begins to weigh more broadly on spending and investment decisions.\n\nA pullback on investments in physical and human capital or in research and development leading to\ninnovations would be particularly troubling because these investments can have a positive effect on\nproductivity growth, which measures how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs\nto make output. Productivity growth is a key determinant of an economy’s longer-run output growth and\nof living standards. But the U.S. economy has been struggling with very low productivity growth. Over\nthe expansion, annual growth in labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector, has averaged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen\nover the prior two expansions. Low productivity growth, coupled with slower growth of the labor force,\nhelps to explain why the trend economic growth rate, which I estimate at 2 percent, is lower than the 3 to\n3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s. It also helps to explain why the acceleration in wages\nsince 2013 has been relatively subdued despite the strength we’ve seen in labor markets and reports of\nshortages of qualified workers in many occupations.\n\nLabor markets\nAs the economic expansion has progressed, firms have been adding people to their payrolls. So far this\nyear, job increases have averaged 176,000 per month, a bit under last year’s pace. This rate exceeds most\nestimates of trend employment growth, which fall in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The\nunemployment rate peaked at 10 percent after the Great Recession, but as the economy has added jobs at\nan above-trend pace, the unemployment rate moved down. For the past five months, the unemployment\nrate has stabilized, with monthly readings bouncing between 4.3 and 4.4 percent; the rate is now\n\n\f5\nessentially at the lowest level reached during the last expansion. Of course, to gauge labor market\nconditions, we look at more than payroll employment growth and this headline measure of the\nunemployment rate. We examine a broad set of indicators, including job opening and turnover rates, and\nbroader measures of the unemployment rate, such as those that include the number of part-time workers\nwho would rather work full time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a\njob. These measures also indicate that substantial progress has been made in the labor market. Although\nwe may see a weaker payroll employment number for September due to the hurricane, I expect that labor\nmarket conditions will remain healthy and that over the next year the unemployment rate will stay below\n4-3/4 percent, my current estimate of its longer-run rate.\n\nGranted, there is considerable uncertainty around estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate. The\nrelatively modest acceleration in wages, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2\npercent in recent quarters, suggests to some that there is still considerable slack in labor markets and that\nthe longer-run unemployment rate is lower than the current rate. For me, a more salient factor in the\nrelatively slow growth in wages is the low level of productivity growth. 2 Firms have indicated that there\nisn’t much slack in the labor market, and we are hearing more frequent reports from our labor and\nbusiness contacts across a broad set of industries that businesses are having trouble finding qualified\nworkers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. Some of these firms report they are\nresponding by raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain workers. These increases\nshould eventually find their way into the aggregate compensation measures, but unless productivity\ngrowth picks up, I wouldn’t expect to see a strong acceleration in wages.\n\n2\n\nAlthough actual wage setting is a complicated process, in economic models of competitive markets, real wages\nreflect the marginal product of workers. For a discussion of wages and their relationship to productivity growth over\nthe expansion, see Roberto Pinheiro and Meifeng Yang, “Wage Growth after the Great Recession,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, Economic Commentary, March 21, 2017 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economic-commentaries/ec-201704-wage-growth-after-greatrecession.aspx).\n\n\f6\nSo my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address,\nwe have achieved the maximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate. At the same\ntime, there are some longer-run structural issues in the labor market that cannot be addressed by monetary\npolicy but that the country must tackle. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature\nof available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. While the overall economy will\neventually benefit from these forces, many individuals and some regions are adversely affected by these\nstructural trends. Government policies and programs and public-private partnerships can and should be\nbrought to bear to help people gain the skills needed for jobs in the modern economy and to help\ncommunities make the transition. This is already happening in Pittsburgh. The Allegheny Conference on\nCommunity Development has published an in-depth analysis of the expected supply and demand for labor\nin the Pittsburgh region over the next decade and has made a number of recommendations to help the\nregion prepare for the coming changes. 3 The study drew on some of the work being conducted by the\nFederal Reserve System’s community development function. In October, the Fed will hold a capstone\nconference on a collaborative initiative that has focused on reframing workforce development efforts as\ninvestments, allowing for larger-scale solutions with increased accountability for outcomes. 4\n\nInflation\nPrice stability is the other part of the Fed’s mandate. Inflation has had its ups and downs over the\nexpansion. It has moved up from the very low levels seen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil\nand import prices. But the last couple of readings were on the weak side and inflation continues to run\n3\n\n“Inflection Point: Supply, Demand and the Future of Work in the Pittsburgh Region,” report prepared by Burning\nGlass Technologies and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning with Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment, May 2016 (http://www.alleghenyconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/InflectionPoint.pdf).\n\n4\n\nThe initiative, “Investing in America’s Workforce: Improving Outcomes for Workers and Employers,” is a Federal\nReserve System initiative in collaboration with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers\nUniversity, the Ray Marshall Center of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of\nTexas, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. The capstone conference will be held on October\n4-6, 2017 in Austin, Texas. More information on the initiative and the conference is available at\nhttps://www.investinwork.org/.\n\n\f7\nbelow the Fed’s goal of 2 percent. The year-over-year increase in PCE inflation stood at 1.4 percent in\nJuly, up from about 1 percent a year ago. Most people understand why high inflation is a problem: it\nerodes the purchasing power of their money. But inflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead\nconsumers and businesses to delay purchases and it increases debt burdens, either of which could slow the\neconomy.\n\nIn assessing where we are relative to the inflation goal, it’s always a good idea to look through temporary\nmovements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is\ngoing on a sustained basis. For example, when assessing the underlying trend in inflation, we should look\nthrough a temporary increase in gasoline prices stemming from disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey.\nSimilarly, some of the weakness in recent inflation reports reflects special factors, like the drop in the\nprices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans earlier in the year. It may take a couple more\nmonths for these factors to work themselves through, but these types of price declines aren’t signaling a\ngeneral downward trend in consumer prices from weak demand. Instead, they reflect supply-side factors\nand relative price changes. At the same time, we need to recognize that weak inflation numbers, no\nmatter what the source, can become a problem if they start to undermine the public’s expectations about\nfuture inflation. If inflation expectations were to become unanchored and began steadily declining, it\nwould be much more difficult to raise inflation back to the Fed’s goal.\n\nI don’t expect the economy to get to that point, and my current assessment is that inflation will remain\nbelow our goal for somewhat longer but that the conditions remain in place for inflation to gradually\nreturn over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent on a sustained basis. These conditions\ninclude growth that’s expected to be at or slightly above trend, continued strength in the labor market, and\nreasonably stable inflation expectations.\n\n\f8\nWe need to recognize that there are risks around any inflation projection – both upside risks, considering\nthe current and future expected strength in labor markets, and downside risks, given the softness in recent\ninflation readings. In fact, inflation is difficult to forecast: based on historical forecast errors over the past\n20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE inflation one year ahead is plus or minus 1\npercentage point, 5 and a significant portion of the variation in inflation rates comes from idiosyncratic\nfactors that can’t be forecasted. 6 Indeed, since the 1990s, assuming that inflation will return to 2 percent\nover the next one to two years has been one of the most accurate forecasts. In the recent period, this is\nperhaps a testament to the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations and of the FOMC’s\ncommitment to its 2 percent symmetric inflation goal. In any case, I will be scrutinizing incoming data on\ninflation and inflation expectations and the reports from my business contacts to help me assess the\ninflation outlook.\n\nEconomic developments in Pittsburgh\nAs I mentioned at the start of my talk, evaluating regional economic conditions plays an important role in\nsetting national monetary policy, so let me spend a few minutes discussing the Pittsburgh-area economy.\nFor some time, this region’s economy has been transitioning from one that is largely dependent on steel,\ncoal mining, and heavy industry, to one that is diversifying into health care, education, financial services,\nand technology. 7 This is a promising development because regions that remain dependent on one\n5\n\nSee “Table 2. Average Historical Projection Error Ranges,” in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of\nthe Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 13-14, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20170614.pdf).\n\n6\n\nSee Janet Yellen, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial\nLecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/yellen20150924a.pdf).\n\n7\n\nPittsburgh has a higher share of employment in the service-producing sector than does the U.S., and this share has\nrisen over time, from about 71 percent of employment in the 1990s to about 77 percent today. The comparable\nshares in the U.S. are 64 percent and 71 percent, respectively. The share of employment in the education and health\nservices component of the service sector in Pittsburgh is higher than in the U.S., and it has shown considerable\ngrowth over time. In Pittsburgh, this share rose from 17 percent in the 1990s to 21 percent today. The comparable\nshares in the U.S. are 11 percent and 16 percent, respectively. (Author’s calculations using payroll employment data\nfrom the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\n\n\f9\nparticular industry have fared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their\nindustrial bases and adapt to changing economic forces. Nonetheless, Pittsburgh’s industrial mix and the\ntypes of shocks that hit the economy played a role in how the area has fared over the expansion.\n\nThe Great Recession took its toll on the region but Pittsburgh was an early achiever in the expansion. In\n2012, Pittsburgh was one of the first major U.S. metropolitan areas to see payroll jobs move back up to\npre-Great Recession levels. The U.S. as a whole didn’t achieve that milestone until mid-2014, and\nPennsylvania, not until 2015. The unemployment rate in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area peaked at\naround 8-1/2 percent in 2010 and had fallen to about 5-1/4 percent by the end of 2014.\n\nBut the decline in energy prices and the appreciation of the dollar in 2014 to 2016 took a toll on the\nregion, causing a contraction in energy exploration and production, and steel production. Though job\nlosses in these sectors were offset by continued increases in service-sector jobs, the unemployment rate\nbegan to rise.\n\nThe good news is that once energy prices and the dollar stabilized, the unemployment rate began falling\nagain to its current level of just over 5 percent, and overall employment began growing again. Certain\nsectors are still losing jobs, but the pace of job cuts in mining and drilling has slowed and job cuts in\nmanufacturing have stabilized. Losses in these sectors are being more than offset by gains in the service\nsector, where we see relatively strong growth in scientific R&D jobs in the metro area.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAs I mentioned earlier, the FOMC will be meeting later this month to discuss the economy and decide on\nmonetary policy. We will also be releasing a new round of economic projections, something we do four\ntimes a year. Based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook, the FOMC has begun to\nnormalize the stance of monetary policy by removing some of the extraordinary accommodation that was\n\n\f10\nnecessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Appropriate adjustments in monetary\npolicy are those that will sustain the expansion, not curtail it, so that our longer-run goals of price stability\nand maximum employment are met and maintained.\n\nBecause we know that it takes some time for monetary policy to work itself through the economy, we\ncan’t wait until these policy goals are fully met to act. We need to assess what incoming information is\ntelling us about where the economy is going over the medium run, and the risks around that medium-run\noutlook, and set policy appropriately.\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via\ngradual increases in the fed funds rate will be needed and will help sustain the expansion. A gradual\nremoval of accommodation helps avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if\nthe economy is allowed to overheat, as well as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low,\nencouraging investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield or engendering other\nfinancial imbalances. The gradual approach to normalization allows for the kind of fluctuations we’ve\nseen in the data on the economy and inflation without having to change our strategy. I see this\nconsistency as a positive in that it underscores our systematic approach to promoting our policy goals and\nit removes policy ambiguity at a time when uncertainty seems to be rising on other fronts.\n\nIt’s important to notice that the gradual path I anticipate does not entail an increase at each FOMC\nmeeting. At its July meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n1 to 1-1/4 percent. It also announced that economic conditions are expected to evolve in a way that will\nwarrant further gradual increases; the pace of those increases will depend on what incoming information\nimplies about the medium-run outlook.\n\n\f11\nNormalizing the stance of monetary policy also means taking steps to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet\nin terms of the size and composition of assets. To address the Great Recession, the Fed undertook several\nprograms to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgagebacked securities (MBS). These purchases aimed to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates\nonce the FOMC’s traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As a\nresult of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6\npercent of nominal GDP, to about $4.5 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. 8 In addition, the\ncomposition of the Fed’s assets has changed from mainly short-term Treasury securities to mainly longermaturity Treasuries and agency MBS. In tandem with the increase in Fed assets, there was a sizable\nincrease in Fed liabilities, namely, depository institution deposits, or reserves, held at the Fed. Reserves\nhave increased from about $11 billion in 2007 to over $2 trillion today. In October 2014, the Fed stopped\nthe program to increase the size of its balance sheet, but since then, we’ve been reinvesting the returns\nfrom maturing securities, thereby maintaining the balance sheet’s large size.\n\nThe FOMC’s intention is to reduce the size of the balance sheet over time to the smallest size needed to\nimplement monetary policy efficiently and effectively and, in the longer run, to hold primarily Treasury\nsecurities. 9 In June, the FOMC described its program for normalizing the balance sheet by gradually\nreducing the amount of reinvestments it is making in a predictable way. 10 The gradual, predictable\ndecline allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on\n\n8\n\nThe comparable figures for the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, which are also using asset\npurchases to increase accommodation, are 38 percent and 91 percent, respectively. (Balance-sheet data for the\nEuropean Central Bank from the Eurosystem are available at\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/wfs/2017/html/ecb.fs170808.en.html. Balance-sheet data for the Bank of Japan\nare available at https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/boj/other/acmai/release/2017/ac170731.htm/.)\n\n9\n\nSee “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm).\n\n10\n\nSee “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System press release, June 14, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm).\n\n\f12\nsetting the appropriate level of the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool. The FOMC\nexpects to begin implementing the program relatively soon, 11 and I favor doing this in the near future.\nFirst, by design, it will be a very gradual process of decreasing the amount of assets reinvested each\nmonth, with balance sheet normalization taking several years. 12 Second, the plan has been well\ntelegraphed in advance. Both of these aspects make it less likely that we will see a sudden or sizable\nincrease in long-term yields as a result of the announcement of the start of implementation. Indeed, in my\nview, other factors, including the ongoing discussions about the debt ceiling, rising geopolitical tensions,\nand political uncertainty, would be more likely to influence Treasury yields in the near term.\n\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, we know the balance sheet will be larger than it was\nprior to the financial crisis for the simple reason that the public’s demand for currency is rising over\ntime. 13 But it will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. How much smaller depends on\nhow the FOMC decides to implement monetary policy in the future. 14 But because it will take several\nyears to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, there is no reason to delay the start of\nnormalization until this decision is made.\n\n11\n\nSee the FOMC post-meeting statement of July 26, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170726a.htm).\n12\n\nOnce started, the plan is to allow up to $6 billion a month of maturing Treasuries and $4 billion a month of\nprincipal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to run off the balance sheet. These caps would be increased by\n$6 billion and $4 billion per month, respectively, every three months, until they reach $30 billion per month for\nTreasuries and $20 billion per month for agency MBS and agency debt. Thereafter, those caps would be maintained\nand the balance sheet would gradually decline. (See “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization\nPrinciples and Plans,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System press release, June 14, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm) ).\nFor projections of the Fed’s balance sheet under various scenarios, see “Projections for the SOMA Portfolio and\nNet Income,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, July 2017\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/omo/SOMAPortfolioandIncomeProjections_July2017Up\ndate.pdf).\n13\n\nSince the financial crisis, currency has doubled in quantity, from about $770 billion in 2007 to about $1.5 trillion\ntoday.\n14\n\nFor an accessible description of frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see Jane E. Ihrig, Ellen E. Meade,\nand Gretchen C. Weinbach, “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach to\nRaising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198\n(http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177).\n\n\f13\n\nAs a final remark, it’s important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and\nbecause of that, monetary policy is not pre-set. The confidence bands the FOMC is now providing\naround its economic and policy path projections are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers\nthat there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in\nhow it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook\nindeed materially change. That said, I view the steps the FOMC is taking to gradually normalize\nmonetary policy – both the fed funds rate and the balance sheet – as a welcome acknowledgment that the\neconomy itself has normalized.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Community Bankers Association of Ohio Annual Convention\nCincinnati, OH\nAugust 2, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Community Bankers Association of Ohio for the opportunity to speak at your annual\nconvention and for your ongoing engagement with the Federal Reserve. That engagement actually goes\nback to the very beginnings of the Federal Reserve System. It might surprise some of you to know that in\n1913, Elvadore Fancher, a vice president with Union National Bank of Cleveland, wrote to Congress\nsuggesting how the regional Reserve Banks might be structured. A year later, Fancher was chosen to be\nthe first head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, a position in which he served for two decades. 1\nToday, I enjoy the fruits of the strong relationship that has developed between Ohio bankers and the\nCleveland Fed. The bankers who serve on our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council\n(CDIAC) and on our board of directors generously provide me with their valuable insights into regional\neconomic and banking conditions. As you all know, community banks play a vital role in the economic\nhealth of their communities, providing creditworthy businesses the wherewithal to prosper and\nhouseholds the ability to improve their financial standing and quality of life. Because of their important\nwork, community bankers are among the most knowledgeable about changes in conditions on the ground\nin local areas. Such information often takes much longer to show up in official statistical reports. So I\nfind the insights gained from speaking with bankers to be especially valuable as part of the mosaic of\ninformation I use in formulating my views on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nOf course, from time to time, I also hear from community bankers about matters pertaining to banking\nregulation and supervision. Recently, these conversations have highlighted the burden of the regulatory\nchanges put in place since the financial crisis. I am grateful to the bankers who willingly discuss both the\neconomy and regulation with me, and today I would like to return the favor and provide you with some of\n\n1\n\nFor further information about Elvadore Fancher, see\nhttps://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/elvadore_r_fancher.\n\n\f2\nmy perspectives on both. Of course, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nThe economic expansion turned eight years old this summer. It got off to a slow start from a very weak\nplace, but now this expansion is one of the longest on record. The sustainability of the expansion through\nvarious economic shocks is a testament to the U.S. economy’s resiliency, and I believe the underlying\nfundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. While the quarterly pattern has had its\nshare of ups and downs, it is usually a good idea to smooth through this volatility when trying to assess\nunderlying conditions. Over the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more\nthan 2 percent, on average. This year, growth in the first quarter was a bit soft, but it picked up in the\nsecond quarter. Favorable fundamentals should support GDP growth over the next year at somewhat\nabove trend, which I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy\nand financial conditions, a sound U.S. banking system, improved household balance sheets and income\ngrowth, continued strength in the U.S. labor market, and improving conditions in the economies of our\ntrading partners.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. So far this year,\nthat strength has been sustained, with an average increase of 180,000 jobs per month. The pace is well\nabove estimates of trend employment growth, which range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month,\ndepending on what one assumes about labor force participation. The trend pace of employment growth is\nlower than it was a few decades ago because there has been a downward trend in participation, reflecting\ndemographic factors, including the aging of our population. The fact that the participation rate has been\nbasically stable for the past three years in the face of a declining trend is another sign of strength in the\nlabor market.\n\n\f3\nOver the expansion, as the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has been moving down. The\nunemployment rate peaked at 10 percent after the Great Recession. In June, it stood at 4.4 percent,\nmatching the lowest level reached in the previous expansion. In addition, broader measures of the\nunemployment rate, which track the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time and\nthe number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, have also fallen significantly\nsince their business cycle peaks. Given the progress that has already been made, payroll job growth is\nlikely to slow a bit from its current pace, but I expect that over the next year the unemployment rate will\nstay below my estimate of its longer-run rate, which I now estimate at 4-3/4 percent. I recently lowered\nmy estimate from 5 percent, and even though this change is not statistically significant, I thought it was\ntime to acknowledge that even as labor markets continue to tighten, inflation has remained moderate.\n\nInflation has had its ups and downs over the expansion. It has moved up from the very low levels seen in\n2015 when it was held down by falling oil and import prices. But the last couple of readings were on the\nweak side and inflation continues to run below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent. In assessing where we are\nrelative to the goal, it’s always a good idea to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both\nthose above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis. Some\nof the weakness in recent inflation reports reflects special factors, like the drop in the prices of\nprescription drugs and cell phone service plans. It may take a couple of months for these factors to work\nthemselves through, but these types of price declines aren’t signaling a general downward trend in\nconsumer prices. I’ll be scrutinizing incoming inflation data and reports from my business contacts, but\nat this point, my assessment is that the conditions remain in place for inflation to gradually return over the\nnext year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent on a sustained basis. These conditions include growth\nthat’s expected to be at or slightly above trend, continued strength in the labor market, and reasonably\nstable inflation expectations.\n\n\f4\nBased on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook, the Fed has begun to normalize the stance\nof monetary policy by removing some of the extraordinary accommodation that was necessary in the\nwake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those\nthat will sustain the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment\nare met and maintained. We can’t wait until the goals are fully met because monetary policy affects the\neconomy with a lag. We need to remain focused on the medium-run outlook, and risks around the\noutlook, assessing what incoming economic reconnaissance implies about the outlook and risks. If\neconomic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via gradual\nincreases in the fed funds rate will be needed.\n\nThe gradual path that the FOMC has communicated for some time is appropriate given the outlook will\nhelp prolong the expansion, not curtail it. A gradual removal of accommodation helps avoid a build-up of\nrisks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as well as risks to\nfinancial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on excessively risky\ninvestments in a search for yield. The gradualism has allowed us to follow a consistent strategy even as\nthe data on the economy and inflation have shown some fluctuations. I see benefits to this consistency: it\nremoves some ambiguity and it underscores the fact that we set monetary policy systematically, with a\nfocus on the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook and their implications for our policy goals.\n\nIt’s important to notice that the gradual path I anticipate does not entail an increase at each FOMC\nmeeting, and last week, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1\nto 1-1/4 percent; it also announced that economic conditions are expected to evolve in a way that will\nwarrant further gradual increases.\n\nNormalizing the stance of monetary policy also means taking steps to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet\nin terms of the size and composition of assets. The balance sheet grew when, to address the Great\n\n\f5\nRecession, the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity\nTreasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These purchases aimed to put downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates once the FOMC’s traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had\nbeen reduced to effectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet has grown from\nnearly $900 billion in assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from\nmainly short-term Treasury securities to mainly longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\n\nFrom the very start of using the nontraditional tools, the FOMC recognized it would need to eventually\nreturn to a more normal balance sheet. In June, the FOMC described its program for normalizing the\nbalance sheet by gradually reducing the amount of reinvestments it is making in a predictable way. 2 Last\nweek, the FOMC said it expected to begin implementing the program relatively soon. 3\n\nOnce started, the plan is to allow up to $6 billion a month of maturing Treasuries and $4 billion a month\nof principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to run off the balance sheet. These caps would be\nincreased by $6 billion and $4 billion per month, respectively, every three months, until they reach $30\nbillion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency MBS and agency debt. Thereafter,\nthose caps would be maintained and the balance sheet would gradually decline. The gradual, predictable\ndecline allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on\nsetting the appropriate level of the funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool.\n\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, the intention is to reduce it over time to the smallest size\nneeded to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. We know the balance sheet will be\n2\n\nSee “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System press release, June 14, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm).\n\n3\n\nSee the FOMC post-meeting statement of July 26, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170726a.htm).\n\n\f6\nlarger than it was prior to the financial crisis for the simple reason that the public’s demand for currency\nis rising over time. 4 But it will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much\nsmaller depends on how the FOMC implements monetary policy in the future. The FOMC has not yet\ndecided whether its long-run framework will be one in which bank reserves are scarce, as was the case\nbefore the financial crisis, or one in which reserves are abundant. 5 However, because it will take several\nyears to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, the FOMC can begin normalizing the\nbalance sheet before we have decided on the balance sheet’s ultimate size.\n\nIt’s important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and because of that,\nmonetary policy is not pre-set. In March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its\neconomic and policy path projections. 6 These are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers\nthat there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in\nhow it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook\nindeed materially change. That said, I view the steps the FOMC is taking to normalize monetary policy –\n\n4\n\nSince the financial crisis, currency has doubled in quantity, from about $770 billion in 2007 to about $1.5 trillion\ntoday.

That the financial system was at the heart of the crisis attests to the\nfact that a sound financial system is a vital part of a vibrant economy. The 2008 financial crisis exposed\ngaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which contributed to a buildup in financial\nimbalances and systemic risk. In response to the crisis, changes were made to how banks are regulated\nand supervised, and banks themselves have made changes in how they monitor risks and run their\nbusinesses. As a result, the U.S. financial system is considerably stronger and more resilient than it was\nleading up to the financial crisis. This strength and resiliency benefit the economy and must be preserved.\n\nHowever, just as the improved economy affords us the opportunity to begin to normalize monetary\npolicy, the improved health of the banking industry makes this an opportune time to consider whether any\nadjustments to the regulatory and supervisory framework could make it even more effective. I won’t\nkeep you in too much suspense: the Federal Reserve and the other financial regulatory agencies are\nalready taking steps to improve the effectiveness of their supervision. Before I discuss some of the steps\nthat are particularly relevant for community banks, it might be helpful to review why banks are regulated\nand the basic approach to effective regulation.\n\nA risk-based approach to bank regulation and supervision\nBanks play an important role in the economy by providing funding to creditworthy borrowers, both\nbusinesses and households, by offering customers methods to save and make payments, and by helping\npeople and firms manage their financial affairs. Community banks play a crucial role in their local\neconomies, and particularly so in many small towns and rural areas where the choices of financial\n\n\f8\nservices are limited. 7 Small businesses rely heavily on community banks for credit, and given the\nimportant role that small businesses play in the economy, it isn’t hard to see that serving these types of\nfirms helps to promote growth. 8 In addition, community banks tend to have close ties to the communities\nand customers they serve, and this allows them to offer products and services tailored to their customers’\nneeds. 9\n\nBut banks of all sizes are able to provide these valuable credit, payment, and financial management\nservices because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial\nbusinesses. This risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic problems that could threaten\nthe functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and impose significant economic\ncosts. The bank regulatory and supervisory framework is meant to address the potential problem of\nsystemic risk, as well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions. The framework aims to foster\na financial system that’s resilient: one in which financial institutions remain strong enough to continue to\nlend and offer other valuable services through the ups and downs of the business cycle.\n\n7\n\nSee, for example, “The Role of Community Banks in the U.S. Economy,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nEconomic Review, Second Quarter 2003, pp. 15-43\n(https://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/econrev/Pdf/2q03keet.pdf).\n\n8\n\nThree-quarters of U.S. businesses have fewer than 10 employees. Over a quarter of U.S. private-sector jobs are at\nfirms with fewer than 50 employees, and over half are at firms with fewer than 500 employees (based on data from\nsupplemental tables F and G of the National Business Employment Dynamics Data, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,\navailable at http://www.bls.gov/bdm/bdmfirmsize.htm).

Mester, “The National and Regional Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,”\nremarks at the African American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania Annual Business Luncheon,\nPittsburgh, PA, November 30, 2016\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom%20and%20events/speeches/sp%2020161130%20the%20national%20and\n%20regional%20economic%20outlook%20and%20monetary%20policy).\n9\n\nSee Allen N. Berger and Gregory F. Udell, “Small Business Credit Availability and Relationship Lending: The\nImportance of Bank Organisational Structure,” Economic Journal 112, February 2002, pp. 32-53 (working paper\nversion available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2001/200136/200136pap.pdf), and Allen N.

Important components of the regulatory-supervisory\nframework include capital requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, living will resolution plans,\nand resolution methods that allow systemically important institutions to fail without causing problems for\nthe entire financial system.\n\nThe focus on risk management means that institutions that pose the most systemic risk should face\nenhanced prudential standards and supervisory attention. The Dodd-Frank Act took a step in this\ndirection and the Federal Reserve takes a tiered approach to banking supervision. Aligning oversight with\nrisk helps to ensure that institutions aren’t burdened by rules that make it more costly for them to serve\ntheir customers but that do little to further the goal of a healthy and resilient financial system.\nCommunity banks generally don’t impose costs on the rest of the financial system or create the kinds of\ncontagion that can put the entire financial system at risk, so their oversight should differ from that of\nsystemically important institutions. At the same time, as the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and the\ncommercial real estate crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s remind us, when many smaller institutions\nget in trouble at the same time, this can also harm the economy. So maintaining the safety and soundness\nof smaller institutions cannot be neglected. It’s a matter of aligning oversight with potential risk.\n\nSteps to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks without sacrificing financial resiliency,\nsafety, and soundness\nThis tiering of oversight by risk adds some complexity to the financial system’s regulatory framework.\nBut the U.S. financial system is quite complex and ever-changing, with various types of banks and\nnonbank providers of financial services. So some complexity is to be expected. To paraphrase H.L.\nMencken: “For every complex problem there is a solution that is clear, simple, and wrong.” That said,\nit’s important that the regulatory framework avoid excessive complexity, which can complicate\n\n\f10\nsupervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Too much complexity can make it harder for\nbanks to understand the standards they are being asked to meet, and harder for regulators to assess\ncompliance and overall risk. Better aligning our regulation and supervision with the risks imposed could\nallow simplifications without sacrificing safety, soundness, and resiliency.\n\nThe Volcker rule is perhaps an obvious example of this. Dodd-Frank generally limits banks from\nengaging in proprietary trading of financial instruments and investing in hedge funds and private equity\nfunds. But the rule is quite complex. Given that community banks are not likely to participate in such\nactivities, there doesn’t appear to be much to gain from having them maintain a compliance program. So\nI support exempting community banks from the Volcker rule.\n\nOther simplifications are already taking place. Earlier this year, the federal banking agencies completed\ntheir decennial review of banking regulations to identify provisions that are outdated or unnecessary. 10\nAs a result of the review, 78 guidance letters were deemed out-of-date and were eliminated, and the datareporting requirements for small community banks were reduced and simplified, resulting in a shorter\nCall Report.\n\nIn addition, exam frequency has been reduced for a large set of institutions. Now, 83 percent of all\ninsured depository institutions qualify to be examined every 18 months rather than every 12 months, as a\nresult of a provision in the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act that raised the asset\nthreshold from $500 million to $1 billion.\n\n10\n\nThis review is required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act. See the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council’s Joint Report to Congress on Economic Growth and Regulatory\nPaperwork Reduction Act, March 2017 for additional details\n(https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf).\n\n\f11\nThe agencies are also working to develop a simplified capital framework for community bank\norganizations. 11 For large banks, the combination of risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio\nrequirement as a back stop, liquidity requirements, and annual stress testing is appropriate. But one has to\nask whether the compliance costs faced by small community banks in adhering to a complicated riskbased capital regime outweigh the benefits in terms of safety, soundness, and financial system resiliency,\ncompared to an alternative regime comprising a leverage ratio requirement based on high-quality capital,\ncombined perhaps with a simplified risk-weighted capital requirement.\n\nThe guiding principle of aligning the degree of prudential oversight with risk applies not only to\ncommunity banks but also to larger banks. Dodd-Frank requires that banks with assets between $10\nbillion and $50 billion be subject to company-run stress tests and that banks with assets of $50 billion or\nmore be subject to annual supervisor-administered stress tests, capital planning, living will, and other\nenhanced prudential requirements. I support some increase in the thresholds but also believe that the\ncombination of these requirements at systemically important banks has led to a stronger and more\nresilient financial system and should be maintained. 12\n\nSome of the amendments I’ve mentioned would require legislation; others would require coordinated\naction across the bank regulatory agencies. But the Fed is also working to improve its own supervisory\nprocesses to make them better aligned with risk and more efficient so that speedier decisions can be made.\nSince 2014, the Fed has used a risk-focused consumer compliance examination framework for community\n\n11\n\nSee a summary of some of the steps being considered in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s\nJoint Report to Congress on Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, March 2017\n(https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/2017_FFIEC_EGRPRA_Joint-Report_to_Congress.pdf).\n\n12\n\nThe Fed has already exempted nonsystemic banks with less than $250 billion in assets and less than $75 billion in\nnonbank activities from the qualitative, capital planning part of the stress-testing process. See “Federal Reserve\nBoard Announces Finalized Stress Testing Rules Removing Noncomplex Firms from Qualitative Aspect of CCAR\nEffective for 2017,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System press release, January 30, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170130a.htm).\n\n\f12\nbanks that helps examiners focus their attention on more serious compliance issues. 13 While this has been\nhelpful, I have heard from several community bankers that it is still taking too long to close compliance\nexamination findings. In looking at the timelines, even though some of the cases are complex, I have to\nagree that we can and should do a better job of reaching decisions in a reasonable period of time.\nClarifying supervisors’ expectations with respect to consumer compliance and community development\nrules would also be a good step.\n\nThe Fed is also undertaking a comprehensive review of its safety and soundness examination framework\nfor community banks, and developing analytical tools so that we can better focus our supervisory efforts\non the highest risks while reducing the regulatory burden on low-risk community banks.\n\nI hope this brief review illustrates that the Federal Reserve is committed to following the guiding\nprinciple of aligning regulatory and supervisory oversight with the level of potential risk. This will allow\nus to reduce undue regulatory burden without compromising the health and resiliency of the financial\nsystem, an approach that will benefit banks of all sizes and the overall economy.\n\nConclusion\nThe financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession took a toll on all of us. Now, the economy and financial\nsystem have returned to health, and the goal is to keep both of them there. Monetary policymakers need\nto set policy appropriately to ensure that the expansion continues and our policy goals of maximum\n\n13\n\nJeffrey Drum, “Risk-Focused Consumer Compliance Supervision Program for Community Banks,” Consumer\nCompliance Outlook, Second Quarter 2014 (https://consumercomplianceoutlook.org/2014/second-quarter/riskfocused-consumer-compliance-supervision-program-for-community-banks/), and “Community Bank Risk-Focused\nConsumer Compliance Supervision Program,” June 2014 Update to the Consumer Compliance Handbook, Federal\nReserve Board of Governors Division of Consumer and Community Affairs\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SupManual/cch/announce/201406cch_update.htm).\n\n\f13\nemployment and 2 percent inflation are met and sustained. In my view, that means continuing on the path\nof gradually normalizing interest rates and the balance sheet. With respect to financial regulation and\nsupervision, it means ensuring that the financial system remains resilient, with an appropriate focus on\nlimiting systemic risk and the costs such risks impose on the economy when they are realized, helping to\nensure that banks remain sound and able to extend financial services to their communities through the ups\nand downs of the business cycle, and avoiding regulations that impose burdens but do not further these\ngoals. Getting the right balance entails a tiered approach to banking supervision and regulation. This\ntiered approach recognizes that the risk a banking organization poses to the financial system is likely to\nvary according to its size, range of activities, and complexity, and so supervision and regulation should\nvary along these dimensions as well. The rules and oversight that apply to community banks should not\nbe the same as those that apply to systemically important institutions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been taking steps to right-size its oversight of banking institutions consistent\nwith the risks they pose to the financial system because a sound financial system conveys benefits on\nhouseholds and businesses. Bankers have also taken important steps to better monitor their risks so that\nthey can better deliver services to their customers.\n\nAt the end of the day, the public will be the judge of whether we have successfully met the challenges.\nAccording to the Financial Trust Index, published by the business schools at the University of Chicago\nand Northwestern University, there is still a ways to go. 14 While there has been some improvement since\n2008, still only about 27 percent of those polled for the index said they trusted their financial institutions,\nbroadly defined to include banks, the stock market, mutual funds, and large corporations. Lest I leave\nyou on that disappointing note, I want to mention that the survey results differ significantly by type of\n\n14\n\nThe Financial Trust Index is based on an annual survey of a representative sample of about 1,000 American\nhouseholds. For further information, see the website: http://www.financialtrustindex.org/index.htm.\n\n\f14\ninstitution. Nearly 60 percent of the people polled said they trusted their local bank. 15 This is an\nencouraging sign that by focusing on safety, soundness, resiliency, and customer service, we can create a\nfinancial system that the public views as beneficial, and one that truly is.\n\n15\n\nThe 2015 results by bank category are available on the Financial Trust Index website at\nhttp://www.financialtrustindex.org/resultswave24.htm. I thank Professor Luigi Zingales at the University of\nChicago for providing the updated results for 2016. In the 2016 survey, while 38 percent of respondents reported\ntrusting their banks, 57 percent indicated that they trust their local bank.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n2017 Policy Summit on Housing, Human Capital, and Inequality:\nTransforming Regional Economies: Growth and Equity through Policy and Practice\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis\nCleveland, OH\nJune 23, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me take this opportunity to offer my thanks to all of you for actively participating in this year’s Policy\nSummit, and to Mary Helen Petrus and Bonnie Blankenship of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\nTheresa Singleton of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and Michael Grover of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Minneapolis for taking the lead in creating this year’s program.\n\nOver the past 14 years, the Policy Summit has brought together community development practitioners,\nresearchers, funders, policymakers, and others interested in strengthening our communities so that all\npeople have the opportunity to productively engage in our economy and to share in its benefits. As is\nclear from the many conversations we’ve had over the past two days – and over the past 14 years of this\nsummit – there are no easy answers. But there are some answers, and I have confidence that your\ndedication, expertise, and collaboration will result in effective solutions being implemented more widely\nand even better solutions being devised. I hope that the discussions over the past two days have inspired\nyou to continue the important work you are doing.\n\nToday, I want to talk about the Federal Reserve’s role in the community development arena. I will touch\non “the why, the how, and the what” of this work: why we at the Fed see our community development\nefforts as important to our mission of fostering a healthy economy, how we go about doing this work, and\nsome of what we are focusing on. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Structure of the Fed\nTo begin, it helps to know a little bit about the structure of the Federal Reserve System. To say that the\nFed is an “interesting” institution is an understatement. I’ve spent my career at the Fed, and I am still\nlearning arcane things about the Fed’s structure and history. The Federal Reserve System was established\nby an act of Congress that was signed into law in 1913. We like to say that the Federal Reserve is a\n\n\f2\ndecentralized central bank, which is independent within the government but not independent from the\ngovernment. The structure is one of balance. Congress designed the Fed to alleviate concerns that it\nwould become dominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington or by\nany particular individual group. The design includes representation from the entire nation, balancing\npublic-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks that are distributed across the country and a\nseven-member Board of Governors in Washington that oversees those Banks. The governors, who serve\nthe public, are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The Reserve\nBanks also operate in the public interest. Each has a nine-member board of directors whose members are\nchosen in a nonpolitical process to represent business, agricultural, industrial, bank, and public interests in\nthe Districts they serve. The nonbank directors are responsible for choosing the Bank’s president, who is\nsubject to approval by the Fed’s Board of Governors. Some of the Reserve Banks also have Branches\nwith boards, and each Reserve Bank has a number of advisory councils drawing membership from\nvarious sectors and geographies in their Districts.\n\nThis regional and balanced structure has served the country well for more than 100 years. The U.S. is\nvery diverse, encompassing large cities, small towns, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries\nand occupations. The Fed’s structure allows decisions on monetary policy, financial system regulation\nand supervision, and payments to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people.\nWe recognize that our policy decisions affect Main Streets and communities all across the country.\n\nAs a participant at Federal Open Market Committee meetings, I can attest to the fact that the members of\nthe Board of Governors and Reserve Bank presidents do bring different perspectives to the table. My\nown perspectives are informed not only by economic and financial data and models but also by the\ninformation gleaned from a diverse set of business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the Fourth\n\n\f3\nDistrict, which includes the state of Ohio, the western part of Pennsylvania, the eastern part of Kentucky,\nand the northern panhandle of West Virginia. By design, the discussions at our meetings contain a\nmosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. The FOMC does not suffer\nfrom group think. We come together, share our different perspectives, and work to develop a consensus\nto set national monetary policy in pursuit of our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment, goals that Congress gave us.\n\nCongress has also given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions. Neither Congress\nnor the U.S. president has to approve monetary policy decisions, so the decisions are insulated from shortrun political considerations. At the same time, the Fed is held accountable for its decisions when it\nregularly communicates the rationale for its policy decisions in testimony before Congress, and in policy\nstatements, meeting minutes, reports, and speeches. This system of accountable independence has been\nshown to yield better policy decisions and better economic outcomes for the country. The regional,\nprivate-public structure of the Federal Reserve System helps to reinforce this system of independence and\naccountability by ensuring that diverse information from all sectors of the economy and all parts of the\ncountry is brought into monetary policy discussions, with the policymakers themselves distributed across\nthe nation and not concentrated in one location.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The Why\nIn addition to aiding monetary policymaking, the Fed’s structure allows us to perform our other functions\nmore effectively, too. Of course, one of those is near and dear to everyone in this room: the Federal\nReserve System’s role in identifying effective community development policies and best practices for\npromoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe origin of the Fed’s community development work lies with the passage of the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA) in 1977. At the time, many people thought that limited access to credit and\n\n\f4\nillegal practices such as redlining contributed to the deterioration in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods throughout the U.S. The CRA was meant to help ensure equitable access to credit for all\nindividuals and neighborhoods by reaffirming that insured depository institutions must serve the\ncommunities in which they are chartered to do business. 1 In 1981, the Board of Governors asked each\nReserve Bank to appoint a Community Affairs Officer, and from there, the Fed built a function to provide\ntechnical training and support to depository institutions to help bolster compliance with the CRA.\n\nOver time, the Fed’s interest and activities in community development have grown. Partly this reflects\nthe desire to promote consistent implementation of the CRA across the nation, recognizing that, to do this,\nwe need a good understanding of all of the interrelated challenges facing lower-income communities. But\nanother motivation is the fact that our community development activities at the local level, facilitated by\nthe Fed’s regional structure, have allowed us to gain valuable reconnaissance on the economic health of\npeople and communities across our Districts. Even if the Federal Reserve, along with other federal\nregulators, were not charged with implementing the CRA, our community development activities would\nremain an important component of the Fed’s work because they help us monitor the health of the\neconomy across various segments of the population and geographies, which is an important component of\nsetting appropriate monetary policy.\n\nThe financial crisis and ensuing recession provide a vivid illustration of this interconnectedness and the\nimportance of local engagement. As the housing market slowed and the number of subprime mortgage\ndelinquencies and foreclosures began to rise, the Federal Reserve began monitoring these developments\nmore intensively. No doubt, at the beginning, we underestimated the negative effects that problems\ninitially centered in the subprime mortgage market would ultimately have on the broader economy.\n\n1\n\nFor more on the historical context of the CRA, see Sandra F. Braunstein, “The Community Reinvestment Act,”\ntestimony before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, February 13, 2008.\n\n\f5\nHowever, members of the Fed’s community development staff were already engaged with industry and\nconsumer advocates who were focused on helping troubled borrowers. These staff members were able to\nprovide first-hand knowledge and objective information to Fed policymakers, raising their awareness that\nthe problems were not insignificant. Fed staff with expertise in mortgage markets and housing in the\ncommunity development, economic research, and bank supervision functions were mobilized. Our\nregular contact with local organizations across the country indicated that a lack of data on delinquencies\nand foreclosures was impeding progress. So Federal Reserve staffs across the country began collecting\ndata; they analyzed delinquency and foreclosure trends and helped to evaluate policies and programs\naimed at aiding troubled borrowers and addressing the growing problem of foreclosures. Ohio had one of\nthe highest foreclosure rates in the country, coupled with high numbers of vacant and abandoned\nproperties, so the Cleveland Fed was particularly active in this analysis, working with government\nagencies, financial institutions, and community-based organizations – perhaps with many of you in this\nroom. 2\n\nWhile our community development work gives us insights into the economic health of communities,\nwhich helps inform our monetary policy, monetary policy is not the right tool to address the many\nchallenges facing lower-income households and neighborhoods. What monetary policy can do is promote\ngreater economic stability overall by focusing on price stability and maximum employment, and thereby\nlower the risk of recessions, which disproportionately harm the more vulnerable parts of our society. But\nan interconnected set of factors determines the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods,\nincluding access to credit, capital, and financial services, affordable housing, workforce development, job\ntraining and education, health and wellness services, and infrastructure, including transportation and\nbroadband services. While monetary policy cannot address issues such as income inequality, the longer-\n\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s 2008 annual report essay, “Breaking the Housing Crisis Cycle,” focused on the magnitude of\nthe housing crisis in the region and the nation and discussed potential policy responses.\n\n\f6\nrun issues of workforce development, or the distributional effects of globalization and technological\nchange, other government policies and private-public programs, if they are well-designed, can. This is\nwhere the Federal Reserve’s community development work comes in.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The How\nThe Fed is not the entity that can set these policies or implement these programs, but the Fed is\ncommitted to increasing knowledge about the economic challenges facing low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds and communities and helping to identify effective policies and best practices to address these\nchallenges. I believe the structure of the Federal Reserve System gives us some advantages in doing this\nwork. In particular, our regional structure insulates us from political influence, so we are viewed as a\ntrusted and objective party. We hold that public trust very dearly, and always strive to maintain our\ncredibility. That is why we aim to conduct our research with the utmost rigor and the highest quality\nstandards, looking objectively at all sides of an issue and potential solutions. Our reputation for\nobjectivity helps us play an important role as a “convener” and, I would add, as a “catalyst.” We all know\nthat the issues facing lower-income regions in a dynamic economy such as ours are complex ones. Many\nof the solutions will be complex as well. At the very least, they will take committed and collaborative\nactions from various stakeholders, and probably some compromises, too.\n\nThe Fed plays a useful role here by convening forums and workshops with the groups needed to effect\nchange. Such forums foster a common understanding of the magnitude and breadth of the issues, allow\nbest practices to be shared, spur quicker dissemination of insights, and can catalyze action that ultimately\nleads to more effective economic policies and programs. The Fed values the relationships we have built\nwith key organizations working to improve the economic outcomes of people in communities across the\ncountry. I have had the privilege of meeting with many dedicated community development practitioners\nand engaging with people who live and work in lower-income areas in our region. I have seen first-hand\nthat the information my Fed colleagues and I glean from such interactions has informed our research and\n\n\f7\nhas helped us learn about the promising programs many of you lead throughout the country. For\nexample, the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Reserve Banks’ project to identify “opportunity\noccupations,” those occupations that pay higher than the median wage but don’t require a bachelor’s\ndegree, grew out of our hearing repeatedly from various parties of the need for these types of jobs. 3 We\nhave also seen that practitioners and policymakers have used Federal Reserve research, so there are\nimportant synergies to be gained by actionable research coupled with convening meetings and workshops.\n\nJust as getting all stakeholders together can help yield more effective solutions, the Federal Reserve\nSystem recognizes that Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors can achieve more by working together\non community development issues without sacrificing the focus each Reserve Bank has on particular\nissues affecting its individual District. The System-wide approach allows us to deploy resources more\nefficiently, to develop more in-depth expertise that can be shared, to identify those issues that loom large\nin many parts of the country, and to track emerging economic developments in a way that we couldn’t if\nwe weren’t regionally distributed and didn’t work together.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The What\nI would like to spend the remainder of my time discussing some of the Fed’s community development\nwork. As I mentioned earlier, many factors influence the economic vitality of households and\nneighborhoods, including access to credit and capital workforce development, affordable housing,\ninfrastructure, and health services. There is ongoing research and engagement across the Federal Reserve\nSystem in each of these topic areas – far too much work to summarize in my remaining time. One focus\nhas been on areas of concentrated poverty, which exist in both urban and rural settings. The Minneapolis\nFed’s Center for Indian Country Development; the Dallas Fed’s Colonias project on neighborhoods along\n\n3\n\n“Identifying Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies,” Federal Reserve Banks of\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta, September 2015.\n\n\f8\nthe U.S.-Mexico border; the St. Louis Fed’s Delta Communities Initiative, which is working with\ndistressed communities across the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta regions; the efforts of the Atlanta,\nCleveland, and Richmond Feds in Appalachia; and the joint efforts among several Reserve Banks in the\nindustrial heartland and older cities have pointed to some key issues affecting the economic vitality of the\npeople and communities in these areas. Workforce development is one of those issues that span regions,\nand so considerable efforts are underway across the Federal Reserve System and with our community\npartners to find solutions to ensure that people have access to the education and skill-development\nprograms needed to ensure that they can be productive members of the modern workforce. 4 Our activities\nfocused on workforce development have improved our understanding of the labor market outcomes of\ndifferent groups and communities and of labor markets more broadly; this work has obvious spillovers to\nthe Fed’s need to understand labor market conditions when setting monetary policy.\n\nOf course, to make progress on any of the issues facing distressed communities you need to be able to\nmeasure the scale of the problems. In addition, you need to ensure that those with funds and an interest in\neffecting solutions are brought together with those with effective programs in need of financing. Let me\ndiscuss some of the contributions the Fed is making in these two areas.\n\nProviding data and data tools\nAs was clear during the foreclosure crisis, inadequate data can be a sizable impediment to understanding\nchallenges and finding solutions. So the Fed’s community development function is providing data and\nanalytical tools to the public. These disaggregated data help us understand emerging issues that can be\nmasked by looking only at aggregate statistics. The Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey is a good\n4\n\nFor a description of some of the community development efforts underway in the Federal Reserve System, see\nJanet L. Yellen, “Addressing Workforce Development Challenges in Low-Income Communities,” remarks at\nCreating a Just Economy, the 2017 annual conference of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition,\nWashington, D.C., March 28, 2017, and Lael Brainard, “Why Opportunity and Inclusion Matter to America’s\nEconomic Strength,” remarks at the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute Conference, sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN, May 22, 2017.\n\n\f9\nexample. 5 This survey started as individual surveys conducted by a few Reserve Banks, but under the\nNew York Fed’s leadership, it became a common national survey in 2016, with more than 15,000 small\nbusiness respondents. This survey could not have been carried out without the 400 organizations,\nincluding chambers of commerce and economic development agencies, that partnered with the Fed to\ngather responses. The results allow us to track access to credit from several individual segments of the\nsmall business population, including minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, startups,\nmicroenterprises, and the self-employed.\n\nAnother example of data gathering is the Board of Governors’ Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking, which has been conducted since 2013 and provides data to help track the economic\nwell-being of households. 6 The survey contains information on access to credit, retirement savings,\nstudent loans, and other evidence on how households are faring financially.\n\nA third example is the data provided by the Dallas Fed and Cleveland Fed on broadband access.\nBroadband internet access has become a necessity in our connected world, allowing for higher income\ngrowth rates and lower unemployment rates in areas with higher adoption rates. 7 But both access and\nadoption rates vary with household income levels, with a considerably smaller proportion of lower-\n\n5\n\nFor the 2016 results and further information on the survey, see the Federal Reserve Small Business Credit Survey.\n\n6\n\nFor further information about the survey and the 2016 results, see the Board of Governors’ Survey of Household\nEconomics and Decisionmaking.\n7\n\nA recent report issued by Cornell University found that nonmetropolitan counties that have had a high rate of\nbroadband adoption have also experienced higher growth in median household income and lower rates of job loss\nthan similarly situated counties that have had low broadband adoption. (See Brian Whitacre, Roberto Gallardo, and\nSharon Strover, “Broadband’s Contribution to Economic Health in Rural Areas,” Issue Number 64, Research and\nPolicy Brief Series, Community and Regional Development Institute, Department of Development Sociology,\nCornell University, February 2015.)\n\n\f10\nincome households using broadband at home compared to higher-income households. 8 There is also wide\ndisparity in broadband access, especially access to higher-speed broadband, between rural and urban\nareas, putting the growth prospects of rural areas at a disadvantage. Recent revisions to the CRA rules\nrecognize that a reliable communications infrastructure, such as broadband internet service, can help to\nrevitalize or stabilize underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income areas. So depository institutions now\nreceive credit for investing in this infrastructure for the purposes of meeting the CRA requirement of\nserving the needs of low- and moderate-income communities. 9 The Dallas Fed produced a\ncomprehensive guide for financial institutions to help them understand how broadband can benefit the\ncommunities they serve and how their planned investments could qualify for CRA credit. The guide\nincludes several tables and maps, based on U.S. Census bureau data, measuring broadband access at the\nnational level and in the Dallas Fed’s District. 10 The Cleveland Fed has provided similar data from the\nFederal Communications Commission for the Fourth District. 11\n\nIn addition to data, the Federal Reserve is providing tools to help the public use the data. Let me mention\nthree of these. Last month, the Philadelphia and Cleveland Feds released the Home Mortgage Explorer\ntool. 12 Based on Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, this tool allows users to track trends in mortgage\nlending at the national, state, metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan levels, by purpose and type of loan.\n\n8\n\nA 2013 federal government report indicated that fewer than half of households with incomes below $25,000 a year\nuse broadband at home, compared with over 90 percent of households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000.\n(See “Four Years of Broadband Growth,” Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Economic\nCouncil, The White House, Washington, D.C., June 2013.)\n9\n\nSee page 48510 of the Federal Register notice, “Community Reinvestment Act; Interagency Questions and\nAnswers Regarding Community Reinvestment; Guidance,” Federal Register, vol. 81, no. 142, Monday, July 25,\n2016, Rules and Regulations.\n10\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, “Closing the Digital Divide: A Framework for Meeting CRA Obligations,”\nJuly 2016, Revised December 2016.\n11\n\nSee Shruthi Arvind and Kyle Fee, “Broadband and High-speed Internet Access in the Fourth District,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, December 8, 2016.\n12\n\nFor further information, see the Home Mortgage Explorer.\n\n\f11\nInformation is provided on the reasons a loan application was denied and on applicant and neighborhood\nincome.\n\nRecently, the Chicago Fed launched the Peer City Identification Tool. This tool allows a user to easily\ndetermine which cities, among the 300 included in the data set, are experiencing similar trends or\nchallenges along four key themes: racial and socioeconomic composition; economic change and labor\nmarket conditions; demographic and economic outlook; and housing affordability, tenure, and housingstock age. 13 The themes were determined based on areas of concern cited by city leaders in more than\n200 interviews across 10 cities. Users of the tool can determine which cities among the 300 are\nconsidered peers with respect to the particular theme, and the values of the theme’s indicators for each of\nthe peer cities. The underlying data on the 28 indicators for all 300 cities are downloadable so people can\nuse the data in other analyses as well.\n\nA third data tool, Following the Money, was created by the Atlanta and Philadelphia Feds, based on data\nfrom the Foundation Center. 14 Foundation grants are becoming a more important source of funding for\ncommunity development, and this tool allows the user to see the distribution of foundation grants across\n366 metropolitan areas across the U.S., or for a user-defined selection from among these metro areas.\nData on the grant volume per capita, on the types of activities the grants are funding, and on the number\nof community and economic development nonprofits in the metro areas are provided.\n\n13\n\nThe 300 cities included in the tool’s data set are those that had a population of at least 50,000 in 1960. City peer\ngroups are determined using cluster analysis based on a set of indicators for each theme. For example, according to\nthe tool, Trenton, New Jersey, and East St. Louis, Illinois, among other cities, are housing peers of Cleveland. The\nthree cities are similar in that a large share of their housing stock was built pre-1980, and they share similar vacancy\nrates, home value to income ratios, homeownership rates, and share of renter households that spend more than 30\npercent of their gross monthly income on rent each month. For further information on the tool and its construction,\nsee the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s Peer City Identification Tool.\n14\n\nFor more information on this tool, see Following the Money.\n\n\f12\nImproving access to funding\nAs the Following the Money tool reminds us, once potential solutions for challenges affecting lowerincome communities are found, those solutions need to secure funding. While the Federal Reserve cannot\nmake those investments, the Fed’s community development function has been working to improve access\nto credit and capital by helping to match funders to those programs and projects that research has shown\nto be effective in helping low- and moderate-income households and communities. The Dallas Fed’s\nwork on broadband and the CRA fits this theme by giving banks guidance in determining which\nbroadband projects are CRA-eligible.\n\nAnother very good example is the Boston Fed’s Working Cities Challenge, which began in 2013. 15\nBoston Fed research on small and mid-sized cities that lost manufacturing employment found that\n“resurgent cities,” meaning those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree\nof leadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private\ncitizens, corporations, and government. 16 Informed by this research and designed in partnership with the\nBoston Fed’s network of community development stakeholders, the Working Cities Challenge is a grant\ncompetition aimed at strengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help low-income areas.\nEligible cities can make one proposal for an idea or program that will unite the public, private, and\nnonprofit sectors, and community members in improving the lives of low- and moderate-income people in\nan enduring way. There are four rounds underway – two in Massachusetts, one in Rhode Island, and one\nin Connecticut – with $10 million in funding to be awarded. In a related effort, the San Francisco Fed is\nnow engaged with the Strong, Prosperous, and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC), which is\nmodeled on the Working Cities Challenge.\n\n15\n16\n\nFurther information on the Boston Fed’s Working Cities Challenge is available on its website.\n\n“Reinvigorating Springfield’s Economy: Lessons from Resurgent Cities,” Public Policy Discussion Paper No. 096, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 1, 2009.\n\n\f13\nMy last example of a successful Federal Reserve effort enabling better access to funding is the Kansas\nCity Fed’s Investment Connection program. 17 In their discussions with the Kansas City Fed, banks had\nindicated they were having trouble identifying CRA-eligible investment opportunities in their service\nareas, and community leaders were saying they were having trouble getting funding. Seeing a potential\nopportunity to improve the situation, the Kansas City Fed created the Investment Connection program.\nUnder the program, community and economic development organizations in the District can have project\nproposals pre-screened by Kansas City Fed staffers to determine whether they are CRA-eligible, and then\nget a chance to pitch their proposals to potential funders, including banks and foundations. So far, the\nKansas City Fed has facilitated connections between nearly 60 community organizations and almost 100\nfunders. Given the regional structure of the Federal Reserve System, a successful program like this one\ncan now potentially be expanded into other regions.\n\nConclusion\nI hope that this review of “the why, the how, and the what” of the Federal Reserve System’s community\ndevelopment efforts has been helpful. I have the privilege of chairing the committee that oversees the\ncommunity development efforts at the Federal Reserve Banks. I can assure you that the professionals in\nthe community development function at the Fed are dedicated to this work and realize that little could be\naccomplished without the productive relationships and partnerships they have with the many groups\nrepresented in this room, including government agencies, financial institutions, foundations, academia,\nresearch centers, and community-based organizations. Going forward, the Fed will continue to leverage\nthe benefits from its regional structure. This structure allows the Reserve Banks and the Board of\nGovernors to uncover common issues and find solutions for the challenges facing low- and moderateincome communities and individuals across the country while allowing each Reserve Bank to remain\n\n17\n\nFurther information on the Kansas City Fed’s Investment Connection program is available on its website.\n\n\f14\nfocused on the particular needs in its specific region. We look forward to our continued collaboration\nwith you to make the economy work well for all.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nEconomic Club of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, MN\nMay 18, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Economic Club of Minnesota for the opportunity to speak today. In looking at your website, I\nnoticed a long list of distinguished speakers, including many from the Federal Reserve and other central\nbanks around the world. I also discovered that John Surma, former chairman and CEO of U.S. Steel and\ncurrent chair of the Cleveland Fed’s Board of Directors, has addressed your group. And with my current\ncolleague Neel Kashkari and former colleague, friend, and fellow opera lover Chris Cumming here, I feel\na connection and I am honored to participate. Today, I will discuss my current outlook for the economy\nand my views on monetary policy. I will also talk about some longer-run issues facing the economy. Of\ncourse, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion will celebrate its eighth birthday next month – that’s 56 in dog years – which is\nlong by historical standards. Of course, expansions don’t die from old age and there is no reason to think\nthat this one cannot continue. In fact, one of my focuses as a monetary policymaker is to set policy to\nmeet and maintain our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. Doing so will\nhelp promote continued expansion.\n\nThe expansion got off to a slow start from a very weak place in the aftermath of the Great Recession. But\nthe fact that the expansion has endured through a variety of economic shocks is a testament to the U.S.\neconomy’s resiliency. First quarter readings on real activity were soft, but it is not unusual to see\nvariability in the monthly and even the quarterly data. To get a reading on where the economy is headed,\nit is important to smooth through the volatility and focus on underlying fundamentals. I believe the\nfundamentals supporting continued expansion are sound. These fundamentals include accommodative\nmonetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets, and increases in personal\n\n\f2\nincome that have come from the continued strength in labor markets. In addition, although geopolitical\nrisks remain, economic conditions in our global trading partners have improved.\n\nOf course, we always need to view things with humility: economics is not an exact science, nothing is\ncertain, and there are upside and downside risks to my forecast. With that in mind, my modal outlook is\nthat over the next year, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longer-run trend,\nwhich I estimate to be about 2 percent, and the unemployment rate will remain below its longer-run level,\nwhich I estimate to be about 5 percent. With appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the\nconditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation. Let me expand a bit on growth, employment, and inflation, before turning to monetary policy.\n\nEconomic growth\nDespite the strong fundamentals, output growth in the first quarter was weak. I am not taking much of a\nsignal about future growth from that reading. Some of the weakness reflects transitory factors like\nreduced spending on energy because of unseasonably warm weather early in the year. There is also likely\nwhat economists call residual seasonality in the data, meaning that even though the data are adjusted for\nseasonal effects, we’ve seen a pattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter\nfollowed by stronger growth in subsequent quarters.1 I anticipate we’ll see stronger consumer spending,\nwhich makes up about two-thirds of output, over the rest of the year. Readings on consumer sentiment\nand confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing. Moreover,\nhousehold balance sheets have improved over time. As a result of the Great Recession, households in the\naggregate lost $13 trillion in net worth, made up of financial and housing equity. The deleveraging that\nhouseholds undertook and their increased savings, coupled with the cumulative increase in stock and\n1\n\nSee Kurt G. Lunsford, “Lingering Residual Seasonality in GDP Growth,” Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, Number 2017-06, March 28, 2017, and Glenn D. Rudebusch, Daniel Wilson, and Tim Mahedy,\n“The Puzzle of Weak First-Quarter GDP Growth,” Economic Letter, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 201516, May 18, 2015.\n\n\f3\nhouse prices over the expansion, mean that households as a group have recovered that loss and have\nadded another $25 trillion in net worth to their balance sheets. In the aggregate, households’ housing\nequity is now back to what it was at the peak, as the housing sector continues to gradually improve.\n\nDemand for housing is rising and is outpacing supply in some places. This mismatch between supply and\ndemand is putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at about a 6 percent pace, on\naverage, nationally, and are driving the increase in homeowners’ housing equity. It shouldn’t be too\nsurprising that the housing recovery has been a moderate one. The housing boom and crash are not\nsomething anyone wants repeated. Households have been careful not to take on more mortgage debt than\nthey can handle, and lenders are extending credit, but to those with good credit quality. Overall, I expect\nactivity in the sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nBusiness activity and investment are starting to strengthen after being quite subdued last year and through\nmuch of the expansion. Part of the weakness reflected the sizable drop in oil prices from mid-2014\nthrough early 2016, which led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers.\nAt the same time, the 20 percent appreciation of the dollar hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent\non exports. Since then, conditions supporting business spending have improved. Over the past year, oil\nprices have been roughly stable near $50 a barrel and the dollar has appreciated only modestly. In\naddition, the firming in global economic growth has increased demand for U.S. exports. We’ve seen a\npickup in the mining sector and in manufacturing, and the data on new orders suggest investment in\nequipment will expand further. Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District tell us that even if some of the\nproposals for tax reform, health insurance, infrastructure spending, and regulatory changes are delayed,\nthey expect the business environment to remain positive and that this will translate into further increases\nin business spending and hiring.\n\n\f4\nLabor markets\nIn fact, labor markets have been strengthening for some time and I expect that to continue. In 2016, the\neconomy added over 2.2 million jobs, an average of about 187,000 jobs per month. Over the first four\nmonths of this year, firms sustained that pace, with an average monthly gain of 185,000 jobs. This is a\nslower pace than in the two expansions in the 1980s and 1990s.2 But it’s important to remember that\nbecause trend labor force participation is lower, trend employment growth is also lower. Indeed,\nestimates of trend employment growth range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on the\nprecise assumptions one makes about the participation rate. So the recent employment growth numbers\nare well above trend.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has moved down. It stood at 4.4 percent in April,\nless than half its peak of 10 percent in late 2009 and at the lowest reading achieved in the previous\nexpansion. Given the progress that has been made in the labor market, payroll job growth is likely to\nslow from its current pace, but I expect it will be sufficient to keep the unemployment rate below my\nestimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nOther gauges of the under-utilization of labor have also improved significantly. For example, the broader\nU6 measure of unemployment, which includes the number of part-time workers who would rather work\nfull time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, has fallen to 8.6\npercent, its lowest level since late 2007. The labor force participation rate has been essentially stable for\nthe past three years. This is another sign of labor market strength because, based on demographics, the\ntrend in the participation rate is downward.\n\n2\n\nPayroll job gains averaged nearly 230,000 per month over the December 1982-July 1990 expansion and about\n200,000 per month over the April 1991-March 2001 expansion.\n\n\f5\nThe strengthening in the labor market has led to a gradual acceleration in wages from earlier in the\nrecovery. For some time we have heard from our labor and business contacts across a broad set of\nindustries that firms are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skill occupations and in\nlower-skill jobs. More and more of these firms report they are responding by raising wages and offering\nother benefits to attract and retain workers. Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District expect wage increases\nto average about 3 percent this year, with significantly higher increases expected for highly skilled\nworkers.\n\nOn balance, there has been a sustained cyclical recovery in labor markets since the Great Recession.\nThere are some longer-run structural issues that the country must tackle, such as making sure people have\naccess to the training and development needed for the jobs in the modern economy. But from the\nstandpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address, I believe we have achieved the\nmaximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Consistent with meeting this part of the\nmandate over the longer run, the FOMC has set a goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the yearover-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Most\npeople understand why high inflation is a problem: it erodes the purchasing power of their money. But\ninflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead consumers and businesses to delay purchases,\nthereby slowing the economy, and it increases debt burdens.\n\nFor some time, inflation has been running below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, but over the past two years,\ninflation has been moving up. Measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation stood at 1.8 percent in\nMarch, up from under 1 percent a year ago.\n\n\f6\nI expect there will be some variability in the monthly data, but in determining where inflation is relative\nto our goal, we need to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both those below and those\nabove our goal, and focus on where inflation is headed and where it will be maintained on a sustained\nbasis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, but we know\nthat we can’t keep actual inflation at 2 percent at each point in time; inevitably shocks hit the economy\nand the inflation numbers move, sometimes below our goal and sometimes above. Still, we want to take\nactions to keep inflation from running either persistently below or persistently above 2 percent. In other\nwords, our goal is symmetric – it isn’t a ceiling – and we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on a\nsustainable basis.\n\nWith appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained\nreturn over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. These conditions include the\nfirming in inflation that we’ve seen over time, reasonably stable inflation expectations, continued strength\nin the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nMonetary Policy\nWhen I say “appropriate adjustments in monetary policy” I mean those that will sustain the expansion so\nthat our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. As I\nmentioned, in my view, we have met the maximum employment part of our mandate and inflation is\nnearing our 2 percent goal.\n\nIf economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in\nthe federal funds rate will be needed. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate\nby one-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent, and two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to maintain\nthis range. Both decisions are consistent with the gradual upward path of interest rates that the\nCommittee has indicated for some time is likely to be appropriate. This upward policy path will help\n\n\f7\nprolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that\ncould arise if the economy is allowed to overheat. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to financial\nstability should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a\nsearch for yield. It will put monetary policy in a better position to address whichever risks, whether to the\nupside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nGiven my outlook, I don’t believe that removing accommodation calls for an increase in the fed funds rate\nat each meeting, but I do anticipate more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past two years. In\naddition, as we continue to make progress on our goals, I think that it’s important for the FOMC to\nremain very vigilant against falling behind, especially given the low level of interest rates and the large\nsize of our balance sheet. We know that monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable\nlags, so policy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. If we delay taking further\nnormalization steps for too long and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor market becomes\nunsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up steeply, we could\nrisk a recession. This is a bad outcome that disproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our\nsociety.\n\nIn addition to removing accommodation by raising interest rates, we also have to consider the Fed’s\nbalance sheet. To address the financial crisis and Great Recession, the FOMC undertook several\nprograms to purchase longer-maturity assets. These purchases aimed at putting downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates once the FOMC’s traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to\neffectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet has grown from nearly $900 billion\nin assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from mainly short-term\nTreasury securities to agency mortgage-backed securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\n\f8\nCurrently, the FOMC is continuing to reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and principal\npayments from agency securities, essentially maintaining the balance sheet at its very large size. But\nnormalizing the stance of policy also means taking steps to normalize the balance sheet. As indicated in\nthe minutes of our March meeting, the FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, including when and\nhow best to implement a change in reinvestments.3 Such a change should be done in a way that allows\nfor a gradual and predictable reduction in the Fed’s asset holdings so that over time the balance sheet is\nreduced to the smallest size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.4\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our\nreinvestment policy this year, with clear communication in advance about how we plan to implement the\nchange. My preference is that once we decide on a plan, we stay with it; the fed funds rate should be our\nmain tool for responding to changes in the outlook during normal times, with purchases of\nlonger-term assets reserved for nontraditional times, times when we have lowered our policy rate to near\nzero and we need to add more monetary policy stimulus because of a deterioration in economic and\nfinancial conditions. Ending reinvestments and beginning the journey toward a smaller balance sheet\ncomposed mainly of Treasury securities will be a welcome acknowledgment that the economy has entered\nnormal times and policy is transitioning back to normal, too.\n\nIt’s important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and because of that,\nmonetary policy is not pre-set. In March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its\neconomic and policy path projections.5 These are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers\nthat there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in\n\n3\n\nThe Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017, pp. 2-3.\n\n4\n\nSee “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014.\n\n5\n\nSee the confidence band charts in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of the Minutes of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017.\n\n\f9\nhow it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook\nindeed materially change.\n\nLonger-Run Issues\nAstute listeners will have noticed that I didn’t tell you how large the balance sheet will be or how high the\nfed funds rate will be once we complete normalization. That is, I haven’t told you the end points. To\nanswer those questions, we need to consider some longer-run issues.\n\nMonetary policy implementation framework\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, we do know it will be larger than it was prior to the\nfinancial crisis for the simple reason that the public’s demand for currency is rising over time. But the\nbalance sheet will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much smaller depends on\nhow the FOMC implements monetary policy in the future.6 Before the crisis, the FOMC kept the supply\nof bank reserves scarce. Making small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries,\nallowed the FOMC to ensure that the market-clearing interest rate at which banks lend reserves to each\nother overnight, the fed funds rate, was maintained at the FOMC’s target.\n\nBut now, as a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks\nare holding around $2.3 trillion in reserves, and more than $2.1 trillion of this amount is in excess of what\nis required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the\nfed funds rate, and the FOMC brings the fed funds rate into its target range by adjusting the rate it pays on\nexcess reserves.\n\n6\n\nFor an accessible description of monetary policy implementation frameworks, see Jane E. Ihrig, Ellen E. Meade,\nand Gretchen C. Weinbach, “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach to\nRaising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198.\n\n\f10\nEach of these systems has its strengths, and the FOMC has not yet decided which framework it will use in\nthe long run and, therefore, what the size of the balance sheet will be at the end of the normalization\nprocess.7 However, because it will take several years to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset\nrun-off, the FOMC can end reinvestments before we have decided on the balance sheet’s ultimate size.\n\nEquilibrium fed funds rate\nIn terms of where the fed funds rate will be in the longer run, one needs to consider what policy rate is\nconsistent with maximum employment and stable inflation over the longer run. There is reason to believe\nthat this equilibrium rate is lower now than it used to be. In fact, FOMC participants have been lowering\ntheir estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate over time. For example, in March 2014, the median\nestimate was 4 percent. Now it is 3 percent. The equilibrium rate is determined by the long-run rate of\nthe growth of consumption and, therefore, of output. So where the fed funds rate will be after\nnormalization depends on the longer-run potential growth rate of the economy.\n\nPotential growth and productivity growth\nThe key determinants of the economy’s longer-run growth rate are structural productivity growth – how\neffectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output – and labor force growth.\nOver the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business\nsector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire expansion it has\naveraged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen over the prior two\nexpansions. Some of the slowdown in productivity growth likely reflects the difficulty in measuring\nproductivity in the service sector. Some of the slowdown is likely cyclical, reflecting persistent effects of\n\n7\n\nFor discussions of the pros and cons of different monetary policy implementation frameworks, see George A.\nKahn, “Monetary Policy Under a Corridor Operating Framework,” Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, Fourth Quarter 2010; Todd Keister, “Corridors and Floors in Monetary Policy,” Liberty Street\nEconomics, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, April 4, 2012; and Ben S. Bernanke, “Should the Fed Keep its\nBalance Sheet Large?” Brookings Institution Blog, September 2, 2016.\n\n\f11\nthe Great Recession, which has retarded investment spending. As the expansion continues and\ninvestment expands, it is reasonable to assume that the cyclical impediments will abate and we’ll see\nsomewhat stronger productivity growth. But structural factors are likely weighing on productivity\ngrowth, as well.\n\nOne such factor is a reduced level of economic dynamism. An enviable aspect of the U.S. economy\naround the globe is our spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor\nmarket flexibility. This dynamism has contributed to economic growth and well-being in the U.S. by\nallowing resources to be reallocated from less-productive to more-productive businesses and allowing\nworkers to move up the career ladder.\n\nBut the degree of dynamism in the U.S. economy has been declining for some time. On average, over the\n1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3 percent of total employment\nper year.8 Since then, this share has fallen to around 2 percent.9 Since 2000, key innovative sectors like\nhigh-tech have seen a sharp slowing in the rate of start-ups.10 The decline in business and labor market\ndynamism is a structural factor that may be contributing to the slowdown we’ve seen in productivity\ngrowth.11\n\nLabor force growth, the other key determinant of long-run economic growth, is projected to be\nconsiderably slower than it has been in recent decades. In the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2-1/2\n\n8\n\nSee John Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Who Creates Jobs? Small Versus Large Versus\nYoung,” Review of Economics and Statistics 95 (May 2013), pp. 347-361.\n9\n\nMy calculations are based on the firm age table from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics, Firm\nCharacteristics Data Tables (http://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data_firm.html).\n10\n\nSee John Haltiwanger, “Top Ten Signs of Declining Business Dynamism and Entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” paper\nwritten for the Kauffman Foundation New Entrepreneurial Growth conference, August 2015.\n11\n\nHaltiwanger (2015), p. 9.\n\n\f12\npercent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered the work force. Labor force growth\nhas slowed since then, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over 2010-2016. Demographic\nfactors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, suggest slow growth at about that\npace will continue.12 So, longer-run output growth will likely remain below the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate\nseen over the 1980s and 1990s.13\n\nMy own estimate is that longer-run growth will be about 2 percent, but I acknowledge that such estimates\nhave wide confidence bands around them and economists hold different views about the future growth\nprospects of the U.S. economy.14,15 The difference in views largely stems from different assessments of\nthe prospects for investments in technology and human capital.\n\nNew technologies\nThose pessimistic about the future don’t expect to get large productivity gains from today’s innovations\nsuch as robotics, artificial intelligence, and computers, and believe that technological advances have been\nslowing since the 1970s. Other observers note that it is very difficult to predict where future technology\nis going, and they are much more optimistic that computerization, nanotechnology, genome mapping, and\n\n12\n\nAccording to the latest available projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that, as baby boomers\nretire, annual growth in the labor force over 2014-2024 will average 1/2 percent. See U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, Economic Projections – 2014-24, December 8, 2015, Table 1.\n13\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office currently estimates that potential GDP growth averaged 3.4 percent per year\nover 1982-1990 and 3.3 percent per year over 1991-2001; it projects that potential growth will average 1.8 percent\nper year over 2017-2027. See Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027,\nJanuary 2017, Table 2.3.\n14\n\nThose pessimistic about the future growth prospects of the U.S. economy include Robert Gordon. (See Robert J.\nGordon, “Secular Stagnation: A Supply-Side View,” American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings 5, May\n2015, pp. 54-59, and Robert J. Gordon, “The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth: Restatement, Rebuttal, and\nReflections,” National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 19895, February 2014.)\n15\n\nOptimists include Joel Mokyr, Barry Eichengreen, Erik Brynjolfsson, and Andrew McAfee. (See Joel Mokyr,\n“The Next Age of Invention,” City Journal, Winter 2014; Barry Eichengreen, “Secular Stagnation: The Long\nView,” American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings 5, May 2015, pp. 66-70; and Erik Brynjolfsson and\nAndrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies,\nNew York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2014.)\n\n\f13\nother advances in biology will have impacts not yet fully harnessed.16 For example, a recent article in The\nNew Yorker describes how machine learning is being used to accurately diagnose malignancies, with the\npotential to displace the doctor as diagnostician – a fundamental change in the practice of medicine.17\n\nChanges in technology with widespread applicability can lead to higher levels of productivity growth and\noutput growth, but because adapting to the changes takes time, it will take longer to see those positive\neffects.18 In fact, the disruption caused by technology can have negative effects at first. Workers need to\nretrain and some industries may be pushed out by the new technology. As the economy adapts,\neventually there are gains, but not all people, industries, and communities will automatically share in the\nbenefits.\n\nHuman capital\nHuman capital and technology are intricately linked. For technology to enhance productivity, workers\nneed to have the abilities and knowledge to apply it. So, technological change can induce higher\ninvestments in human capital. But the reverse is true, too. Investment in human capital may spur\ninvestment in innovation because firms are more likely to develop and adopt a new technology if they are\nmore certain they will be able to hire workers with the requisite skills to use it. Many studies have\ndocumented the importance of investment in human capital to a nation’s economic growth and wellbeing.19 And at the individual level, better education is correlated with higher wages and lower levels of\n\n16\n\nSee Mokyr (2014), and Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014).\n\n17\n\nSee Siddhartha Mukherjee, “A.I. Versus M.D.,” The New Yorker, April 3, 2017.\n\n18\n\nBarry Eichengreen distinguishes between two dimensions of technology: the range of applicability and the range\nof adaptation. A technology that has only a limited range of applicability won’t have a large effect on productivity\nand growth because it is used only in a narrow range of sectors or activities. A technology that requires a large\nrange of adaptation of other processes in the economy will take longer to have a positive effect on productivity and\ngrowth. See Eichengreen (2015).\n19\n\nFor a discussion of educational attainment and its contributions to economic growth, see J. Bradford DeLong,\nClaudia Goldin, and Lawrence F. Katz, “Sustaining U.S. Economic Growth,” in Henry J. Aaron, James M. Lindsay,\nand Pietro S. Nivola, eds., Agenda for the Nation (Washington: Brookings Institution Press, 2003). The importance\n\n\f14\nunemployment. Moreover, research suggests that technological change is driving the rising skill premium\nand is affecting how work is organized. Medium-skill jobs that are more likely to involve routine, nonphysical work are being handled by computers.20 This shift in the distribution of jobs helps to explain the\nwider gap in wages for highly skilled vs. lower skilled workers, and the increasing return to gaining the\neducation required to obtain those skills.\n\nGlobalization\nGlobalization in the form of lower barriers to trade is another phenomenon that influences productivity\ngrowth. Free trade enhances productivity growth by allowing countries to focus resources on their\ncomparative advantage and by spurring competition. Globalization and technological change are linked:\nglobalization allows new technologies to be deployed more broadly and quickly and, by increasing\ncompetition, can drive firms to create and develop new and more productive technologies.\n\nWhile globalization leads to long-run improvements in the standard of living in the aggregate, similar to\ntechnological change, it can be disruptive in the short run as production shifts to the industries in which\nthe country has a comparative advantage and workers in the contracting sectors need to retrain or relocate\nto find jobs.\n\nof education to economic well-being can even be found at the state level. For example, Cleveland Fed researchers\nfound that over a 75-year period, education levels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each\nstate’s per capita income growth. See Paul W. Bauer, Mark E. Schweitzer, and Scott A. Shane, “Knowledge\nMatters: The Long-Run Determinants of State Income Growth,” Journal of Regional Science 52, 2011, pp. 240-255,\nand “Altered States: A Perspective on 75 Years of State Income Growth,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2005\nAnnual Report.\n20\n\nThe data suggest that since 2000, jobs have become “polarized,” meaning that while high-skill and low-skill\noccupations have seen job growth, medium-skill occupations have experienced job losses. See Daron Acemoglu\nand David Autor, “Skills, Tasks, and Technologies: Implications for Employment and Earnings,” in Handbook of\nLabor Economics, vol. 4B, Orley Ashenfelter and David Card, eds., Amsterdam: Elsevier-North Holland, 2011, pp.\n1043-1171. For an accessible explanation of the polarization hypothesis, see Rob Valletta, “Higher Education,\nWages, and Polarization,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter, 2015-02, January 12, 2015.\nAlso see Valletta (2015) and Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz, “Job Polarization and Rising Inequality in the\nNation and the New York-Northern New Jersey Region,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Current Issues in\nEconomics and Finance 18, 2012.\n\n\f15\nEconomic policy\nMonetary policy cannot affect the economy’s long-term growth rate. But other government policies, if\nthey are well-designed and focused on spurring productive investments in human and physical capital,\nR&D, and innovation, would be helpful, and could, with sufficient time, lead to a somewhat higher\nlonger-run growth rate.21 Policies can also help to ensure that the aggregate longer-term gains from\ntechnological change and globalization are better distributed, and that households, industries, and\ncommunities that are negatively affected are provided with some cushion to help ease the transition.\nPolicies and programs that enable people to gain the skills needed to be productive members of the\nmodern workforce are part of such a cushion.\n\nOn the technology side, in addition to public-private ventures for developing technological innovations, a\ngood case can be made for expanded government support of basic science and R&D, a building block for\nhigher productivity growth. Basic R&D has a public good aspect to it because its benefits can be widely\napplied throughout various parts of the economy, while an individual firm might be deterred from such\ninvestment as it cannot fully capture the returns.\n\nFinally, we should recognize that immigrants make up over 16 percent of the U.S. workforce today.22\nGiven U.S. demographics, immigrants will become an increasingly important source of labor supply for\nthe U.S. This suggests that a well-thought-out immigration policy that attracts labor to the U.S. is also a\nnecessary ingredient to support longer-run growth.\n\nIt is important for the country to tackle these longer-run issues in order to improve the economic health of\nindividuals and communities and to maintain and enhance our future standard of living.\n21\n\nSee the discussion in Loretta J. Mester, “A Serenity Prayer for Monetary Policymakers,” remarks at the Global\nInterdependence Center Central Banking Series, Singapore, February 20, 2017.\n22\n\nSee U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Foreign-Born Workers: Labor Force Characteristics – 2015,” May 19, 2016.\n\n\f16\n\nOne of my favorite composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was known for writing beautiful music but\nhe was also an avid letter writer.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Chicago Council on Global Affairs\nChicago, IL\nMay 8, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Chicago Council on Global Affairs for this opportunity to speak about the economy and\nmonetary policy. I was very pleased to receive this invitation from Michael Moskow. I have known\nMichael for quite a while now, having seen him in action around the FOMC table when he was president\nof the Chicago Fed and I was the director of research at the Philadelphia Fed. Michael personified what’s\nbest about the FOMC’s collegial atmosphere. He was able to explain his thinking, listen to alternative\nviews, and then persuade others about the appropriate path forward. Michael’s last FOMC meeting was\non August 16, 2007. It was the second unscheduled conference call that month and the FOMC discussed\nthe profound deterioration in credit market conditions. Of course, we all know what happened to the\neconomy after that. It is common knowledge that Michael stepped down as Chicago Fed president\nbecause he had reached the official term limit, but I’m now wondering if the timing might also reflect his\nvery keen ability to forecast the future.\n\nAs everyone in this room knows, economic forecasting is both science and art. Today, I will discuss my\noutlook for the economy and my views on monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion turns eight years old next month. It got off to a slow start from a very weak\nplace, but now this expansion is one of the longest on record. While the quarterly pattern has had its\nshare of ups and downs, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on\naverage, over the expansion. The sustainability of the expansion through various economic shocks is a\ntestament to the U.S. economy’s resiliency. While some of the recent readings on real activity have been\nsoft, it is normal to see variability in the monthly and quarterly data.\n\n\f2\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting continued expansion remain sound. These\nfundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household\nbalance sheets, and strength in the labor market that has led to increases in personal income. In addition,\nalthough geopolitical risks remain, global economic conditions have improved. Supported by\naccommodative monetary policy, the recovery in Europe has gained traction, with unemployment rates\ndown and inflation moving up, and the slowdown in the Chinese economy has been more orderly and\nmoderate than what some had feared early last year.\n\nWhile there are upside and downside risks around my forecast, my modal outlook is that over the next\nyear, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longer-run trend, which I estimate to\nbe about 2 percent, and the unemployment rate will move further below its longer-run level, which I\nestimate to be about 5 percent. With appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions\nare in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation.\nLet me put this outlook into context.\n\nEconomic growth\nDespite the strong fundamentals, GDP growth in the first quarter was weak. At this point, I’m not taking\nmuch of a signal about future growth from that reading; there are reasons to think this was a transitory\nslowdown. We’ve seen a pattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter followed\nby stronger growth in subsequent quarters. So even though the data are adjusted for seasonal effects,\nthere appears to be some residual seasonality in the GDP data.1\n\nThe unseasonably warm weather early in the year appears to have weighed on growth, shifting spending\nfrom one quarter to another. For example, after growing strongly in the fourth quarter of last year,\n1\n\nSee Kurt G. Lunsford, “Lingering Residual Seasonality in GDP Growth,” Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, Number 2017-06, March 28, 2017, and Glenn D. Rudebusch, Daniel Wilson, and Tim Mahedy,\n“The Puzzle of Weak First-Quarter GDP Growth,” Economic Letter, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 201516, May 18, 2015.\n\n\f3\nconsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, decelerated in the first quarter in\npart because the warm weather led to lower spending on utilities. It is usually a good idea to average\nthrough some of these ups and down when trying to detect the underlying trend. Readings on consumer\nsentiment and confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing.\nSo the softness in the first quarter hasn’t changed my medium-run outlook, and I expect a rebound in\nconsumer spending over the rest of the year.\n\nThe housing sector continues to gradually improve. Despite a rise in mortgage rates, demand for housing\nis increasing, and in some places, supply has not kept pace with demand. The months’ supply of existing\nhomes on the market has fallen to under four months, its lowest level since early 2005. Business contacts\nreport that, in some cases, it has been difficult to find construction workers to build new supply. The\nmismatch between supply and demand is putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at\nabout a 6 percent pace, on average, nationally.\n\nIt shouldn’t be too surprising that the housing recovery has been a moderate one. The housing boom and\ncrash are not something anyone wants to repeat. It took some time for household balance sheets and the\nlabor market to recover to a point where households were confident enough to take on mortgage debt\nagain. Borrowers are being careful not to take on more debt than they can handle, and lenders are\nextending credit, but to those with good credit quality. Multifamily housing activity has picked up more\nthan single-family housing. Going forward, the mix between multifamily and single-family housing may\ndiffer from what it has been in the past, as both younger people and empty-nesters are drawn to urban\nenvironments, and some prefer to rent rather than buy. Overall, I expect activity in the sector to continue\nto expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nBusiness activity and investment are starting to strengthen after being quite subdued last year and through\nmuch of the expansion. The sizable drop in oil prices from over $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to around\n$30 in early 2016 led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers. The 20\n\n\f4\npercent appreciation of the dollar from mid-2014 to the end of 2015 hurt manufacturers and other firms\ndependent on exports. But since then, conditions supporting business spending have improved. Oil\nprices began to firm in early 2016 and have been roughly stable near $50 per barrel since then, and the\ndollar has appreciated only modestly, on net, over the past year. In addition, the firming in global\neconomic growth has increased demand for U.S. exports.\n\nU.S. business sentiment is at a very high level, but it has not translated into a surge in activity.\nNonetheless, we are starting to see a pickup in business spending, driven by the improvement in\nunderlying economic conditions. This gives me some confidence in positive momentum even if there is\nsome downward adjustment in expectations going forward. Mining activity has increased: the number of\nactive oil drilling rigs remains well below the level seen before the oil price drop, but has roughly doubled\nover the past year. National and regional manufacturing surveys suggest an improvement in activity and\ncapital spending plans even if overall sentiment has been tempered. Even though motor vehicle\nproduction softened in March, manufacturing production was higher in the first quarter compared to the\nfourth quarter and compared to a year ago. This is particularly good news for the Cleveland Fed and\nChicago Fed Districts, which have a higher share of employment in manufacturing compared to the\nnation. Both regions felt the brunt of the cyclical pullback in manufacturing, as well as the longer-run\nshift from manufacturing to services.2 Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District tell us that even if some of\nthe proposals for tax reform, health insurance, infrastructure spending, and regulatory changes are\ndelayed, they expect the business environment to remain positive and that this will translate into further\nincreases in business spending and hiring.\n\nI would welcome a pickup in business investment in plant, equipment, and research and development\nbecause investment is an important factor influencing underlying productivity growth. Structural\n2\n\nThe Cleveland Fed District includes Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of\nWest Virginia. The Chicago Fed District includes all of Iowa and most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and\nWisconsin. Manufacturing employment is 8.5 percent of total payroll employment in the U.S. and 12 percent of\ntotal payroll employment in these nine states; these states account for 32 percent of U.S. manufacturing\nemployment.\n\n\f5\nproductivity growth – how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output\n– is a key determinant of an economy’s longer-run growth rate, the standard of living of its people, and\nwage growth. And productivity growth depends on factors like investment in human and physical capital\nand R&D that yields innovative products and processes.\n\nOver the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business\nsector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire expansion it has\naveraged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen over the prior two\nexpansions. Some of the slowdown in productivity growth likely reflects the difficulty in measuring\nproductivity in the service sector, including health care, intellectual property, and information technology,\nwhich is becoming a larger share of the U.S. economy. Some of the slowdown is likely cyclical,\nreflecting persistent effects of the Great Recession. Indeed, it took a long time for investment in physical\nand human capital, key determinants of productivity growth, to emerge during this expansion.\n\nAs the expansion continues and investment expands, it is reasonable to assume that the cyclical\nimpediments will abate and we’ll see somewhat stronger productivity growth. This assumption underlies\nmy expectation that longer-run growth will be 2 percent. But, in addition to measurement and cyclical\nissues, structural factors are likely weighing on productivity growth, as well. Monetary policy cannot\naddress these structural issues, but other government policies, if they are well-designed and focused on\nspurring productive investments in human and physical capital, R&D, and innovation, would be helpful,\nand could, with sufficient time, lead to a somewhat higher longer-run growth rate.3\n\nAnother important determinant of long-run growth is growth in the labor force. U.S. demographic\nfactors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, especially if coupled with restrictions\non immigration, suggest that labor force growth will be considerably slower than it has been in recent\n3\n\nSee the discussion in Loretta J. Mester, “A Serenity Prayer for Monetary Policymakers,” remarks at the Global\nInterdependence Center Central Banking Series, Singapore, February 20, 2017.\n\n\f6\ndecades. This means longer-run growth will likely remain lower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over\nthe 1980s and 1990s.4\n\nIndeed, the downward trend in the labor force participation rate is one of the factors we consider when\nassessing the condition of the labor market. So let me discuss labor market developments now.\n\nLabor markets\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 jobs per month on average. Over the\nfirst four months of this year, firms sustained that pace, with a monthly average gain of 185,000 jobs.\nThis is a slower pace than in the two expansions in the 1980s and 1990s.5 But it’s important to remember\nthat because trend labor force participation is lower, trend employment growth is also lower. Indeed,\nestimates of trend employment growth range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on the\nprecise assumptions one makes about labor force participation. So the recent employment growth\nnumbers are well above trend.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has moved down. It stood at 4.4 percent in April,\nless than half its peak of 10 percent in late 2009 and at the lowest reading achieved in the previous\nexpansion. Although payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace given the progress\nthat has already been made in the labor market, I expect the pace will be sufficient to keep the\nunemployment rate below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nOther gauges of the under-utilization of labor have also improved significantly. For example, the broader\nU6 measure of unemployment, which includes the number of part-time workers who would rather work\n4\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office currently estimates that potential GDP growth averaged 3.4 percent per year over\n1982-1990 and 3.3 percent per year over 1991-2001; it projects that potential growth will average 1.8 percent per\nyear over 2017-2027. See Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027, January\n2017.\n5\n\nPayroll job gains averaged nearly 230,000 per month over the December 1982-July 1990 expansion and about\n200,000 per month over the April 1991-March 2001 expansion.\n\n\f7\nfull time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, has fallen to its\nlowest level since late 2007. In addition, the labor force participation rate has been essentially stable for\nthe past three years. So relative to the downward trend, the stability we’ve seen in participation is\nactually another sign of strength in the labor market.\n\nFor much of the expansion, wage growth has been subdued compared to what we’ve experienced in other\nexpansions. Partly this reflects slow productivity growth.6 Still, we have seen a gradual acceleration in\nwages over time as labor market conditions have strengthened. For some time we have heard from our\nlabor and business contacts across a broad set of industries that firms are having trouble finding qualified\nworkers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. More and more of these firms are\nresponding by raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain workers. Contacts in the\nCleveland Fed District expect wage increases to average about 3 percent this year, with significantly\nhigher increases expected for highly skilled workers. These anecdotal reports are showing through to the\nwage data, where measures such as the employment cost index and average hourly earnings have\naccelerated from earlier in the recovery. This is a welcome state of affairs. As one of the characters in\nBeethoven’s opera “Fidelio” sings: “If you haven’t money by you, happiness is hard to find...But when it\njingles round your pockets fate is at your mercy.”\n\nOn balance, we’ve seen a sustained cyclical recovery in labor markets since the Great Recession. There\nare some longer-run structural issues that the country must tackle, such as making sure people have access\nto the training and development needed for the jobs in the modern economy. But from the standpoint of\nthe cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address, I believe we have achieved the maximum\nemployment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\n\n6\n\nAlthough actual wage setting is a complicated process, in economic models of competitive markets, real wages\nreflect the marginal product of workers. For a discussion of wages and their relationship to productivity growth over\nthe expansion, see Roberto Pinheiro and Meifeng Yang, “Wage Growth after the Great Recession,” Economic\nCommentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, March 21, 2017.\n\n\f8\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Consistent with meeting this part of the\nmandate over the longer run, the FOMC has set a goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the yearover-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Most\npeople understand why high inflation is a problem: it erodes the purchasing power of their money. But\ninflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead consumers and businesses to delay purchases,\nthereby slowing the economy, and it increases debt burdens.\n\nFor some time, inflation has been running below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, but over the past two years,\ninflation has been moving up. In March, we saw a decline in readings on consumer price inflation. But\nI’m taking little signal about the future path of inflation from those numbers. They partly reflected some\none-off changes, such as the decline in prices for cell phone service plans, and they came after strong\nreadings in January and February. Measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation stood at 1.8 percent\nin March, up from under 1 percent a year ago.\n\nIn determining where inflation is relative to our goal, we need to look through transitory movements in\nthe numbers, both those below and those above our goal, and focus on where inflation is headed and\nwhere it will be maintained on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily\ndetermined by monetary policy, but we know that we can’t keep actual inflation at 2 percent at each point\nin time; inevitably shocks hit the economy and the inflation numbers move, sometimes below our goal\nand sometimes above. Still, we want to take actions to keep inflation from running either persistently\nbelow or persistently above 2 percent. In other words, our goal is symmetric – it isn’t a ceiling – and we\naim to keep inflation at 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\n\nWith appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained\nreturn over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. These conditions include the\n\n\f9\nfirming in inflation that we’ve seen over time, reasonably stable inflation expectations, continued strength\nin the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAppropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our longerrun goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. In my view, we have met\nthe maximum employment part of our mandate and inflation is nearing our 2 percent goal. Although we\nlive in a high-frequency world, we cannot overreact to transitory movements in incoming data; our\npolicymaking has to focus on what changes in economic and financial conditions imply for the mediumrun outlook and risks around the outlook.7\n\nIf economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in\nthe federal funds rate will be needed. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate\nby one-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent, and last week, the FOMC decided to maintain this\nrange. Both decisions are consistent with the gradual upward path of interest rates that the Committee has\nindicated for some time is likely to be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives, should the\neconomy evolve as anticipated. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It\nwill help avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed\nto overheat and risks to financial stability, should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on\nexcessively risky investments in a search for yield. It will put monetary policy in a better position to\naddress whichever risks, whether to the upside or downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nGiven my outlook, I don’t believe that removing accommodation calls for an increase in the fed funds rate\nat each meeting, but I do anticipate more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past two years. In\n7\n\nSee the discussion in Loretta J. Mester, “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy: Low-Frequency\nPolicymaking in a High-Frequency World,” remarks to the New York Association for Business Economics, New\nYork, NY, April 1, 2016.\n\n\f10\naddition, I think that it’s important for the FOMC to remain very vigilant against falling behind as we\ncontinue to make progress on our goals, especially given the low level of interest rates and the large size\nof our balance sheet. We know that monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags, so\npolicy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. If we delay too long in taking the\nnext normalization step and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor market becomes\nunsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up steeply, we could\nrisk a recession. This is a bad outcome that disproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our\nsociety.\n\nIn addition to removing accommodation by raising interest rates, we also have to consider the Fed’s\nbalance sheet. To address the financial crisis and Great Recession, the FOMC undertook several\nprograms to purchase longer-maturity assets. These purchases aimed at putting downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates once the FOMC’s traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to\neffectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet has grown from nearly $900 billion\nin assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from mainly short-term\nTreasury securities to mortgage-backed securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\nNormalizing the stance of policy also means taking steps to normalize the balance sheet, and the FOMC\nrecognized this need from the very start of using nontraditional tools. Currently, the FOMC is continuing\nto reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and principal payments from agency debt and mortgagebacked securities, essentially maintaining the balance sheet at its very large size. But, as indicated in the\nminutes of our March meeting, the FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, including when and how\nbest to implement a change in reinvestments.8 Such a change should be done in a way that allows for a\n\n8\n\nThe Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017, pp. 2-3.\n\n\f11\ngradual and predictable reduction in the Fed’s asset holdings so that over time the balance sheet is\nreduced to the smallest size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.9\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our\nreinvestment policy this year, with clear communication in advance about how we plan to implement the\nchange. My preference is that once we decide on a plan, we stay with it; the fed funds rate should be our\nmain tool for responding to changes in the outlook during normal times. Because it will take several\nyears to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, we can end reinvestments before we\nhave decided on the ultimate size of the balance sheet. This decision is essentially one about our longerrun monetary policy implementation framework: do we want to operate with scarce banking reserves (the\nso-called corridor system) or abundant reserves (the so-called floor system)?10 Regardless of which\nframework is chosen, the Fed’s balance sheet will be considerably smaller than it is today.\n\nI view the purchase of longer-term assets as a nontraditional tool that should be reserved for\nnontraditional times, times when we have lowered our policy rate to near zero and we need to add more\nmonetary policy stimulus because of a deterioration in economic and financial conditions. Ending\nreinvestments and beginning the journey toward a smaller balance sheet composed mainly of Treasury\nsecurities will be a welcome acknowledgment that the economy has entered normal times and policy is\ntransitioning back to normal, too.\n\nAcknowledging Risks\nIn concluding, it’s important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and\nbecause of that, policy is not pre-set. Policy needs to remain systematic in how it reacts to incoming\ninformation relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook indeed materially change.\n9\n\nSee “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014.\n\n10\n\nThe FOMC has undertaken an extended effort to evaluate different frameworks for implementing monetary policy\nin the long run. See the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, July 28-29, 2015, July 26-27, 2016, and\nNovember 1-2, 2016.\n\n\f12\n\nIn March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its economic and policy path\nprojections.11 These are very good reminders to both the public and to policymakers that there is always a\nlot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. There’s forecast uncertainty because the economy is\nconstantly being buffeted by shocks, data are revised over time, and it isn’t clear which model will best\npredict the future path of the economy.\n\nToday, I view the risks to the real economy and to inflation over the medium run – the time horizon\nrelevant for monetary policy – as roughly balanced and see a gradual reduction in monetary policy\naccommodation as appropriate. I acknowledge that there are geopolitical risks out there, including\ntensions in North Korea and the Middle East, but these aren’t the kinds of risk that preemptive monetary\npolicy action can mitigate. Still, these types of risk need to be recognized when assessing changes in\neconomic and financial conditions. Indeed, some of the recent downward pressure on long-term interest\nrates likely reflects some flight-to-quality flows in the face of rising geopolitical tensions, rather than a\nmaterial re-evaluation of the modal outlook.\n\nIn addition, there remains uncertainty around what fiscal and other economic policies might be\nforthcoming. These include changes to infrastructure spending, regulation, and policies pertaining to\ntaxes, immigration, and trade. When one gauges the effects – both positive and negative – of any\nforthcoming policy changes on the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation over the short,\nmedium, and longer runs, the devil will be in the details in terms of the size, composition, timing, and\nfinancing of such initiatives.\n\nMy view that it is appropriate to continue on our gradual path of monetary policy normalization is not\ndependent on fiscal policy but, instead, is based on my reading of the resiliency in the U.S. economy’s\n11\n\nSee the confidence band charts in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of the Minutes of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017.\n\n\f13\nunderlying momentum and the progress we have made on reaching our monetary policy goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nTenth Annual Risk Conference:\n“Promise and Peril: Managing the Uncertainty of Rapid Innovation and a Changing\nEconomy”\nCo-hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and\nDePaul University’s Center for Financial Services\nChicago, IL\nMarch 30, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and DePaul University’s Center for Financial Services for\ninviting me to participate in this Tenth Annual Risk Conference. A conference series that has lasted a\ndecade has something going for it, and this series is no exception. The first risk conference was held in\n2008, in the midst of an emerging financial crisis, when the deficiencies in risk management and\nmeasurement became all too apparent. I think we have learned a thing or two since then – at least I hope\nwe have. One of those things is that the world is constantly moving and innovating. Financial services is\nno exception. Given the important role that financial services plays in the economy, it behooves all of us –\nproviders, supervisors, regulators, and consumers – to understand the risks that are inherent in the financial\nsystem and to manage those risks effectively so that the benefits of a sound and stable financial system can\nbe realized for all. Although the technological changes affecting the industry are accelerating, we\nshouldn’t let that distract us from the fundamental matter of risk management. While technological change\nmay increase some risks, it also has the potential to improve our methods of assessing risks, and we should\nharness its power.\n\nTechnological change is very apparent in the payments system. This morning, I will focus a large portion\nof my remarks on an initiative that the Federal Reserve is leading to address the rapidly changing\nlandscape in the payments industry in the U.S. This initiative is a collaborative effort between the Fed and\na broad array of private-sector participants, and aims to improve the speed, efficiency, security, and\nubiquity of the U.S. payments system. I am happy to say that the effort has made significant progress and\nthat several important milestones will be reached this year.\n\nBut before I turn to payments, it behooves me to say a little bit about the economy in which the payments\nsystem plays such an important role. I should add that what I say today about payments and about the\neconomy are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f2\nThe Underlying Fundamentals Supporting the Economic Expansion Are Sound\nAt its mid-March meeting, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by one-quarter\npercentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent. This decision was based on the Committee’s view of actual and\nexpected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward our goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. I fully supported this further step on the path of increases in\nthe federal funds rate that the Committee has indicated for some time is likely to be appropriate to achieve\nand maintain our objectives, should the economy evolve as anticipated.\n\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion are sound. Looking\nthrough the quarterly pattern of ups and downs, we find that output has sustained a moderate pace of\nabout 2 percent growth, on average, over the past three years. While growth in the first quarter may come\nin on the weak side, I think this largely reflects transitory factors and residual seasonality in the data, and\nI see favorable fundamentals as supportive of GDP growth over the next year at somewhat above trend,\nwhich I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial\nconditions, improved household balance sheets and income growth, and continued strength in the labor\nmarket.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. This year, that\nstrength has been sustained, with an average increase of 237,000 jobs per month in January and February,\nwell above estimates of trend employment growth.\n\nIn a further sign of strength, as the economy has added jobs, labor force participation has been basically\nstable for the past three years rather than declining like its trend, and the unemployment rate has been\nmoving down. In February, the unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent, less than half of its peak after the\nGreat Recession. Although payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace, given the\nprogress that’s already been made, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the\n\n\f3\nunemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5\npercent over the next two years.\n\nFor a while, inflation has been running below the Fed’s target of 2 percent. But inflation has picked up\nover the past year and is moving in the right direction. There are likely to be monthly variations in the\ninflation numbers as previous changes in energy and import prices roll out of our year-over-year\nmeasures, and current fluctuations roll in. In determining where we are relative to goal, we need to look\nthrough transitory movements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on\nwhere inflation is going on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily\ndetermined by monetary policy, and with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the\nconditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation. Conditions supporting the return to goal include the firmer data on inflation, reasonably stable\ninflation expectations, continued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly\nabove trend.\n\nThe appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our\nlonger-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. If economic\nconditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in the fed\nfunds rate will be needed. My current assessment is that the pace of removal won’t call for an increase in\nthe fed funds rate at each meeting, but it does mean more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past\ntwo years. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a\nbuild-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as\nwell as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on\nexcessively risky investments in a search for yield.\n\n\f4\nAlong with its rate increase, in mid-March the FOMC also announced that it was maintaining its policy of\nreinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and\nagency mortgage-backed securities, essentially maintaining the Fed’s balance sheet at its very large size.\nThe balance sheet grew when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets. The\nFOMC used this nontraditional policy tool to address the Great Recession, once its traditional policy tool,\nthe fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As Chair Yellen mentioned in her press briefing,\nthe FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, but no decisions have been made. If economic\nconditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our reinvestment policy this year. I\nview this as consistent with our principles of policy normalization and our statement that we anticipate\ncontinuing reinvestments “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.”1\nEnding reinvestments is a first step toward reducing the size of the balance sheet and returning its\ncomposition to primarily Treasury securities over time – a welcome acknowledgment that the economy\nand policy are transitioning back to normal.\n\nThe Payments System Is Vital to a Sound Economy\nI don’t think anyone would disagree with the statement that a well-functioning and secure payments\nsystem is vital to a sound economy. Like highways, bridges, railroads, and water treatment plants, the\npayments system is a critical part of the infrastructure of our country. As the nation’s central bank, the\nFederal Reserve has an interest in promoting the macroeconomic and financial stability of our nearly\n$19 trillion economy, and our oversight of the payments system has this in mind. Indeed, everyone in the\ncountry has a stake in a sound payments system. According to the Fed’s latest payments study, in 2015\nconsumers, businesses, and government agencies executed 144 billion noncash, nonwire-transfer\npayments with a value of almost $178 trillion; that’s an average of 550 million payments worth $680\nbillion per working day.2 Because the current system works well, most people have spent little time\n1\n\nSee, “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014, and the FOMC post-meeting\nstatement of March 15, 2017.\n\n\f5\nthinking about the backbone that makes these payments possible and ensures that the payments system is\nreliable and secure.\n\nBut with the changes brought by new technology, more people are seeking new ways to execute\ntransactions, whether it be online or via cell phone, and they want to execute them faster. For example,\nthe U.S. Census Bureau reports that e-commerce sales accounted for about 8 percent of total U.S. retail\nsales in 2016, more than double their share of 10 years ago.3 According to analysis commissioned by the\nFederal Reserve, about a third of consumers and three-quarters of businesses are willing to pay a fee for\npayments that offer faster availability to the payee.4 Demand is also rising for a more efficient way to\nexecute payments across international borders, and to make person-to-person payments. On the supply\nside, we have seen an expanded set of providers, beyond traditional commercial banks, seeking to satisfy\nthis demand for new and faster payments.\n\nOf course, innovation is nothing new. The U.S. has experienced a long history of payments system\ninnovation, including the introduction of ATMs and debit cards, the move from paper checks to check\nimaging and electronic presentment, the introduction of online bill payment with the advent of the\nInternet, and expanded offerings of mobile banking. Some of the enhancements, like check imaging,\nmade the system more efficient, while others, like chip credit and debit cards, made the system more\nsecure. Yet, we have seen an increasingly rapid pace of technological change over the past several years,\nand this is again driving change in the industry. While the current system is working, we have to\n\n2\n\nThese include debit card, credit card, ACH, and check payments. See “The Federal Reserve Payments Study\n2016,” December 28, 2016.\n3\n\nSee U.S. Census Bureau, “Quarterly Retail E-Commerce Sales: 4th Quarter 2016,” February 17, 2017, and the\nadjusted time-series data, “Estimated Quarterly U.S. Retail Sales (Adjusted): Total and E-Commerce.” In this\nreport, e-commerce sales are “sales of goods and services where the buyer places an order, or the price and terms of\nthe sale are negotiated over an Internet, mobile device (M-commerce), extranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)\nnetwork, electronic mail, or other comparable online system. Payment may or may not be made online.”\n4\n\nSee Federal Reserve Financial Services, “Key Themes from Consultation Paper Feedback and End-User\nResearch,” April 2014.\n\n\f6\nrecognize that the evolution of the payments landscape has led to a fragmented patchwork of payment\nvehicles and providers, often lacking interoperability with one another or the ability to combine invoice\ninformation with a payment. The complexity of the payments system, involving incumbent providers,\nnew entrants, and end users, makes it harder to coordinate payments innovations. Platforms for making\npayments, including ACH, check, and credit and debit card systems, are lagging behind the technological\nadvances. The current U.S. payments system has not kept up with the evolving expectations and demands\nof end-user consumers and businesses. Nor has it kept up with developments in other countries that have\ntaken steps to modernize their payments systems. According to the Bank for International Settlements\n(BIS), nearly 20 countries have either implemented or are building systems that offer real-time or nearly\nreal-time payments, available as near as possible to 24 hours, 7 days a week. The role the central bank\nplayed in fostering these systems differs across countries; the roles include catalyst, overseer, and/or\noperator.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Is Taking a Collaborative Approach to Fostering Payments Modernization\nThe role that the Federal Reserve is playing in our payments system initiative is broadly a\nleadership/catalyst role. Assessing the trends in the payments landscape, the Federal Reserve and a\ndiverse set of industry stakeholders have come to agree that the U.S. payments system needs to evolve\nfurther and faster to support the changing nature of commerce, keep pace with the global economy, meet\nthe changing needs of end users, and address new and ongoing threats to security. An improved\npayments system – one that is more efficient and also secure – has several benefits. It will contribute to\npublic confidence, economic growth, and global competitiveness. In addition to meeting customer\ndemand, a modernized payments system could have an added societal benefit by helping the unbanked\nand underbanked join the financial mainstream, thereby receiving its benefits. It could also help lowincome households, small businesses, and others who need to closely manage their finances to gain faster\naccess to their funds.\n\n\f7\nIn 2015, the Federal Reserve Board and Reserve Banks published a paper laying out the strategies and\ntactics that the Federal Reserve is pursuing in collaboration with a broad array of payments system\nstakeholders to facilitate the move to a faster, more efficient, ubiquitous, and secure payments system.5 Of\ncourse, a lot of work was done before the 2015 paper was published. In 2002 and in 2012, the Fed\nundertook gap and opportunity assessments of the payments environment. It sought and received\nconsiderable input from the public on possible improvements to the payments system.6 That work helped\nframe the current initiative that seeks to achieve five outcomes: (1) a payments system that offers a safe\nand faster electronic solution for making a variety of personal and business payments, and one that is\nubiquitous and available on demand; (2) one that is secure and resilient, so the public can have high\nconfidence in it; (3) an efficient payments system that offers better value to consumers and businesses;\n(4) one that allows for cross-border payments in a more convenient, cost-effective, and timely way; and\n(5) a payments system that has been improved via a collaborative process involving a broad array of\npayment participants.7\n\nTo further this work, the Fed has taken a leadership role to spur a private-sector solution that will align\nprivate-sector interests with those of the public. We view this as consistent with our responsibility to\nfoster a well-functioning payments system for the benefit of the public. The Fed believes that\ncomprehensive improvement of the system for making payments end-to-end will require a comprehensive\napproach. It will need collaboration among and actions from a diverse set of payment stakeholders,\nincluding traditional and nontraditional payment providers, technology companies, the government, and\nend-user businesses and consumers. We think this collaboration will encourage ubiquitous access and\nwidespread adoption of new payment-system capabilities, which are keys to success.\n5\n\nSee “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System,” Federal Reserve System, January 26, 2015. This paper\nand other information on the Federal Reserve payments improvement initiative can be found on the website\nFedPaymentsImprovement.org.\n6\n\nSee “Payment System Improvement – Public Consultation Paper,” The Federal Reserve Banks, September 10,\n2013; and “The Future of Retail Electronic Payments Systems: Industry Interviews and Analysis,” Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Staff Study 175, December 2002.\n7\n\nSee “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.”\n\n\f8\n\nNote that the Fed’s initiative is not preempting or competing with other efforts already being undertaken\nby the industry; nor is it halting our efforts to improve the efficiency of the payment services the Fed\nitself provides. For example, late last year, Early Warning announced its Zelle network, a faster payments\nnetwork available to mobile banking customers, and The Clearing House, a large-bank association and\npayments company, is working on a real-time payments system that will be available to all U.S. financial\ninstitutions and is expected to be operable this year.8 Also, last September the Federal Reserve enhanced\nits same-day ACH service, consistent with NACHA’s (formerly, the National Automated Clearinghouse\nAssociation) new rules, which will result in wider usage of this service.9 And the Fed has also adopted\nnew global messaging standards (ISO 20022) for wire and cross-border ACH payments to ensure better\ninteroperability across platforms.\n\nI should note that the Fed’s approach to supporting and guiding the various parties working on improving\nthe payments system differs somewhat from approaches taken in other countries. Perhaps this is not too\nsurprising. For one thing, the number of entities involved in the U.S. payments system is quite large.\nAccording to BIS statistics, in 2015, over 12,000 entities offered payments services to non-banks in the\nU.S., compared to around 160 in Australia and around 360 in the United Kingdom.10 Even if we\nnormalize this by population, the U.S. has many more service providers: 39 per million inhabitants in the\nU.S., compared to under 7 in Australia and under 6 in the U.K. In addition, the Fed does not have the\n8\n\nSee “Early Warning Announces Zelle Network, October 24, 2016, and “The Clearing House to Undertake a MultiYear Effort to Design and Develop a Secure, Real-Time Payment System,” The Clearing House press release,\nOctober 22, 2014; and “Innovative Real-Time Payment System for the U.S. – VocaLink,” The Clearing House press\nrelease, October 26, 2015.\n9\n\nSee “Federal Reserve Board Approves Enhancements to Reserve Banks' Same-day ACH Service,” press release,\nSeptember 23, 2015, “Enhancements to Federal Reserve Bank Same-Day ACH Service,” Federal Register, 80(187),\nSeptember 28, 2015, pp. 58248-58253, and Same-Day ACH Resource Center on the Federal Reserve Bank Services\nwebsite. Also see Strategy 5: Enhanced Federal Reserve Services in “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment\nSystem: A Progress Report,” Federal Reserve System, January 2017.\n10\n\nSee Comparative Table 4, p. 450, in Bank for International Settlements, Committee on Payments and Market\nInfrastructures, “Statistics on Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Systems in the CPMI Countries: Figures for 2015,”\nDecember 2016 (http://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d155.htm).\n\n\f9\npower to mandate a solution, nor could we implement meaningful payment improvement on our own.\nWe recognize that many payment innovations have come from the industry. Of course, even countries\nthat have officially mandated changes to speed the adoption of more efficient payments systems recognize\nthe important role the industry must play. For example, the Faster Payments Service launched in the U.K.\nin 2008 was implemented by the private sector at the request of the government.11 The New Payments\nPlatform for immediate low-value payments, currently being built in Australia and expected to be\noperational in the second half of this year, was an industry-based solution proposed after the Reserve\nBank of Australia, that country’s central bank, undertook a review of payments innovation and published\nstrategic objectives it expected the payments system to meet.12\n\nConsiderable Progress Has Been Made on the Fed’s Payments System Improvement Initiative\nStakeholder engagement has been better than we might have hoped for. Our Payments Strategy Director,\nGordon Werkema, who oversees the initiative, hails from right here, the Chicago Fed, and has done a\nremarkable job. Two task forces were initiated in 2015 to work toward proposed solutions to our goals.\nIn setting up the task forces, we knew it was important to have the perspectives of the diverse set of\nrepresentatives with an interest in the payments system. The Faster Payments Task Force has over 300\nmembers from eight segments, including small, medium, and large financial institutions; nonbank\nproviders like technology companies; consumer interest organizations; government end users; business\nend users; and other industry segments, including regulators, rules and standards organizations,\nconsultants, and academic institutions.13 The Payments Security Task Force has over 175 members, and\nit, too, includes wide stakeholder representation. These task forces are operating under the direction of\n\n11\n\nSee Fumiko Hayashi, “Faster Payments in the United States: How Can Private Sector Systems Achieve Public\nPolicy Goals?” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Research Working Paper no. 15-03, June 2015.\n12\n\nSee “Strategic Review of Innovation in the Payments System: Conclusions,” Reserve Bank of Australia, June\n2012; and “RBA Core Criteria for a ‘Fast Payments’ Solution,” Reserve Bank of Australia, November 2012.\n13\n\nFor more information, see the Fed’s payments improvement initiative’s website at\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org.\n\n\f10\nsteering committees and have set up a framework for ensuring that task-force decisions and work\nproducts have broad support across members. Several work streams are now underway.\n\nThe Faster Payments Task Force reached an important milestone in February 2016 when the Faster\nPayments Effectiveness Criteria were published.14 This set of criteria is being used to evaluate whether\nproposed alternative approaches would be effective in delivering a safe and ubiquitous faster payments\ncapability. The 36 criteria fall into six categories: ubiquity, efficiency, safety, speed, legal considerations,\nand governance. The criteria were not intended to be a set of minimum requirements, but rather to\ndifferentiate the effectiveness of proposals across many dimensions, recognizing that many times there\nmay be tradeoffs. For example, higher speed might entail lower security unless coupled with a mitigant.\n\nIn the next stage, participants submitted proposed solutions for faster payments. Nineteen proposals have\nprogressed through the review process, with reviews by an independent assessment team and the members\nof the two task forces.\n\nIn an effort to be transparent about the process and the progress being made, in January, the Faster\nPayments Task Force published the first part of its final report, providing an overview of the task force’s\nmission and process, and the motivation for the work given the payments landscape. The second part of\nthe final report will be published this summer. It will provide details of the proposed solutions for faster\npayments that have been evaluated against the effectiveness criteria, as well as a discussion of challenges,\nopportunities, and recommendations to the industry for implementing faster payments solutions.\n\nIt is very important not to think about faster payments separately from secure payments. Indeed, each\nproposed faster payments solution is being assessed in terms of its security, including identity\n14\n\nInformation on the effectiveness criteria is available on the Fed’s payments improvement initiative’s website at\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/faster-payments/effectiveness-criteria/.\n\n\f11\nmanagement, authentication, the security of sensitive information as the payment travels through the\nsystem, the handling of fraudulent or erroneous payments, and the robustness of the system. While the\ntypes of risks need not change with faster payments, some risks might be exacerbated. For example,\nwhile a faster payments system makes funds available to the payee much faster, settlement may still take\nsome time. Deferred settlement means that the payee’s payments system is taking on credit risk until it\ngets the funds from the payer’s payments system. To reduce this risk, some, but not all, of the faster\npayments systems around the world couple real-time or near real-time settlement with faster payments.15\n\nIn addition to considering the security of the future faster payments system, the Secure Payments Task\nForce is also focusing on the security of the current payments system. The task force has mapped existing\nidentity management practices in end-to-end payment flows to help discover ways to improve current\npractices; it has defined guiding principles for protecting sensitive data associated with payments, which\ncould serve as the foundation for building a more comprehensive data-protection framework for the\nindustry; and it has completed an inventory of current industry efforts to share information for fraud and\nrisk prevention. As indicated in the January progress report, the Secure Payments Task Force plans to\nrelease further information on these initiatives later this year.16\n\nThere Is More Work to Be Done\nAs I mentioned, the Faster Payments Task Force will publish the second part of its final report this\nsummer, providing evaluations of the proposed solutions in terms of their effectiveness in providing the\nU.S. with a faster, more efficient, ubiquitous, and secure payments system. But that’s just the start of what\n\n15\n\nSee Committee on Payments and Markets, Bank for International Settlements, “Fast Payments – Enhancing the\nSpeed and Availability of Retail Payments,” November 2016. Also, for a discussion of some of the risks involved in\nfaster payments, see Julius Weyman, “Risks in Faster Payments,” Retail Payments Risk Forum Working Paper,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, May 2016. Weyman studies 15 faster payment schemes and finds that one-third\ninvolved real-time or near real-time settlement.\n16\n\nSee Federal Reserve System, “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System: Progress Report,” January\n2017.\n\n\f12\nneeds to be accomplished to modernize the U.S. payments system. A lot of further work will be needed to\nimplement solutions, and I believe it will require the same high level of collaboration across the many\npayments system stakeholders that has proved to be so important to the progress made to date.\n\nAt the same time, the Federal Reserve System, which has served as a catalyst for this effort, will need to\nconsider what further steps we should take to support payments system modernization. As I mentioned\nearlier, central banks across the globe have played different roles in fostering their countries’ efforts\nregarding faster and secure payments. Some have served as catalysts, others have overseen industry\nefforts, and others have been providers. Today, the Federal Reserve plays all three roles with respect to\npayments. We have been a leader and catalyst for the current initiative, we provide retail and wholesale\npayment services, and we have some supervisory and regulatory oversight responsibility for the payments\nsystem deriving from the fact that a well-functioning and secure payments system plays an important role\nin fostering macroeconomic and financial stability in the public interest.\n\nThe technological change we’ve experienced in recent years isn’t likely to stop, so it seems prudent that we\nshould be working to ensure that our payments system evolves in a productive way. Innovation,\ncompetition, collaboration, broad accessibility, common standards, risk management, and appropriate\nsupervision and regulation – all are important facets of a well-functioning payments system. Indeed, as the\npayments system evolves, I anticipate that how we go about effectively supervising the payments system\nwill need to evolve as well to ensure that the system remains secure, effective, and broadly accessible. As\nnew providers enter the field, we’ll need to focus on the risks rather than on the type of entity providing the\nservice.\n\nOne way in which central banks in several countries are supporting innovation in payments systems is by\nproviding a “regulatory sandbox.” Such a sandbox allows private-sector firms to test out innovative\nproducts, services, business models, or methods of delivery in a real-life environment, with some reduction\n\n\f13\nin full regulatory requirements but with appropriate safeguards for consumers and the financial system in\nplace during the experiments. The U.K. was the first country to provide such a sandbox in 2016, and\nseveral other countries, including Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore, also offer sandboxes.17\nRegulatory sandboxes have the potential to encourage more competition and faster, more effective\ninnovation in the payments system, by allowing new ideas to be tried out, to be made more effective\nthrough experimentation, and to be designed to better comply with consumer protections and other\nregulatory requirements. Even if the tested ideas aren’t brought to market, finding out early on that an idea\nwon’t work would seem to be very valuable information. The industry seems to have viewed the\nintroduction of the sandboxes favorably. For example, the regulatory sandbox in the U.K. received 69\napplications for its first cohort from a wide variety of firm-types, including start-ups and incumbents, with\n24 applications meeting the eligibility requirements to move on to development toward testing. Although\nthey are in their early stages, I find the regulatory sandboxes to be an intriguing idea and will be following\nthe results closely. They provide but one example of the type of productive collaboration that central\nbanks and regulators can have with the payments industry.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s payments modernization efforts, which I discussed today, are another important\nexample of the value of collaboration. As the work moves forward, the Federal Reserve is committed to\nfacilitating collaborative efforts with payment stakeholders to foster the move to a faster, secure, efficient,\nand ubiquitous payments system in the U.S. on behalf of the public.\n\n17\n\nSee the remarks by Christopher Woolard, U.K. Financial Conduct Authority Director of Strategy and\nCompetition, at the Innovate Finance Global Summit, April 11, 2016; U.K. Financial Conduct Authority,\n“Regulatory Sandbox,” November 2015; the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s regulatory sandbox web page; the\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission’s regulatory sandbox web page; Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nFintech Supervisory Sandbox, circular B1/15C, B9/29C to all authorized institutions, September 6, 2016; Bank\nNegara Malaysia (Central Bank of Malaysia) Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox Framework and press\nrelease; Monetary Authority of Singapore FinTech regulatory sandbox web page and FinTech Regulatory Sandbox\nGuidelines, November 2016.\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Communications\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nThe Stanley S. Watts Lecture\nThe Robins School of Business, University of Richmond\nRichmond, VA\nMarch 21, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Dean Nancy Bagranoff, Professor Dean Croushore, and the University of Richmond’s Robins\nSchool of Business for the opportunity to deliver this year’s Stanley S. Watts lecture. I feel honored to\njoin the list of distinguished speakers who have previously presented the Watts lecture. I have had the\npleasure of knowing and working with Professor Croushore for many years. Through his research and\nanalysis, Dean has made important contributions to the Federal Reserve System and to the economics\nprofession. As a professor, he is passing on his knowledge by training the next generation of economists\nand business people, an important public service.\n\nThis evening, I will speak about monetary policy and the role of communications in Federal Reserve\npolicymaking. I serve on the Federal Open Market Committee’s subcommittee on communications, so it\nmay not be surprising that I believe communications play an essential role in monetary policy\nimplementation. Of course, my remarks this evening will reflect my own views and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLast Week’s FOMC Monetary Policy Decision and the Economic Outlook\nThis is an opportune time to talk about policy communications because, as I’m sure many of you know,\nthe FOMC announced last week that it had decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by\none-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent. This decision was based on the Committee’s view of\nactual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward our\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability. I fully supported this further step on the path of\nincreases in the federal funds rate that the Committee has indicated for some time is likely to be\nappropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives, should the economy evolve as anticipated.\n\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion are sound. Looking\nthrough the quarterly pattern of ups and downs, we find that output has sustained a moderate pace of\n\n\f2\nabout 2 percent growth, on average, over the past three years. So far, based on the limited data available,\ntracking estimates suggest that growth in the current quarter may come in on the weak side. I am not\ntaking much of a signal from this, as it likely reflects some transitory factors like reduced energy demand\ndue to unseasonably warm weather early in the year and residual seasonality in the data – we’ve seen a\npattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter followed by stronger growth in\nsubsequent quarters. I see favorable fundamentals as supportive of GDP growth over the next year at\nsomewhat above trend, which I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative\nmonetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets and income growth, and\ncontinued strength in the labor market.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. This year, that\nstrength has been sustained, with an average increase of 237,000 jobs per month in January and February.\nThe pace is well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from around 75,000 to\n120,000 per month, depending on what one assumes about labor force participation. Demographic\nfactors, including the aging of our population, have resulted in a downward trend in participation, which\nis one of the reasons trend employment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago. But rather than\ndeclining like its trend, the participation rate has been basically stable for the past three years. This is a\nfurther sign of strength in the labor market.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has been moving down. In February, it stood at\n4.7 percent, less than half of its peak after the Great Recession. Although payroll job growth is likely to\nslow a bit from its current pace, given the progress that’s already been made, it will be sufficient to put\nfurther downward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below my\nestimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\n\f3\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. For a while, inflation has been running below\nthe Fed’s target of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, that is, total PCE inflation. But inflation has picked up over the past year and\nis moving in the right direction. There are likely to be monthly variations in the inflation numbers as\nprevious changes in energy and import prices roll out of our year-over-year measures, and current\nfluctuations roll in. In determining where we are relative to goal, we need to look through transitory\nmovements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is\ngoing on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary\npolicy, and with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a\nsustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. Conditions\nsupporting the return to goal include the firmer data on inflation, reasonably stable inflation expectations,\ncontinued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nThe appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our\nlonger-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. If economic\nconditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in the fed\nfunds rate will be needed. My current assessment is that the pace of removal won’t call for an increase in\nthe fed funds rate at each meeting, but it does mean more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past\ntwo years. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a\nbuild-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as\nwell as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on\nexcessively risky investments in a search for yield.\n\nAlong with its rate increase, last week the FOMC also announced that it was maintaining its policy of\nreinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and\nagency mortgage-backed securities, essentially maintaining the Fed’s balance sheet at its very large size.\n\n\f4\nThe balance sheet grew when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets. The\nFOMC used this nontraditional policy tool to address the Great Recession, once its traditional policy tool,\nthe fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As Chair Yellen mentioned in her press briefing,\nthe FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, but no decisions have been made. In my view, if\neconomic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our reinvestment policy this\nyear. I view this as consistent with our principles of policy normalization and our statement that we\nanticipate continuing reinvestments “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under\nway.” 1 Ending reinvestments is a first step toward reducing the size of the balance sheet and returning its\ncomposition to primarily Treasury securities over time – a welcome acknowledgment that the economy\nand policy are transitioning back to normal.\n\nFed Structure, Monetary Policy Independence, and Accountability\nI have already mentioned two important pieces of monetary policy communication, namely, the FOMC’s\npost-meeting statement and the Chair’s press briefing. But before I go any further, it will help if I provide\na little information about the structure of the institution responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy.\n\nCongress established the Fed in 1913 to operate in the public interest to promote the health of the U.S.\neconomy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed as a decentralized central bank, independent\nwithin the government but not independent from the government. The Fed’s design balances publicsector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country – including\none right here in Richmond. The Reserve Banks are overseen by a seven-member Board of Governors in\n\n1\n\nSee, “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” FOMC, September 17, 2014, and the FOMC post-meeting\nstatement of March 15, 2017.\n\n\f5\nWashington, D.C. 2 I believe the regional structure of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for\nmore than 100 years. This design allows monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of\nthe American economy and its people. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe\nthe history of the Fed has shown that better policy decisions are made when diverse information and\nviews are considered. The Fed’s structure also helps us to carry out our other responsibilities. These\ninclude supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions, promoting the\nstability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the nation’s payments system,\nproviding certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying effective community\ndevelopment policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe FOMC comprises the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed,\nand four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. As president of the Cleveland\nFed, I vote every other year, as does the Chicago Fed’s president. The other presidents vote every third\nyear. I note, though, that all Reserve Bank presidents, whether voting members at the moment or not,\nparticipate in FOMC meetings. Thus, by design, the discussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of\neconomic information and analysis from all parts of the country. When I attend FOMC meetings, I make\nit a point to bring the economic information the Cleveland Fed staff and I have garnered from business,\nconsumer, and labor contacts throughout the Fourth District, which comprises the state of Ohio, western\nPennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. This regional information,\nalong with economic and financial data and analysis, plays an important part in the FOMC’s setting of\nnational monetary policy in pursuit of our goals of maximum employment and price stability, which were\ngiven to us by Congress.\n\n2\n\nCurrently, there are two openings on the Board of Governors and there will be another when Governor Daniel\nTarullo steps down in early April.\n\n\f6\nWhile Congress has set the Fed’s goals, it has also wisely given the Fed independence in making\nmonetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. That is, monetary policy decisions do not have to be\napproved by the president or Congress. This is wise because a substantial body of research and actual\npractice indicate that when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run political\ninterference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nIndependence in setting monetary policy is worth preserving because it yields more effective policy. But\naccountability must go hand in hand with independence. A central bank cannot expect to remain\nindependent from the political process unless it is transparent about the rationale for its policy decisions.\nIt takes some time for monetary policy to affect the economy, so the public won’t be able to immediately\nsee whether a policy action was a good one. So it is incumbent upon policymakers to explain their\ndecisions, including their assessment of economic conditions, as well as their outlook for the economy.\nIn other words, clear communications play a crucial role in monetary policymaking.\n\nThe Benefits of Clear Communications in Monetary Policymaking\nClear communications can make monetary policy more effective by helping households and businesses\nmake better economic and financial decisions. When policymakers are clear about the goals of monetary\npolicy and the economic information that is important in their forecasts and policy decisions, and set\npolicy in a systematic way, the public will have a better idea of how monetary policy is likely to change\nas economic conditions evolve. They will have a better sense of how policy will react not only to\nanticipated changes in conditions but also to unanticipated economic developments. Such knowledge\nhelps households and firms make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions.\n\nAchieving clearer monetary policy communications is better viewed as a journey rather than as a\ndestination. Indeed, over the past two decades, the Fed has taken several steps on this journey to become\nmore transparent, as the benefits of transparency have become better appreciated. It might surprise you to\n\n\f7\nknow that it wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to explicitly announce changes in its fed funds rate\ntarget and later added more description about the state of the economy and the rationale for its decisions.\nBefore 1994, there was no post-meeting FOMC statement; the public had to infer what the FOMC\ndecided by looking at how it implemented policy through its open market operations in financial markets.\nNow, the post-meeting statement describes the FOMC’s view of the state of the economy and the\nrationale for its decisions, as well as the votes of individual members and the preferred policy choices of\nany dissenters. Further context for the decisions is provided in the meeting minutes, which are released\nby the FOMC three weeks after the meeting, and a full transcript is released with a five-year lag. Outside\nof the blackout period around FOMC meetings, many of the FOMC participants present speeches – like\nthis one – in which they share their perspectives on the economy and monetary policy with the public. In\nfact, as a Reserve Bank president, I view myself as a public servant and believe one of my duties is to\nexplain the rationale for my decisions to the public.\n\nIn addition to speeches, the Chair testifies before subcommittees of both houses of Congress at two\nregularly scheduled monetary policy hearings a year, and at additional hearings when asked. And the\nChair holds press briefings after four FOMC meetings per year. These briefings, which started in 2011,\nallow the Chair to expand on things that are too complex to discuss in the FOMC’s relatively short postmeeting statement. The four meetings followed by press briefings are also ones at which the FOMC\nreleases its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP. I would like to spend the balance of my talk\ndiscussing the role of these projections in monetary policy communications and a recent enhancement the\nFOMC made to the SEP.\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections\nThe Summary of Economic Projections, released four times a year, provides information on individual\nparticipants’ economic projections, conditional on the path of policy that each participant sees as\nappropriate to promoting the FOMC’s goals of price stability and maximum employment. It is worth\n\n\f8\nnoting that unlike private-sector forecasts, the SEP policy path projections are not policy forecasts, but\nrather the individual participants’ view of what constitutes appropriate policy. The projected economic\nvariables included in the SEP are real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation,\nthat is, inflation excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, with appropriate policy\ngiven by the federal funds rate. The projections are for the current year and for up to three additional\nyears, and also include the participants’ estimates of the longer-run values for these variables.\n\nI believe the SEP is an important part of monetary policy communications. Because monetary policy\naffects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking, and the SEP provides the public\nwith a sense of where FOMC participants see the economy evolving and the associated policy path\nconsistent with that outlook.\n\nOf course, it is important to put the FOMC’s projections into proper context. The economy can evolve in\nunexpected ways. The FOMC is not prescient, nor should we expect it to be. At the end of the year, the\nmedia often writes a story on how the economy actually fared compared to what the FOMC was\nprojecting at the start of the year, and when the misses are large, more than one story is written. For\nexample, according to the central tendency of the projections, at the start of 2012, FOMC participants\nexpected real GDP growth for the year to be 2.2 to 2.7 percent. It turns out that the economy grew at only\na 1.3 percent pace that year, a forecast miss of around 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points. On the other hand,\nparticipants underestimated the improvement seen in the unemployment rate in 2012. At the start of the\nyear, they projected an unemployment rate of 8.2 to 8.5 percent by the fourth quarter, but the\nunemployment rate ended up lower, at 7.8 percent. The FOMC also was more optimistic about growth at\nthe start of 2015 than what came to pass, and inflation ran below projections over 2013-2015.\n\nThe public has to hold the FOMC accountable for its performance, but it should not hold monetary\npolicymakers to an unrealistic standard. To evaluate the performance of FOMC projections, it is\n\n\f9\nimportant to put these forecast misses into context by remembering that even though forecast errors of\nthis magnitude, both above and below actual outcomes, may seem large, they are the norm among\neconomic forecasters, not the exception. 3 Forecasting is a difficult task. The economy is constantly\nbeing buffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated.\nMoreover, our view of current economic conditions can be cloudy because many economic data are\nrevised over time. Data revisions complicate forecasting and setting monetary policy in real time.\nUniversity of Richmond’s Dean Croushore is at the forefront of economic research into how forecasters\nand policymakers should incorporate data revisions into their work. Another reason forecasting is\ndifficult is what economists call “model uncertainty”: it isn’t clear which model will best predict the\nfuture path of the economy at any given time. One way to approach this model uncertainty is to average\nacross various models to develop a forecast. From a practical policymaking standpoint, I find that\nlooking at forecasts from several models gives me a better sense not only of the most likely forecast but\nalso the risks around the forecast. It is important to keep in mind that around any economic forecast there\nis typically quite a lot of uncertainty.\n\nTo illustrate the level of uncertainty around its projections, the FOMC will now be providing charts\nshowing confidence bands, so-called fan charts, around the median projections, something I have\nadvocated for quite some time. 4 The future is inherently uncertain, and the confidence bands will give the\n\n3\n\nIt is also worth remembering that the FOMC projections are conditional on what each participant views as the\nappropriate policy path and not necessarily what the participant views as the most likely policy path. For a clear and\nvery useful explanation of what the FOMC projections are and are not, see Ben S. Bernanke, “Federal Reserve\nEconomic Projections: What Are They Good For?” Brookings Institution blog post, November 28, 2016.\n4\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Forward Guidance in Extraordinary Times, in Normal Times, and Betwixt the Two,”\nremarks at the Money Marketeers of New York University, Inc., New York, NY, November 6, 2014; Loretta J.\nMester, “Forward Guidance and Communications in U.S. Monetary Policy,” Imperial College, London, U.K.,\nNovember 20, 2014; Loretta J. Mester, “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy Communications,”\nNational Association for Business Economics 2015 Economic Policy Conference, Washington, D.C., March 9,\n2015; Loretta J.

Mester, “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” Shadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting,\nNew York, NY, October 7, 2016; Loretta J.

The confidence bands are also a helpful reminder to policymakers to remain humble about\nour ability to know the future with much certainty.\n\nFigures 1 to 4 show 70 percent confidence intervals (in light blue and teal) around the median projections\nfrom the FOMC’s March SEP. If the level of uncertainty is similar to that experienced in the past and the\nupside and downside risks around the forecast are broadly balanced, then there’s a 70 percent probability\nthat the actual outcomes will lie within the band. For example, for real GDP growth, a 70 percent\nconfidence interval around the forecast is about ±1.6 percentage points for this year and a little over ±2.0\npercentage points for each of the following two years. The intervals tend to fan out over time because\nthere is increasingly more opportunity for unforeseen shocks to occur. The miss of the FOMC’s early\n2012 forecast that I referred to earlier was within the interval. The confidence bands around forecasts of\nunemployment and inflation are also pretty wide. So the FOMC’s forecast performance has been quite\nreasonable by this metric.\n\nThe policy path in the SEP receives considerable scrutiny. In March, there was essentially no change in\nthe median policy path compared to December because there was little change in the economic outlook.\nThe median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the\nend of next year, and 3 percent at the end of 2019, which is its median longer-run value. The SEP\nindicates that most participants expect that an upward path of policy will be appropriate based on their\ncurrent assessment of the outlook.\n\nThe federal funds rate path differs from the other variables in the SEP because policymakers choose the\npath. But because there is uncertainty around the economic outlook, there is also uncertainty around the\nappropriate policy path. The confidence band is a reminder that the median policy path in the SEP is not\nmeant to be a firm commitment on the part of the FOMC. Instead, policy should be expected to respond\n\n\f11\nto changes in economic and financial conditions that materially affect the medium-run outlook. As you\ncan see, the range of reasonable outcomes for the policy path is actually quite wide, and considerably\nwider than some of the variation we’ve seen in the SEP policy path over time, even though those small\nshifts have often drawn considerable media attention. The dispersion in forecasts across participants also\nreceives attention, but as you can see in the figures, that dispersion – shown in dark blue for the economic\nvariables and in the famous dot plot for the fed funds rate – is quite a bit narrower than the degree of\nuncertainty around the forecasts.\n\nConclusion\nThe addition of fan charts to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections is the most recent step the\nCommittee has taken on its journey of increased transparency and better communication. The FOMC will\ncontinue to strive for further improvements because when the public has a better understanding of how\nmonetary policy decisions are made, the policy itself is more effective, and the public will have the\ninformation it needs to hold us accountable for our decisions. This accountability provides a crucial\nfoundation for allowing monetary policymakers to pursue the congressionally mandated goals of price\nstability and maximum employment free from short-run political considerations. This independence of\nmonetary policy decisions results in better economic outcomes. Because our policy decisions depend on\nthe economic outlook, it is important for the FOMC to provide as much information as we can on our\ncurrent assessment of the outlook, at the same time explaining that the forecast can change because\neconomic conditions can evolve differently than expected.\n\nLet me conclude with something former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan once said about monetary policy:\n“Because monetary policy works with a lag, we need to be forward looking, taking actions to forestall\nimbalances that may not be visible for many months. There is no alternative to basing actions on\nforecasts, at least implicitly. It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is\nevident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the\n\n\f12\nunderlying forces acting on the economy shift. This process is not easy to get right at all times, and it is\noften difficult to convey to the American people, whose support is essential to our mission.” 5 Alan\nGreenspan made these remarks more than 20 years ago, yet they strike me as just as relevant today as they\nwere then.\n\n5\n\nAlan Greenspan, “The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society,” remarks at the Annual Dinner and\nFrancis Boyer Lecture of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, Washington D.C., December\n5, 1996.\n\n\f13\n\n\f14\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nSingapore\nFebruary 20, 2017\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Michael Drury and the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak in their Central\nBanking Series. I have had the opportunity to attend many GIC programs over the years and I have\nalways walked away with new insights into the global economy and financial markets. I have also been\nhonored to speak at two earlier GIC events. I’m hoping that when the organizers invited me to be on\ntoday’s program they weren’t thinking, “the third time’s the charm”! For my part, I feel privileged to\nshare some of my views and I thank our local hosts in Singapore for providing such a beautiful setting in\nwhich to do it.\n\nRather than provide a standard economic outlook talk, I’d like to speak about a challenge that monetary\npolicymakers face in the aftermath of the financial crisis and Great Recession. That challenge is\nmanaging expectations. When we think about expectations in the context of monetary policy, we usually\nmean expectations about inflation or expectations about the future path of policy. But today, what I mean\nis managing expectations about the role monetary policy can play in promoting a healthy economy.\nWhile I’ll focus on the Federal Reserve, I believe a similar challenge applies to central bankers around the\nworld. Of course, the remarks I’ll provide are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nA decade has passed since the onset of the global financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession. The\nU.S. economy has emerged from those dark days; it is now on sound footing. But it took a set of\nextraordinary actions outside the realm of normal monetary policy to get us back to this point. Because of\nthe pain they caused, the global financial crisis and Great Recession rightly shined a bright light on the\nrole of central banks. People who had never heard of the Federal Reserve before the crisis now hold\nstrong opinions. There has been a healthy debate about the role monetary policy might have played in the\nrun-up to the crisis, the effect of near-zero interest rates on the economy and financial markets, and the\nefficacy of the nontraditional tools used to address the Great Recession, including purchases of mortgagebacked securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\n\f2\n\nSome critics of the Fed believe that monetary policy was excessively accommodative and a key driver of\nconditions that led to the crisis, while other critics believe that the economy could have emerged much\nmore quickly from the deep recession had monetary policy reacted differently. On the other side, there\nare fans of the Fed who believe that the nontraditional actions taken by central banks were very successful\n– so successful that policymakers should consider expanding the use of monetary policy beyond its\ntypical purview.\n\nIn my view, both sides represent exaggerated expectations of what monetary policy can achieve. And this\ndistorted view is troubling because it makes it harder for the public to understand the rationale for\npolicymakers’ decisions and to evaluate their performance. It is no secret that there are several legislative\nproposals to change the way the Fed pursues its congressionally mandated monetary policy goals. Some\nproposals seek to restrict the Fed’s ability to pursue these goals in a way that is insulated from short-run\npolitical influence. This restriction on monetary policy’s independence would be a significant loss for the\nnation because, as a substantial body of research and actual practice indicate, when a central bank\nformulates monetary policy free from short-run political interference and is held accountable for its\ndecisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nAccountability must go hand in hand with independence. That’s why I believe it is time to recalibrate\nexpectations of what monetary policy can achieve. The public needs to know what it can reasonably hold\nmonetary policymakers accountable for. Indeed, even those who set policy would benefit if we kept in\nmind the serenity prayer: give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change\nthe things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nFor the rest of my talk, I’ll elaborate on what this serenity prayer means for four aspects of monetary\npolicy: how monetary policy should address business cycle fluctuations; monetary policy and long-run\n\n\f3\ngrowth; monetary policy vis-à-vis fiscal policy; and monetary policymakers’ projections of the economy\nand future path of policy.\n\nMonetary Policy and Business Cycle Fluctuations\nAt times during the recovery, the public discussion seemed to suggest that by setting interest rates\nappropriately, monetary policymakers could offset the deep shock that afflicted the economy and speed\nup the recovery. But this view ignores lessons from modern economic theory and historical experience.\nWhen a shock hits the economy, it takes some time for businesses to adjust their prices and for\nhouseholds to adjust their behavior. This delay allows monetary policy to affect the real side of the\neconomy – output growth and employment – providing a bit of a cushion against the shock. However, it\nis a temporary effect that lasts only until prices adjust and the shock dissipates. We don’t know the exact\ntiming and magnitude of that impact; moreover, we can’t predict with much precision the future shocks\nthat will hit the economy. So attempting to fine-tune monetary policy to counteract the effects of a\nvariety of temporary current and future shocks, some negative and some positive, is likely to lead to less\neconomic stability rather than more.\n\nIn addition, not all shocks are transitory. Well-known research by Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart\ndocuments that recessions associated with financial crises tend to be deeper and more prolonged than\nother types of recessions. 1 The loss in output after financial crises is usually not fully recovered. 2 In the\ncase of the Great Recession, the housing crash required a large shift of resources out of that sector, and\nsome Cleveland Fed research indicates that it typically takes the economy a long time to recover after a\nhousing bust. 3 In other words, some part of the shock that caused the Great Recession was likely\n\n1\n\nSee Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,\nPrinceton: Princeton University Press, 2009.\n2\n\nSee Valerie Cerra and Sweta Chaman Saxena, “Growth Dynamics: The Myth of Economic Recovery,” American\nEconomic Review 98, March 2008, pp. 439–457.\n\n3\n\nSee Michael D. Bordo and Joseph G. Haubrich, “Deep Recessions, Fast Recoveries, and Financial Crises: Evidence from\nthe American Record,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper 12-14, June 2012, and Greg Howard, Robert\n\n\f4\npermanent or very persistent rather than the type of transitory shock monetary policy might temporarily\ncushion. Given the size of the shock, it took a long time for the economy to adjust. Monetary policy\ncould not be expected to make up for that permanent loss.\n\nThat said, this doesn’t mean that monetary policy should be unresponsive to changes in economic\nconditions. Monetary policy can ease the transitions the economy has to make after shocks hit by\nresponding in a way that fosters monetary policy’s longer-run goals, which for the Fed are price stability\nand maximum employment. 4 This means policy will vary over the business cycle as economic conditions\nchange. For example, suppose there is a negative shock to aggregate demand. Firms will begin to cut\ntheir supply and reduce investment and employment. As output and employment fall, and demand and\nsupply rebalance, the market level of interest rates will also fall. So long as inflation is near target,\nmonetary policymakers would want to accommodate that fall in the market rate by reducing the shortterm policy rate, supporting the economy’s return to equilibrium. If policymakers didn’t reduce the\npolicy rate, prices would have to fall further and this would lead to disinflationary pressures, which is\ncounter to promoting price stability.\n\nOr consider a positive shock to productivity growth. In this case, firms would respond by increasing\noutput and investment, and this would lead to a higher equilibrium interest rate in the economy. So long\nas inflation was near target, the central bank would want to raise its policy rate as the market interest rate\nrose. A failure to do so would allow inflationary pressures to build. In both of these cases, monetary\npolicy isn’t attempting to totally offset the shock. Instead, to foster price stability and maximum\nemployment over the longer run, policymakers are moving the short-run policy rate consistent with\nchanges in the equilibrium interest rate as the economy adjusts to shocks. Notice that in this view, the\n\nMartin, and Beth Anne Wilson, “Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises Really So Different?” Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers 1037, November 2011.\n4\n\nIn the remainder of my talk, when referring to monetary policy’s longer-run goals, I will use the Fed’s goals of\nprice stability and maximum employment. But my points apply to other central banks whose goals may be price\nstability alone, or are hierarchical, putting price stability before other goals.\n\n\f5\nmaximum employment benchmark for evaluating the performance of monetary policy isn’t static; it\ndepends on the types of shocks that hit the economy and the time it will take for the economy to adjust.\nIn terms of our serenity prayer, it’s important to have the serenity to know there will be shocks to the\neconomy that monetary policy should not attempt to offset, and the courage, instead, to set policy to\npromote the longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nMonetary Policy and Long-Run Growth\nMy second topic is long-run growth. The recent discussion among economists and others about long-run\ngrowth has led some people to overestimate what monetary policy can achieve. A long-standing\neconomic tenet is that while monetary policy can affect real growth in the short run, it cannot affect the\neconomy’s long-run growth rate. Unfortunately, this distinction between short-run and long-run effects\nhas become somewhat muddled.\n\nSo let’s take a step back and consider the drivers of long-run growth. The amount of goods and services\nan economy can produce depends on the amount of capital and labor it has – its inputs – and on how\nproductively it can combine those inputs to create output. For the economy to grow, there needs to be an\nincrease in labor or capital or an increase in productivity, or both. Labor force growth is largely\ndetermined by demographic factors like the birth rate, age distribution, and immigration. Labor force\ngrowth, along with labor force skills and the economy’s infrastructure and institutional arrangements,\nsuch as the rule of law and well-developed financial markets, can all affect the quantity and quality of\ninputs and therefore the level of output a country can produce over the longer run. But sustained\nincreases in output, that is, long-run economic growth, and increasing standards of living are determined\nby productivity growth. And productivity growth depends on factors like investment in human and\nphysical capital and R&D that yields innovative products and processes. 5\n5\n\nIn the elegant and seminal neoclassical growth model developed by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan, a higher\nsavings rate will lead to higher investment and higher income per capita in the long run, but this can’t happen\nindefinitely; eventually the economy reaches a new steady state. Only productivity growth can lead to an economy\nthat continues to grow. (See Robert M. Solow, “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth,” Quarterly\n\n\f6\n\nIt is these underlying fundamentals, and not monetary policy, that determine the economy’s long-run\ngrowth rate and sustainable unemployment rate. In economists’ terminology, in the long run, monetary\npolicy is said to be neutral with respect to the real side of the economy and to affect only the price level\nand inflation rate.\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which was adopted in 2012\nand reaffirmed each year since, recognizes this distinction. 6 It clearly says that “the inflation rate over the\nlonger run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify\na longer-run goal for inflation.” In contrast, “the maximum level of employment is largely determined by\nnonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may\nchange over time and may not be directly measurable.” It’s true that poor monetary policy can inhibit the\nability of the economy to achieve its long-run growth potential, but by promoting the longer-run goals of\nprice stability and maximum employment, monetary policy can contribute to the economy’s ability to\nreach its long-run growth rate, even though it cannot affect what that long-run rate is.\n\nWhile monetary policy can’t affect the economy’s long-run growth rate, it cannot ignore it either, because\nthe economy’s long-run equilibrium real rate of interest, that is, the rate consistent with stable prices and\nmaximum employment over the long run, is determined by the long-run growth of consumption and,\ntherefore, of output. A sizable shock to the economy can affect the potential growth rate, and monetary\n\nJournal of Economics 70, 1956, pp. 65–94, and Trevor W. Swan, “Economic Growth and Capital Accumulation,”\nThe Economic Record 32, 1956, pp. 334–361.) A further advance is the endogenous growth model, which seeks to\nexplain the source of productivity growth. In this model, there need not be diminishing marginal returns to capital if\nhuman capital increases with the stock of physical capital. But even if there are diminishing marginal returns, these\ncan be offset if increases in R&D lead to innovative products and processes. Thus, ongoing growth can be sustained\nby investments in human capital and new technology. (Two early contributions to the endogenous growth literature\nare Robert E. Lucas, Jr., “On the Mechanics of Economic Development,” Journal of Monetary Economics 22, July\n1988, pp. 3–42, and Paul Romer, “Increasing Returns and Long-Run Growth,” Journal of Political Economy 94,\nOctober 1986, pp. 1002–1037.)\n6\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted\neffective January 24, 2012; as amended January 31, 2017.\n\n\f7\npolicy will need to take that into account. The financial crisis and Great Recession affected not only\naggregate demand but also aggregate supply. Potential growth fell and, with it, so did the economy’s\nequilibrium interest rate. There is ongoing research into the mechanism through which large shocks\nmight affect potential growth. Regardless of the mechanism, the fact that potential growth fell had\nimplications for monetary policy. The Fed’s policy rate has been lower than what it would have been had\nthere been no change in the equilibrium rate. The lower equilibrium rate is reflected in the FOMC’s\neconomic projections. For example, in January 2012, the median level of the longer-run fed funds rate\nwas 4-1/4 percent. In the most recent projections, in December 2016, that level is 3 percent.\n\nAn easy way to see the effect of lower equilibrium interest rates is to look at simple monetary policy rules\nthat are often used to assess the degree of monetary accommodation. I don’t believe that monetary policy\nshould be set mechanically using a single policy rule; no rule works well enough across a variety of\neconomic models and in a variety of economic circumstances. But I do find it useful to look at the\noutcomes of an array of simple, robust monetary policy rules as a gauge. You can find updates for a set\nof seven rules and their outcomes across several forecasts on the Cleveland Fed’s website. 7 The\nequilibrium interest rate is a parameter in most of these rules, and when it falls, so does the policy\noutcome from these rules, indicating that policy should respond to changes in these fundamental aspects\nof the economy.\n\nBut this is different from trying to actively use monetary policy to affect the longer-run growth rate of the\neconomy or the longer-run unemployment rate. As Chair Janet Yellen said in her press briefing after the\nDecember FOMC meeting, this is not a strategy she has recommended, and rightly so. 8 I am very\ndoubtful that monetary policy could be targeted to spur a strong pickup in the types of investment in\nhuman capital and physical capital that would raise productivity growth. Monetary policy is a blunt\n7\n\nSee “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

Indeed, one of the conundrums has been the low productivity growth rates we’ve been\nexperiencing. Attempting to use monetary policy to spur productivity growth would be a risky\nexperiment, both in terms of our ability to achieve our longer-run goal of price stability and in terms of\nfinancial stability given the excessive accommodation such a strategy would require. So once again, we\nneed the serenity to accept that monetary policy cannot affect the economy’s long-run growth rate, and\nthe courage to keep monetary policy focused on what it is capable of achieving: price stability that\npromotes maximum employment.\n\nMonetary Policy vs. Fiscal Policy\nRather than monetary policy, other forms of economic policy are better suited to affecting the\nfundamentals that drive productivity growth and potential growth. Policies and programs that encourage\nhigher levels of investment in R&D and innovation, that help workers displaced from jobs because of\ntechnological change or globalization to transition to other jobs, and that spur investments in education to\nhelp people gain the skills needed in the modern economy all have the potential to raise productivity and\nlonger-run growth. Tax-code changes, immigration policy, and trade policy also have the potential to\naffect the economy’s longer-run growth rate, but whether in a positive or negative direction depends on\nthe particular changes that are made, how they are implemented, and how they are financed.\n\nGovernment spending and tax policies fall under the purview of fiscal policy, not monetary policy. The\ndistinction is important, yet it has become somewhat muddled in the aftermath of the crisis. During the\nfinancial crisis, the Federal Reserve established some special credit and liquidity programs that went\nbeyond traditional monetary policy. Some of these programs, like the term auction facility, which\nauctioned longer-term credit to depository institutions, were related to the Federal Reserve’s role as\nlender of last resort. Other lending programs targeted specific markets, like the commercial paper market.\nIn addition, to put downward pressure on longer-term yields and to support the housing market, the Fed\npurchased large volumes of housing agency debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.\n\n\f9\nThese purchases had the desired effect of adding accommodation once the traditional tool of policy, the\nfed funds rate, had reached its effective lower bound. But they also entailed the Fed’s allocating credit to\na particular sector, housing, something the Fed traditionally has not done.\n\nThese programs were necessary, but they did have some negative aspects. One was that they opened up\nthe Fed to requests to aid other industries or to use its balance sheet to fund government initiatives.\nDuring December 2008, as Congress debated a bailout for American automakers, several members of\nCongress requested of then-Chair Ben Bernanke that the Fed lend directly to auto companies. Needless to\nsay, the Fed was reluctant to go down this path, which would have put it squarely in the midst of\nindustrial policy, a responsibility of Congress. 9 More recently, the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Act,\nor FAST Act, tapped the Fed’s surplus account to pay for highways.\n\nTo avoid the erosion of monetary policy’s independence, it is important to bring monetary policymaking\nback to more normal footing. The Fed recognized this need from the very start of its use of nontraditional\ntools. For example, many of the special lending facilities were designed to be self-liquidating as creditmarket conditions improved. And the Fed clearly states in its policy normalization principles that it\nintends, in the longer run, to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy\nefficiently and effectively, and that the composition of assets will return to being primarily Treasury\nsecurities. 10 This will mean a smaller balance sheet than what we hold today, regardless of the longer-run\npolicy implementation framework the Fed ultimately adopts. 11 The return to primarily Treasuries will\ntake some time, but it will be welcome because it will minimize the effect of the Fed’s asset holdings on\nthe allocation of credit across sectors of the economy, and it may help guard against future calls for the\n\n9\n\nSee the discussion in Chapter 17 of Ben S.

We need the serenity to accept that monetary\npolicy and fiscal policy are distinct, and the courage to push against attempts to use monetary policy for\ngoals that fall under the purview of fiscal policy.\n\nFOMC Projections\nThe final topic I’d like to discuss is the FOMC’s projections of the economy and federal funds rate path.\nThe FOMC is not prescient, nor should we expect it to be. Four times a year, the FOMC provides a\nsummary of economic projections across FOMC participants, conditional on the path of policy that each\nparticipant sees as appropriate. The media focuses attention on changes in the projections over the year,\nand at the end of the year, stories are written about what actually came to pass compared to what the\nFOMC was projecting at the start of the year. For example, according to the central tendency of FOMC\nparticipants’ projections, at the start of 2012, real GDP growth for the year was expected to be 2.2 to 2.7\npercent. It turns out that the economy grew at only a 1.3 percent pace that year, a forecast miss of around\n1.0 to 1.5 percentage points. On the other hand, participants underestimated the improvement seen in the\nunemployment rate in 2012. At the start of the year, they projected an unemployment rate of 8.2 to 8.5\npercent by the fourth quarter, but unemployment ended up lower, at 7.8 percent. The FOMC also was\nmore optimistic about growth at the start of 2015 than what came to pass, and inflation ran below\nprojections over 2013–2015.\n\nThe public has to hold the FOMC accountable for its performance, but it should not hold monetary\npolicymakers to an unrealistic standard. To evaluate the performance of the FOMC’s projections, it is\nimportant to put these forecast misses into context by remembering that forecast errors of this magnitude,\nboth above and below actual outcomes, are the norm among economic forecasters, not the exception. 12\nForecasting is difficult because the economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks, data are revised over\n12\n\nIt is also worth remembering that the FOMC projections are conditional on what each participant views as the\nappropriate policy path and not necessarily what the participant views as the most likely policy path. For a clear and\nvery useful explanation of what the FOMC projections are and are not, see Ben S. Bernanke, “Federal Reserve\nEconomic Projections: What Are They Good For?” Brookings Institution blog post, November 28, 2016.\n\n\f11\ntime, and there is uncertainty about which model will best predict the future path of the economy at any\ngiven time. In its Summary of Economic Projections, the FOMC publishes a table of the average\nhistorical forecast errors across various private-sector and government forecasts.13 For real GDP growth,\na 70 percent confidence interval around the forecast one year out is about ±1-3/4 percentage points. The\nforecast the FOMC made in early 2012 was within the interval. The confidence bands around forecasts of\nunemployment and inflation one year out are also wide: about ±3/4 percentage point for the\nunemployment rate, and about ±1 percentage point for inflation. So the FOMC projection performance is\nquite reasonable by this metric.\n\nSimilar scrutiny has been applied to changes in the policy path that the FOMC includes in its projections.\nA small change in the path can generate many headlines. But we should expect the policy paths to be\nresponsive to changes in economic conditions and changes in fiscal and other government policies, to the\nextent that they change the outlook. Changes in appropriate policy that are based on sound monetary\npolicymaking principles and are systematically related to changes in underlying conditions that affect the\nmedium-run outlook provide useful information on the Fed’s reaction function, helping the public better\nanticipate how the Fed will change policy when economic conditions change.\n\nAs a way to convey some of the uncertainty around our future policy path and outlook, I have been an\nadvocate of the FOMC’s publishing confidence bands around its projections. 14 The Committee is\n\n13\n\nFor example, see p. 11 of the Summary of Economic Projections, included in the “Minutes of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee Meeting, December 13–14, 2016.”\n14\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Forward Guidance in Extraordinary Times, in Normal Times, and Betwixt the Two,”\nremarks at the Money Marketeers of New York University, Inc., New York, NY, November 6, 2014; Loretta J.\nMester, “Forward Guidance and Communications in U.S. Monetary Policy,” Imperial College, London, U.K.,\nNovember 20, 2014; Loretta J. Mester, “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy Communications,”\nNational Association for Business Economics 2015 Economic Policy Conference, Washington DC, March 9, 2015;\nLoretta J. Mester, “Recent Inflation Developments and Challenges for Research and Monetary Policymaking,” The\n47th Konstanz Seminar on Monetary Theory and Monetary Policy, Insel Reichenau, Germany, May 12, 2016;\nLoretta J. Mester, “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” Shadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting, New York, NY,\nOctober 7, 2016.\n\n\f12\ndiscussing it. 15 Confidence bands will help the public understand some of the risks around our\nprojections and remind them of the reasonable amount of variation to expect in outcomes relative to\nprojections. The bands will also illustrate that while the dispersion across FOMC participants’\nprojections of the policy path often gets a lot of attention, this dispersion is actually quite narrow\ncompared with the confidence bands. Finally, confidence bands will also be a helpful reminder to\npolicymakers themselves of the uncertainty we constantly live with. So, we all need the serenity to accept\nthat policymakers aren’t prescient and their forecasts will change over time, and the courage to hold\npolicymakers accountable for being principled and systematic in how they react to changes in economic\nconditions.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, I am a strong supporter of insulating monetary policy decisions from short-run political\nconsiderations. Accountability must go hand in hand with such independence. For the public to be able\nto hold policymakers accountable for their policy decisions, it must understand what it is appropriate to\nexpect from monetary policy. Today, I talked about four areas where expectations need some\nrecalibration: how monetary policy should address business cycle fluctuations; the relationship between\nmonetary policy and long-run growth; monetary policy vis-à-vis fiscal policy; and monetary\npolicymakers’ economic and policy path projections. The serenity prayer provides some guidance for\nthat recalibration: We need the serenity to accept the things that cannot be changed by monetary policy\n(and look for more appropriate solutions). We need the courage to change the things we can (by keeping\nmonetary policy focused on its longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment). And we\nneed the wisdom to know the difference.\n\n15\n\nSee “Minutes of the FOMC Meeting, January 26–27, 2016.”\n\n\f"
