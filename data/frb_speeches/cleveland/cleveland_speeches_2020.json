Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nFourth Annual Fintech Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\n(via videoconference)\nNovember 9, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the other organizers for inviting me to speak at the\nfourth annual Fintech Conference. I spent most of my career at the Philadelphia Fed, so it is always a\npleasure to participate in one of its events. Since the beginning of this conference series, the discussions\nhave consistently been very topical, and the agenda for the next two days does not disappoint on that\nscore. The conference will cover many of the hot issues confronting practitioners, academics, and\npolicymakers as financial system innovation proceeds at a rapid pace. Today I will discuss the\nimplications of digitalization for financial inclusion and some steps that need to be taken to ensure that\ndigitalization helps to foster inclusion rather than promote exclusion. The views I will present today are\nmy own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\nFinancial Inclusion Has Benefits\nIt is probably best to start off with a definition of financial inclusion, and the World Bank provides us\nwith a workable one: financial inclusion refers to individuals and businesses having access to useful and\naffordable financial products and services that meet their needs and that are delivered in a responsible and\nsustainable way. 1 Much of the literature measures financial inclusion as households’ and businesses’ use\nof formal financial services from banks or other traditional providers, so-called mainstream financial\nservices. With the entry of fintech providers, that definition is expanding because fintech financial\nservices are moving into the mainstream.\n\nThe World Bank’s Global Findex database provides data on how people in 140 economies access\naccounts, make payments, save, borrow, and manage risks. It includes data on formal and informal\nfinancial services and the use of financial technology to conduct financial transactions. 2 The data indicate\n\n1\n\nThe World Bank, Financial Inclusion, https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview.\n\n2\n\nWorld Bank (2017).\n\n\f2\nthat across the globe financial inclusion has risen. The share of adults with an account at a financial\ninstitution or through a mobile money service rose from 62 percent in 2014 to 69 percent in 2017.\nNonetheless, there is still a large portion of the population that does not have access to or use financial\nservices. As of 2017, an estimated 1.7 billion adults around the world are unbanked or underserved.\nWomen lag behind men; the poor lag behind the wealthy; and developing economies lag behind\ndeveloped economies in the shares having formal accounts.\n\nIn the U.S., the level of financial inclusion is high: 93 percent of adults have an account at a bank or other\ntype of financial institution or use a mobile money service. But disparities exist: there is a 13 percentage\npoint gap between those in the richest 60 percent of households and those in the poorest 40 percent.\nFederal Reserve data indicate that, compared to whites, Blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. are less likely to\nhave a bank account and more likely to rely on alternative financial services such as money orders and\ncheck cashing services. 3 And compared to small firms with white ownership, those with Black ownership\nwere half as likely to have obtained financing from a bank in the past five years, relying more on online\nlenders, which, according to the survey respondents, provide less satisfactory service. 4\n\nTo address these types of gaps, many countries have set financial inclusion as a formal target. 5 This is\nreasonable because numerous studies have documented the contribution of a well-functioning financial\nsystem and higher levels of financial inclusion to longer-run macroeconomic goals of output and\n\n3\n\nAccording to a 2020 supplement to the Board of Governors’ Survey of Economic Well-Being, 14 percent of Black\nadults and 10 percent of Hispanic adults do not have a bank account, compared to 3 percent of white households.\n(See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (May 2020), Table 11, p. 28.) Unbanked is defined as not\nhaving a checking, savings, or money market account. Underbanked is defined as having a checking, savings, or\nmoney market account but having used one of these alternative financial services: money order, check cashing\nservice, pawn shop loan, auto title loan, payday loan, paycheck advance, or tax refund advance.\nAccording to the Fed’s most recent Small Business Credit Survey of firms with 1 -499 employees, 46 percent of\nfirms with white ownership, 32 percent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 23 percent of firms with Black\nownership had obtained financing from a bank in the past five years; 19 percent of firms with white ownership, 22\npercent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 27 percent of firms with Black ownership had obtained financing\nfrom an online lender in the past five years. (See Federal Reserve System (2020), p. 9.)\n4\n\n5\n\nSahay, et al. (2015).\n\n\f3\nproductivity growth. 6 On the macro level, healthy financial markets and institutions allow for more\nefficient allocation of capital and better monitoring and broader diversification of risk, which can enable\nhigher levels of overall growth. At the micro level, access to savings and credit via financial\nintermediaries connects households and businesses to economic opportunities that would not be available\notherwise. A sound financial system can spur entrepreneurship and support the competitive forces that\ndrive productivity in the economy.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, the distributional impacts of finance are worth considering. A body of work\nhas shown that finance can expand economic opportunities for those at the bottom of the income and\nwealth distributions and does not merely benefit those at the top. 7 For example, access to credit allows\naccess to education, which can have profound effects on an individual’s economic well-being, and it also\nallows households to build wealth through homeownership, which remains the most significant asset on\nmany U.S. families’ balance sheets.\n\nDigitalization Is Transforming Financial Services\nDigitalization of financial services is transforming the industry and expanding the range of financial\nservice providers to include not only fintech lending and payments firms but also so-called bigtech firms,\nincluding technology, social media, search platform, and e-commerce companies. Consumer demand is\none factor driving the rise in these services. EMarketer estimates that in 2019, 1.9 billion people\nworldwide purchased goods online. 8 In 2020, despite the global pandemic, retail e-commerce sales are\nestimated to rise to over $3.9 trillion and yearly sales growth has been in the 15 to 25 percent range over\nthe past three years. 9 As the costs of computing have declined and the demand for new services that offer\n\n6\n\nLevine (2009).\n\n7\n\nLevine (2009) and Demirgüç-Kunt and Levine (2009).\n\n8\n\nSee United Nations (2020) and Lipsman (2019).\n\n9\n\nSee Lipsman (2019) and Cramer-Flood (2020).\n\n\f4\nspeed and convenience at a lower price has risen, new firms have entered the financial services space.\nAccording to the U.S. Treasury, from 2010 to the third quarter of 2017, more than 3,330 new technologybased firms serving the financial services industry have been founded. The global market capitalization\nof fintech firms grew to $22 billion in 2017, 13 times what it was in 2010. Lending by these firms\naccounts for over 36 percent of personal loans in the U.S., up from under 1 percent in 2010. New tools\nand techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, are now routinely being applied in\nfinance.\n\nDigitalization Has the Potential to Increase Financial Inclusion\nLike past financial innovations, digitalization holds the promise of increasing the efficiency, productivity,\nand inclusiveness of the financial sector, thereby increasing the economic welfare of households and\nbusinesses. For example, a wide body of research indicates that tools that increase a household’s savings\nbehavior can have a substantial impact on household welfare. 10 Digital tools that give households and\nsmall businesses across the income spectrum the ability to track and understand their spending and\nsavings patterns can improve their ability to manage their finances, allow them to avoid more costly\nsources of credit, and increase their savings rate. There is evidence, reflected in several countries’\nexperiences, that access to savings accounts not only increases savings but also results in households\nshifting more of their spending to education and to healthier food. 11 Digitalization also provides\ncustomers with tools to search for and compare financial services across various vendors to determine\nwhich is more likely to meet their specific needs.\n\nOn the credit side, digital lending platforms hold the potential for more objective credit decisions, helping\nto guard against personal prejudices influencing those decisions. Bigtech companies have access to large\namounts of data, for example, from e-commerce platforms or search engines. Models to assess credit risk\n\n10\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\n11\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\n\f5\nbased on these alternative data hold the potential to increase credit access for households and small firms\nthat do not necessarily have a long credit history, audited financial statements, or collateral, which are\ntraditionally used to underwrite and monitor credit risk. And there is some research to back this up. A\nstudy co-authored by Julapa Jagtiani, one of the organizers of this conference, found that consumer loans\nmade by LendingClub, a large fintech lending platform, reached areas with fewer bank branches and\nlower-income borrowers. 12 Research published by the Bank for International Settlements found that the\ninternal credit scoring model built by and applied to small merchant customers of Mercado Libre, a large\ne-commerce platform in Latin America now offering financial services, has outperformed (at least in the\nshort run) models based on credit bureau ratings and traditional borrower characteristics. 13 And Mercado\nLibre was able to provide credit to merchants who would have been assessed as high risk by the credit\nbureau.\n\nInnovations in payments services also hold the potential to increase inclusion. Across the globe there is a\nmove toward faster, cashless payment systems, which can lower costs and provide more secure\ntransactions than cash. Early evidence from several countries shows that the move to digital payments\nhas had a positive impact on the well-being of individuals by strengthening their ties to other financial\nservices. 14 There is also evidence that the use of digital systems by governments to make transfer\npayments to individuals can significantly reduce the cost of distribution and the amount of fraud. 15\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s FedNowSM service, which is currently being built, will be an around-the-clock\nservice whereby payments can be originated, cleared, and settled within seconds. 16 The service is\n\n12\n\nJagtiani and Lemieux (2018).\n\n13\n\nSee Bank for International Settlements (2019) and Frost, et al. (2019).\n\n14\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\n15\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\nMore information on FedNow is available on the Fed’s website at https://www.frbservices.org/financialservices/fednow/index.html.\n16\n\n\f6\nexpected to provide clear public benefits in the form of safety, efficiency, and accessibility of instant\npayments. By lowering the cost of making payments in a secure way, FedNow can help promote\nfinancial inclusion by drawing more people into the financial system. This service, coupled with a\ndirectory service with accurate information on where to route payments for final distribution to\nhouseholds and businesses, could also make distribution of government benefits more efficient and solve\nsome of the challenges the government faced when distributing pandemic relief payments earlier this\nyear.\n\nSteps Need to Be Taken So That Digitalization Lives Up to Its Potential\nWhile digitalization holds a lot of promise to bring more households and businesses into the financial\nsystem, there is no guarantee this will happen. Indeed, digitalization could create more exclusion and\nincrease disparities rather than close the gaps. But steps can be taken to help ensure that digitalization\nlives up to its potential. Let me discuss five of these.\n\nClose the digital divide\nFirst, the digital divide in the U.S. needs to close so that more people can take advantage of digital\nfinancial services. Among communities with a population of 100,000 or more, the city of Cleveland has\namong the lowest home broadband access in the nation. 17 Only about 69 percent of households have\nbroadband subscriptions compared to over 84 percent in the city of Philadelphia and over 86 percent for\nthe nation as a whole. In the meantime, mobile phone technology, which has wide distribution, could\nsignificantly improve financial system access for unbanked adults. 18\n\n17\n\nThe data are available in Table GCT2801, U.S. Census American Community Survey (2019). In the cit y of\nCleveland, 69.3 percent of households have a broadband internet subscription. Only Lakewood Township, Ocean\nCounty, N.J. has lower internet connectivity, at 58.9 percent. The number for the U.S. is 86.4 percent and the\nnumber for the city of Philadelphia is 84.2 percent.\n18\n\nWorld Bank data indicate that two-thirds of unbanked adults globally have a mobile phone. See Demirgüç-Kunt,\net al. (2018), p. 91.\n\n\f7\nImprove financial literacy\nSecond, steps must also be taken to improve the reach and the effectiveness of financial literacy\nprograms. Digitalization increases the number of financial services providers and the types of services\nbeing offered. But to take advantage of these, people need to be able to assess their value. One study of\n188 financial literacy programs indicated that they had not, on average, increased financial knowledge or\nresulted in better financial choices. But the research also suggested that programs that included simple\nrules-of-thumb were more effective.19 Businesses also have to understand the costs and benefits of credit\ncoming from a fintech firm versus a traditional banking relationship, which may prove to be more stable\nin an economic downturn. Increasing the ability of the consumers of financial services to evaluate new\nservices will help ensure that these products add value.\n\nBuild trust\nThird, in order to increase inclusion, steps must be taken to build trust between potential customers and\nthe financial services industry. One Federal Reserve analysis indicated that one reason people do not\nhave a transaction account is the lack of trust in financial institutions. 20 Effective consumer protection\nregulations encompassing all providers of financial services would give potential customers more\nconfidence to use the services. Trust also depends on providers of financial services adequately\nprotecting their customers’ accounts against cybersecurity breaches, fraud, and data leakage. With the\nchanges in technology and rapid expansion of available data, the methods for protecting the data will need\nto adapt. The traditional way of keeping data private, by taking away names or otherwise anonymizing it,\nno longer works in a world rich with multiple data sources that can be cross-referenced to de-anonymize\nthe data and reveal identities. 21 New methods have to be evaluated. An example is the technique used to\nachieve differential privacy by carefully adding some statistical noise to the data to maintain individual\n\n19\n\nKarlan, et al. (2016).\n\n20\n\nHogarth, et al. (2004), as cited in Raskin (2011).\n\nKearns and Roth (2020) discuss how then-Massachusetts governor William Weld’s medical record was identified\nby combining the anonymized medical records released by the state with voter registration data.\n21\n\n\f8\nprivacy while maintaining statistical accuracy. 22 The U.S. Census Bureau plans to apply differential\nprivacy techniques to the statistics released as part of the 2020 census. 23\n\nTest the algorithms before deployment\nFourth, it must be recognized that just because it is an algorithm does not mean it is immune from\nproducing discriminatory underwriting and pricing decisions. Algorithms should be tested for bias before\nthey are deployed. Credit and pricing models produced by algorithms through machine learning are\nnecessarily complex because they are designed to reveal relationships in the data that are not revealed by\nstandard modeling. But their opacity and complexity – their black-box quality – make it more difficult to\nidentify these relationships and more difficult to uncover statistical discrimination or disparate impact and\nto enforce fair lending laws. 24\n\nWell-meaning algorithms can have unintended effects. Algorithms are trained on past data that may have\nreflected biased decisions or may not be representative of the entire population. With more pieces of data\navailable, there is more risk that data correlated with race or gender could be used in discriminatory ways.\nThis means machine learning algorithms could exacerbate disparities by reinforcing past decisions.\nKearns and Roth point out the need for what they call ethical algorithms, which are built to balance the\naccuracy of the model, for, say, assessing credit risk, with other desirable goals. 25 For example, the\ndeveloper could build the algorithm so that it has low error rates in identifying creditworthy borrowers\nand the error rate for one racial group is not disproportionately higher than that for another.\n\nAt present, much of the auditing of algorithms occurs in an ad hoc way after the algorithm has been put\n22\n\nDifferential privacy is achieved when no one, regardless of additional data, is able to determine better than\nrandom guessing whether any individual’s data were used to construct a data release. See Kearns and Roth (2020).\n23\n\nSee U.S. Census (2020).\n\n24\n\nMorse and Pence (2020) examine the ways in which technology may augment or deter discrimination in\nhousehold finance. See also Abuhamad (2019).\n25\n\nKearns and Roth (2019, 2020).\n\n\f9\ninto place and has had the opportunity to have a disparate impact. 26 A well-known example is the Apple\nCard: gender discrimination was alleged by some customers about the algorithms used by Goldman\nSachs, the issuer of the card, after the card was deployed. 27 Who should do the testing is an open\nquestion. A report from the Brookings Institution’s Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies\nInitiative recommends that the developer test the algorithm for disparate impact. Companies that use such\nalgorithms could engage independent third parties to evaluate them, with appropriate restrictions to guard\nthe firms’ intellectual property. Regulators may also have to play a larger role in testing algorithms.\n\nSince adequate data sets are needed for testing, the rules pertaining to data collections should be\nreviewed. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act restricts creditors from discriminating in credit transactions\nagainst credit applicants on any prohibited basis, including race and gender. The collection of data on\napplicants’ personal characteristics for home purchase and refinance loan transactions is required and the\ndata must be publicly disclosed. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires small business lenders to collect and\nreport race and gender data to federal regulators. But for other nonmortgage loans, creditors’ collection\nof these data is prohibited except for the creditors’ own use to conduct a limited self-test of their\ncompliance with the law. 28 The original prohibition was based on the notion that the data might be used\nin discriminatory ways. But experience with the collection of mortgage data suggests that this has not\nbeen the case and that the data have made it easier to monitor compliance and enforce the law. Extending\nmandatory data collection of personal characteristics for nonmortgage credit applicants may allow for\nbetter testing for compliance. But it would also entail costs for creditors that could partially be passed on\nto borrowers. With more entities offering credit, it is time to undertake a new review of the costs and\nbenefits of data collection for different types of nonmortgage credit.29\n\n26\n\nKleinberg (2018).\n\n27\n\nMacCarthy (2019).\n\n28\n\nData collected for such a self-test are not available to government agencies or credit applicants for use in\nexaminations or litigation. See Taylor (2011).\n29\n\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act does not address data collection. In 1995 and again in 1998, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System put out for public comment proposed amendments to Regulation B, which\n\n\f10\n\nRethink the regulatory framework\nFifth, a rethinking of the regulatory framework is needed to ensure that the financial innovations led by\ndigitalization are a net positive. Such innovations do not reduce the need for risk management, financial\nregulation and supervision, and good governance, although the form each takes is likely to be different\nthan what has been effective in the past. Existing regulatory and supervisory structures will need to adapt\nto keep up with the new ways that financial services are being delivered and the new players delivering\nthem. Under the principle, “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck,” a regulatory\napproach that shifts the focus from the type of institution offering the service to the type of activity would\nlikely be more effective in fostering the stability of the financial system and limiting regulatory arbitrage.\nThe extension of some regulations to new service providers is already occurring; for example, bigtech\nfirms’ payments services are subject to know your customer rules.\n\nBut the entry of fintech and bigtech providers of financial services also raises new issues. Data produced\nby bigtech firms are what make it attractive for these firms to enter into financial services in the first\nplace. But their ability to control the data also makes it harder for other firms to enter the market, thus\nlimiting competition. There are different approaches to regulating data usage in order to limit the market\npower of bigtech firm entrants and facilitate market contestability without stifling entry.30 Two examples\nare the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the open banking regulations, which\nare in place in many countries. Both approaches allow certain data to be shared directly with third parties\nbut place restrictions on the type of data and the kinds of authorizations that need to be garnered in order\nto allow for data sharing.\n\nimplements the ECOA, to eliminate the data ban and allow for voluntary collection of personal characteristics of\napplicants for nonmortgage credit. The final rules did not drop the ban. See Braunstein (2008), Government\nAccountability Office (2008), Taylor (2011), and Abuhamad (2019).\n30\n\nSee Frost, et al. (2009) for further discussion.\n\n\f11\nThe ability of bigtech firms to produce and to capture the benefits of big data depends on network effects.\nBenefits to users grow when there are more users of the services, and as the number of users increases,\nmore data are produced that can be garnered for use by the bigtech firm for the development of new\nservices, pricing, and marketing. For example, a firm that may have begun as an e-commerce firm may\nfind it beneficial to offer payment services as an adjunct to generate more e-commerce business, but the\ntransactions data can then be used to offer more services. 31 Once a bigtech firm is well established, it\nbecomes more difficult for other firms to enter. This adds concerns about market power to data privacy\nconcerns. Issues of pricing, cross-subsidization, product tying, and other anti-competitive practices that\nlead to less innovation, not more, deserve increased attention from financial services regulators.\n\nWith the entry of bigtech and fintech firms into financial services, the public policy approach will need to\nchange to include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data privacy\nregulation. There will need to be cooperation across these types of regulators within each country, and\nthis may entail creating structures that allow for more formal or systematic coordination across different\ntypes of regulators. The growth of digitalization also calls for a modernization of the antitrust laws and\npolicy, which is occurring in several countries. 32 The global nature of the bigtech firms entering financial\nservices means that effective international coordination among regulators and supervisors through the\nFinancial Stability Board and other international entities will be critical to ensuring that the benefits can\nbe captured and the risks managed. 33\n\nFinally, it is important that regulators and those responsible for enforcing fair lending and consumer\nprotections increase their expertise regarding the technologies being used in the marketplace. This is\n\nBank for International Settlements (2019) provides a nice description of network externalities in bigtech’s entry\ninto financial services.\n31\n\n32\n\nBank for International Settlements (2019) discusses some of the implications of bigtech for traditional competition\npolicy.\n33\n\nThe Financial Stability Board designated fintech as a key area of focus in its 2020 work program. See Financial\nStability Board (2019).\n\n\f12\nbeginning to happen as financial system regulators and supervisors are starting to use big data and data\nanalytics to improve their own assessments of banking and financial stability risks and to understand\ntrends in the industry more generally. Several countries have set up innovation hubs and regulatory\nsandboxes to encourage innovation in financial services. The Fed has been researching new technologies\nand innovations in financial services for some time. The System Payments Researchers, co-chaired by\nFumiko Hayashi of the Kansas City Fed and Bob Hunt of the Philadelphia Fed, are producing research on\nfintechs and digital currencies. The Board of Governors has set up a technology lab where researchers\nacross the System are building and testing a range of distributed ledger platforms to understand their\npotential benefits and tradeoffs. 34 The Boston Fed is working with the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology to experiment with digital currency technologies, and the New York Fed has established an\ninnovation center, in partnership with the Bank for International Settlements, to identify and develop indepth insights into critical trends and financial technology of relevance to central banks. 35\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, fintech, bigtech, algorithms, machine learning, and digitalization are rapidly transforming\nthe financial services industry.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nRemarks for the Session, “Monetary Policy Implications”\n6th Annual Monetary and Financial Policy Conference\nMoney Macro and Finance Society\nLondon, UK\n(via videoconference)\nOctober 21, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Paul Mizen and the Money Macro and Finance Society for the opportunity to speak at your 6th\nAnnual Conference. In my brief remarks today, I will give an overview of the changes to our monetary\npolicy strategy that the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the\nFederal Reserve, recently announced and discuss their implications for monetary policy going forward.\nAs always, the views I will present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRevised Statement on Long-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\nIn early 2019, the FOMC began a review of our framework for setting monetary policy – the strategy,\ntools, and communications we use in setting policy in pursuit of the monetary policy goals given to us by\nthe U.S. Congress. These goals are maximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term\ninterest rates. When prices are stable and the economy is at full employment, long-term interest rates are\ntypically at moderate levels. So it is often said that the U.S. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate\nof price stability and maximum employment. The framework review was informed by our experience\nduring and after the Great Recession, by economic theory and empirical analysis, and by consultations\nwith academic researchers and practitioners at research conferences. It was also informed by\nconversations with the public at large, through a series of Fed Listens events held across the country.1\nThe main conclusions of the review are captured in our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy, which the FOMC approved this August.\n\nThe framework review was undertaken in light of changes in the economic environment that have\nemerged since the FOMC’s first strategy statement was published in 2012. One change with important\nimplications for monetary policy is the decline in the U.S. and other advanced economies in the general\n1\n\nThe revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as well as other materials pertaining to\nthe review, is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategytools-and-communications.htm.\n\n\f2\nlevel of interest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline reflects several\nfactors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity\ngrowth. It means that the level of the federal funds rate, the policy rate in the U.S., consistent with\nmaximum employment and price stability is now lower than it has been in the past. This means that\nduring economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds rate will be constrained by its\neffective lower bound, and the FOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using its\ntraditional policy tool. This constraint, being understood by households, businesses, and financial\nmarkets, imparts a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations, and so increases the downside\nrisks to achieving our policy goals.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment with implications for monetary policy pertains to inflation\ndynamics. Resource slack in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with\nactual inflation than in the past, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation\noutcomes. This means it is even more important that inflation expectations remain well anchored at\nlevels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal. If expectations move below these levels, then it is\nmore likely that inflation will run below our goal, which would then result in even less policy space in a\nlow-interest-rate environment.\n\nThese changes in the economic environment warranted asking ourselves whether there were revisions to\nour monetary policy strategy that would make it more effective in promoting our policy goals. The\nreview led us to conclude that the answer was yes. And we made changes to our approach to both the\ninflation goal and the employment goal, which are summarized in our revised strategy statement.\n\nRevised Strategy Statement: Inflation Goal\nRegarding our approach to inflation, the first thing I want to note is something that did not change. The\nFOMC has reaffirmed the explicit inflation target first announced in 2012, namely, that a longer-run\n\n\f3\ninflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our statutory mandate. But our strategy statement is\nnow more explicit about how we will go about achieving this inflation goal. In particular, after periods in\nwhich inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we will likely aim to have inflation run\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. Doing so will help anchor inflation expectations , a main\ndeterminant of actual inflation, at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.\n\nThis new language is a stronger statement than we have made in the past as we have struggled to\neffectively convey that the longer-run goal of 2 percent should not be interpreted as a ceiling. In the past,\nmany of us on the FOMC have indicated that we would be comfortable with inflation running above 2\npercent for a time after it has run low for some time – a type of opportunistic reinflation. But now we are\ngoing to be deliberate rather than opportunistic. As the revised strategy indicates, after inflation has been\nrunning persistently below 2 percent, not only will we tolerate serendipitous shocks that move inflation\nabove 2 percent, but we will likely set policy with the intention of moving inflation moderately above 2\npercent for some time. The implication is that monetary policy will be somewhat more accommodative\nthan in the past when inflation has been running persistently low in order to reach our longer-run inflation\ngoal.\n\nRevised Strategy Statement: Employment Goal\nRegarding our employment goal, I view the changes we made in the strategy statement as an\nacknowledgment of the uncertainty around assessments of the level of maximum employment and a\nclarification to our approach to achieving this goal. This is consistent with something I have advocated\nfor some time: that policy communications should acknowledge uncertainty. 2 In the recent expansion, we\nsaw that employment growth could be stronger and the unemployment rate lower without generating\ninflation than one would have thought possible based on past decades of experience. Over the expansion,\nSee, e.g., Loretta J. Mester, “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” remarks at the Shadow Open Market Committee Fall\nMeeting, New York, NY, October 7, 2016. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp20161007-acknowledging-uncertainty.aspx)\n2\n\n\f4\nit took time to learn about these structural changes in the economy, and as the FOMC learned, its\nassessments of the longer-run unemployment rate came down significantly over time. Unfortunately, this\ntime-to-learn, combined with the previous strategy statement’s references to “deviations” of employment\nfrom maximum employment, has been misinterpreted by some as suggesting that the FOMC, at times,\ntakes deliberate policy action to bring employment down independently of our inflation goal. This is not\nthe case. The benefits of a strong labor market in fostering economic inclusion are clear.\n\nChanges in the economy underscore the difficulties in using the Phillips curve model to forecast inflation\nor to assess maximum employment in real time. The revised strategy statement clarifies that in the\nabsence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, strong employment is not a concern and\nmonetary policy will not react to it. This approach is consistent with the recent behavior of the FOMC.\nEstimates of simple monetary policy rules by the Cleveland Fed staff indicate that FOMC participants put\nless weight on the unemployment rate in determining the appropriate policy path in the last two years of\nthe most recent economic expansion than they did earlier in the expansion. 3\n\nAn Area for Further Work: Systematic Policymaking and Communications\nThe new strategy statement will guide FOMC monetary policy decisions both during and beyond the\npandemic. But bringing the new strategy to bear in our policymaking is a work in progress. So I will end\nmy remarks by discussing two areas for further work: first, systematic policymaking and\ncommunications, and second, the nexus between financial stability and monetary policy.\n\nSee Edward S. Knotek II, “Changing Policy Rule Parameters Implied by the Median SEP Paths,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland Economic Commentary Number 2019-06, April 15, 2019.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economiccommentaries/ec-201906-changing-policy-rule-parameters)\n3\n\n\f5\nOur September FOMC statement was the first to incorporate the new strategy.4 The statement indicated\nthat because inflation has been running persistently low, we will be aiming to achieve inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time and that we expect to maintain the current funds rate target\nrange of 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with our assessment\nof maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2\npercent for some time. As of September, the forecasts of FOMC participants, as indicated in the\nSummary of Economic Projections, showed that the majority thought it would not be appropriate to raise\nrates until after 2023. 5 However, importantly, the guidance is based on the state of the economy and not\non calendar dates. The economy could evolve so that the stipulated inflation and employment conditions\nare achieved earlier or later than currently projected, in which case, the anticipated policy path would\nappropriately adjust.\n\nI strongly believe that clear policy communications are an important part of effective monetary\npolicymaking. When the public has a better understanding of the goals and rationale for monetary policy\ndecisions, they are better able to hold policymakers accountable for their actions. Clear communication\nalso makes monetary policy itself more effective by providing the public with information about the\neconomic outlook and aligning the public’s expectations about future policy actions. When households,\nbusinesses, and investors have a better sense of how monetary policy is likely to change conditional on\nthe outlook, they can make better economic and financial decisions.\n\nEven though the September statement incorporated some aspects of the new strategy, Fed watchers and\nothers have asked for more context about what indicators the FOMC would be using to assess whether\nlabor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment, and how far above 2 percent would\nthe FOMC aim for inflation to be and for how long. While the context has changed, similar kinds of\n\n4\n\nThe September FOMC meeting statement is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916a.htm.\n5\n\nThe September Summary of Economic Projections is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200916ep.htm.\n\n\f6\nquestions about how the FOMC assessed whether or not its goals had been met were asked when we\noperated under the previous strategy as well. Work still needs to be done to ensure that our policy\ndecisions are systematically guided by our outlook and risks around the outlook and that our policy\ncommunications convey a good sense of the FOMC’s reaction function, especially now under the new\nstrategy.\n\nThe revised strategy leans heavily on the relationship between inflation expectations, inflation, and the\nability of monetary policy to influence both, but there is still much to learn about inflation dynamics and\ninflation expectations. The benefits of the move to a type of make-up strategy for inflation – that is,\nrunning policy to achieve inflation somewhat above 2 percent for a time after it has run persistently low –\ndepend on our ability to communicate that we have shifted to and will pursue this new strategy and our\nability to explain clearly how the new strategy differs from the old.\n\nRecent research from the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research suggests that we may have\nfurther to go on this score. Center researchers used the Cleveland Fed’s daily national survey of\nconsumers to examine the effect of Chair Jay Powell’s announcement of the new strategy on households’\nunderstanding of monetary policy and their expectations of inflation. 6 They obtained four interesting\nresults.\n\nFirst, while there was a surge in news coverage about monetary policy around the time of the Chair’s\nspeech, there was only a small increase in the number of respondents who reported having heard news\nabout monetary policy; most people did not recall anything.\n\nOlivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Edward S. Knotek II, and Raphael Schoenle, “Average Inflation Targeting\nand Household Expectations,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper 20-26, September 18, 2020.\n(https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202026)\n6\n\n\f7\nSecond, among the small group who had heard news, there was a sense that something had changed, but\nlittle recognition of what had changed in the approach to monetary policy.\n\nThird, there is considerable confusion about our goals: when presented with a list of options, more\nrespondents said that the Fed sets monetary policy with the aim of maintaining a strong dollar or keeping\ninterest rates low to reduce the government’s cost of borrowing than said we set policy to promote\nmaximum employment and price stability.\n\nFourth, when some individuals were selected at random and given information about average inflation\ntargeting, their expectations about future inflation over the next five years were no different than those of\nindividuals who were, instead, given information about traditional inflation targeting.\n\nOf course, it is important to remember that some of the gains from the new strategy will likely come from\nthe expectations and actions of sophisticated financial market participants who closely follow monetary\npolicy, thereby helping policy to transmit throughout the economy. It is also true that the survey was\ntaken over only a short period following the announcement, and as anyone who has ever taught or been a\nstudent knows, it takes time to master new material. Still, the results do suggest that more work needs to\nbe done on policy communications to ensure that households will understand the policy strategy and then\nincorporate it into their expectations and actions.\n\nAnother Area for Further Work: Financial Stability and Monetary Policy\nA second area that needs further work is understanding the nexus between monetary policy and financial\nstability. Our revised strategy statement explicitly acknowledges that sustainably achieving maximum\nemployment and price stability depends on a stable financial system. As part of its framework review, the\nFOMC considered the interactions between financial stability and monetary policy, particularly in the\n\n\f8\ncurrent environment of low neutral interest rates. 7 While monetary policy that leads to a stable\nmacroeconomy encourages financial stability, it is also possible that in an environment with low neutral\nrates, a persistently accommodative monetary policy could, in some cases, increase the vulnerabilities of\nthe financial system by encouraging higher levels of borrowing and financial leverage, increased\nvaluation pressures, and search-for-yield behavior. How best to approach the nexus between monetary\npolicy and financial stability in a low-interest-rate world deserves more consideration.\n\nAs indicated in the minutes of the January 2020 FOMC meeting, in discussing the framework, most\nFOMC participants agreed that supervisory, regulatory, and mac roprudential tools, including the\ncountercyclical capital buffer and stress tests, should be the primary way to address financial stability\nrisks rather than using monetary policy. But in the U.S., there are few countercyclical tools and they are\nnot designed to address vulnerabilities outside of the banking system. Therefore, there may be certain\ncircumstances where monetary policy may need to be adjusted in order to mitigate risks to financial\nstability. But when and how to do that needs further study. In addition, more study is needed of the\ntradeoffs and complementarities among our three sets of relevant polic ies: monetary policy,\nmacroprudential policy, and microprudential policy, which includes tools, such as capital and liquidity\nrequirements, that work throughout the business and financial cycles. As our framework review did with\nmonetary policy, the implications of a low-interest-rate world for both macroprudential policy and\nmicroprudential policy should be considered.\n\n7\n\nSee a summary of the discussion in the minutes to the January 2020 FOMC meeting at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200129.htm.\n\n\f"

Mester*\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGreater Cleveland Partnership Annual Meeting\n(videotaped October 6, 2020)\nOctober 14, 2020\n\n*\n\nThe views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fPage 1 of 4\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today. Let me start by congratulating Joe Roman on his upcoming\nretirement as president and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Partnership. Joe was one of the first civic\nleaders I met when I moved to Cleveland in 2014. From our very first conversation, it was clear that Joe\nwas passionate about Cleveland. Over his entire career, he has been a strong advocate for our region and\na strong adherent to the view that by working together, business, civic, and community leaders can get\nimportant things done. I am sure that Joe will show that same dedication and optimism in his new\nendeavors and I wish him well.\n\nWishing someone well has taken on new meaning this year. The coronavirus pandemic is a global public\nhealth crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all over the world. The pandemic was an\nunprecedented shock to the economy – the largest in most of our lifetimes.\n\nIn March, all but essential economic activity shut down when the country took aggressive social\ndistancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to\nincrease its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and\ntreatments.\n\n[FIGURE 1. Output and Employment through Q2] In the second quarter of the year, real output\ndeclined at a rate of about 31 percent measured on an annual basis. In just the two months of March and\nApril, payroll jobs dropped by 22 million. That is about the same number of jobs that the economy had\nadded over the entire recent expansion that lasted over 10 years. The unemployment rate, which had been\nat a fifty-year low of 3.5 percent in February, spiked to 14.7 percent in April. And despite supply\ndisruptions, inflation moved down with the drop in demand.\n\n\fPage 2 of 4\nIn May, as public health statistics began to improve, many parts of the country began to relax some of\ntheir stay-at-home restrictions, and the economy began to reopen. Activity, hiring, and inflation picked\nup – all good news. But there is quite a bit of difference across sectors.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive sectors, like housing and autos, have seen the sharpest rebounds. Other sectors,\nespecially service sectors like travel, hospitality, and leisure, are still very depressed.\n\n[Figure 2. Employment and Unemployment] September’s jobs report shows a continued pickup in\nhiring, although at a slower pace than in the summer. We have made up a little over half of the jobs lost\nin March and April as people returned to work from temporary furlough. But that still means we are\ndown almost 11 million jobs from February’s level. The unemployment rate fell to just under 8 percent\n(7.9 percent) in September, better than expected. But part of that drop reflects a drop in labor force\nparticipation, which remains well below February’s level.\n\n[Figure 3. Re-employment Rates by Income] It is clear that the adverse effects of the pandemic have\nnot been evenly distributed. They have been borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income\nand minority workers and communities; those who do not have the opportunity to work from home; those\nwho do not live in areas with reliable telecommunications and internet services or access to adequate\nhealthcare; and the smaller of small businesses.\n\nRehiring by employers has been slower for lower-income workers than for higher-income workers – at\nthe national level and in Cuyahoga county.\n\n[Figure 4. Progress on Unemployment by Race/Ethnicity and Educational Attainment] Over the\ncourse of the reopening, there has been less progress on reducing the unemployment rate for minorities\nthan for whites and for those with lower levels of education compared with those with higher levels .\n\n\fPage 3 of 4\n\nSo while the economy is recovering, it is still in a deep hole. Employment is about where it was in the\nmiddle of 2015 – so we’ve lost more than five years of job growth. Even if growth rebounds in the third\nquarter at the same pace at which it contracted in the second quarter, the level of output will be about\nwhere it was at the end of 2017, so the economy will have lost almost three years of output growth.\n\nBoth monetary policy and fiscal policy reacted swiftly and strongly to support the economy thus far. We\nhave in place very accommodative monetary policy: the fed funds rate is at its effective lower bound, we\nare purchasing Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, we have a number of liquidity and\nlending facilities in place to ensure that markets continue to function and that credit continues to flow to\nbusinesses and households, and we have temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements on\nbanks so they have greater capacity to lend.\n\nFiscal policy actions have included grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic,\nand states and municipalities; expanded unemployment benefits; and the Paycheck Protection Program,\nwhich offered loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their payrolls.\n\nIt will take some time to move from the somewhat fragile, disparate recovery we have now to a more\nsustainable, broader recovery. The path of the recovery is likely to be bumpy, with some fits and starts\nand uneven progress. It will take time for workers who have lost jobs to find new ones, either at another\nfirm in their current industry or in a new industry after they retrain. The commercial real estate mar ket\nhas been particularly hard hit. There was already a trend toward online shopping and remote work; the\npandemic has greatly accelerated that trend. The structural changes in the commercial real estate market\nwill take some time to sort out.\n\nProvided we continue to make progress on controlling the virus, activity and hiring will continue to\n\n\fPage 4 of 4\nexpand. By the end of this year, I expect that output will still be somewhat below its level at the end of\nlast year; that the unemployment rate will remain in the high single digits; and that inflation will be well\nbelow our longer-run 2 percent goal. The recovery should continue over the next couple of years\nprovided it is supported by very accommodative monetary policy and further fiscal policy actions . Fiscal\npolicy in the form of aid to households and small businesses most affected by the pandemic and to states\nand municipal governments, and increased investment in testing, contract tracing, treatment, and vaccine\ndevelopment would provide important support for the recovery.\n\nOf course, there is a lot of uncertainty around the forecast. It is highly dependent on the virus and our\nactions to control its spread. It is easy to think of downside scenarios. Many of our contacts in the\nregion, across all sectors, tell us that uncertainty about the course of the virus and about whether there is\ngoing to be additional fiscal support is clouding their outlook and holding back larger investments.\n\nBut there are upside scenarios as well. Development of a safe and effective vaccine that people have\nconfidence in and that can be widely distributed fairly quickly would be very positive for the outlook. In\naddition, we should not discount the fact that the pickup in activity we have seen so far has exceeded\nexpectations. It is a good reminder that we should never count out the resiliency of the U.S. economy and\nthe American people.\n\n\fCharts for\n“An Update on the Effects of the Pandemic\non the Economy”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nEconomic Equality Webinar\nAfrican American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania\nPittsburgh, PA\n(via videoconference)\nSeptember 28, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Doris Carson Williams and the members of the African American Chamber of Commerce of\nWestern Pennsylvania for the opportunity to speak with you today. As you may know, Doris is a member\nof the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. In the best of times, the valuable\ninsights provided by Doris, her fellow directors, and all of our contacts help us assess economic\nconditions and formulate monetary policy. But these are not the best of times. And I cannot overstate the\nimportance of the information that Doris and our other contacts are providing – real-time, on-the-ground\nreconnaissance on how businesses and households are faring during the evolving pandemic. While the\noutlook remains uncertain, one thing I am certain of is that we have a better understanding of the\neconomic impacts of the pandemic because of the public service of our directors and contacts. So, thank\nyou, Doris.\n\nIt is clear that the adverse effects of the pandemic have not been evenly distributed. They have been\nborne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority workers and communities;\nthose who do not have the opportunity to work from home; those who do not live in areas with reliable\ntelecommunications and internet services or access to adequate healthcare; and the smaller of small\nbusinesses. 1 Indeed, the results from a recent Fed survey show that between March and July, a larger\npercentage of low-income workers, less educated workers, and Black and Hispanic workers were laid off\ncompared to higher-income, more educated, and white workers. Rehiring by employers has been slower\nfor lower-income workers than for higher-income workers. 2 In addition, from February to April, the\n\nIn these remarks, I will use the term “race” to refer to race and ethnicity, and “Hispanic” to refer to Hispanic and\nLatinx.\n1\n\n2\n\nResults from the recently released Board of Governors survey on the economic well-being of households (Table 1,\np. 3 of Board of Governors, September 2020) show that between March and July, 28 percent of workers in families\nmaking less than $40,000 a year were laid off (including being told not to work any hours), considerably higher than\nthe 13 percent of workers from families with incomes over $100,000 a year. Furthermore, a quarter of workers in\nlow-income families who experienced a layoff reported that they had returned to work for the same employer, while\nnearly 40 percent of high-income workers did so. Twenty-three percent of workers with a high school diploma or\nless were laid off between March and July, compared to 13 percent of workers with a college degree or more, and 22\npercent of Black workers and 23 percent of Hispanic workers were laid off compared to 18 percent of white\nworkers.\n\n\f2\nnumber of active small business owners dropped by 3.3 million, a record 22 percent decline. 3 Compared\nto small firms overall, Black-owned businesses have been twice as likely to close and Hispanic-owned\nbusinesses have been one-and-a-half times as likely to close. It is distressing to see the disparate impact\nof the pandemic, but the differences in economic outcomes did not start with COVID-19. There were\nalready long-standing economic disparities in our economy.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will step back from the effects of the pandemic per se and examine the differences\nin economic opportunity that so many in America still experience at every phase of their lives. I will\nconclude with some thoughts, based on the research, on where we might focus in order to reduce these\ngaps and promote economic inclusion. As always, the views I will present are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nWhy Economic Inclusion Matters\nThe Federal Reserve System’s mission is to promote a healthy economy and stable financial system in the\nUnited States. Our monetary policy decisions, our actions as supervisors and regulators of banks, our role\nin the payments system, and our efforts to promote community development in low- and moderateincome areas all contribute to achieving a well-functioning economy and financial system in which\neveryone can participate. Opportunity and inclusion are important for achieving a strong economy, and\nthe recently announced revision to the Fed’s strategy for setting monetary policy explicitly states that we\nview maximum employment, one part of our statutory mandate, as a broad-based and inclusive goal.\n\nUnfortunately, today, the U.S. economy does not offer the same opportunities to all. There are racial\ndisparities in educational attainment, labor market outcomes, and access to credit. People born into areas\n3\n\nSee Fairlie (2020). Researchers at the New York Fed point to a number of contributing factors, including these\nfirms’ weaker financial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and funding gaps that existed prior to the pandemic,\nplus less access to federal relief funds . See Mills and Battisto (2020).\n\n\f3\nof concentrated poverty or predominantly minority areas are disadvantaged over their entire lifetimes, and\nso are their children. Unless actions are taken to promote an inclusive economy – one in which people\nhave the chance to move themselves and their families out of poverty, one in which systemic racism does\nnot limit opportunities, and one in which all people can fully participate – the U.S. economy will not be\nable to live up to its full potential and the country will suffer.\n\nUpward Mobility\n[Figure 1] All parents want to know that their children will be better off financially than they are. An\nimportant part of the American Dream is the idea that anyone can climb up the ladder through hard work\nand perseverance. But upward mobility – the probability that a child will be better off economically than\nhis or her parents – has fallen sharply in the U.S. since World War II. At last year’s Cleveland Fed Policy\nSummit, Harvard professor Raj Chetty presented some of his seminal research on income mobility. 4\nAround 90 percent of children born in 1940 earned more at age 30 than their parents did. 5 By the mid1980s, only about 50 percent did. And, although not shown in the figure, the largest declines have been\nin the middle class.\n\n[Figure 2] Many factors have contributed to this decline. One contributor is rising income inequality,\nwhich leads to advantages in terms of education and other social factors for those in the higher-income\ngroups compared to those in the bottom. Since the 1960s, the median level of income, adjusted for\ninflation, has risen over time, from about $48,000 in 1967 to about $69,000 in 2019. But those in the top\n10 percent of the income distribution have enjoyed sharper gains than those in the bottom 10 percent.\nThe U.S. has one of the lowest rates of intergenerational mobility among advanced economies and more\npronounced income inequality. 6\n\n4\n\nChetty and Williams (2019).\n\n5\n\nChetty, et al. (2017).\n\n6\n\nCorak (2013).\n\n\f4\n\n[Figure 3] To get the full picture, we need to look at disaggregated data. 7 Research by Chetty and his coauthors shows that upward mobility depends not only on the family’s characteristics but also on\nneighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, racial integration, the quality of schools, and\naccess to social services. 8 On this map, areas of relatively high intergenerational mobility are shown in\nshades of blue-green. Children who grew up in these places earn higher average income in their midthirties than their parents did at the same age. Shades of red indicate areas of low intergenerational\nmobility: places where children have not progressed very far in terms of income relative to their parents.\nAn important insight is that even areas with fairly good economies in terms of stronger output growth and\njob growth, like some places in the South, have not necessarily produced high levels of upward mobility\nfor the children growing up there. Strong economic factors certainly help, but they are not a panacea.\n\n[Figure 4] In Pittsburgh, mobility differs quite a bit across the city, and if you were to drill down even\nfurther, you would see differences even within neighborhoods.\n\nIn fact, research shows that moving a child from a low -mobility neighborhood to a high-mobility\nneighborhood can have profound effects on his or her future economic outcomes.9 This is true not only in\nthe U.S., but also in countries, like Australia, where income inequality is lower than it is here. 10\n\nSo place matters. But so does race. Research by Chetty and co-authors has found that there is a gap in\n\n7\n\nMaps showing income mobility at the zip code level for different levels of income, race, and gender are available\nat https://www.OpportunityAtlas.org, a collaboration between the U.S. Census Bureau and Opportunity Insights.\nThe map shown here is based on the average income at age 35 of a child whose parents earned in the 25 th percentile\nof the income distribution, in other words, in low-income families.\n8\n\nSee Chetty and Hendren (2018), Chetty, et al. (2018, revised 2020), and Chetty an d Williams (2019).\n\n9\n\nThe effect is found for children who move by the age of 13; it does not apply to adults. Each year of exposure to a\nbetter neighborhood has a greater benefit for the child. See Chetty, et al. (2018, revised 2020) and Chetty and\nHendren (2018).\n10\n\nOne study of Australia found that where a child grows up, especially in his or her teenage years, has a causal\neffect on adult outcomes. See Deutscher (2020).\n\n\f5\nearnings between Black males and white males even if their parents were at the same income level and\nthey grew up in the same neighborhood. 11\n\n[Figure 5] The research also shows that even conditional on where a child grows up, Blacks have a\nsignificantly lower chance of moving up in the income distribution than whites or Hispanics and a higher\nchance of moving down in the distribution. Strikingly, Blacks who happen to have been born to parents\nin the highest income quintile are almost as likely to move down to the lowest quintile as to stay in the\nhighest one.\n\nGaps in Income and Net Worth\n[Figure 6] According to the most recent Federal Reserve triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, in 2016,\nmedian income for white households was about 1-3/4 times that of Black families and 1-1/2 times that of\nHispanic families. 12 Earnings are an important driver of family net worth (financial and nonfinancial\nassets, like homes and autos, minus debt). 13 Racial gaps in net worth are much larger than income gaps:\nthe median net worth of white families in 2016 was almost 10 times as high as that of Black families and\nabout 8 times as high as that of Hispanic families. 14 These gaps are not a recent phenomenon: they have\nbeen around for decades.\n\n11\n\nControlling for parental income, in adulthood, Black males end up having lower earnings than white males in 99\npercent of Census tracts in the U.S. For those who grew up in neighborhoods of low poverty and higher rent, both\nBlack and white males have better outcomes, but the gap between them is greater than in high poverty areas. The\ngap is smaller when fathers are present and when measures of racial bias are lower. See Chetty, et al. (2020).\n12\n\nSee the Federal Reserve System 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) (2017). In 2016 dollars, the median\nincome in 2016 for white, Black, and Hispanic families were $61,000, $35,000, and $38,000, respectively .\n13\n14\n\nFor further discussion of racial net worth disparities over time, see Aliprantis, Carroll, and Young (2019).\n\nAccording to the SCF data, in 2016 dollars, the median net worth in 2016 of white, Black, and Hispanic families\nwere $171,000, $17,600, and $20,700, respectively.\n\n\f6\nGaps over the Life Cycle: Early Years\n[Figure 7] Many factors play a role in these gaps in income and net worth; in fact, if we look over a\nperson’s life, racial gaps exist every step of the way. From the beginning of life, Black children have only\nhalf the chance of reaching their first birthday compared to either white or Hispanic children. These gaps\nin infant mortality have existed over many years, and even if you control for the educational level of the\nmother, the gaps remain.\n\nBlack and white children tend to grow up in different neighborhoods, and this racial stratification leads to\nother risks that can affect longer-term economic outcomes. One example is children’s lead toxicity – the\namount of lead in one’s bloodstream – which at elevated levels causes brain damage and has significant\nadverse effects on a child’s ability to learn. A study of Chicago neighborhoods found that even though\nlead poisoning in children has fallen significantly over time as a result of public health policy, it is still\nthe case that those neighborhoods with the highest levels of toxicity are predominantly Black\nneighborhoods. 15\n\n[Figure 8] While lead poses one significant disadvantage to learning, lack of internet connectivity poses\nanother. Well before the coronavirus pandemic, access to the internet was an important avenue for\neducation, as well as for healthcare and job access. Usage of broadband at home is comparatively higher\nfor whites, those with higher incomes, and those in urban and suburban areas.16 Blacks and Hispanics are\nless likely to have a computer or broadband at home than whites, and when they do have a computer, they\nare less likely to have broadband service at home. 17 This puts Black and Hispanic families at a\n\n15\n\nSee Sampson and Winter (2016).\n\n16\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center survey data, in 2019, usage of broadband at home was 79 percent of whites, 66\npercent of Blacks, and 61 percent of Hispanics; 92 percent for those earning $75,000 or more per year and 56\npercent for those earning less than $30,000 per year; 75 percent for those in urban areas, 79 percent for those in\nsuburban areas, and 63 percent for those in rural communities. See Pew Research Center (2019).\n17\n\nEstimates for 2019 from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that about 2 percent of Asian households, 4 percent of\nwhite households, 4 percent of Hispanic households, and 7 percent of Black households do not have a computer at\nhome. About 95 percent of Asian households, 90 percent of white households, 88 percent of Hispanic households,\nand 84 percent of Black households have a computer and broadband at home. See U.S. Census Bureau, American\n\n\f7\ndisadvantage, especially now, given the pandemic, when remote in-home learning is the norm rather than\nthe exception.\n\n[Figure 9] In fact, during the spring, students in lower-income areas completed significantly fewer math\ncourses online than those in higher-income areas. 18 If these differences continue, there could be lasting\neffects on students’ earning potential throughout their lives, leading to further inequality.\n\nGaps over the Life Cycle: College Ages\n[Figure 10] Indeed, the accumulation of human capital via education is an important path to economic\ninclusion and opportunity, resulting in better economic outcomes for individuals, households, and the\ncountry at large. The median income for families whose head has a college degree is more than twice as\nhigh as that of a family whose head has only a high school diploma. Similarly, median net worth is\nconsiderably higher for those with a college degree. 19\n\n[Figure 11] While our workforce as a whole has become more educated over time, educational attainment\ndiffers by race, as does the likelihood of completing a degree. In the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances,\n39 percent of white heads of household held a college degree compared to 23 percent of Black heads of\nhousehold and 17 percent of Hispanic heads of household. 20\n\nCost can be an important barrier to entering college, particularly for those coming from lower-income\nfamilies. The average cost of tuition and fees at four-year institutions is now over $16,000 a year, and\n\nCommunity Survey, Subject Table S2802, 2019 1-year estimates. (Note: These estimates on broadband are higher\nthan those from Pew, cited in footnote 16, which pertain to usage.)\n18\n\nSee the Zearn math platform data at Opportunity Insights: Economic Tracker, and Chetty, et al. (2020).\n\n19\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve System 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, in 2016, the median income of\nfamilies whose head has a college degree was $90,000 compared with $40,000 for families whose head had only a\nhigh school diploma. See Federal Reserve System (2017).\n20\n\nSee Dettling, et al. (2017).\n\n\f8\nadjusted for inflation, it has more than doubled over the past three decades. 21 According to the Fed’s\nsurvey on economic well-being, as of late 2019, over 40 percent of those who went to college had taken\non debt for their education and about half of those people still owe money on this debt. 22 New York Fed\nanalysis shows that compared to borrowers in majority white areas, those in majority Black areas have\nhigher student loan balances and those in majority Black and majority Hispanic areas have higher rates of\ndefault on those loans. 23 These defaults can follow a person over time, making it harder to access credit\nin the future.\n\n[Figure 12] For those students who do find the financial means to enter college, the likelihood of\ncompleting a degree differs by type of institution and by race. The completion rates have remained\nparticularly low at for-profit institutions. At both public and nonprofit private institutions, the graduation\nrates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of Blacks remain well below\nthose of these other groups and have shown no progress over time.\n\nSatisfaction with college also varies by race. About 70 percent of white recipients of bachelor’s degrees\nfelt that their education was worth the cost, but only slightly more than half of Black recipients did. 24\n\nGaps over the Life Cycle: Earning Years – Labor Markets and Credit Markets\n[Figure 13] The differences in educational attainment across races follow people as they enter the\nworkforce. There are significant racial disparities in labor market outcomes. Unemployment rates among\nBlacks and Hispanics have been chronically above those of whites and Asians, and Blacks and Hispanics\nare more likely to lose their jobs during recessions. Although some progress had been made over the long\n\n21\n\nSee Digest of Education Statistics.\n\n22\n\nSee pp. 43-46, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (May 2020).\n\n23\n\nSee Chakrabarti, Nober, and van der Klaauw (2020).\n\n24\n\nSee Figure 28, p. 39, in Board of Governors (May 2020).\n\n\f9\neconomic expansion that ended in February, racial disparities remained. Research from Fed economists\nindicates that while lower educational attainment explains much of the difference in the unemployment\nexperience of Hispanics, this is not true for the Black-white gap. In fact, observable characteristics, like\neducation, age, or marital status, cannot fully account for the higher and more cyclical unemployment of\nBlacks relative to whites. 25\n\n[Figure 14] These long-standing labor market disparities spill over in other ways that limit Black\nhouseholds’ ability to fully participate in the economy. Worse and more volatile labor market outcomes\nmake it harder for nonwhite families to build assets and achieve sound financial health.\n\nFor those families that are able to get a mortgage, job insecurity makes the household less financially\nresilient and raises the risk that the household might fall behind on its mortgage or even default, putting\nthe family’s longer-term financial health at risk. Housing continues to be an important way for families to\nbuild wealth, but even controlling for income and other factors related to creditworthiness, there is a\nrising gap between the homeownership rate of whites and Blacks. This indicates that systemic racial\ndifferences in access to credit have persisted well after enactment of fair housing and lending legislation\nin the 1970s meant to address the scourge of redlining and discrimination in credit markets. 26,27\n\n[Figure 15] In terms of access to financial services, Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have a bank\naccount and more likely to rely on alternative financial services such as money orders and check cashing\nservices than whites. Being unbanked or underbanked makes it harder for these families to build a credit\nhistory. 28\n\n25\n\nSee Cajner, et al. (2017).\n\n26\n\nSee also Choi (2020).\n\n27\n\nFor documentation and discussion of the racial gaps in homeownership rates, see Haughwout, et al. (2020).\n\n28\n\nSee Table 11, p. 28, in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (May 2020). Unbanked is defined as\nnot having a checking, savings, or money market account. Underbanked is defined as having a checking, savings, or\n\n\f10\n\nThe use of bank financing by small businesses also varies significantly with the race of the owner.\nAccording to the Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey, compared to small firms with white ownership,\nthose with Black ownership were half as likely to have obtained financing from a bank in the past five\nyears, relying more on online lenders, which, according to survey respondents, provide less satisfactory\nservice. 29\n\nMuch Needs to Be Done to Address Economic Disparities and Promote Economic Inclusion\nEliminating racial and economic disparities, which have lasted over generations, is no easy task. It will\ntake concerted action at the individual, professional, and institutional level to change structures and\nsystems that perpetuate these gaps. But this work needs to be done so that all people have the opportunity\nto fully participate in the U.S. economy. The research I discussed today points to four priorities.\n\nInvesting in neighborhoods and communities must be a priority. Place matters and at smaller\ngeographical divisions than might be expected. Localized, neighborhood-based community development\nwork and investments aimed at reducing poverty rates, improving school quality and housing choices, and\nrevitalizing neighborhoods can offer families more stability. Focusing on improving neighborhoods can\nhave results. In 2016, the Cleveland Fed convened all those interested in contributing to the efforts of the\nLead Safe Cleveland Coalition and the city of Cleveland in preventing lead poisoning in the city. 30 And\nlast July, Cleveland City Council passed an important piece of legislation requiring, among other\nprovisions, that landlords pay for private inspections and certifications that their occupied units are lead-\n\nmoney market account but having used one of these alternative financial services: money order, check cashing\nservice, pawn shop loan, auto title loan, payday loan, paycheck advance, or tax refund advance.\nAccording to the Fed’s most recent Small Business Credit Survey of firms with 1-499 employees, 46 percent of\nfirms with white ownership, 32 percent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 23 percent of firms with Black\nownership had obtained financing from a bank in the past five years; 19 percent of firms with white ownership, 22\npercent of firms with Hispanic ownership, and 27 percent of firms with Black ownership had obtained financing\nfrom an online lender in the past five years. See Federal Reserve System (2020), p. 9.\n29\n\n30\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2016).\n\n\f11\nsafe, with penalties for noncompliance. 31\n\nClosing the digital divide must be a priority. Among communities with a population of 100,000 or more,\nthe city of Cleveland has among the lowest home broadband access in the nation. 32 Business leaders\nthrough the Greater Cleveland Partnership are working with the city’s governmental leaders and other\norganizations to ensure that all residents in the Greater Cleveland area have access to in-home highquality broadband and devices to access it. Similar work is being done in Pittsburgh by the Allegheny\nConference on Community Development.\n\nIncreasing access to high-quality education at all levels must be a priority. Education is a significant\navenue to economic opportunity. Recognizing that a higher-skilled workforce benefits communities,\nOhio has a project underway to try to increase educational attainment. 33 Issues with cost and preparation\nneed to be addressed. Respondents to recent Fed surveys said that the cost of college and family\nobligations are among the reasons they did not complete their degree. 34 Low grades were also cited as a\nreason. Adequate preparation for college has an impact on completion rates and likely on satisfaction.\nResearch is increasingly pointing to the fact that children who fall behind have difficulty catching up. 35\nTutoring and mentoring throughout a student’s elementary, high school, and college years can support a\nstudent through to earning a degree.\n\n31\n\nSee Dissell and Zeltner (2019).\n\n32\n\nThe data are available in Table GCT2801, U.S. Census American Community Survey (2019). In the city of\nCleveland, 69.3 percent of households have a broadband internet subscription. Only Lakewood Township, Ocean\nCounty, N.J. has lower internet connectivity, at 58.9 percent. The numbers for the U.S. and for the city of Pittsburgh\nare 86.4 percent and 86.5 percent, respectively.\n33\nOhio Excels, partnering with the Complete to Compete Ohio Coalition, has developed a statewide action plan to\nincrease postsecondary educational attainment in the state. See Ohio Excels (2020) and Wright -McGowan (2020).\n34\n\nAccording to the Fed survey of economic well-being, of those respondents who could not complete their\nassociate’s or bachelor’s degree, among other reasons, 56 percent said it was because it was too expensive, 52\npercent said it was because they needed to earn money to take care of their family, and 22 percent said it was\nbecause of low grades. Respondents could choose more than one reason. See Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (May 2020), Table 23, p. 41.\n35\n\nSee Mester (2015).\n\n\f12\n\nIn addition, financial literacy should be included in elementary and high school curricula. Such courses\nwill give students the skills to evaluate the various options for financing their education, determine which\ntypes of educational institutions offer a good return on their investment, and lead to better savings,\ninvestment, and credit decisions throughout their lives. The Cleveland Fed actively supports economic\nand financial literacy programs, and this year we will be hosting the Council of Economic Education’s\nNational Personal Finance Challenge, a competition for high school students that encourages\ndevelopment of financial management skills.\n\nEliminating systemic inequities in access to credit and financial services must be a priority. The racial\ndisparities that still exist in banking and credit markets mean institutions need to reassess their business\npractices and change those that are found to be sources of such disparities. Similarly, policymakers need\nto strengthen policies meant to address such inequities. The Federal Reserve is currently working to\nstrengthen the regulations that implement the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The act, passed in\n1977, was intended to help address concerns about disinvestment in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods and the impact of illegal practices such as redlining. The CRA reaffirmed that insured\ndepository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business. Evidence\nshows that the CRA has provided tangible benefits to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. With\nthe many changes in banking since the 1970s, it is time to modernize the regulation so that it can help to\naddress systemic inequities in access to financial services and credit for low - and moderate-income and\nminority communities and individuals. 36\n\n36\n\nThe Board of Governors issued its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to strengthen, clarify, and\ntailor the CRA regulation, and other materials summarizing the ANPR on September 21, 2020. See Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (September 21, 2020) and Brainard (2020).\n\n\f13\nOf course, much more needs to be done. But if we have focus, perseverance, and a shared commitment to\neliminating systemic racism and increasing the breadth of economic opportunity, then together we can\nensure that instead of being a pipe dream for some, the American Dream is available to all.\n\n\f14\nReferences\nAliprantis, Dionissi, Daniel R.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Speech\n20 Anniversary Chicago Payments Symposium\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, IL\n(via videoconference)\nth\n\nSeptember 23, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nIt is a great pleasure being with you today as part of the 20th Anniversary Chicago Payments Symposium.\nOver the last two decades, this symposium has established itself as a valuable forum at which those\ninterested in the payments system can gather to learn and share ideas. In recent years, the symposium has\nfostered important conversations between industry practitioners and policymakers. Those conversations\nhave helped inform the Federal Reserve System’s initiative to improve and modernize the U.S. payments\nsystem. That work is ongoing and has reached important milestones this year, despite the pandemic.\nToday, I will discuss some of the effects the pandemic has had on the U.S. payments system and update\nyou on some of our ongoing efforts to modernize the payments system. As always, the views I’ll express\nare my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nI know I do not need to tell this audience that the payments system is a crucial part of the infrastructure of\nthe U.S. and a well-functioning and secure payments system is vital for a sound economy. As is true of\npretty much every aspect of life this year, the pandemic has affected the payments business, including\npayment patterns and volumes. The most important thing to recognize is that the U.S. payments system\nhas been weathering the pandemic without significant disruptions. This has taken the hard work of many\npeople in both the public sector and the private sector. Many of these workers were deemed to be\nessential, and we owe them all our deep gratitude for their dedication and public service. Because of the\nvital role played by the payments system, priorities had to change to meet the challenges posed by the\npandemic. At the same time, progress continued on important projects that have longer-run consequences\nfor the payments system.\n\nThere will be many lessons to take away from the current pandemic situation; two seem particularly\nrelevant to the payments work in which we are all engaged. First, although it is safe to say no one\nanticipated an event quite like the pandemic, the industry’s forethought, investment, and preparation to\n\n\f2\nensure that the payments system would be resilient to extreme scenarios has paid off greatly. It has\nallowed us to avoid a collapse of the payments system – an event that would have made what was already\na grave situation much, much worse. One big takeaway is that once we get through the current pandemic,\nmaking necessary investments to ensure that the U.S. payments system remains resilient in the face of\nextreme stress events will need to remain a priority.\nAnother key lesson is that having the right technology in place can make a big difference in being able to\naddress the challenges posed in an environment of rapid change in payments behavior. Industry\nparticipants may need to rethink their payments technology investment strategy once we are through the\npandemic. The changes we have seen in customers’ payment behavior since February have happened\nquickly. The spread of COVID-19 heightened the reliance of businesses and individuals on digital\nservices and faster connectivity, as many employees began to work from home and consumers turned to\nonline shopping. This is a global pandemic, and demand for consumer-to-consumer and cross-border\npayments has risen, as people want to send and receive payments in support of family and friends. Some\npayments technology is more resilient, scalable, and adaptable to such rapid changes in user behavior and\nvolume. Some industry participants note that cloud technologies are inherently more scalable and\nadaptable, and early adopters of the cloud are likely better positioned during these times compared to\nthose operating on mainframes. 1 It would be wrong to say that the pandemic has been the catalyst for\npayments system modernization: the Federal Reserve Banks have been assessing our payments\ntechnology for some time. We are investing in cloud technology and have platform modernization\ninitiatives at various stages of completion across nearly all of our business lines. However, the pandemic\ndoes underscore the need to have a technology strategy that will meet the needs of the future. Industry\nefforts to replace decades-old core banking systems with more flexible, resilient, and cloud-friendly\n\n1\n\nSee Fintech Advisory Group (2020).\n\n\f3\nplatforms, and to integrate the old with the new along the way, may need to be accelerated to ensure that\nwe are prepared for the future.\nLet me review some of the changes we have seen in payments activity during the pandemic.\n\nPayments Volume and Mix\nThe coronavirus pandemic and actions taken to contain its spread have had tremendous effects on\nhouseholds, businesses, and communities across America and on economic activity. So it is not\nsurprising that the pandemic has had significant effects on the types and volumes of payments flowing\nthrough the payments system. In March, the country took aggressive social-distancing measures to limit\nthe spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for\nthe sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. In March and April, with\nstay-at-home orders issued by state and local authorities in full swing, the number of checks processed by\nthe Reserve Banks declined substantially.\n\nBut at the same time, global demand for U.S. currency notes increased at unprecedented rates in March as\ncurrency orders from domestic and international banks spiked dramatically. At times of crisis, people\noften turn toward safety, and the U.S. dollar is viewed as a stable and safe asset across the world. So it is\nnot unusual that the pandemic has led to a shift toward cash, but the scale has been unprecedented.\nAdding to that, the fiscal support in the form of economic impact payments issued by the U.S.\ngovernment to millions of households also likely contributed to the higher demand in the U.S. as many\npeople converted the payments into cash for spending. On the supply side, just as in other industries, the\npandemic has affected the supply chain of cash. With the shutdown in full swing earlier this year,\ncurrency deposits to the Fed decreased, as retailers had less cash to deposit and banks wanted to maintain\nhigher inventories in their vaults. The Federal Reserve Banks had to adjust their usual cash operations to\nensure that cash inventories were maintained and cash was delivered to meet the higher demand.\n\n\f4\nAccording to a Federal Reserve survey of consumers taken in May of this year, participants reported that,\non average, during the pandemic, they had increased their holdings of cash on their person from $69 to\n$81, a 17 percent increase. 2 And the amount of cash stored at home or elsewhere rose even more, nearly\n90 percent, from an average of $250 to over $475. Thirty percent of consumers did report they were\navoiding using cash to pay for transactions, in favor of debit and credit cards. But even they were holding\nmore cash in May than they were before the pandemic. Now, since May, as states and localities have\nrelaxed stay-at-home restrictions and the economy has entered a reopening phase, the cash volumes at\nReserve Banks have begun to return to more normal levels.\n\nThe pandemic has also caused a disruption to normal patterns of coin circulation. Deposits by banks to\nthe Fed normally account for roughly 80 percent of the coins that the Federal Reserve puts back into\ncirculation, with the remaining 20 percent coming from new coin produced by the U.S. Mint, the issuing\nauthority for U.S. coin. While about $48 billion of coin is already in circulation, because coin-intensive\nbusinesses and bank branches have been less accessible during the pandemic, much of that coin has piled\nup in people’s homes and piggybanks and in businesses that were shuttered by the pandemic. 3 This has\nmade it more difficult to recirculate the coin where needed. This temporary supply disruption is likely to\ndissipate because as the reopening phase continues and more businesses resume normal activity, more\ncoins will flow back into retail and banking channels.\n\nElectronic payments have also been affected by the pandemic. Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nvolumes declined in late March and early April, driven by lower payroll processing, business-to-business\npayments, and online bill payments. Once the federal government’s economic impact payments were\ndisbursed and the Small Business Administration’s payroll protection plan loans were funded, there was a\n\n2\n\nSee Kim, et al. (2020)\n\n3\n\nU.S. Coin Task Force (2020).\n\n\f5\nrapid rebound in these types of payments and ACH volume has nearly recovered to its pre-pandemic\ngrowth trend.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is the primary collection agent for the U.S. Treasury, and in late\nMarch and early April, our receipts of credit and debit card payments to the Treasury dropped to about\nhalf of what they were compared to last year. On the other hand, the use of debit and credit card\npayments increased for some types of payments. In the Fed survey of consumers, about 20 percent of\nrespondents reported switching to paying online or over the phone for items from restaurants and big-box\nstores, and nearly two-thirds reported that they had made no in-person payments during the first several\nweeks of the pandemic. 4\n\nFinally, I will note that payments related to securities transactions have increased dramatically during the\npandemic amid increased volatility in financial markets, higher levels of government bond issuance, and a\nsurge in mortgage refinancings prompted by low interest rates. 5\n\nAll in all, the pandemic has had a wide-ranging and uneven impact across firms’ and households’\npayment behaviors and patterns. Some of the changes seen early during the pandemic have already\nreverted to pre-pandemic norms and others are likely to revert as the pandemic recedes. But it is also the\ncase that the changes we have seen for some forms of payment will be longer lasting. A consumer’s\ndecision to use a different form of payment during the pandemic may have been driven by circumstances,\nbut now that the consumer has had experience with it, that payment method may become a more routine\nchoice. Similarly, some of the changes in work and consumption patterns may last after the pandemic has\nended, altering payment mix and types of transactions more permanently.\n\n4\n\nSee Kim, et al. (2020).\n\nIncreases in average daily trading volumes for fixed-income municipal, U.S. Treasury, MBS, ABS, and corporate\ndebt for August 2020 year-to-date over the same period a year ago range from 15 percent to 40 percent (SIFMA,\nSeptember 3, 2020).\n5\n\n\f6\nFederal Reserve Payments Actions\nGiven the importance of the payments system to the U.S. economy and the potential for wide-ranging\neffects of the pandemic and the actions taken to stem its spread, the Federal Reserve has been focused on\nmitigating disruptions and preparing for the unexpected. The Fed has established an active inventory\nmanagement program to coordinate existing stores of cash and coin between Federal Reserve distribution\nlocations. This has allowed us to better serve areas in the country experiencing high demand for cash and\nto increase the supply of fit notes available to the public. To help address the national coin circulation\nissues brought on by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve established temporary caps on coin orders in\nJune. These caps, which have risen over time in response to changes in demand and supply conditions,\nhave helped to ensure smooth ordering and fair distribution to financial institutions of all sizes. The Fed\nhas also convened a U.S. Coin Task Force, with representatives from the Fed, the U.S. Mint, and the\nindustry, to identify actions that could be taken to improve coin circulation.\n\nThe Fed understands that financial institutions have had to cope with several pandemic-related challenges\n– after all, we have faced similar challenges. So to ease some of the burden, in May through July of this\nyear, the Fed offered a customer assistance package, including some fee concessions on reporting,\ntransactional, and electronic access services, and provided temporary relief from certain operational\nrequirements. We also announced that in 2021 we would hold our prices for most Federal Reserve\nfinancial services at their current levels.\n\nAs fiscal agent to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Banks also provided service\nto the Treasury by processing more than 160 million economic impact payments to households and small\nbusinesses authorized by the CARES Act to help recipients cope with the financial effects of the\npandemic. Payments were disbursed via ACH, check, and debit card in waves between April and August.\nThe payments were made relatively quickly to those recipients whose bank account details were available\nto the government from prior tax returns or Social Security payments. Recipients whose bank account\n\n\f7\ndetails were not known by the government could enter their account information on a specially created\nIRS website. Even so, this experience showed that the quality of recipients’ routing information needs to\nimprove in order to reduce the proportion of payments that cannot be posted automatically to the payee.\nAnd when exceptions occur, the processes for handling exceptions need to be sped up in order to avoid\ndelays. It was a much bigger challenge to reach those without a bank account. This is a sizeable group:\nin 2017, this number was almost 8-1/2 million households, or about 6.5 percent of U.S. households. 6\nRecipients without bank accounts had to wait much longer for their relief payments to be disbursed by\nchecks or debit cards through the mail, and unfortunately, many of these households tend to be lower\nincome and have the greatest need for speedy financial assistance. The pandemic has underscored the\nneed to ensure that during a crisis, payments can flow quickly and to everyone: those with and those\nwithout a bank account. 7\n\nAs many in this audience know, one of the goals of the Fed’s recent efforts to modernize the U.S.\npayments system is to speed up the flow of payments between payer and payees. Another goal is to make\nsure that all Americans have access to the payments system.\n\nFedNowSM\nThe Federal Reserve’s FedNow service, which is currently being built, will be an around-the-clock\nservice whereby payments can be originated, cleared, and settled within seconds. The service is expected\nto provide clear public benefits in the form of safety, efficiency, and accessibility of instant payments.\nYesterday, my colleague Ken Montgomery provided an excellent overview of FedNow features and\nfunctions, so let me touch upon a few points about how we’ll be rolling the service out.\n\n6\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2017).\n\n7\n\nGeorge (2020).\n\n\f8\nWhile COVID-19 has affected many parts of the payments system, it has not slowed down our work on\nFedNow. Our goal is to bring FedNow to market as soon as practicably possible. The target release date\nremains 2023 or 2024, but we will announce a more specific time frame once additional work is\ncompleted. In order to get the service up and running as soon as possible, we are taking a phased\napproach to its features. We will begin with the most important features and introduce enhancements\nquickly and iteratively thereafter. To inform the design and to determine which features to include at the\nstart, we have been engaging extensively with stakeholders through focus groups, industry meetings, and\nthe establishment of a stakeholder-wide FedNow community, and through the more formal public\ncomment process. We are working to finalize a technology strategy that will create a flexible\ninfrastructure, one that is scalable and can evolve with the times.\n\nIn addition to offering secure instant payments, an important goal of FedNow is to establish a nationwide\nreach for the service so that this new type of payment is broadly accessible to consumers and businesses\nalike. The Federal Reserve’s payments services have a broad reach, with connections to and customer\nrelationships with more than 10,000 diverse financial institutions across the country. This existing reach\nwill help support a nationwide infrastructure for FedNow instant payments. We are also working closely\nwith private-sector payment providers to explore the best approach to achieve wide accessibility.\n\nThinking ahead, a service like FedNow, coupled with a directory service with accurate information on\nwhere to route payments for final distribution to households and businesses, has the potential to solve\nsome of the challenges the government faced when distributing pandemic relief payments. Of course,\ncreating such a directory and ensuring it is kept up-to-date is complex, and several challenges, including\ndata privacy considerations, account information maintenance demands, and business case considerations,\nwould have to be solved. The Federal Reserve understands the potential value of such a service, and has\nbeen exploring these issues as it evaluates the features to eventually include in FedNow.\n\n\f9\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies\nThe experience with pandemic emergency payments has brought forward an idea that was already gaining\nincreased attention at central banks around the world, that is, central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nLegislation has proposed that each American have an account at the Fed in which digital dollars could be\ndeposited, as liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks, which could be used for emergency payments.\nOther proposals would create a new payments instrument, digital cash, which would be just like the\nphysical currency issued by central banks today, but in a digital form and, potentially, without the\nanonymity of physical currency. Depending on how these currencies are designed, central banks could\nsupport them without the need for commercial bank involvement via direct issuance into the end-users’\ndigital wallets combined with central-bank-facilitated transfer and redemption services. 8 The demand for\nand use of such instruments need further consideration in order to evaluate whether such a central bank\ndigital currency would allow for quicker and more ubiquitous payments in times of emergency and more\ngenerally. In addition, a range of potential risks and policy issues surrounding central bank digital\ncurrency need to be better understood, and the costs and benefits evaluated.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been researching issues raised by central bank digital currency for some time.\nThe Board of Governors has a technology lab that has been building and testing a range of distributed\nledger platforms to understand their potential benefits and tradeoffs. 9 Staff members from several\nReserve Banks, including Cleveland Fed software developers, are contributing to this effort. The Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston is also engaged in a multiyear effort, working with the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, to experiment with technologies that could be used for a central bank digital currency. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York has established an innovation center, in partnership with the Bank for\nInternational Settlements, to identify and develop in-depth insights into critical trends and financial\n\n8\n\nSee Mester (2020) for further discussion.\n\n9\n\nBrainard (2020).\n\n\f10\ntechnology of relevance to central banks. 10 Experimentation like this is an important ingredient in\nassessing the benefits and costs of a central bank digital currency, but does not signal any decision by the\nFederal Reserve to adopt such a currency. Issues raised by central bank digital currency related to\nfinancial stability, market structure, security, privacy, and monetary policy all need to be better\nunderstood.\n\nImproving Traditional Federal Reserve Financial Services\nFedNow and central bank digital currency have to do with the future, but the Fed is also working to\nenhance our current portfolio of payment services to ensure they meet evolving customer needs. We\ncontinue to make investments to modernize the technical platforms for traditional payment services,\nincluding the Fedwire Funds Service, FedACH, FedLine access channels, and currency-processing\nservices.\n\nWe are investigating expanding the operating hours of wholesale payment services to meet the interbank\nsettlement demands of a 24x7x365 world. We are enhancing services to facilitate cross-border payments,\nincluding expanding the reach of our FedGlobal ACH service and adopting the ISO 20022 global\nstandard for several of our payment services. We are investigating emerging technical approaches, like\nAPIs, to see whether they can be leveraged to facilitate broader access and efficiency. And, of course, we\nare doing what needs to be done to enhance the resilience of our platforms so that our services can run\nefficiently, reliably, and securely every day.\n\nConclusion\nI hope my remarks today give you some sense of the payments work that has been going on at the Federal\nReserve during the pandemic. The pandemic has triggered notable short-term changes to payments\n\n10\n\nBank for International Settlements (2020).\n\n\f11\nsystem patterns, practices, and usage. But the Federal Reserve and industry participants have responded\nto ensure that our payments system, a critical part of the U.S. infrastructure, continues to function well\nand to meet stakeholder needs. We have all learned a lot during the pandemic. We have seen that we can\nrespond to unforeseen events and that we can be flexible. We have seen the importance of investing in\nthe resilience of our payments system – such resilience helped ensure that the payments system was not\ndisrupted and did not add another challenge to the long list caused by the pandemic. We have seen the\nimportant role the payments system can play in an emergency by distributing funds to those in need.\nThere is some uncertainty about the extent to which some of the changes we have seen in consumer and\nbusiness behavior with respect to their payment choices will continue after the pandemic. But one thing\nis certain: we must ensure that our payments system remains modern, resilient, and able to adapt to\nchanging customer needs as they evolve. I am confident that by working together, the Fed and the\nindustry will be able to achieve that goal for the benefit of the public.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nBank for International Settlements, “BIS Innovation Hub to Expand to New Locations in Europe and\nNorth America,” June 30, 2020.\n(https://www.bis.org/press/p200630a.htm)\nBrainard, Lael, “An Update on Digital Currencies,” at the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco's Innovation Office Hours, San Francisco, CA (via webcast) August 13, 2020.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20200813a.pdf)\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “2017 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked\nHouseholds,” October 2018.\n(https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2017/2017report.pdf)\nFintech Advisory Group, “Minutes of the Regular Meeting of the Fintech Advisory Group,” Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, April 8, 2020.\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/aboutthefed/pdf/ftag-minutes-04082020.pdf)\nGeorge, Esther, “Pondering Payments: Challenges of Reaching All Americans,” KC Fed Policy\nPerspectives, June 30, 2020.\n(https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/speeches/2020/policy_perspectives_6_30_20.pdf?l\na=en)\nKim, Laura, Raynil Kumar, and Shaun O’Brien, “Consumer Payments & the COVID-19 Pandemic: A\nSupplement to the 2020 Findings from the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice,” Cash Product Office,\nFederal Reserve System, July 2020.\n(https://www.frbsf.org/cash/files/consumer-payments-covid-19-pandemic-2020-diary-consumer-paymentchoice-supplement.pdf)\nMester, Loretta J., “Modernizing Our Payments System,” remarks at the Fourth Annual Financial\nLiteracy Day: Understanding Global Markets and Finance, Global Interdependence Center, University of\nSouth Florida Sarasota-Manatee College of Business, Sarasota, FL, February 14, 2020.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20200214-modernizing-our-paymentssystem)\nSIFMA, U.S. Fixed Income Trading Volume, statistics, September 3, 2020.\n(https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-fixed-income-trading-volume/)\nU.S. Coin Task Force, “Statement from the U.S. Coin Task Force on the Coin Circulation Issue,” July 24,\n2020.\n(https://www.aba.com/-/media/documents/email-bulletins/us-coin-task-force-public-statement072420#_ga=2.166214334.1890085829.1597941665-539224350.1597941665)\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Session\n2020 Economic Measurement Seminar\nThe NABE Foundation\n(via videoconference)\nSeptember 2, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Jack Kleinhenz for inviting me to participate in the NABE Foundation’s 2020 Economic\nMeasurement Seminar. I last spoke at a NABE conference in February. That was only six short months\nago, but it seems like a lifetime. Many things have changed since then, including current economic\nconditions and the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. I want to compliment NABE for\nmaintaining its important programming throughout the pandemic. It is a demonstration of perseverance\nand resilience in the face of extraordinary circumstances, traits exhibited by many households, businesses,\nand organizations over the past several months. Such resilience is a hallmark of the U.S. economy, and it\nwill prove useful as the economy makes its way to a sustainable recovery. Before we turn to the question\nand answer part of this session, I’ll give you a brief update on the economic outlook and monetary policy,\nand touch on the changes to the FOMC’s policy strategy that were announced last week. The views I’ll\npresent are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nIn thinking about the economic impact of the pandemic, I find it helps to think in terms of phases. The\nshutdown phase started in March when the country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the\nspread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the\nsick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. There were swift and severe\neffects on the economy from the shutdown of nonessential businesses and activities.\n\nThe reopening phase started in May, as public health statistics began to improve and many parts of the\ncountry began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions. Economic activity and hiring in many\nsectors began to improve in May and June as businesses began to reopen and consumers began to reengage. Even sectors such as travel and leisure and hospitality saw some improvement, although these\nsectors are likely to remain weak for some time. Early in the reopening phase, many of our business\n\n\f2\ncontacts in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which includes Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania,\nKentucky, and West Virginia, told us that activity was picking up more than they had expected. And\nsome of the official statistics have come in stronger than economists had expected. The housing market\nhas been particularly strong, with both new home and existing home sales now back to or above prepandemic levels. Spending on durable goods, including autos, is well above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis is all good news. But the recovery in activity appears to be a fragile one. The most recent highfrequency data and discussions with regional contacts indicate that the pickup in activity seen in May and\nJune has slowed over the past couple of months. This slowdown has occurred as the number of virus\ncases began to rise again in some parts of the country in late June, causing some localities to put their\nreopening plans on pause or to reimpose restrictions on activity. Even in areas where authorities did not\nchange reopening plans, the rise in virus cases seems to have had a dampening effect on activity as people\npulled back, out of concern for their safety. The most recent virus data suggest the number of new cases,\nwhile still elevated, has turned back down, so I’ll be watching to see if the pace of activity picks up again.\n\nSince this is a measurement conference, it seems fitting that I should show you some charts illustrating\nsome of the data. Economists tend to look at growth rates when assessing the economy, but in this\nunprecedented situation of a shutdown followed by a reopening, looking at the level of activity compared\nto what it was before the pandemic is helpful in gauging the economic outlook.\n\n[FIGURE 1] The official GDP data clearly show the deep plunge in activity associated with the\nshutdown. Economic activity peaked in February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. Real GDP\nfell at a 5 percent annual pace in the first quarter and a record 32 percent annual pace in the second\nquarter, with nonresidential business fixed investment down 26 percent, and personal consumption down\n34 percent, at an annual rate. The level of real GDP in the second quarter was back down to the level it\nwas in 2014 – so we have lost six years of output growth.\n\n\f3\n\nThe recovery in some sectors, like services, will take longer than in others, and there will be fits and\nstarts, depending on the course of the virus. But I expect the second quarter to be the trough, a strong\nrebound in growth in the third quarter, and continued positive growth in the fourth quarter, but with the\nlevel of output still ending the year somewhat below where it was at the end of last year.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity in the first half of the year when the economy shut down put\ndownward pressure on inflation, even though supply disruptions have caused the prices of certain goods\nand services to rise. During the reopening phase, there has been some recovery in the inflation measures,\nbut I expect inflation to remain below our longer-run 2 percent goal for some time to come.\n\n[FIGURE 3] The shutdown and reopening had clear effects on the labor market. In April there was an\nunprecedented rise in unemployment and loss of jobs, particularly in sectors where people cannot work\nfrom home. Many workers reported that they expected their unemployment spell would be temporary,\nand as the economy has been reopening, we have seen a rapid decline in the unemployment rate as people\non temporary furlough began to be rehired. This is good news. But it is also good to keep these numbers\nin perspective. The unemployment rate was 10.2 percent in July, still slightly above its peak after the\nGreat Recession. There are still 16 million unemployed workers in the U.S., compared with 6 million in\nFebruary. This means that about one in 16 Americans over the age of 16 is unemployed, near the level\nafter the Great Recession. Moreover, the deterioration in the labor market has not been evenly shared,\nwith the net increase in the unemployment rate since February being higher for Blacks, Hispanics, and\nAsians than for whites.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The payroll employment data tell a similar story. In just the two months of March and\nApril, the economy lost 22 million jobs, the same number of jobs it had added over the entire recent\nexpansion that lasted over 10 years. More than three-quarters of those losses were in the sectors paying\n\n\f4\nbelow-average wages. The good news is that in just three months, the economy has added back over 9\nmillion jobs. Of course, this means we are less than half way back up to the pre-pandemic level of jobs,\nand the current level of employment is about what it was back in 2014. So like output, about 6 years’\nworth of job growth has been lost.\n\nGiven the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and economic shutdown, many economists, including\nthose at the Fed, have been looking at higher-frequency indicators to track developments. The Cleveland\nFed has been surveying our contacts with greater frequency and we have added a nationwide survey of\nconsumers to gauge how the virus has affected their attitudes and activities. These higher-frequency\nindicators clearly show the rebound in activity that came with the reopening of the economy, but they also\nshow that activity is correlated with data on the course of the virus.\n\n[FIGURE 5] For example, when virus cases began to rise again in late June, the data on mobility, or the\npercentage of time spent away from home, and the data on restaurant visits began to level off compared to\nMay when reopening began. Our contacts in the restaurant industry also confirmed that the pace of\nbusiness activity was dampening and some have begun to question the longer-run viability of many\nestablishments, especially those that have not been able to transition to takeout.\n\n[FIGURE 6] As the pandemic has worn on, businesses have begun to change their plans. Early on, many\ncontacts told us that they were not planning to make permanent reductions to their work force; however,\nthey eventually had to let some workers go. In our latest survey, over half of the firms told us that in light\nof the increase in virus cases since late June, they have made meaningful changes to their plans, including\nfor hiring and capital spending.\n\nSmall businesses have been disproportionately affected by the virus, and the smallest of the small\nbusinesses particularly so. Data from Homebase show that the strides made since April on employment at\n\n\f5\nsmall businesses have now begun to stall, with the number of hourly staff down about 20 percent since\nJanuary. As documented by researchers at the New York Fed, Black-owned businesses have been\nparticularly hard hit by the pandemic, and have been twice as likely to close as other firms during the\npandemic. The researchers point to a number of contributing factors including these firms’ weaker\nfinancial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and funding gaps that existed prior to the pandemic, plus\nless access to federal relief funds.1\n\n[FIGURE 7] The Cleveland Fed’s survey data show that both businesses and consumers are thinking\ndifferently about the pandemic than they did at the start. In our survey taken in late June, about half of\nour regional business contacts said it will take at least a year for their firms’ activity to return to prepandemic levels.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s national daily survey shows that consumers are now more willing to engage in\ncertain activities than they were at the start, but they also believe that the pandemic will last much longer\nthan they originally thought.2 In March, over 80 percent of respondents thought the pandemic would last\na year or less. In early August, only half think that, and the other half thinks it will be two years or even\nlonger.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\nThe link we’ve seen between the rise in virus cases and the dampening of activity underscores the fact\nthat the path of the economy depends on the path of the virus. Of course, the path of the virus can be\n\nClaire Kramer Mills and Jessica Battisto, “Double Jeopardy: Covid-19’s Concentrated Health and Wealth Effects\nin Black Communities,” Brief, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, August 2020\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/DoubleJeopardy_COVID19andBlackOwnedBusine\nsses).\n1\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s website provides updates of these survey results each Wednesday on the Consumers and\nCOVID-19 page, https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/consumers-and-covid-19.aspx. For\nfurther results from the survey, see Edward S. Knotek II, et al., “Consumers and COVID-19: A Real-Time Survey,”\nEconomic Commentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 2020-08, April 17, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.26509/frbcec-202008).\n2\n\n\f6\naffected by our actions. These include public- and private-sector investments in expanded testing, contact\ntracing, treatments, and vaccines, as well as our own individual actions to safely engage in activity by\nwearing a mask that covers our noses and mouths, avoiding social gatherings, maintaining distance from\nothers, and washing our hands frequently.\n\nAssuming that we get the virus under control and people feel safe enough and businesses confident\nenough to re-engage in economic activity, the economy will move from the reopening phase to a more\nsustained recovery phase. This recovery is likely to take some time because the pandemic was a\nsignificant shock to the economy.\n\nBoth the federal government and the Federal Reserve took swift and significant actions to provide\nhouseholds and businesses with relief during the shutdown. Fiscal actions have included grants to\nindividuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities; expanded\nunemployment benefits; and loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their\npayrolls.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took actions to ensure that financial markets had enough liquidity to continue to\nfunction well and that credit could continue to flow to households and businesses, thereby avoiding\nfinancial instability on top of the pandemic. These actions have included buying Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities to address strains in these markets; making sure our central bank\ncounterparties abroad have access to dollar funding; setting up a variety of so-called 13(3) emergency\nfacilities, backed by the U.S. Treasury, that serve as a backstop to other key credit markets and support\nthe flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state and local governments; temporarily\nrelaxing some of the regulatory requirements on banks so they have greater capacity to lend; and since\nMarch, maintaining the fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent.\n\n\f7\nBy the end of this year, I expect that output will still be somewhat below its level at the end of last year;\nthat the unemployment rate will remain in the high single digits; and that inflation will be well below our\nlonger-run 2 percent goal. Of course, the uncertainty around this forecast is extremely high: we are in an\nunprecedented situation and outcomes depend on public health considerations. The outlook also depends\non appropriate economic policy. In my view, fiscal policy and monetary policy support are needed to\nlimit lasting damage to the economy and achieve a broader, sustainable recovery. Several key parts of the\nfiscal policy support already in place are expiring. Given economic conditions, it seems clear that further\nfiscal support is needed to provide a bridge for households, small businesses, and state and local\nmunicipalities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic until the recovery is sustainably in place.3\n\nFor the Fed’s part, the FOMC has indicated that we expect to maintain the fed funds rate target range at\n0 to 1/4 percent until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to\nachieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Our asset purchases continue to support\nmarket functioning and accommodative financial conditions. In addition, clear communications about our\npolicy strategy can also make any monetary policy actions we take more effective. Last week, the FOMC\nreleased a revised statement outlining our longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which should\nhelp clarify and reinforce the FOMC’s policy intentions.4 So let me conclude with a few highlights from\nthis statement. I direct you to Fed Chair Powell’s recent remarks for a fuller discussion of the statement.5\n\n3\n\nRecent Cleveland Fed research shows that there have been sizable declines in activities that typically produce the\nlargest share of state and local government tax revenue, including air transportation and gasoline sales. See Stephan\nWhitaker, “How Much Help Do State and Local Governments Need? Updated Estimates of Revenue Losses from\nPandemic Mitigation,” District Data Brief, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, June 29, 2020 (https://doi.org\n/10.26509/frbc-ddb-20200629).\nFor information about the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary policy framework, including strategy, tools,\nand communications, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-toolsand-communications.htm.\n4\n\nSee Jerome H. Powell, “New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,” remarks at\n“Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,” an economic policy symposium sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, WY (via webcast), August 27, 2020\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm).\n5\n\n\f8\nRevised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\nFor the past year and a half, the FOMC has been engaged in a review of our framework – the strategy,\ntools, and communications – for setting monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals to promote\nmaximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates. The review was informed\nby our experience during and after the Great Recession, by economic theory and empirical analysis, and\nby consultations with academic researchers and practitioners at research conferences and with the public\nat large, through a series of Fed Listens events held across the country.\n\nThe review, whose main conclusions are captured in the strategy statement, was undertaken in light of\nchanges in the economic environment that have emerged since our first strategy statement was published\nin 2012. One important change is the decline both here and abroad in the general level of interest rates\nconsistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline reflects several factors, including the\naging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth. It means that the\nlevel of the fed funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability is now lower than it\nhas been in the past. This means that during economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds\nrate will be constrained by its effective lower bound. In other words, in the wake of a downturn, the\nFOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using its traditional policy tool. With\nhouseholds, businesses, and financial markets all understanding this constraint, this imparts a downward\nbias to inflation and inflation expectations, and increases the downside risks to achieving both of our\npolicy goals.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment pertains to inflation dynamics. Resource slack has become\nless correlated with actual inflation than in the past, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in\ndetermining inflation outcomes. This makes it even more important that inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored at levels consistent with our longer-run 2 percent inflation goal, especially since inflation\nrunning below our goal would result in even less policy space in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\n\f9\n\nThe first thing to note about the revised strategy statement is that the FOMC has reaffirmed that a longerrun inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our statutory mandate. But our strategy statement is\nnow more explicit about how we will go about achieving this inflation goal. Namely, after periods in\nwhich inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we will likely aim to have inflation run\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. Doing so will help anchor inflation expectations, a main\ndeterminant of actual inflation, at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. The new language is a\nstronger statement than we have made in the past as we have struggled to effectively convey that 2\npercent should not be interpreted as a ceiling. We are now clear that after inflation has been running\npersistently below 2 percent, not only will we tolerate serendipitous shocks that move inflation above 2\npercent, but that we will likely set policy with the intention to move inflation moderately above 2 percent\nfor some time.\n\nI have spoken many times on the fact that policy communications should acknowledge uncertainty.6 The\nchanges made in the strategy statement about our employment goal are an acknowledgment of the\nuncertainty around assessments of the level of maximum employment. Indeed, the FOMC’s assessments\nof the longer-run unemployment rate have come down significantly over time, and employment growth\nover the expansion ended up being considerably stronger without generating inflation than past\nexperience suggested was possible. It took time to learn about these structural changes in the economy.\nAnd this time-to-learn, combined with the previous strategy statement’s references to “deviations” of\nemployment from maximum employment, has been misinterpreted by some as suggesting that the FOMC,\nat times, takes deliberate policy action to bring employment down independently of our inflation goal.\nThis is not the case. The benefits of a strong labor market in fostering economic inclusion for all\nAmericans are clear and we need to be humble about our abilities to assess maximum employment in real\n\nSee, e.g., Loretta J. Mester, “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” remarks at the Shadow Open Market Committee Fall\nMeeting, New York, NY, October 7, 2016 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp20161007-acknowledging-uncertainty.aspx).\n6\n\n\f10\ntime. The new statement language clarifies that in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to\nfinancial stability, strong employment is not a concern and monetary policy will not react to it.\n\nI strongly believe that clear policy communications are an important part of effective monetary\npolicymaking. The completion of the framework review and the revised strategy statement come at an\nopportune time, in support of the FOMC’s commitment to doing all that it can to support a sustainable\nrecovery back to maximum employment and price stability in service to the public.\n\n\fCharts for\n“An Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Session\n2020 Liberal Arts Macroeconomics Conference\nPomona College\nClaremont, CA\n(via videoconference)\nAugust 5, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Dean Croushore and the organizers of the 2020 Liberal Arts Macroeconomics Conference for\ninviting me to present in the keynote session. I also want to acknowledge the important role that the\nparticipants in this conference play in our economy and in society. In recent years, some have questioned\nwhether a liberal arts education offers the same value as it once did, and point to other types of programs\nthat, in their view, better prepare students for the job market. I take the opposite view: to me the value of\na liberal arts education has never been clearer. The current pandemic underscores the fact that the future\nis uncertain. A year ago, I certainly wasn’t imagining we would be in the place we find ourselves today.\nIf we want students to be prepared for the future, then we must give them the tools they will need to\nsuccessfully stand up to future challenges, think critically through possible approaches and solutions to\nthose challenges, be resilient in the face of adversity, and question the status quo. A broad-based liberal\narts education, which encompasses the study of history, literature, and the arts, as well as mathematics\nand the natural and social sciences, holds the best promise to prepare students for the future, whatever it\nmay bring. I applaud the professors taking part in this conference. Not only do you have to be\ninspirational teachers, but you also have to be excellent researchers who are pushing the boundaries of\nknowledge in economics forward. Both roles have become more challenging during the pandemic, with\nthe sudden need to move to remote teaching and the difficulty in keeping ongoing research on track. I\nappreciate your efforts and ask that you persevere in these very important roles.\n\nToday, before we open it up to questions, I’ll give you an update on the economy and on the Federal\nReserve’s policy response. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f2\nThe Economy\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all\nover the world. This is an unprecedented situation and unprecedented actions have been taken in\nresponse.\n\nIn thinking about the economic impact of the pandemic, it helps to think in terms of phases: the shutdown\nphase, the reopening phase, and a more traditional economic recovery phase. The shutdown phase began\nin March when the country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and\nto buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about\nthe virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. The shutdown had swift and severe effects on the\neconomy.\n\nThe economy entered the reopening phase in May, as the public health statistics began to improve in\nsome parts of the country. Many states began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, with some\nstates doing so more quickly and more broadly than others. We began to see some welcome rebound in\nthe economic data in May and June. But it is good to keep in mind that growth rates after a shutdown are\ngoing to look good as activity resumes. Given the deep hole we are digging out of, it is more informative\nto look at levels when gauging the economy and assessing the outlook.\n\nThe reopening phase has proved to be challenging. In late June, virus cases in many parts of the country\nbegan rising again and, in response, some states have hit the pause button on their reopening plans, while\nother states have reimposed some restrictions on activities. Although we don’t yet see the effects of the\npause in many of the official economic statistics, the higher-frequency data and discussions with regional\ncontacts do indicate that economic activity has slowed in recent weeks. Thus, the reopening phase may\nbe more protracted than many had anticipated when it started.\n\n\f3\n[FIGURE 1] At this point, the most dated of our official statistics are the GDP data. These statistics\nshow that economic activity peaked in February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. After\ndeclining at a 5 percent annual pace in the first quarter, real GDP plunged at a record 33 percent annual\npace in the second quarter, with nonresidential business fixed investment down 27 percent, and personal\nconsumption down almost 35 percent, at an annual rate. I expect that the second quarter will be the\ntrough in economic activity. Consumer spending rebounded in May and June, with June’s spending on\ngoods higher than it was in February, before the shutdown. But while spending on services, which\nincludes dining at restaurants, air travel, and hotel stays, moved up in May and June, it remains well\nbelow pre-pandemic levels.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity has put downward pressure on inflation. Both headline and core\ninflation readings moved down in March and April and remained low in May and June. It is true that\nsupply disruptions have caused the prices of certain goods and services to rise, but this upward pressure\nhas been more than offset by the downward pressure driven by the pullback in demand. And I expect\ninflation to remain low for some time to come.\n\n[FIGURE 3] The shutdown of the economy earlier this year led to an unprecedented rise in\nunemployment and loss of jobs. While many people can work from home, many others cannot. As\nreopening began, we started to see some improvement in labor markets. Both the unemployment rate and\npayroll employment have improved over the past two months. Recall that in February, the unemployment\nrate was 3.5 percent, its 50-year low. In April, the unemployment rate surged to 14.7 percent. As\nreopening commenced in May, people on temporary furlough began to be rehired. As of June, the\nunemployment rate is down to 11.1 percent. The fact that the unemployment rate is coming down is good\nnews. But we also need to put this into perspective. The current level is still above its peak in the\naftermath of the Great Recession. And there are still almost 18 million unemployed workers in the U.S.,\n\n\f4\ncompared with 6 million in February. This means one in 15 Americans over the age of 16 is unemployed,\nabout the same as at the height after the Great Recession.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The economy lost over 22 million jobs in March and April. This is a staggering number. It\nwould have been literally off the charts if I hadn’t changed the scale. In fact, the losses in just the two\nmonths of March and April were about the same as the number of jobs the economy added over the entire\nrecent expansion that lasted more than 10 years. The jobs added in May and June make up only about\none-third of the jobs lost.\n\n[FIGURE 5] To get a sense of where we are, it is helpful to look at employment in levels rather than\nmonthly changes. The current level of payroll jobs is now back to where it was in 2014. In other words,\nthe economy is still down about 6 years’ worth of job growth.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market is even sharper than these numbers indicate. Many people left the\nwork force at the beginning of the shutdown and consequently they do not show up in the unemployment\nrate, and many workers had their hours cut. Our survey of firms in the Fourth District, which includes\nOhio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia, indicates that firms have recalled workers\nmore slowly than they originally intended to. As of mid-July, over half of District contacts have told us\nthey are meaningfully altering their plans in response to the rise in virus cases, including reducing\nemployment or employee compensation or cancelling or postponing planned capital expenditures.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market has not been evenly shared. Net job losses have been predominantly\nin lower-paying jobs. Nearly half of the net private-sector job losses since February have been in the\nleisure and hospitality and the retail trade sectors, the two sectors ranked lowest in terms of average\nhourly earnings. Three-quarters of the job losses are in the sectors that pay below-average wages.\n\n\f5\n[FIGURE 6] There are racial disparities as well. Unemployment rates among Blacks and Hispanics have\nbeen chronically above those of whites and Asians. Over the long expansion, we had finally seen some\nprogress being made on that front, as the gap in unemployment rates narrowed. But the pandemic has\nincreased the disparities. The net increase in the unemployment rate since February is higher for Blacks,\nHispanics, and Asians than for whites. It is particularly distressing that much of the sacrifice over the\npandemic period is being borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority\nworkers and communities, and the smaller of the small businesses.\n\n[FIGURE 7] And it shines a bright light on long-standing economic inequality that needs to be addressed\nif the economy is to perform up to its potential. Education is a path to better economic outcomes for\nindividuals, households, and the country at large. According to data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer\nFinances, the median income for families whose head has a college degree was over $90,000 compared\nwith only $40,000 for families whose head has only a high school diploma. Similarly, median net worth\nis considerably higher for those with a college degree. 1\n\n[FIGURE 8] Our work force has become more educated over time. But educational attainment differs by\nrace, as does the likelihood of completing a degree. In the Fed’s survey, 39 percent of white heads of\nhouseholds held a college degree compared to 23 percent of Black heads of household and 17 percent of\nHispanic heads of household. 2\n\nInformation about and data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances are available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSee Lisa J. Dettling, Joanne W. Hsu, Lindsay Jacobs, Kevin B. Moore, and Jeffrey P. Thompson, “Recent Trends\nin Wealth-Holding by Race and Ethnicity: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,” FED Notes,\nSeptember 27, 2019 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-byrace-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm).\n\n\f6\n[FIGURE 9] Graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of\nBlacks remain well below those of these other groups and have shown no progress over time. Because\neconomic well-being rises with education, unless more is done to support those entering college so they\ncan complete their degrees, economic inequality is likely to continue to rise.3\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\nLet me now turn to the outlook and policy. Macroeconomic forecasting has been particularly challenging\nduring the pandemic. Higher-frequency indicators, including data on mobility, restaurant visits, debit and\ncredit card transactions, employment in small businesses, and the weekly initial claims for unemployment\ninsurance, all suggest that activity has begun to decelerate with the rise in virus cases. These recent\ndevelopments add uncertainty to what was already an uncertain outlook. Whether the rise in cases and\nthe deceleration in activity prove to be temporary or more persistent remains to be seen. At the very least,\nthey suggest that the economy will be in the reopening phase for a while longer.\n\nIt is clear that the path of the economy depends on the path of the virus. But that does not mean we are\nhelpless. The actions we take can help control the virus and thereby change the impact of the virus on the\neconomy. Increased government and private-sector investment in expanded testing, contact tracing, and\ndevelopments of therapeutics and vaccines will influence the path of the virus and our ability to re-engage\nin economic activity. Each individual can also influence the path of the virus: we can wear a mask that\ncovers our noses and mouths when out and about, we can avoid social gatherings and maintain our\ndistance from others, and we can wash our hands frequently. These simple steps have been shown to\nmake a difference in infection rates. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the latest estimates indicate that\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Community Development and Human Capital,” remarks at the 2015 Policy Summit on\nHousing, Human Capital, and Inequality, Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond,\nPittsburgh, PA, June 19, 2015 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20150619community-development-and-human-capital.aspx). And see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\n“Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2019, Featuring Supplemental Data from April 2020,”\nMay 2020 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019preface.htm).\n3\n\n\f7\nif 95 percent of Americans wore face coverings in public, COVID-related deaths could be reduced by up\nto 40,000 to 50,000. 4\n\nIn response to the increase in cases seen in Ohio, the governor recently upgraded the mask-wearing\nrecommendation to a mandate. This is occurring in other states as well. Evidence from the Cleveland\nFed’s daily national survey of households shows that the vast majority of the more than 1,000 survey\nrespondents would comply with such a mandate, with older people more likely to comply than younger\npeople. The vast majority also thought that mask-wearing is helpful in reducing transmission of the virus,\nand those who believed this are more likely to wear a mask. About 70 percent of respondents also\nreported that they feel more comfortable shopping when they see others wearing masks. 5\n\nAssuming that the virus gets under control once again and people feel safe enough and businesses\nconfident enough to re-engage in economic activity, the economy will move from the reopening phase to\nthe recovery phase. I anticipate that the recovery will take some time because significant sectoral\nreallocations are going to need to occur. Changes in consumers’ behavior, including their shopping,\ndining, and housing preferences; changes in firms’ demand for office space and work arrangements; and\nchanges in supply chains will all take time to sort out. The pandemic was a significant shock to the\neconomy – the largest in most of our lifetimes. A significant number of firms have already declared\nbankruptcy. Many workers will need to be rehired; some will have to find jobs in different industries. It\n\n“COVID-19 Update: What Employers Need to Know,” conversation with Steve Gordon, MD, Chair, Department\nof Infectious Disease, Cleveland Clinic, moderated by James Merlino, MD, Chief Clinical Transformation Officer,\nCleveland Clinic, webinar, July 27, 2020 (https://youtu.be/zxFECH7ZO4w).\n\n4\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s website provides updates of these survey results each Wednesday on the Consumers and\nCOVID-19 page, https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/consumers-and-covid-19.aspx. For\na discussion of the results on mask-wearing, see Edward S. Knotek II, Raphael S. Schoenle, Alexander M. Dietrich,\nGernot J. Müller, Kristian Ove R. Myrseth, and Michael Weber (2020) “Consumers and COVID-19: Survey Results\non Mask-Wearing Behaviors and Beliefs,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary 2020–20.\nhttps://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-ec-202020.\n5\n\n\f8\nwill take continued fiscal and monetary policy support to limit lasting damage to the economy and\nachieve a sustainable recovery.\n\nPolicy Actions\nBoth the federal government and the Federal Reserve took swift and significant actions to provide\nhouseholds and businesses with relief during the shutdown. Fiscal policymakers made grants to\nindividuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities. They offered\nexpanded unemployment benefits and loans to small businesses that turn into grants if they maintain their\npayrolls. It is clear that these programs made a significant difference; it is also clear that more fiscal\nsupport is needed to provide a bridge for households, small businesses, and state and local municipalities\nthat have borne the brunt of the economic shutdown until the recovery is sustainably in place.\n\nAs one indicator of the need, I point you to recent analysis by a Brookings Institution researcher of data\nfrom the Census Bureau’s Pulse Survey from the third week in June. These data show that 16.5 percent\nof households with children reported that sometimes or often their children were not eating enough due to\na lack of resources. This is more than 5 times as high as in 2018. It translates into 14 million children,\nwhich is over 2-1/2 times the number at the peak of the Great Recession.6\n\nUnlike the federal government, the Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken\nsignificant actions to ensure that financial markets have enough liquidity to continue to function well and\nthat credit can flow to households and businesses. Actions include buying Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities to address strains in these markets, and setting up a variety of so-called 13(3)\nfacilities. These emergency lending facilities, with the backing of the U.S. Treasury, serve as a backstop\nto other key credit markets and support the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state\n6\nLauren Bauer, “About 14 Million Children in the U.S. Are Not Getting Enough to Eat,” Up Front, The Brookings\nInstitution, July 9, 2020. (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/09/about-14-million-children-in-the-usare-not-getting-enough-to-eat/)\n\n\f9\nand local governments. The Fed is also ensuring that our central bank counterparties abroad have access\nto dollar funding. Because much of the flow of credit to households and businesses relies on the banking\nsystem, the Fed has encouraged banks to use its discount window as a source of liquidity and to work\nwith their borrowers affected by the virus. The Fed has temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory\nrequirements and supervisory oversight so that banks have greater capacity to lend, but it has also\nsuspended share buybacks, limited dividend distributions, and is requiring large banks to reassess their\nlong-run capital plans to ensure they remain adequately capitalized to sustain lending through the\ndownturn. Since March, the FOMC has set its fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent. At our\nmeeting last week, we reiterated that we expect to maintain this target range until we are confident that\nthe economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price\nstability goals.\n\nThe portfolio of Fed actions has helped to relieve stress in financial markets, improve market functioning,\nsupport the flow of credit to businesses and households, and contribute to very accommodative financial\nconditions in support of economic activity.\n\nAs the economy emerges from the reopening phase and moves into the recovery phase, the focus of Fed\npolicy will expand from supporting market functioning and the flow of credit to ensuring that appropriate\nmonetary policy accommodation remains in place to support the economy’s return to more normal levels\nof economic activity and employment and inflation’s moving back up. Although our policy rate is\nalready at its effective lower bound, the tools that we used to support the recovery from the Great\nRecession, including forward guidance about the future path of policy and purchases of longer-term\nTreasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities, can be used to provide additional accommodation.\nClear communications about our policy strategy, which is part of our current review of our monetary\n\n\f10\npolicy framework, can also make the monetary policy actions we take more effective. 7 As Fed Chair\nPowell indicated in his recent press conference, we plan to wrap up the review in the near future.8\n\nBy the end of this year, I expect that output will still be about 6 percent below its level at the end of last\nyear; that the unemployment rate will remain elevated, at around 9 percent or so; and that inflation will be\nwell below our 2 percent goal. Of course, the uncertainty around this forecast is extremely high: we are\nin an unprecedented situation and outcomes depend not only on appropriate economic policy but also on\npublic health considerations. The increase in virus cases that we’ve seen in recent weeks has raised the\ndownside risks to the outlook and is a stark reminder that there are several different scenarios that could\nplay out. While there are many uncertainties, there is one thing you can be certain of: the Federal Reserve\nis committed to using all of its policy tools to provide relief to households and businesses, to foster\nstability in the financial system, and to support the recovery back to maximum employment and price\nstability in service to the public.\n\nFor information about the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary policy framework, including strategy, tools,\nand communications, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-toolsand-communications.htm.\n7\n\nSee “Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference,” July 29, 2020\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200729.pdf).\n\n8\n\n\fCharts for “The Economy and Monetary Policy\nin Our Challenging Times”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nEconomists on the Economy\nCouncil for Economic Education\nNew York, NY\n(via videoconference)\nJune 17, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me start by thanking Nan Morrison and the Council for Economic Education for the opportunity to\nspeak today. I have the pleasure of serving on the council’s board so I have seen firsthand the important\nwork the council is doing to increase economic and financial literacy in the country. As the council’s\nmission statement explains, equipping students with this knowledge can help them make better decisions\nfor themselves, their families, and their communities. It is noteworthy that despite the burdens of the\npandemic, the council has found creative ways to carry on its mission, including its support of teachers,\nthe National Economics Challenge, and this speakers’ series.\n\nToday, before we open it up to questions, I’ll give you an update on the economy and on the Federal\nReserve’s policy response. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Current Economy\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all\nover the world. This is an unprecedented situation and unprecedented actions have been taken in\nresponse. The country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus,\nresulting in a shutdown of much of the economy starting in March. This was an investment in public\nhealth that bought some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, for\ndoctors and scientists to learn more about the disease itself, and for the country to begin to develop tests\nand treatments. But at the same time, the effect of the shutdown on the economy was swift and severe.\n\n[FIGURE 1] In the first quarter, real output declined at a 5 percent annual rate, with real consumption\ndown almost 7 percent and nonresidential business fixed investment down nearly 8 percent. These\ndeclines reflect what occurred in a single month, March. Earlier this month, the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee determined that economic activity peaked in\n\n\f2\nFebruary and that the U.S. economy entered a recession. I anticipate that the second quarter will show the\nmost severe effects of the pandemic shutdown on economic activity. Most private-sector forecasts for\nsecond quarter GDP growth range from minus 25 down to minus 40 percent, measured at an annual rate.\nI agree that second quarter growth could be the largest quarterly decline on record.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity led to both headline and core inflation readings moving down in\nMarch and April. I expect inflation to decline further this year because the sharp pullback in demand will\noutweigh any upward pressure coming from limited supplies of certain goods and services.\n\nIn recent weeks, states have begun to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, and we are beginning\nto see some positive signs in the data. Retail sales rebounded significantly in May, with sales up in all\nmajor categories. In the Fourth District, which includes Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and\nWest Virginia, some activities have picked up faster than our business contacts had expected. Tourism\nactivity increased after Memorial Day and foot traffic at retail stores in the region moved up. Even so,\nabout 40 percent of our contacts do not expect activity to recover to pre-pandemic levels for at least a\nyear.\n\nAs more regions and sectors of the economy reopen, rates of growth are going to look very good, but we\nare digging out from a very deep hole and it is more informative to think in terms of levels.\n\nOne of the most positive pieces of news we’ve received is the employment report for May. Instead of\nrising as most economists expected, the unemployment rate fell. And instead of losing jobs, payrolls\nincreased by 2.5 million jobs. This is great news and points to some stabilization in the labor market after\ntwo months of deep declines. I am hoping we will continue to see positive reports over coming months as\nmore of the economy opens up.\n\n\f3\nBut it is also important to put May’s report into perspective.\n\n[FIGURE 3] In April, the unemployment rate surged to 14.7 percent. In May, it fell to 13.3 percent, still\nconsiderably above its previous peak in October 2009, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and well\nabove the 3.5 percent it was as recently as February. In May, 21 million workers were unemployed\ncompared with 6 million in February. That is about one in 12 Americans aged 16 or older. This is worse\nthan in October 2009, when about one in 15 people were unemployed.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The gain of 2.5 million jobs in May was a record monthly gain, but it is only about 11\npercent of the job losses in March and April.\n\n[FIGURE 5] In fact, the level of employment is near the lows we saw right after the Great Recession. So\nthat means the economy has lost almost all of the jobs it added over the entire expansion of 10-plus years.\nEmployment is 13 percent below February’s level.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market is even sharper than these numbers indicate. Many people left the\nwork force at the beginning of the shutdown and they do not show up in the unemployment rate, and\nmany workers had their hours cut. Our survey of firms in the Fourth District indicates that while layoffs\nbegan to slow in May, firms have recalled workers more slowly than they originally intended to.\n\nMoreover, the improvements in May were not evenly shared. Indeed, half of the net private-sector job\nlosses since February have been in the leisure and hospitality and the retail trade sectors, the two sectors\nranked lowest in terms of average hourly earnings.\n\n\f4\n[FIGURE 6] The unemployment rates among blacks and Hispanics have been chronically above those of\nwhites and Asians. Over the long expansion, we had finally seen some progress being made on that front,\nas the gap in unemployment rates narrowed. But the pandemic has increased the disparities. All groups\nhave experienced an increase in their unemployment rate since February, but the increase was less for\nwhites than for the other groups. And in May, the unemployment rate for both blacks and Asians\ncontinued to edge up rather than fall. It is particularly distressing that much of the sacrifice over the\npandemic period is being borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority\nworkers and communities, and the smaller of the small businesses.\n\n[FIGURE 7] And it shines a bright light on long-standing economic inequality that needs to be addressed\nif the economy is to perform up to its potential. Like the Council for Economic Education, I believe that\neducation is a path to better economic outcomes for individuals, households, and the country at large. Our\nwork force has become more educated over time. But the likelihood of completing a degree varies by\nrace. Graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have risen over time, but those of blacks remain\nwell below those of these other groups and have shown no progress over time. Economic well-being rises\nwith education, so if more is not done to ensure that blacks who enter college have the support to\ncomplete their degrees, economic inequality is likely to continue to rise.1\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\nLet me now turn to the outlook and policy. Macroeconomic forecasting is particularly challenging at this\ntime. With states relaxing stay-at-home restrictions, I expect economic activity to pick up in the second\nhalf of the year. But there is considerable uncertainty about what the recovery will look like after the\n\nSee Loretta J.

The shape of the recovery will depend on the path of the virus and our ability to\nhandle its spread through testing, contact tracing, treatment, and risk-focused restrictions on activity. It\nwill also depend on the behavior of households and businesses and how comfortable they feel in reengaging in economic activity. The Cleveland Fed’s daily national survey of households suggests widely\nvarying views about the pandemic and how people plan to behave. About 60 percent of the respondents\nthink the pandemic will last a year or less, and on average, this group says they are likely to return to their\npre-pandemic usage of bars and restaurants, public spaces, public transportation, and crowded events.\nThe other 40 percent of the respondents expect the pandemic to last more than a year, and on average, this\ngroup says they will not engage in these activities to the same extent they once did, even after the\npandemic has ended. 2 It will be important to continue to monitor household and business attitudes in\nassessing the outlook.\n\nThe other important factor that will determine the path of the recovery is how successful policy actions\nare in ensuring that the temporary disruption in activity we have seen so far does not cause lasting damage\nto the economy and that the recovery has enough support to be sustained.\n\nLet me discuss some of these policy actions and then talk about the outlook. Both the federal government\nand the Federal Reserve took significant actions quickly to provide households and businesses with relief\nduring the shutdown. Fiscal policymakers made grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by\nthe pandemic, and states and municipalities. They have expanded unemployment benefits and have\nfunded the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides small businesses with loans that turn into grants\nif they maintain their payrolls. As the magnitude of the need has come into better focus, the federal\ngovernment has increased its level of support. Although the amount of support has been sizable, so is the\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s website provides updates of these survey results each Wednesday on the Consumers and\nCOVID-19 page, https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/consumers-and-covid-19.aspx.\n\n2\n\n\f6\ndepth of the economic downturn. In my view, further direct fiscal support will be needed for states and\nmunicipal governments and for households most affected by the pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken significant actions and has\ncommitted to using its full set of tools to support the economy, guided by our congressional mandate to\npromote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, the Fed began taking actions to help ensure that financial markets have enough\nliquidity to continue to function well. Well-functioning financial markets are what allow credit to flow to\nhouseholds and businesses and monetary policy to effectively transmit to broader financial conditions. So\nwhen conditions became strained, the Fed began buying Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and conducted operations in the repo market to ease those strains. At our meeting last week,\nthe FOMC said that over the coming months, the Fed would increase its holdings of Treasuries and\nmortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.\n\nThe Fed has also set up emergency lending facilities, with the backing of the U.S. Treasury, to serve as a\nbackstop to other key credit markets, including money market mutual funds and the commercial paper\nmarket. The Fed is also ensuring that our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar\nfunding. Although volatility and risk spreads have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, there has been a\nsignificant lessening of stress and an improvement in market functioning in many markets since these\nactions have been taken.\n\n\f7\nAnother set of our emergency lending facilities focuses more directly on supporting the flow of credit to\nhouseholds, to businesses of all sizes, and to state and local governments. 3 Included in this group are the\nMunicipal Liquidity Facility, which purchases short-term notes from states to help them manage cashflow pressures, and the Main Street Lending Program, which supports lending to small and medium-sized\nbusinesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the pandemic. Based on\nconsultations with both lenders and potential borrowers, the Fed has adjusted the terms on some of these\nprograms to ensure that they will support the economy as effectively as they can while safeguarding\ntaxpayer funds. And earlier this week the Fed announced it was seeking public feedback on a proposed\nexpansion of the Main Street program to nonprofits, which provide vital services in the economy.\n\nBecause much of the flow of credit to households and businesses relies on the banking system, the Fed\nhas encouraged banks to use its discount window as a source of liquidity and to work with their borrowers\naffected by the virus. The Fed has temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements and\nsupervisory oversight so that banks have greater capacity to lend.\n\nLast, but not least, in March the FOMC reduced its target range for the fed funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent.\nAt our meeting last week, we maintained the funds rate at that level and reiterated that we expect to\nmaintain this target range until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on\ntrack to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nAs more states relax restrictions on activity, the economy is moving from a shutdown phase, through a reopening phase, and into a recovery phase. As this happens, the focus of Fed policy will expand from\nsupporting market functioning and the flow of credit to supporting the recovery. I expect to see an\n\nIn addition to the Municipal Liquidity and the Main Street Lending Program, these facilities include the Paycheck\nProtection Program Liquidity Facility, the Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities, and the Term\nAsset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. More information on the Federal Reserve’s actions in response to the effects\nof the coronavirus on the economy is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/covid-19.htm.\n\n3\n\n\f8\nimprovement in the second half of the year as the economy reopens. But after that, I believe it will take\nquite some time for economic activity and job levels to approach more normal levels. The improvement\nwill vary across sectors, because even if people can resume some of their normal activities, they need to\nfeel some reassurance that it is safe to do so. In some industries, like travel and leisure and hospitality, it\nwill likely take quite a while longer for activity to pick up than in others. By the end of this year, I expect\nthat output will still be about 6 percent below its level at the end of last year, and the unemployment rate,\nwhile down from its peak, will still be around 9 percent. I expect inflation to remain below our 2 percent\ngoal for some time to come.\n\nIn my view, very accommodative monetary policy will be needed to support the recovery and the return\nto the FOMC’s goals of price stability and maximum employment over time. My economic forecast is\nvery similar to the median forecasts of the FOMC participants that were released last week, which show\nan economic recovery starting in the second half of the year and continuing over the next couple of years.\nAlmost all of my FOMC colleagues agree with me that it will be appropriate for the fed funds rate to\nremain at its current level through 2022, the end of our projection horizon, in support of the recovery. 4\n\nOver the next several weeks as more states reopen, we will get further readings on the condition of the\neconomy. The uncertainty surrounding the outlook is extremely high because we are in an unprecedented\nsituation. Outcomes depend not only on appropriate economic policy but also on public health\nconsiderations. Epidemiologists tell us to expect periodic upswings in the number of cases until a vaccine\ncan be distributed. We are seeing that today in some locations. People often say that the virus determines\nthe timeline. I agree, but that does not mean we are helpless to affect the outcomes. Increased investment\nwould speed up the progress on testing, contact tracing, and treatments, and help ensure that the\nhealthcare system has adequate capacity. Better adherence to the guidelines on social distancing, mask\n\nSee Press Conference Projection Materials, June 10, 2020\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20200610.htm).\n\n4\n\n\f9\nwearing, and hygiene would help to control the virus’s spread. These actions would make it safer for\npeople to re-engage in activity and would allow for interventions to become more focused on helping\nthose at highest risk from the disease, thereby supporting the recovery. And May’s positive employment\nand retail sales reports remind us of the resiliency of the U.S. economy. Of course, if the number of cases\nof the virus is not well-controlled and the healthcare system gets overwhelmed, then the economic\noutcomes I have discussed could turn out to be much more dire, with people and businesses restricting\ntheir own activity even if states do not reinstate restrictions.\n\nSo at this juncture, I think it makes sense for monetary policymakers to continue to monitor the economy\nas the country begins to re-engage in economic activity, to continue to support the flow of credit to\nhouseholds and businesses and ensure the smooth functioning of financial markets, to remember that\nthere are several different scenarios that could play out, and to stand ready to use all of our tools to\nmitigate lasting damage and to support the economy’s recovery back to maximum employment and price\nstability.\n\n\fCharts for “The Outlook for the Economy\nand Federal Reserve Policy”\nLoretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPOWER Series\nCFA Society Chicago\nChicago, IL\n(via videoconference)\nMay 12, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the CFA Society Chicago and the CFA’s Women’s Network for inviting me to speak today. In\npreparing my remarks, I noticed that the last formal speech I gave on the economy was on March 3,\nwhich seems like a lifetime ago, and it was in London, which seems like a world away. A lot has\nhappened since then. So before the question and answer portion of today’s session, I’d like to start with a\nbrief update on the economy and the Federal Reserve’s policy response. As always, the views I’ll present\nare my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all\nover the world. I want to express my deepest sympathies to those who have been affected by the virus.\nThis is an unprecedented situation. In the interests of public health, the country has taken aggressive\nsocial distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus, resulting in a shutdown of much of the\neconomy. This investment in public health is buying time for the healthcare system to increase its\ncapacity to care for the sick, for doctors and scientists to learn more about the disease itself, and for the\ncountry to develop tests and treatments. This investment is beginning to pay off in terms of fewer new\nhospitalizations in some locations. We owe a great deal of thanks to the healthcare workers, public health\nofficials, scientists, and all those who support them as they battle the virus, and to all the people working\nin essential activities, including grocery stores, delivery companies, and municipal services, whose\ndedication allows many of us to stay safely at home.\n\nWhile the shutdown has yielded public health benefits, its effects on the economy have been swift and\nsevere. In the first quarter, real output declined at a nearly 5 percent annual rate, with real consumption\ndown over 7-1/2 percent and nonresidential business fixed investment down nearly 9 percent. And these\nsharp declines reflect mainly what occurred in just one month, March. In April, the unemployment rate\nsurged to 14.7 percent, its highest level since the Great Depression. Remember, it was only this past\n\n\f2\nFebruary when the unemployment rate was a low 3.5 percent. Over the past two months, payrolls\ndeclined by more than 21 million jobs; that is nearly the same the number of jobs added over the entire\n10-plus-year expansion. There were losses across all major sectors. The deterioration in the labor market\nis even sharper than these numbers indicate. A large number of people left the workforce last month and\nthey do not show up in the unemployment rate, and many workers had their hours cut. Certainly, this is\nthe worst and speediest deterioration in the labor market many of us have ever seen.\n\nBoth headline and core inflation readings moved down in March, reflecting the drop in oil prices due to\nboth supply and demand conditions in global markets, and the start of the shutdown in activity. I expect\ninflation will move down further this year because the sharp pullback in demand will outweigh any\nupward pressure due to limited supply in certain goods and services.\n\nOur outreach at the Cleveland Fed is painting a very painful picture. Since mid-March, we have watched\nconfidence among regional businesses and households drop from week to week as the negative effects of\nthe virus have risen. Regional firms are taking defensive positions, pulling back from risk taking,\nconserving cash, putting capital expenditures on hold, and drawing on their credit lines. At the start of the\nshutdown, many told us that they intended to keep their employees on their payrolls, but over time, an\nincreasing number have felt the need to lay off or furlough workers. The Cleveland Fed’s national survey\nof consumers indicates that most respondents initially thought the virus outbreak would last less than six\nmonths. More now believe it will last one year, and a growing number think it could last two years.1\n\nIn some sense, the sharp contraction we are seeing should not come as a surprise: it is a direct result of the\nnecessary actions taken to shut down activity to try to limit the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, the\nnumbers are eye-popping. And it is worth noting that much of the sacrifice is being borne by the most\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s website provides updates of these survey results each Wednesday on the Consumers and\nCOVID-19 page, https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/consumers-and-covid-19.aspx.\n1\n\n\f3\nvulnerable in our economy: lower-income workers and communities and small businesses. In fact, the\njob losses in April fell disproportionately on lower-wage workers. This resulted in a sharp rise in average\nhourly earnings in the report, which was not indicative of the state of the job market. Our outreach paints\na more accurate picture. Over three-quarters of the regional community development organizations\nrecently surveyed by the Cleveland Fed said that the low- and moderate-income areas they serve are\nexperiencing significant disruptions that will hamper recovery.\n\nI anticipate that the second quarter will show the most severe effects on the economy. Given the\nunprecedented nature of the shutdown, private-sector forecasters are offering a wide range of estimates\nfor second quarter real GDP growth, with most falling in the range of minus 25 to minus 40 percent. My\nown estimate is in the middle of this range, but with numbers so bad, the precision seems less relevant. I\nanticipate that the reported unemployment rate is likely to go up further, perhaps to 20 percent or even\nmore.\n\nLooking ahead, parts of the country are beginning to relax some of the stay-at-home orders, and economic\nactivity will likely begin to pick up in the second half of the year. But these are still early days, and there\nis considerable uncertainty around what the recovery will look like. It will depend on the evolution of the\nvirus and the success of our methods to control its spread while it is still among us. It will also depend on\nhow successful policy actions are in ensuring that the temporary disruption in activity does not cause\nmore persistent damage to the economy and that the economy is well staged for a recovery. Let me\ndiscuss some of these policy actions and then talk about the outlook.\n\nUnprecedented times require unprecedented actions. Both the federal government and the Federal\nReserve took action quickly. These relief efforts can be viewed as building a bridge to get households\nand businesses from the generally good economy we had in February to the other side of the pandemic\nshutdown period. The shutdown period has lengthened over time, driven by the course of the disease. So\n\n\f4\nthe bridge has to be longer than first assumed, and it also has to be wider, as more households and firms\nare in need of some kind of help.\n\nFiscal policymakers have taken significant actions, including making grants to individuals, certain\nbusinesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities. They have expanded\nunemployment benefits and have funded the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides small\nbusinesses with loans that turn into grants if they maintain their payrolls. As the magnitude of the need\nhas come into better focus, the federal government has increased its level of support. Although the\namount of support has been sizable, so is the depth of the economic downturn. In my view, further direct\nfiscal support will be needed if we are to avoid the longer-lasting damage to the economy that would\nhappen if job losses become persistent and a large share of otherwise viable businesses fail.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken significant actions and has\ncommitted to using its full set of tools to support the economy, guided by our congressional mandate to\npromote maximum employment and price stability. The actions fall into three general categories. First,\nsome of the Fed’s actions focus on ensuring that financial markets have enough liquidity to continue to\nfunction well. Well-functioning financial markets allow credit to flow to households and businesses and\nmonetary policy to effectively transmit to broader financial conditions. The Fed aggressively responded\nto stresses in the U.S. Treasury market by purchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and by conducting operations in the repo market. With the approval and financial backing of\nthe U.S. Treasury, the Fed is also setting up emergency lending facilities to serve as a backstop to other\nkey credit markets, including money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. And the Fed\nis ensuring that primary dealers have access to liquidity and that our central bank counterparties abroad\nhave access to dollar funding. Although volatility and risk spreads have not returned to pre-pandemic\nlevels, there has been a significant lessening of stress and an improvement in market functioning in many\nmarkets since these actions have been taken.\n\n\f5\n\nA second set of Fed actions focuses more directly on supporting the flow of credit to households, to\nbusinesses of all sizes, and to state and local governments. These programs include the Paycheck\nProtection Program Liquidity Facility, the Main Street Lending Program, the Primary and Secondary\nMarket Corporate Credit Facilities, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, and the Municipal\nLiquidity Facility.2 Based on consultations with both lenders and potential borrowers, the Fed adjusted\nthe terms on some of these programs to ensure that they will support the economy as effectively as they\ncan while safeguarding taxpayer funds.\n\nThe third category of Fed actions focuses on banks because much of the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses relies on the banking system. The Fed has encouraged banks to use its discount window as a\nsource of liquidity and to work with their borrowers affected by the virus. The Board of Governors has\ntemporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements and supervisory oversight so that banks have\ngreater capacity to lend in a safe and sound manner through the downturn. Our current situation\nhighlights the value of a resilient banking system, one that builds up sufficient capital and liquidity\nbuffers in good economic times in preparation for bad ones.\n\nWhile this is a long list of actions, the Fed continues to look for gaps where our tools can be used to\nbenefit the economy. For example, the Board of Governors is evaluating an approach to meet the needs\nof nonprofits, including institutions of higher education, because they play an important role in the\neconomy. And I shouldn’t conclude this list of policy actions without discussing our usual tool of\nmonetary policy, the federal funds rate. The FOMC has reduced its target range for the fed funds rate to\n0 to 1/4 percent, and we have said that we expect to maintain this target range until we are confident that\nthe economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price\n\nMore information on the Federal Reserve’s actions in response to the effects of the coronavirus on the economy is\navailable at https://www.federalreserve.gov/covid-19.htm.\n2\n\n\f6\nstability goals. Low rates cannot stop the sharp drop in activity caused by the pandemic shutdown, but\nonce the economy begins to reopen, accommodative monetary policy will be needed for some time to\nsupport the recovery.\n\nSo what might that recovery look like? A reasonable baseline outlook is that as some of the stay-at-home\nrestrictions are lifted, the economy will begin to grow again in the second half of this year and\nunemployment will begin to move down, with continued recovery in 2021. I would expect this\nimprovement to start off slowly, with variation across sectors, because even if people can resume some of\ntheir normal activities, they need to feel some reassurance that it is safe to do so. In some industries, like\ntravel and leisure and hospitality, it will likely take quite a while longer for activity to pick up than in\nothers. Under this baseline, by the end of this year, output would still be below its level at the end of last\nyear, by 5 percent or even somewhat more, and the unemployment rate would still be in the high single\ndigits or low double digits. I expect inflation to remain low for the remainder of this year and for some\ntime to come.\n\nAchieving this outcome depends on a number of things falling into place. It depends on there being a\nsolid enough bridge of economic relief and support. It depends on the relaxation of stay-at-home\nrestrictions being based on public health criteria and being done in a careful and responsible way,\nrespecting guidelines on social distancing, mask-wearing, and hygiene. It depends on more progress\nbeing made on testing and treatments so that the virus can be better controlled and people feel safe reengaging in activity. And it depends on the medical system being prepared to handle the periodic\nincreases in cases that epidemiologists tell us to expect. These are a lot of conditions, which is another\nway of saying there is considerable risk around this outcome. It isn’t difficult to imagine more\npessimistic scenarios, especially if an upsurge in virus cases necessitates shutting down activity again or if\nthere is considerably more harm in terms of business and personal bankruptcies or if instabilities in the\n\n\f7\nbanking system arise. At this point, I think some of the more pessimistic outcomes are almost as likely as\nthe reasonable baseline I just described.\n\nSo I think it makes sense for policymakers to continue to monitor the economy, continue to support the\nflow of credit to households and businesses and the smooth functioning of financial markets, evaluate\nseveral scenarios rather than focusing only on a modal forecast, and stand ready to address the challenges\nthat will arise as the country incrementally re-engages in economic activity as the year progresses.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Statement Regarding My Dissenting Vote at the Meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee Held on March 15, 2020*\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nMarch 17, 2020\n\n*\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f1\nI usually discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy in public speeches. Because of the\ncoronavirus, my upcoming speeches have been canceled, so I am providing this statement in lieu of a\nspeech.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, I dissented from the action of the majority of the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC). As the post-meeting statement issued by the Committee notes, I was fully supportive of all of\nthe actions taken to promote the smooth functioning of markets and the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses but preferred to reduce the target range of the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent instead of\nto 0 to 1/4 percent as was done.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is harming communities and disrupting economic activity in the U.S. and other\ncountries. In the Fourth Federal Reserve District and elsewhere in the country, steps are being taken to\nprotect people’s health, including practicing social distancing, canceling gatherings, and closing schools.\nWhen they are able to, businesses have invoked work-from-home practices and many have restricted all\nnonessential travel. These are necessary steps taken in the interest of public health. There will be a sharp\npullback in economic activity, at least in the near term, as the country focuses on tackling the challenges\nposed by the virus. The recent fiscal policy actions to increase access to testing and healthcare for those\nwho are sick, to support public and private healthcare providers who are dealing with virus containment\nand the treatment of ill patients, and to help workers and small businesses that will be most affected by\nwork stoppages are the types of government policy measures that can be most helpful in defending\nagainst the adverse consequences of the disease for individuals and the economy.\n\nIn the wake of the widening spread of the virus and the rising level of uncertainty it brings, global\nfinancial conditions have tightened considerably, as investors, businesses, and financial institutions\nreassess their tolerance for risk and their economic outlooks. In the week leading up to our recent FOMC\nmeeting, increased stress and illiquidity were seen in financial markets, including the U.S. Treasury\n\n\f2\nmarket, a foundational market for the world’s financial system. In response, the Federal Reserve\nexpanded its overnight and term repurchase agreement operations to help to improve liquidity, and I fully\nsupported this action. However, illiquid market conditions continued.\n\nLack of liquidity in financial markets is a first-order problem that can reverberate through the financial\nsystem and the economy and hinder the transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. It is\ncritical that there is sufficient liquidity to allow markets to function in an orderly way so that credit\ncontinues to flow to households and businesses. So I fully supported all of the actions that the Federal\nReserve announced on March 15 to help ensure that there is adequate liquidity in financial markets so that\ntrades can be made and credit can continue to flow. These measures include increasing our holdings of\nU.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities; lowering the rate on the standing U.S. dollar\nliquidity swap arrangements; reducing the spread between the rate at which depository institutions can\nborrow at the Federal Reserve’s discount window (the primary credit rate) and the top of the federal funds\nrate target range to 0 basis points; instituting term discount window lending; encouraging banks to use the\nliquidity and intraday credit available at the Federal Reserve’s discount window and to use their own\ncapital and liquidity buffers as they lend to households and businesses affected by the coronavirus; and\nreducing reserve requirement ratios to zero percent.\n\nIf market illiquidity continues, I will support our taking further actions to address funding needs,\nincluding activating facilities like those the Federal Reserve has used in the past, including the\ncommercial paper funding facility, to help ensure access to credit by small businesses, and the term\nauction facility to auction term funds to depository institutions should their use of the discount window\nprove insufficient.\n\nWhen markets are not functioning well, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy\nis disrupted, and any reduction in the target federal funds rate will have less of an impact on the real\n\n\f3\neconomy. In current circumstances, with social distancing and the stoppage of spending activity, rate cuts\nare also less impactful. I dissented because I viewed a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate as\nappropriate, in support of the liquidity actions we were taking and in light of the outlook. I did not favor\nreturning the funds rate to zero and using up all of our interest-rate policy space at this time when the\ntransmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy is impaired. I preferred to stage our policy\nactions by first providing liquidity to improve market functioning, supported by a smaller reduction in the\nfunds rate. This would have preserved the option of a further cut in the funds rate, if needed, for a time\nwhen market functioning had improved and such an action could be expected to be most effective in\nsupporting the economy as it emerges from the health crisis after the medical response has been put in\nplace, new cases of the virus have begun to stabilize, social distancing has eased, and life begins to return\nto some semblance of normal.\n\nDespite my dissent at our recent meeting, I have the utmost respect for Chair Jay Powell and other\ncolleagues on the FOMC who reached a different conclusion than I did and for the Federal Reserve’s\npolicymaking process, which allows for a full discussion of the issues and the opportunity to express\ndissenting views, as we all work to set monetary policy to promote our longer-run goals of price stability\nand maximum employment on behalf of the American public.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nShadow Open Market Committee\nNew York, NY\nMarch 6, 2020\n\n*\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f1\nA tradition at FOMC meetings is that the research directors go out for dinner the night before the\nmeetings. Sometimes some of the Reserve Bank presidents join this group. Shortly after I had been\nappointed research director at the Philadelphia Fed in 2000, a group of us, which included my president\nand Marvin Goodfriend, were walking to dinner when an accident happened. In the midst of a robust\nconversation, the Philadelphia Fed president walked into a metal parking sign and cut his forehead. The\nprospect of losing the Bank’s president to a bout of tetanus flashed through my mind: it was clear he had\nto go to the emergency room to get patched up. It took some convincing, but he and I headed over to\nGeorge Washington University hospital where he was quickly taken to the back for triage. That was the\nlast I saw of him for a very long time. If any of you have ever experienced the waiting area of a large\nurban emergency room you understand that it’s not the most comfortable place to be. After a couple of\nhours, you can imagine my surprise when I saw Marvin Goodfriend walking through the emergency room\ndoor. Dinner was over and he had come back to check on me, knowing it was going to be a long night. I\nhave never forgotten this act of kindness and caring for an individual. I tell you this story now to\nillustrate the kind of person Marvin was. He a great scholar who advanced knowledge in the field of\nmonetary policy, not just out of intellectual curiosity but because he cared about people. He understood\nthat if policymakers did things right they could improve how the economy works for real people. I feel\nvery fortunate to be a part of this conference that honors Marvin Goodfriend and recognizes his many\ncontributions to the theory and practice of monetary policy.\n\nOur session discusses the contributions Marvin made to our understanding of the role of transparency and\ncommunication in monetary policymaking. I will frame my remarks around the two things Marvin\nindicated in his confirmation hearing statement that he would pursue if confirmed. First, Marvin planned\nto draw on his “academic and professional experience to promote policies that would further increase\ntransparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve.”1 This is a worthy pursuit. Congress has given\n\n“Statement of Marvin Goodfriend, Nominee to be a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem” before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, January 23, 2018.\n(https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/01-23-18%20Goodfriend%20Testimony.pdf)\n1\n\n\f2\nthe Fed a mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, and it has given the Fed\nindependence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. This independence has been\nshown to yield better economic outcomes. But a central bank cannot expect to remain independent from\nthe political process unless it is held accountable for its policy decisions and is transparent about the basis\nfor these decisions.\n\nMarvin was a strong advocate of transparency in monetary policymaking and clear communications about\nthe strategy policymakers use to set policy. He was also a persuasive advocate: many of Marvin’s\nsuggestions that were contrary to how policy setting was being done at the time have become standard\noperating practice in central banking. Recall that it wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to explicitly\nannounce changes in its fed funds rate target. At a time when the Federal Reserve was still quite\nsecretive, Marvin argued that more transparency would confer social benefits by helping to align markets’\nand policymakers’ expectations.2 Well before the Fed adopted its explicit numerical inflation target in\n2012, Marvin had been explaining the benefits such an explicit goal could play in anchoring inflation\nexpectations. He argued further that the Fed’s actions and its communications needed to be designed so\nas to make this goal a credible commitment on the part of the Fed. One way to do this is to ensure that\npolicymakers are taking a systematic approach to setting policy, which can help align the public’s policy\nexpectations with policy decisions, thereby helping to transmit monetary policy to the broader economy.\nPolicy rules are one way to foster systematic policymaking and Marvin suggested that the FOMC refer to\na Taylor-type rule when explaining its policy decisions.3\n\nSee, for example, Goodfriend, Marvin, “Monetary Mystique: Secrecy and Central Banking,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics, 17 (January 1986), pp. 63-92. (https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3932(86)90006-1)\n2\n\nGoodfriend, Marvin, “The Fed Needs a Credible Commitment to Price Stability,” testimony before the\nSubcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives,\nMarch 16, 2017. (https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/03.16.2017_marvin_goodfriend_testimony.pdf)\n3\n\n\f3\nThe FOMC has been reluctant to relinquish policymaking to following a simple rule because no one rule\nworks well enough across a variety of economic models and circumstances, and judgment will likely\nalways need to be a part of policymaking. Nonetheless, rules provide useful benchmarks. The Board of\nGovernors has begun to include a discussion of rules as benchmarks in the monetary policy report.4 In\nsome of my speeches I have referred to simple rules that have been shown to yield good economic\noutcomes as reference points to explain my own views of appropriate policy.5 The Cleveland Fed’s\nwebsite regularly updates the outcomes of seven simple policy rules across several forecasts.6\n\nOf course, one of the communications challenges for the FOMC continues to be how to convey to the\npublic a good sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy evolves without\nimplying that policy is pre-committed to a particular policy path regardless of how the economy evolves.\nMy own view is that if the Committee were willing to expand what it says in its post-meeting statement, it\ncould give a better sense of its reaction function, its medium-run outlook, the risks around the outlook,\nand policy rationale. The statement could provide a summary of changes in a consistent set of indicators\non inflation, inflation expectations, the unemployment rate, employment growth, output growth, and\nfinancial conditions that the Committee regularly assesses to formulate its outlook and view of\nappropriate policy. The statement would convey whether the accumulated changes in these indicators\nhave materially changed the Committee’s outlook. That outlook and the risks around the outlook would\nalso be summarized. The statement would then describe the Committee’s policy decision, tying that\npolicy to the achievement of its policy goals, given the outlook and risks. The statement would articulate\nthe considerations the Committee would take into account when determining future changes in policy to\n\nSee Board of Governors, “Monetary Policy Report,” February 7, 2020, pp. 33-37.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20200207_mprfullreport.pdf)\n4\n\nSee, for example, Mester, Loretta J., “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy in 2020,” National\nAssociation for Business Economics, 36th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference, Washington, DC, February\n24, 2020. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20200224-outlook-for-the-economyand-monetary-policy-in-2020)\n5\n\nSee “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. (https://www.clevelandfed.org/ourresearch/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules)\n6\n\n\f4\nhelp the public anticipate how policy is likely to change in response to changes in economic\ndevelopments that affect the economic outlook, without having to be prescient about how those\nconditions will actually evolve. Since the FOMC’s assessment of risks is an important part of the policy\ndiscussion, for the four meetings a year in which the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP), the Committee could release the balance of risk graphs that are part of the SEP with\nthe other charts released at the time of the press conference, rather than waiting three weeks to release\nthem with the minutes of the meeting. I believe enhancements like this would allow the FOMC to better\ncontrol the narrative about its economic and policy views and they are consistent with Marvin’s desire to\nincrease FOMC transparency in a productive way.\n\nA second thing Marvin said in his confirmation hearing statement was that his years at the Richmond Fed\n“gave him a deep appreciation of the role of the regional Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System,”\nand that the regional structure encourages diverse perspectives and innovative thinking that he would\nconsider in formulating monetary policy.7 In 1998, Marvin was a presenter at a workshop on the structure\nof the newly formed European Central Bank and laid out some of the benefits of the decentralized\nstructure of the Federal Reserve System.8 The regional structure enhances credibility by making the\ninstitution less prone to political pressure. The diffusion of power across the 12 regional Reserve Banks\nhelps build rapport with constituencies throughout the country. The regional structure also aids\ncommunication. It helps the institution collect information on economic and financial developments\nacross the country. Reserve Banks have boards of directors drawn from the private sector and typically\nhave multiple advisory councils; their presidents and staffs speak regularly with a large number of\ncontacts representing business, labor, consumers, and banking. In a dynamic economy, anecdotal\n\n7\n\nSee “Statement of Marvin Goodfriend (2018).\n\nSee Goodfriend, Marvin, “The Role of a Regional Bank in a System of Central Banks,” Carnegie-Rochester\nConference Series on Public Policy, 51, 1999, pp. 51-71. (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-2231(00)00004-X) and\nreprinted in Economic Quarterly, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 86, Winter 2000, pp. 7-25.\n(https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2000/winter/goodfriend). The workshop\nwas “Monetary Policy of the ESCB: Strategic Implementation Issues,” sponsored by the Bank of Italy, IGIER, and\nBocconi University, July 6-7, 1998, in Milan, Italy.\n8\n\n\f5\ninformation from the regional Reserve Banks can provide early indications of changing sentiment or\ndeveloping trends well before they show up in the data. Because the dispersion of activity across the\ncountry is not even, the regional structure also allows for some specialization in expertise about particular\nindustries relevant to each region, expertise that can be called on when needed.\n\nA further benefit of the regional presence is that it helps the Fed disseminate its policy messages via\nspeeches and presentations made by Reserve Bank officials. In addition, it provides a way to collect\ninformation about the impact of its policy in the community. An example of the power of the regional\nstructure in action was the program of Fed Listens events that the System held as part of its ongoing\nreview of its monetary policy framework. These events were held across the country to gain the\nperspectives of people with diverse backgrounds and in different economic circumstances about how our\ndual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices affect them.9\n\nAs has been documented, the regional Reserve Banks have also been able to provide thought leadership\nwithin the Federal Reserve System.10 Reserve Bank economists regularly interact with academic\neconomists and have provided a way for diverse analytical methods and innovative thinking to enter into\nthe process of monetary policymaking, helping the institution to guard against group think and leading to\nbetter policy outcomes. Ideas such as rational expectations, time consistency, the important roles of\ncredibility and commitment, and inflation targeting first came into the System via a Reserve Bank.11 The\nA summary of the Cleveland Fed’s Fed Listens event is available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/events/2019/policy-summit/fed-listens.aspx. A full list of Fed Listens events is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fedlistens-events.htm.\n9\n\nSee Bordo, Michael D., and Edward S. Prescott, “Federal Reserve Structure, Economic Ideas, and Monetary and\nFinancial Policy,” NBER Working Paper No. 26098, July 2019 and Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Working\nPaper No. 19-13, June 2019.

However, the reality is that the economy is complex and so is monetary\npolicymaking. Different models, techniques, and measurements need to be brought to bear in order to\nassess appropriate monetary policy. Participants on the FOMC bring their perspectives to the table and\nthese perspectives are inputs into the consensus-building process. While the FOMC works hard to get to\na consensus, there will inevitably be times when individual policymakers hold different views. These\ndiverse views are shared with the public and ultimately result in better policymaking as sound ideas gain\ntraction. Indeed, the contributions that Marvin Goodfriend made while he was an economist and policy\nadvisor at the Richmond Fed prove this point. His arguments on the value of transparency and good\ncommunication in monetary policymaking began in the 1980s and ultimately gained traction within the\nSystem. The FOMC can thank Marvin Goodfriend for starting us on our journey toward better policy\ncommunications in support of more effective monetary policy, a journey that continues to this day.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThe Society of Professional Economists\nAnnual Dinner\nLondon, United Kingdom\nMarch 3, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nGood evening. I thank the Society of Professional Economists for inviting me to speak at the society’s\nannual dinner. It is truly an honor to join you and to count myself among the list of distinguished\nspeakers who have addressed you at previous events. This evening I will update you on the outlook for\nthe economy and monetary policy from my side of the pond and on the Federal Reserve’s review of our\nmonetary policy framework: the strategy, tools, and communications we use to make monetary policy.\nAs always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or\nof my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook for the U.S.\nLet me start with the topic on everyone’s mind: the coronavirus. The recent emergence of the coronavirus\nin Wuhan, China, and its spread to other countries in the world, including the U.K. and the U.S., is\ncausing considerable human suffering. It is also clouding the outlook for the global economy. This is a\nrapidly evolving situation that we are continuing to monitor closely. For the U.S. economy, the risks and\nuncertainty surrounding the outlook have increased in a short period of time. In China, the reductions in\ntravel and shutdown in activity are widely expected to cause a sharp decline in output in China in the first\nquarter. China is a large player in the global economy, accounting for 16 percent of global GDP. So\nwhat happens there will have effects in other countries, especially those with strong trade ties to China.\nTrade and supply chain disruptions, travel spending cuts, and declines in consumer and business\nsentiment will also weigh on U.S. growth at least in the first half of the year, as will the extreme moves\nwe have experienced in U.S. financial markets. These moves have reflected a sharp pullback in investors’\nwillingness to take on risk and the flight to quality into U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nAt this point, both the magnitude and duration of the economic effects of the virus are highly uncertain.\nThey will depend on how the disease progresses, the efficacy of the actions countries take to help contain\nthe spread of the virus and treat the sick, public health officials’ contingency planning and\n\n\f2\nimplementation of those plans, and other actions policymakers take to mitigate the effects on sentiment\nand economic activity. Today, the FOMC reduced its target range for the federal funds rate, our policy\nrate, by 50 basis points to 1 to 1-1/4 percent in response to the risks to the outlook.\n\nI am currently putting together the forecast I will submit as part of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic\nProjections, which will be released after the conclusion of our March FOMC meeting in two weeks. In\nstructuring my remarks, I thought it would be helpful to first discuss my views on the U.S. economy\nbefore the emergence of the coronavirus, and then discuss the potential ramifications of this risk.\n\nThe economic expansion in the U.S. is now in its 11th year, the longest expansion on record. The course\nof the expansion has seen its ups and downs, but the resiliency of the U.S. economy has been remarkable.\nLast year, uncertainties around trade policy and tariffs, as well as slow global growth, clouded the U.S.\noutlook. In prior years, the sharp drop in oil prices and strength of the dollar weighed on the U.S.\neconomy. Yet, with support from fiscal and monetary policy, the expansion continued. The Federal\nReserve has a statutory mandate to set U.S. monetary policy to achieve the longer-run goals of price\nstability and maximum employment. Viewed through this lens, the U.S. economy has been performing\nwell.\n\nLast year, real GDP grew at a 2.3 percent pace, above my 2 percent estimate of its longer-run trend and\nbetter than many economists and businesses had expected. Indeed, at the start of last year, concerns\ndeveloped that a sharper slowdown in the economy was a real possibility. In light of the FOMC’s\nreassessment of its outlook and risks, the FOMC’s anticipated path of appropriate monetary policy\nflattened, leading to more accommodative financial conditions that helped to support the expansion. As\nthe year wore on, several downside risks to the outlook worsened and new ones emerged. These risks\nincluded those associated with trade policy and slower global growth, as well as geopolitical risks\nsurrounding the possibility of a “hard” Brexit, social unrest in Hong Kong, and rising tensions in the\n\n\f3\nMiddle East. The FOMC responded to these risks to the outlook by lowering the federal funds rate, our\npolicy rate, a cumulative 75 basis points. More accommodative financial conditions, coupled with some\neasing of trade tensions and uncertainty by the end of the year, helped to support last year’s above-trend\ngrowth.\n\nWith respect to the mix of growth across sectors it has been a tale of two cities. Business spending has\nbeen soft, while consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of output in the U.S., has been\nsolid. Business investment, manufacturing, and exports declined over most of last year. Slow growth\nabroad, especially in Europe and China, and uncertainty over trade policy and tariffs have weakened\ndemand for U.S. exports, which has weighed on the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors.\nProblems with the Boeing 737 MAX airplane also weighed on investment and the decision to halt\nproduction of the plane will be a drag on U.S. growth at least in the first quarter of this year and perhaps\nlonger. On the positive side, some of the uncertainty over trade policy and its impact on business\nsentiment eased with the signing of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the\nPhase One trade deal with China.\n\nIn contrast to soft business spending, consumer spending has been driving the U.S. economy forward, and\nthat has been the case for most of the expansion. Solid fundamentals have helped to support consumer\nspending. Household balance sheets are healthy. Low mortgage rates contributed to the turnaround in\nresidential investment in the second half of 2019, which rose for the first time since the end of 2017.\nHousehold income has been growing, reflecting the solid performance of the labor market.\n\nLast year, firms added an average of 175,000 jobs per month to their payrolls, and in January, an even\nstronger 225,000 jobs were added. So the pace of job growth in the U.S. has been well above trend,\nwhich most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. A benefit of the long expansion is\nthat more people have been drawn into the labor force. The participation rate has held up even though the\n\n\f4\nlarge baby boom generation is aging and leaving the workforce through retirement. The prime-age\nparticipation rate of those between ages 25 and 54 has been rising and is now at its highest level of the\nexpansion, led by women. The unemployment rate, at 3.6 percent, is near its 50-year low; it has fallen\nnearly half of a percentage point over the past year. Broader measures of the unemployment rate that\ninclude discouraged workers and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work are also near\nhistoric lows.\n\nStrong labor markets mean aggregate wages are rising in the U.S., especially for lower paying jobs. But\nwages have not accelerated as much as one might have expected based on the reports from firms about\nhow hard it is to find workers. This could reflect labor mix: older workers exiting the labor force\ntypically are higher paid than those entering. It could also reflect a faster pace of automation, one way\nsome of our business contacts are addressing labor shortages. Other contacts tell us that they don’t\nbelieve raising wages will attract qualified workers and are not willing to go that route to fill positions. It\nremains to be seen how much longer that situation can last, especially if labor markets tighten further.\n\nIn assessing how the labor market is doing relative to what is sustainable over the longer run, we need to\nremain humble. Five years ago, FOMC participants’ estimates of unemployment over the longer run\nranged from 5.0 to 5.8 percent; the current range is 3.5 to 4.5 percent. I’ve brought my estimate down\nover time and recently I’ve been estimating a range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent. But if the unemployment rate\ncontinues at these low rates and wage pressures remain muted, I’m open to lowering my estimate again.\n\nTurning to inflation, the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal is 2 percent, as measured by the year-overyear change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This measure moved up to 2\npercent in 2018, but the increase wasn’t sustained as PCE inflation moved back down in 2019; it stood at\n1.7 percent in January. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices to strip out some\nvolatility, also moved down last year; it now stands at 1.6 percent. But other measures of inflation show\n\n\f5\nfirmer readings, at or above 2 percent.1 These alternative gauges are not a substitute for the PCE inflation\nmeasure that the FOMC has targeted, but they do reduce my concern that inflation will continue to be\nweak. Inflation expectations have been relatively well anchored near 2 percent. Conditional on that,\nresearch done by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research suggests that if labor markets remain\nstrong, then we should see the components of PCE that are more responsive to labor market conditions\ncontinue to firm, helping total PCE inflation return to our 2 percent goal on a sustainable basis over time.2\n\nMonetary Policy\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking and\ndetermine what interest rate path will best achieve the FOMC’s longer-run goals of price stability and\nmaximum employment, based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nAt our meeting at the end of January, the FOMC maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at\n1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. I agreed with this decision because it seemed appropriate to take the opportunity\nto assess the cumulative effects of last year’s policy easing on the economy and whether the economy is\nevolving according to our outlook. Even before last year’s cumulative 75 basis point reduction, monetary\npolicy had become easier as the Committee’s view of the appropriate policy path had flattened. You can\nsee this by looking at FOMC projections. In September 2018, the median participant thought it\nappropriate for the fed funds rate to rise to 3.4 percent by the end of this year. By June 2019, that rate had\nfallen over a percentage point, to 2.1 percent. The most recent reading from last December was 1.6\npercent. I viewed this flatter policy path as being consistent with taking an opportunistic approach to\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure was 2.6 percent in January and the Dallas Fed’s trimmedmean PCE inflation measure has been stable at 2 percent. In January, CPI inflation rose to 2.5 percent, core CPI\ninflation was 2.3 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed-mean CPI measures were 2.9 and 2.4\npercent, respectively.\n1\n\nSee Saeed Zaman (2019) “Cyclical versus Acyclical Inflation: A Deeper Dive,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland Economic Commentary 2019-13, https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economic-commentaries/ec-201913-cyclical-versus-acyclicalinflation.\n2\n\n\f6\nraising inflation to our symmetric goal – refraining from taking deliberate policy action to lift inflation\nmore quickly but also refraining from taking deliberate action against shocks that would, for a time, move\ninflation somewhat above 2 percent. This approach attempts to keep inflation sustainably in a reasonable\nrange around 2 percent, consistent with our symmetric 2 percent objective, while balancing our dual\nmandate goals and risks to financial stability.\n\nBefore the emergence of the coronavirus, my expectation was that output growth would be about trend\nthis year, with solid performance in the labor market, and inflation continuing to move up gradually over\nthe next year or two to the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent. The underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy\nremain strong, but the coronavirus will weigh on U.S. growth at least during the first half of the year, with\na pullback in spending by households and businesses. It is what economists call a negative supply shock.\nMuch is still unknown about the disease making it difficult to predict how large and persistent the\neconomic impact will be. Heightened and persistent uncertainty can affect the economy. It raises the\npossibility that negative effects on consumer and business sentiment and a pullback in investor risk-taking\ncould last after the spread of the coronavirus has stabilized. The supply shock could evolve into a\ndemand shock.\n\nThe extreme volatility in financial markets is noteworthy. When a shock like this hits financial markets,\nthe first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets\nto continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of extreme volatility, and to assure the public that\nthey are prepared to act as necessary. Fed Chair Jay Powell issued such a statement last Friday. The\nBank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank took similar steps; the International\nMonetary Fund and World Bank jointly stated that they stand ready to help affected countries with\nemergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance; and the G7 finance ministers and central\nbankers released a joint statement this morning reaffirming their commitment to use all appropriate policy\ntools to support growth and safeguard against downside risks. Times like this underscore the value of an\n\n\f7\neffective framework of financial system regulation and supervision to help ensure that the financial\nsystem is well-capitalized and resilient, enabling financial institutions to better withstand volatility so that\nthey can continue to extend credit to households and businesses.\n\nWhile the economic fundamentals underlying the U.S. economy remain strong, in light of the risks to the\noutlook and guided by our statutory goals to promote price stability and maximum employment, today the\nFOMC lowered its target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The\nvirus’s near-term effects on the supply side of the economy, including the reduction in activity from\nclosures, reduced social interactions, cuts in travel and tourism, and disruptions in supply chains, are not\nthings that can be affected by lowering interest rates. However, the action taken by the FOMC can help\nsupport confidence and ease financial conditions of indebted households and firms, thereby helping to\nmitigate potential demand-side impacts of the virus. It was within this context that I supported today’s\ninterest rate reduction, while recognizing that appropriate actions taken by other parties, including global\npublic health officials and fiscal authorities, would likely do more to support confidence and spending by\nhelping to contain the spread of the virus, ensure adequate healthcare services are available to the sick,\nspeed development of a vaccine, and provide relief to workers and smaller businesses that are affected by\nthe pullback in activity.\n\nReview of the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Framework\nLet me now step away from current monetary policy and discuss future monetary policy. While the U.S.\nCongress has specified the Fed’s longer-run monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment, it has given the Fed considerable independence in choosing the framework used to achieve\nthese goals.3 The FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework\n\nSection 2A of the Federal Reserve Act says that the Fed should conduct monetary policy to “promote effectively\nthe goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm) When prices are stable and the economy is at\nmaximum employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels, so it is often said that the U.S.\nCongress has given the Fed a dual mandate.\n3\n\n\f8\nrecognizes that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying\nreal structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum\nemployment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment\naround maximum employment. The framework is briefly described in the FOMC’s statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy, which was originally released in January 2012.4\n\nThe flexible inflation-targeting framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in\npromoting our monetary policy goals. But the economic environment of the future is likely to differ from\nthe past environment in some important dimensions. The expected slowdown in population growth and\nlower labor force participation rates due to changes in demographics will weigh on long-run economic\ngrowth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the longer-term equilibrium interest rate.5 This is true not\nonly in the U.S., but in other advanced economies as well.6 Real interest rates are expected to remain\nlower than in past decades. If so, this means there will be less room for monetary policymakers to\ncushion against a negative economic shock by lowering its policy rate and a higher likelihood that the\npolicy rate will hit its effective lower bound more frequently. In this case, tools including forward\nguidance and balance-sheet policies such as longer-term asset purchases will need to be used more often.\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012;\nas amended effective January 29, 2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\n4\n\nSee Loretta J. Mester, “Demographics and Their Implications for the Economy and Policy,” Cato Journal, 38\n(Spring/Summer 2018), pp. 399-413. (https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2018/5/cjv38n2-6.pdf)\n5\n\n6\n\nFOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the fed funds rate that will be consistent with maximum\nemployment and price stability over the longer run. The median estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March\n2014 to 2.5 percent in December 2019, the most recently available estimate. (See the Summary of Economic\nProjections included in the Minutes of the FOMC, March 18-19, 2014, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20140319.pdf, and the Summary of Economic\nProjections included in the Minutes of the FOMC, December 10-11, 2019, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20191211.pdf.) Also, empirical estimates of the\nequilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are lower than in the past. For a review of\nthe literature on the equilibrium interest rate, see Hamilton, James D., Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D.\nWest, “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate: Past, Present and Future,” IMF Economic Review 64, 2016, pp. 660-707.\n(https://doi.org/10.1057/s41308-016-0015-z)\n\n\f9\nIn past recessions, the FOMC has reduced the federal funds rate target by 5 to 6 percentage points. With\ninterest rates expected to stay low, that policy space will not be available. Moreover, in some economic\nmodels, the proximity to the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates can impart a downward bias\nto inflation, making it harder for central banks to hit their inflation targets. And inflation now appears to\nbe less responsive to resource slack than it once was.\n\nIn light of these structural changes in the economic environment and our experience during the Great\nRecession and its aftermath, the FOMC has engaged in a review of our monetary policy framework to\nensure it will continue to be effective in maintaining macroeconomic stability in the future. The review\ncovers our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications, taking as given our statutory mandate\nand that an inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the long run with this mandate.\n\nSince the FOMC announced its review in November 2018, it has been spending time at its regularly\nscheduled meetings considering various aspects of its framework.7 The Committee is evaluating different\nstrategies such as whether to target inflation, average inflation, or the price level. These latter two\nstrategies attempt to make up for past misses on the inflation target; in contrast, targeting inflation lets\nbygones be bygones. We are also analyzing the types of policy tools and best formulations of these tools\nthat could be used to add accommodation in a future downturn, once our policy rate has been brought\ndown to its effective lower bound. The FOMC did not use negative interest rates during the Great\nRecession and its aftermath, but our review is open minded and we are taking a look at the experience of\nother central banks that have used negative interest rates to address low inflation and low growth. A third\naspect of our framework review is monetary policy communications. Policy communications are an\nimportant part of policymaking because they can increase the effectiveness of monetary policy in a\nnumber of ways. For example, communications can help to anchor inflation expectations at the target and\n\nInformation about the Fed’s monetary policy framework review is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-andcommunications.htm.\n7\n\n\f10\nthey can better convey the rationale for policymakers’ decisions, helping to transmit monetary policy\nthroughout the economy. Various aspects of the FOMC’s communications are being evaluated, including\nforward guidance used as a policy tool at the effective lower bound on interest rates.\n\nIn addition to internal discussions, the Fed engaged with academics at a research conference held last\nJune; selected papers from the conference were published in the International Journal of Central\nBanking.8 We also held a series of Fed Listens events across the U.S. to gain the perspectives of people\nwith diverse backgrounds and in different economic circumstances about how our dual mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices affect them. The Cleveland Fed held our Fed Listens event at\nour Community Development Policy Summit in Cincinnati.9 One of the main themes that came out of\nthis discussion was the importance of jobs. People were less concerned about inflation; in fact, some\nwere skeptical of the Fed’s view that inflation was too low, because in their experience it is costing more,\nnot less, to get by. This lack of concern about inflation partially reflects the success the Fed has had in\nachieving price stability. If inflation were to get out of hand again as it was in the 1970s and early1980s\nin the U.S., it would become a major concern again for everyone. From an individual’s perspective, low\ninflation is not a problem. But inflation running below our goal is a problem for the macroeconomy and\nfor monetary policymakers. When inflation runs persistently below our goal, expected inflation can move\nlower, which can put further downward pressure on inflation and pull down interest rates, which then puts\nfurther constraints on monetary policy’s ability to stabilize the economy.\n\n“Special Issue: Federal Reserve System Conference on Monetary Policy - Strategy, Tools, and Communication\nPractices,” International Journal of Central Banking, February 2020. (https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb2002.htm)\n8\n\nA summary of the Cleveland Fed’s Fed Listens event is available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/events/2019/policy-summit/fed-listens.aspx. A full list of Fed Listens events is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fedlistens-events.htm.\n9\n\n\f11\nOur framework review seeks to ensure that we are approaching monetary policy in the most effective way\nto achieve our mandated longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability. The minutes of\nthe FOMC meetings summarize the initial impressions of the Committee participants on the topics raised\nin the framework review. I’d like to conclude with some of my thoughts on the three broad areas of the\nreview.\n\nRegarding monetary policy strategy, in my view, while make-up strategies like price-level targeting tend\nto work well in some models, I am skeptical that they would be as effective in the real world because their\nbenefits depend on high levels of credibility and commitment. For example, I question whether the public\nwill think it credible that policymakers will keep interest rates low to make up for past shortfalls even\nwhen demand is growing strongly or that the public will believe that policymakers will tighten policy\nwhen demand is weak after a supply shock has raised the price level. Instead of adopting a make-up\nstrategy, I think some changes to communication could help to convey a better sense of the FOMC’s\napproach and commitment to its policy goals. For example, I think it would be useful for us to explain\nthat it is normal for inflation to vary in a range around our target due to a number of factors, including\nmeasurement issues, idiosyncratic shocks, and economic developments. It would also be useful to\nexplain that the lower general level of interest rates likely to prevail in the future and changes in inflation\ndynamics suggest that inflation would likely be lower during economic downturns. In terms of strategy,\nafter a period when inflation has been running below our goal for a sustained period, I would be\ncomfortable with inflation moving somewhat higher than 2 percent for a time during economic\nexpansions in order to help anchor inflation expectations and achieve our long-run symmetric 2 percent\ninflation goal.\n\nRegarding tools, I believe that asset purchases and forward guidance have been and will continue to be\nuseful tools at the effective lower bound. I am skeptical that the benefits of negative interest rates would\noutweigh the costs in the U.S. The experiences in Europe and Japan suggest that negative rates may have\n\n\f12\nsome beneficial effects on bank lending and so far have not had adverse effects on market functioning or\nfinancial stability. But the financial markets in the U.S. are considerably different and are less bankcentric than those in Europe or Japan.\n\nRegarding policy communications, I have spoken often about improvements the FOMC might make to\nthe way we explain the rationale for our policy decisions, thereby making monetary policy more\neffective.10 Indeed, for forward guidance at the effective lower bound to work, people need to understand\nthat we have entered a different mode and are using it as a policy tool. But that means they need to\nunderstand our policy setting in normal times: in particular, the goals we are trying to achieve; how we\nuse changes in the fed funds rate to influence inflation, economic activity, and the labor market; and the\nkey elements in our reaction function. A post-meeting policy statement that gives a fuller view of the\nCommittee’s outlook and attendant risks to the outlook, and that ties the Committee’s policy decisions to\nthat outlook and assessment of risks would be a worthwhile enhancement.11\n\nThese are some of my own thoughts, but our review is ongoing and Federal Reserve Chair Powell has\nindicated that the FOMC will publicly report the outcome of the review once it is completed.\n\nOne can view the FOMC’s review of its monetary policy framework as a form of good governance that is\nbecoming a standard best practice of central banks around the world. The Bank of Canada reviews its\nframework to support the renewal of its agreement with the government on its inflation target every five\n\nSee Loretta J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNational Association for Business Economics\n36th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference\nWashington, DC\nFebruary 24, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. I thank the National Association for Business Economics for inviting me to participate\nin this year’s economic policy conference. I had the pleasure of speaking at this conference five years\nago and I recall a very engaging question-and-answer session following my remarks. I hope we will have\na similar session today because I believe that one of the responsibilities (and pleasures) of being a\nmonetary policymaker is listening to other people’s perspectives and learning from them. Today, I will\ngive you an update of my own take on the economy and monetary policy for the coming year. As always,\nthe views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Growth\nThe U.S. economic expansion is now in its 11th year, making this the longest expansion on record. It has\nnot been a smooth ride; risks of various kinds have risen and ebbed over the journey. Last year,\nuncertainties around trade policy and tariffs and slow growth abroad clouded the outlook. In prior years,\nthe sharp drop in oil prices and strength of the dollar weighed on the U.S. economy. Yet, with support\nfrom fiscal and monetary policy, the expansion continued. The length of the expansion is a true testament\nto the resiliency of the U.S. economy. For 2020, my outlook is for the expansion to continue, with\ngrowth around trend, solid performance in the labor market, and low and stable inflation. As is always\nthe case, there are risks to the outlook, including the recent emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan,\nChina. There are also longer-run challenges for the U.S. economy, including low productivity growth,\nlimits on access to education and training for the jobs of the future, and rising income inequality. But\nviewed through the lens of the Fed’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability, the\neconomy has been performing well and I expect that to continue.\n\nLast year, real GDP grew at a 2.3 percent pace, down a bit from 2018’s 2.5 percent pace. My estimate of\nlonger-run growth is 2 percent, so the economy has been growing somewhat above trend. Indeed, last\n\n\f2\nyear’s performance was better than many economists and businesses had expected. Before the start of\nlast year, it was widely anticipated that output growth would be slower than in 2018 because the effects of\nthe fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts and federal government spending were expected to wane and\nfinancial conditions were expected to be less accommodative. But as 2019 started, concerns developed\nthat a sharper slowdown in the economy was a real possibility. In light of the FOMC’s reassessment of\nthe outlook and risks, the FOMC’s anticipated path of appropriate monetary policy flattened, leading to\nmore accommodative financial conditions that helped to support the expansion. As the year wore on,\nseveral downside risks to the outlook worsened and new ones emerged. These risks include those\nassociated with trade policy and slower global growth, as well as geopolitical risks surrounding the\npossibility of a “hard” Brexit, social unrest in Hong Kong, and rising tensions in the Middle East. The\nFOMC responded to these risks to the outlook by lowering the federal funds rate a cumulative 75 basis\npoints. More accommodative financial conditions and some easing of trade tensions and uncertainty by\nthe end of the year helped to support last year’s above-trend growth.\n\nWith respect to the mix of growth across sectors, it is a tale of two cities. For most of the expansion,\nconsumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of output, has been driving the economy\nforward; the strength in business spending has varied and it has been weak of late. Although consumer\nspending softened a bit in the fourth quarter, this isn’t troubling as it followed strong readings in the\nsecond and third quarters. Solid fundamentals will continue to support consumer spending this year. The\nstrong performance of the labor market has brought more people into the labor force and has sustained\nwage growth, so household incomes are rising. Measures of consumer confidence are at high levels. And\nhousehold balance sheets, at the aggregate level, are healthy. Equity prices have been rising and the\ninterest rates paid by consumers are at low levels.\n\nThese same factors have led to a pickup in housing market activity over the past year. Residential\ninvestment turned around in the second half of 2019, rising for the first time since the end of 2017. On a\n\n\f3\nyear-over-year basis, housing starts, new single-family home sales, and existing home sales all posted\ndouble-digit rates of increase at the end of last year. Demand is outstripping supply. One indicator of this\nis the month’s supply of homes on the market. At the December sales pace, the current inventory of\nhomes up for sale would last three months. This is the lowest level in the history of the series, which\ndates back to 1982. As a consequence, house prices are beginning to accelerate.\n\nIn contrast to the strength in consumer spending and the improvement in housing conditions, business\ninvestment, manufacturing, and exports have been weak, declining over most of last year. Slow growth\nabroad, especially in Europe and China, and uncertainty over trade policy and tariffs have weakened\ndemand for U.S. exports, which has weighed on the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The\nuncertainty also dampened business sentiment and caused some firms to postpone planned investment. If\nit continues, the low level of investment will be troubling for the economy over the longer run. The\neconomy’s long-run growth potential is determined by the growth of its labor and capital stock and how\nproductively it uses these inputs. Without investment in new technologies and capital, productivity will\ncontinue to be weak, dampening the economy’s growth potential and living standards.\n\nFortunately, the picture for 2020 is somewhat better on the trade front. Some of the uncertainty over trade\npolicy eased with the signing of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Phase\nOne trade deal with China; this reduction in uncertainty should prove positive for investment.\nNevertheless, some long-lasting effects arising from the trade war are likely. For example, some of our\nbusiness contacts report that foreign firms have reoriented their supply chains away from U.S. firms,\nwhich means these exports may be permanently lost.\n\nThe start of the year brought some tentative signs that growth abroad in our trading partners was\nstabilizing. But offsetting the positive news on foreign growth and trade are the continuing problems with\n\n\f4\nthe Boeing 737 MAX airplane. The decision to halt production of the plane will be a drag on growth at\nleast in the first quarter of this year and perhaps longer.\n\nIn addition, the coronavirus is exacting a heavy human toll. It is also clouding the near-term economic\noutlook for China, with potential spillovers to the rest of the world. Most estimates of the possible impact\ndraw on the experience of the SARS epidemic in 2003. A Brookings study suggested that that epidemic\nreduced growth in China by about 1 percentage point in 2003 and growth in the U.S. by only about 0.1\npercentage point.1 However, there are many differences between 2003 and 2020. China was not as big a\nplayer in the global economy back then as it is today, so there is the potential for a larger impact, through\ndecreases in tourism and travel, reductions in consumer spending in China and by Chinese tourists\nelsewhere, disruptions in supply chains, and a pullback in investors’ willingness to take on risk. On the\nother hand, China now has more resources with which to address the epidemic than it had in 2003 and\nearly actions have been taken to try to limit the spread and cushion the Chinese economy. This might\nmean a larger negative impact on growth in China in the near term but perhaps a less protracted one. At\nthis point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects, but this new source of uncertainty\nis something I will be carefully monitoring. I’ve incorporated it as a downside risk to my modal forecast,\nwhich calls for growth to continue at trend, slightly slower than the pace of last year, with continued\nhealthy consumption growth and some pickup in investment spending.\n\nLabor Markets\nSupporting this forecast is the strength we’ve seen in labor markets. I expect solid labor market\nconditions to continue. Last year, firms added an average of 175,000 jobs per month to their payrolls, and\nin January, an even stronger 225,000 jobs were added. So the pace of job growth has been well above\n\nJong-Wha Lee and Warwick J. McKibbin, “Globalization and Disease: The Case of SARS,” Brookings Discussion\nPapers in International Economics, No. 156, February 2004.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20040203-1.pdf)\n1\n\n\f5\ntrend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The unemployment rate, at\n3.6 percent, is near its 50-year low; it has fallen nearly half of a percentage point over the past year. A\nbroader measure of the unemployment rate, the U-6 measure, which includes workers who haven’t been\nactively looking for work and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work, is under\n7 percent, near its lowest level since the start of this series in January 1994. In the Cleveland Fed’s\nDistrict, which includes the state of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the panhandle of\nWest Virginia, the unemployment rate is about 4-1/4 percent, near the lowest levels seen in two decades.\nMy expectation is that job growth will remain solid and the unemployment rate will remain near its\ncurrent level this year.\n\nA benefit of the long expansion is that more people have been drawn into the labor force. Even though\ndemographic forces such as the aging of the large baby boom generation mean people are leaving the\nworkforce through retirement, the participation rate has held up. The prime-age participation rate of those\nbetween ages 25 and 54 has been rising and is now at its highest level of the expansion. Women have\nbeen leading this rise. The participation rate for prime-age women has risen over 2 percentage points\nover the past two years, and the rate for men has edged up as well.2 Business contacts have continually\nreported that they are having trouble finding qualified workers. Some tell us that they have turned away\norders and would be able to take on more work if they could attract and retain the employees they need.\n\nAggregate wages have been rising in line with productivity growth and inflation, and we’ve seen stronger\nwage gains for lower paying jobs. But wages have not accelerated as much as one might have expected\nbased on the reports from firms about how hard it is to find workers. It could be a question of labor mix,\nwith those older workers exiting the labor force typically being higher paid than those entering. It could\n\n2\n\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as compiled by Haver Analytics, the (combined) prime-age\nparticipation rate rose to 83.1 percent in January 2020, its highest level since August 2008. From January 2018 to\nJanuary 2020, the participation rate for prime-age women rose from 74.8 percent to 77.0 percent; over the same\nperiod, the rate for prime-age men edged up from 89.0 percent to 89.3 percent.\n\n\f6\nalso reflect a faster pace of automation. Some of our business contacts have told us they are substituting\nmachines for workers rather than increasing wages. Others tell us they don’t believe that raising wages\nwill attract qualified workers and are not willing to go that route to fill positions. It remains to be seen\nhow much longer that situation can last, especially if labor markets tighten further.\n\nAssessing how the labor market is doing relative to what is sustainable over the longer run is a key factor\nwhen setting monetary policy, as maximum employment and price stability are our mandated goals. The\nbehavior of the labor market over this expansion has led me to believe that one needs to be humble about\nthis assessment and let not only past experience but also current experience be a guide. In fact, the strong\nperformance of the labor market over this expansion has made many economists reevaluate what\nunemployment rate is sustainable over the longer run and consistent with price stability. This is true of\nparticipants on the FOMC as well. Five years ago, their estimates of the unemployment rate over the\nlonger run ranged from 5.0 to 5.8 percent; the current range is 3.5 to 4.5 percent.3 I’ve brought my\nestimate down over time and recently have been estimating a range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent. But if the\nunemployment rate continues at these low rates and wage pressures remain muted, I’m open to lowering\nmy estimate again.\n\nInflation\nTurning to inflation, the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal is 2 percent, as measured by the year-overyear change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This measure moved up to\n2 percent in 2018, but the increase wasn’t sustained as PCE inflation moved back down in 2019 and stood\nat 1.6 percent in December. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices to strip out some\nvolatility, also moved down to 1.6 percent. Although core inflation is often used as an indicator of the\n\n3\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections included in the Minutes of the FOMC, December 16-17, 2014, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20141217.pdf and the Summary of Economic\nProjections included in the Minutes of the FOMC, December 10-11, 2019, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20191211.pdf.\n\n\f7\nunderlying trend in inflation, it is important to remember that a sizable fraction of the variability of core\ninflation is due to idiosyncratic factors, for example, changes in Medicare reimbursement rates or cell\nphone prices. So to gauge the underlying trend I look at a broad set of inflation measures. These\nmeasures show firmer inflation readings. The CPI measures typically run about 1/4 percentage point\nabove the PCE measures. In January, CPI inflation rose to 2.5 percent and core CPI inflation was 2.3\npercent. The Dallas Fed’s trimmed-mean PCE inflation measure has been stable at 2 percent. The\nCleveland Fed’s new Center for Inflation Research is carrying on the pioneering work done at the Bank to\ndevelop better measures of underlying inflation trends.4 In January, the Cleveland Fed’s median and\ntrimmed-mean CPI measures were 2.9 and 2.4 percent, respectively, and our median PCE inflation\nmeasure was 2.6 percent in December. These alternative gauges are not a substitute for the PCE inflation\nmeasure that the FOMC has targeted, but they do reduce some of my concern that inflation will continue\nto be weak. Indeed, research done by our Center suggests that if labor markets remain strong, then we\nshould see the components of the PCE that are more responsive to labor market conditions continue to\nfirm, helping total PCE inflation return to our 2 percent goal on a sustainable basis over time.5\n\nThis forecast depends on inflation expectations remaining stable. If firms and households begin to expect\nthat lower inflation will prevail over the longer run, the Fed would have a harder time hitting its inflation\ntarget, because theory suggests that these expectations influence actual price- and wage-setting decisions.\nLower inflation expectations could lead to lower inflation. In my view, expectations have been relatively\nwell anchored near 2 percent. The movements in the monthly readings of some of the measures have\nbeen within the typical variation seen in these measures. The Cleveland Fed produces a measure of\ninflation expectations that combines survey readings with market-based readings; the 5-year/5-yearThe Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research aims to further the understanding of inflation among\npolicymakers, researchers, and the public by providing data, forecasts, analysis, and research. The Center’s website\nis https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/center-for-inflation-research.aspx.\n4\n\nSee Saeed Zaman (2019) “Cyclical versus Acyclical Inflation: A Deeper Dive,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland Economic Commentary 2019-13, https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economic-commentaries/ec-201913-cyclical-versus-acyclicalinflation.\n5\n\n\f8\nforward reading on inflation from this measure has been fairly stable over the past 12 months, although\nsomewhat under 2 percent.\n\nMy projection is that PCE inflation will move up to our 2 percent goal in line with the FOMC’s objective,\nbut this will be a gradual return over the next year or two.\n\nMonetary Policy\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking and\ndetermine what interest rate path will best achieve the FOMC’s dual mandate goals of price stability and\nmaximum employment over the longer run, based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nAt our meeting at the end of January, the FOMC maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at\n1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. I agreed with this decision. Keeping the fed funds rate at current levels for a time\ngives us an opportunity to assess the cumulative effects of last year’s policy easing on the economy and to\nassess whether the economy is evolving according to our outlook. Even before last year’s cumulative 75\nbasis point reduction, monetary policy had become easier as the Committee’s view of the appropriate\npolicy path had flattened. You can see this by looking at FOMC projections. In September 2018, the\nmedian participant thought it appropriate for the fed funds rate to rise to 3.4 percent by the end of this\nyear. By June 2019, that rate had fallen over a percentage point, to 2.1 percent. The most recent reading\nfrom last December is 1.6 percent. Given the risks from slower growth abroad and trade policy\nuncertainty, I believed a flatter policy path was appropriate, although I would have preferred to wait for\nclearer evidence that the downside risks were materially affecting the economy before actually cutting the\nfunds rate last year. Still, I am comfortable with the current stance of policy. While some of the\ndownside risks have eased, including trade tensions, the possibility of a “hard” Brexit, and continued\nweakening of global growth, other risks like the coronavirus have emerged. In my view, our current\npolicy stance is appropriate given the outlook of growth near its trend pace, solid labor market conditions,\n\n\f9\nand inflation rates not far from the FOMC’s symmetric 2 percent objective, and given the risks around the\noutlook that we continue to monitor.\n\nI am committed to achieving both of our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.\nAs many of you know, the FOMC is in the process of assessing our monetary policy framework,\nincluding our strategy, tools, and policy communications. As part of that review, we conducted Fed\nListens events around the country to hear from various groups about how our dual mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices affect them. The Cleveland Fed held our Fed Listens event at\nour Community Development Policy Summit in Cincinnati.6 One of the main themes that came out of\nthis discussion was the importance of jobs. People were less concerned about inflation; in fact, some\nwere skeptical of the Fed’s view that inflation was too low, because in their experience it is costing more,\nnot less, to get by. This lack of concern about inflation partially reflects the success the Fed has had in\nachieving price stability. It’s a tribute to the late Paul Volcker, former Fed chair. If inflation were to get\nout of hand again as it was in the 1970s and early 1980s, it would become a major concern again for\neveryone. From an individual’s perspective, low inflation is not a problem. But inflation running below\nour goal is a problem for the macroeconomy and for monetary policymakers. When inflation runs\npersistently below our goal, expected inflation can move lower, putting further downward pressure on\ninflation and pulling down interest rates. Lower rates constrain monetary policy’s ability to stabilize the\neconomy by giving us less room to reduce rates in the event of a future downturn. So hitting our\nsymmetric inflation goal is an important part of ensuring a healthy economy over the longer run.\n\nA summary of the Cleveland Fed’s Fed Listens event is available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/events/2019/policy-summit/fed-listens.aspx. A full list of Fed Listens events is available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fedlistens-events.htm.\n6\n\n\f10\nWe have been undershooting our inflation goal for some time, so a natural question is whether\npolicymakers should add even further accommodation to spur a faster return of inflation to our goal. I\nwould not favor that at this time. In my view, doing so would raise the risk of generating imbalances that\nwould threaten the expansion and undermine our employment goal. Even given the low level of interest\nrates, equity prices and commercial real estate valuations are elevated; corporate debt levels are high; and\nunderwriting standards on leveraged loans are weak. While commercial banks are well capitalized, their\ncapital buffers are falling, which could potentially limit their ability to lend through the cycle should a\nnegative shock hit. I think we should be particularly attuned to financial market developments in the\ncurrent environment.\n\nGiven the low level of the funds rate and the outlook for growth and the labor market, and the fact that\ninflation rates are already near our objective, I support taking an opportunistic approach to raising\ninflation to our symmetric goal. This entails leaving policy at current levels for a time to support a\nfirming in inflation rates, refraining from taking deliberate policy action at this point to try to lift inflation\nmore quickly, and also refraining from taking deliberate action against shocks that would, for a time,\nmove inflation somewhat above 2 percent. This approach attempts to keep inflation sustainably in a\nreasonable range around 2 percent, consistent with our symmetric 2 percent objective, while balancing\nour dual mandate goals and risks to financial stability. I don’t view this opportunistic approach as\nignoring the inflation undershoot because it works to move inflation up by keeping policy more\naccommodative than if the Committee were behaving as it has in the past, as illustrated by the range of\nmonetary policy rules that the Cleveland Fed publishes on its website.7\n\nIn assessing the appropriate path of policy going forward, I will be monitoring incoming economic and\nfinancial data and reports from District contacts to assess the outlook and risks to the outlook. My\n\nSee the Cleveland Fed’s simple monetary policy rules at https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicatorsand-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx.\n7\n\n\f11\ncurrent view is that monetary policy is well calibrated to support our dual mandate goals, and a patient\napproach to policy changes is appropriate unless there is a material change to the outlook.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks at the\n2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nSponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets\nat the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\n*\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nWelcome to this session entitled “Hall of Mirrors: Feedback Between Monetary Policy and Financial\nMarkets.” I thank Anil Kashyap and Ric Mishkin for inviting me to moderate today’s panel discussion. I\nhave been attending the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum for many years, and I marvel at the organizers’\nprescience in anticipating the issues confronting monetary policymakers. This panel’s topic is no\nexception. It ties together various aspects of modern monetary policymaking, including the information\ncontent in asset prices, the role of expectations in monetary policy transmission, policy communications,\nand the wisdom of crowds.\n\nAs most of you know, the title of the session harkens back to a 2004 speech made by former Fed Chair\nBen Bernanke. Speaking about how monetary policymakers can gain insights from asset price\nmovements, he pointed out that if policymakers are too concerned about meeting market expectations for\nfear of creating excess volatility, then this undermines the information content of asset prices. As he put\nit: “Such a strategy quickly degenerates into a hall of mirrors” in which the policymaker is at once\nsending signals to the market about future policy and trying to gain insights from the market.\n\nHowever, if the market’s expectations get too far out of alignment with those of the policymaker, the\npolicymaker finds herself in a difficult situation. If financial markets expect easier policy than what the\npolicymaker feels is appropriate and she chooses to accommodate the markets’ belief, this suboptimal\npolicy could lead to macroeconomic instability in the future. If, instead, the policymaker chooses to\ndisappoint the markets, she risks increased volatility and an unwanted tightening of financial conditions.\nEven a policymaker who declares that surprising the markets won’t deter her from following appropriate\npolicy might find that this declaration is not time consistent when faced with such a choice.\n\nAt the same time, as Amato, Morris, and Shin (2002) point out, the policymaker’s view of the world may\nnot be correct. If policymakers are successful in getting agents to accept their view, then the\n\n\f2\ninformational content one might glean from agents’ decisions just reflects back the policymakers’ view\nand not the agents’ own private information. The potential is that asset prices could deviate far from\nfundamentals if the policymakers’ view is wrong.\n\nThe question is: how can policymakers best avoid the “expectations trap” (Chari, Christiano,\nEichenbaum, 1998), and utilize the information content in asset prices?\n\nBernanke emphasizes the role of communications. In his view, policymakers should pay attention to the\nmarket’s expectations for policy because they are a check on how well the central bank is communicating.\nWhen expectations are not well aligned, either policymakers aren’t communicating the rationale for their\nown policy views very well, or they are communicating, but market participants aren’t buying it. Thus,\nmarket expectations speak directly to two factors that are paramount in effective monetary policymaking:\ntransparency and credibility.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been on a journey of increased transparency for some time now in order to better\ncommunicate the Committee participants’ current views on the economic outlook and appropriate policy.2\nNonetheless, the Committee’s views and those of the market are not always in alignment.\n\nIn these cases, policymakers shouldn’t just capitulate to the market.3 But they should be open to\nreassessing their view of the economy based on all incoming information, including the views of\nparticipants in the financial markets. We have to be open to the possibility that the markets’ view may be\n2\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was launched in October 2007. It summarizes information about the\nindividual FOMC participants’ views on the economic outlook based on their own individual assessments of the\nappropriate path of policy. In January 2012, the SEP began including information on the individual appropriate\npolicy paths, summarized in the well-known dot plot. In September 2015, the FOMC began publishing the median\nSEP responses for each variable in the projections. And in March 2017, the SEP began including confidence bands\naround the median path for each variable.\n3\n\nJeremy Stein and Adi Sunderam (2018) present a model in which society is worse off if the central bank cares too\nmuch about bond market volatility and moves policy rates too gradually.\n\n\f3\nmore in alignment with fundamentals than the policymakers’ view. Significant misalignment between the\ncentral bank’s views and market expectations should also prompt the chair to augment communications in\nintermeeting periods and to consider improvements in how the central bank explains the rationale for its\noutlook for the economy, the risks around the outlook, and its view of appropriate monetary policy based\non the outlook and risks.\n\nI don’t want to underplay the challenges of formulating effective policy communications. Consider the\nFOMC’s post-meeting statement. It is pretty sparse. The chair’s press conference does give more\ncontext, but I’d like to see more of that information in the Committee’s statement, to provide more of a\nsense of our outlook and why we think our anticipated policy path is appropriate. Our assessment of risks\nis an important part of the policy discussion. We should provide more information on risks in the\nstatement and consider releasing the balance of risk graphs that are part of the SEP with the other charts\nreleased at the time of the press conference. Currently, these charts are released with the minutes three\nweeks later. What I’m advocating would result in a longer statement – which may not be fashionable in\nthe age of Twitter. But I think it would help us escape the statement’s “Hotel California” problem: words\ncheck in but they don’t check out. The market hangs on each word in the statement, so there is a\nlegitimate reluctance to change any word from one meeting to the next because of the signal it might send\nto the market. If we used more words to explain things, each word would carry less weight. The\nlanguage would be less boilerplate. This would free us to explain our rationale and change the\nstatement’s language productively from meeting to meeting without fear of sending the wrong message.\n\nOne last comment before I introduce our speakers. I’ve been talking about the market’s expectations as if\nthere is one monolithic market. But, of course, that isn’t correct. The market is made up of many\nindividual participants. In liquid markets, asset prices aggregate these individual investors’ beliefs about\nthe current and future state of the economy, but the diversity of views can still matter. The so-called taper\ntantrum in mid-2013 comes to mind. Before the FOMC communicated that tapering its asset purchases\n\n\f4\nmight soon be appropriate, it looked as if market expectations were in alignment. Nonetheless, financial\nmarkets reacted sharply when the communication actually came. Both Jeremy Stein (2014) and Stan\nFischer (2017) have discussed the episode, pointing out that the distribution of views across market\nparticipants and how strongly they hold these views are important determinants of how asset prices might\nreact to an announcement, even one that is aligned with the median view in the market. The point being\nthat even the best policy communications won’t be able to prevent market swings all the time and\npolicymakers and markets need to understand that.\n\nAs you can see, there are many things to talk about in this session. Our panelists bring broad academic,\nmarket, and central bank experience. Their bios are in your booklet, but briefly:\nRichard Clarida is vice chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Prior to\njoining the Fed, he was a professor at Columbia University. He has served in the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment and on the Council of Economic Advisers, and was a managing director of PIMCO.\n\nRick Rieder is managing director of BlackRock, where he is global chief investment officer and cohead of global fixed income. Prior to this, he was president and CEO of R3 Capital Partners, and was\nan advisor to the U.S. Treasury and the NY Fed.\n\nSilvana Tenreyro is professor of economics at the London School of Economics and serves as an\nexternal member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee. She is president-elect of the\nEuropean Economic Association, and, I’m happy to say, a member of the advisory council of the\nCleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research.\n\nWe’ll hear from our speakers in the order in the program and then open it up to participants for discussion\nand questions.\n\n\f5\nReferences\nAmato, Jeffery D., Stephen Morris, and Hyun Song Shin, “Communication and Monetary Policy,” Oxford\nReview of Economic Policy, 18 (2002), pp. 495-503.\nBernanke, Ben S. “What Policymakers Can Learn from Asset Prices,” remarks before the Investment\nAnalysts Society of Chicago, Chicago, IL, April 15, 2004.\nChari, V.V., Lawrence J.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nFourth Annual Financial Literacy Day:\nUnderstanding Global Markets and Finance\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nUniversity of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee College of Business\nSarasota, FL\nFebruary 14, 2020\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank David Kotok and the Global Interdependence Center for this wonderful opportunity to speak on\nthe campus of the University of South Florida, Sarasota-Manatee. As you probably know, the Federal\nReserve is very interested in promoting financial literacy. One reason is that our economy performs\nbetter if people are equipped with the knowledge to make sound savings and investment decisions.\nAnother reason is that our monetary policy is actually more effective if people understand how it works. I\nam proud to be on the board of the Council for Economic Education (CEE), which is a champion of both\neconomic and financial literacy for students from kindergarten through high school. The CEE recently\nreleased the 2020 Survey of the States, a biennial look into the state of K-12 economic and financial\neducation in the U.S. 1 The results show that progress is being made. Twenty-one states now require high\nschool students to take a course in personal finance, four more than in 2018, and 25 states now require an\neconomics course, three more than in 2018. The CEE is working to encourage more states to adopt such\nrequirements because research indicates that they lead students to make more informed real-world\neconomic decisions, such as those pertaining to college financing. I am also proud that the Cleveland Fed\nis an active partner with schools across the Fourth Federal Reserve District to improve the financial skills\nof students and members of our community. You are welcome to visit our learning centers in Cleveland\nor Cincinnati, but some of our materials are also available online for those of you who’d prefer to stay in\nthe warmth of the Florida sun. 2\n\nI want to spend my time with you today focusing on one particular aspect of our country’s financial\nsystem, one that is less understood and is undergoing rapid change: the payments system. The Federal\nReserve System plays an important role in helping to ensure that our payments system is efficient, secure,\n\nThe Council for Economic Education offers many materials to advance financial literacy and economic education\non its website at www. https://www.councilforeconed.org/. The Survey of the States is available at\nhttps://www.councilforeconed.org/survey-of-the-states-2020/. EconEdLink, at https://www.econedlink.org/, is\nCEE’s web portal of resources supporting K-12 teachers of economics and finance.\n1\n\nThe Cleveland Fed’s Learning Center and Money Museum provides materials to foster financial and economic\nliteracy on its website at https://www.clevelandfed.org/learningcenter/explore.aspx.\n2\n\n\f2\nand effective. I recently became chair of the Financial Services Policy Committee (FSPC), which\noversees the provision of payment services to depository institutions and the U.S. Treasury by the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks. So as a follow-up to the discussion we just heard about new forms of payments, I\nthought it would be useful to provide you with an update on some of the Fed’s ongoing work to\nmodernize the U.S. payments system, and then offer a policymaker’s perspectives on some payments\ninnovations. Of course, the views I will present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFedNowSM Service 3 Will Be a New Service for Making Real-Time Payments in the U.S.\nIt shouldn’t surprise anyone when I say that a well-functioning and secure payments system is an essential\ningredient for a sound economy. Like highways, bridges, and railroads, the payments system is a critical\npart of the infrastructure of our country; everyone has a stake in a healthy U.S. payments system.\nAccording to the 2019 Federal Reserve Payments Study, noncash payments have been growing by almost\n7 percent per year since 2015; these include debit and credit card transactions, checks, and direct deposit\nand automatic payment transactions that go through the automated clearing house system. In 2018 there\nwere 174 billion noncash transactions made in the U.S. – more than 500 payments for every American.4\nThese transactions totaled over $97 trillion. As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve works to\npromote the macroeconomic and financial stability of our $21 trillion economy and the Fed’s oversight of\nand participation in the payments system is a vital part of this work.\n\nLast year, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced that the Fed would develop a\nnew service called FedNow. This new interbank payments service will allow people all over the country\nto make payments securely and in real time, at all times of the day and night, including on weekends and\n\n3\n\n“FedNow” is a service mark of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\n4\n\nSee Federal Reserve System (2019).\n\n\f3\nholidays. 5 Although payments made through mobile apps and the internet appear to be instantaneous, the\nunderlying infrastructure does not move funds immediately from the payer’s bank to the payee’s bank.\nCurrently, this takes several days. With FedNow, you’ll be able to send and receive payments securely at\nany time and anywhere, and get access to funds within seconds. This speed will provide economic\nbenefits, making it easier for individuals and businesses to manage money and make time-sensitive\npayments. This service, along with similar private-sector alternatives like The Clearing House’s RealTime Payments (RTP®) service, may be especially beneficial for those households and businesses that\ndon’t have as much funds in reserve, allowing them to avoid late fees when making last minute payments.\nSimilarly, workers who aren’t getting regular payroll checks will be able to get faster access to their\nwages.\n\nThe history of the U.S. payments system shows the need for the FedNow service. Over the decades, the\nevolution of the payments landscape has led to a patchwork of payment vehicles and providers, often\nlacking interoperability with one another or the ability to combine billing invoice information with a\npayment. Our payments system is concentrated in the banking system but is quite complex. Currently,\nthere are several platforms for making payments. The automated clearing house (ACH), which was\nconceived of in the late 1960s, handles smaller value, regularly scheduled payments, like your paycheck\nor your utility bills, via batch processing of a group of transactions during a predetermined time period.\nAlthough ACH was conceived as a way to eliminate the use of paper checks, checks are still used for\nmaking some payments. There are credit and debit card systems as well. This complexity makes it\nharder to foster payments innovations. Indeed, not all parts of the U.S. payments system have kept up\nwith the evolving expectations and demands of consumers and businesses. This has allowed nonbank\nproviders, including fintech companies, to enter the payments business, offering consumers and\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019). More information on FedNow is available at the\nFedNow web site: https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/index.html.\n5\n\n\f4\nbusinesses more modern payments methods that clear and settle on the bank-centric traditional payments\ninfrastructure. The consumers and businesses enjoy a more user-friendly experience, and while it appears\nthat the payments are moving in real time, the actual clearing and settlement of payment instructions on\nboth sides of these transactions take place through the traditional system: transactions are settled in\nperiodic batches, processed one or more days later, and available only during regular banking hours. Of\ncourse, this creates some risk because banks might choose to make final funds available to the customer\nbefore receiving the covering funds from the payer’s bank.\n\nThis highlights the need for an updated U.S. payments system that is faster from end-to-end and meets the\nneeds of consumers, businesses, and financial institutions in a safe and efficient way. To address this\nneed, the Fed engaged in several years of study and consultation with a diverse group of payment system\nstakeholders, including financial institutions of all sizes, private-sector payment networks, businesses,\nconsumers, fintech companies, and software vendors. Those stakeholders made clear that they wanted\naccess to enhanced interbank settlement mechanisms 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\nThis was reinforced when the vast majority of respondents to a 2018 Federal Reserve request for\ncomment advocated for the Fed to build a faster payment system. 6 In response to this demand, the\nFederal Reserve has embarked on building a resilient real-time payments system that will enable our\nnation’s more than 10,000 banks and credit unions of all sizes to use their existing electronic connections\nto the Fed and their existing Fed settlement accounts to process real-time retail payments for consumers\nand businesses. This payments system modernization will bring the U.S. in line with other countries that\nhave developed faster payment networks, including Australia, the U.K., Singapore, India, Mexico, and\nsome European countries.\n\nBefore making the decision to move forward with the FedNow service, the Fed determined that the\n\n6\n\nSee the Federal Register Notice in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019).\n\n\f5\nservice met its established criteria for offering a new payments service. These criteria are, first, that it is a\nservice that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and\nequity; second, that there is a clear public benefit; and, third, that the Fed be will able to fully recover its\ncosts of providing the service over the long run.\n\nIt is important to know that the Fed will offer FedNow alongside payments services operated by privatesector companies, just as it does today with check, ACH, and wire transfer services. This will encourage\ncompetition among operators and provide an added layer of resiliency in the event of downtime at any\none of the real-time payment systems. The Fed is working closely with financial institutions and\ntechnology firms to prepare for an anticipated launch of the FedNow service in 2023 or 2024. An official\nlaunch date has not been announced, as ongoing work to finalize business requirements and design\nfeatures to meet the needs of potential users of the service will help determine the timeline for\nimplementation. The project is complex, and we want to get it right.\n\nAchieving a Broad Reach for Faster Payments to Serve the Public\nThe FedNow service is being developed with the aim of having a broad nationwide reach and the ability\nto work across different systems. Payments industry stakeholders have emphasized the importance of\nestablishing a real-time payment capability for the nation whereby any payer can reach any payee,\nregardless of which real-time retail payments system is used by their banks. Such interoperability has not\nalways been a given in the U.S. and no doubt will be a challenge. For example, in the early 1970s, there\nwere several regional automated clearing house associations, each providing clearing and settlement\namong and between only their own bank members. In most cases, the ACH associations had an\nagreement with the regional Federal Reserve Banks to help operate the ACH networks. In 1974, the\nregional ACH associations formed Nacha to facilitate the nationwide clearing of ACH transactions. And\nby 1978, an interoperator agreement between the Federal Reserve and Nacha was executed to link local\nACHs on a nationwide basis. The message exchange protocols that allowed that to happen are still in\n\n\f6\nplace today. Interoperability is also a feature of debit cards and of wire transfers. For each of these\nservices, interoperability also evolved over decades and followed different paths to arrive at different\nmodels.\n\nToday, the Fed, private sector-operators, and other stakeholders are exploring options to ensure a broad\nreach for faster payments. Interoperability as currently achieved in the ACH system is one possible\napproach. Another approach is dual participation, where some banks choose to join more than one\noperator network. This is the prevailing model for high-value, urgent payments processed through the\nwire transfer networks. Hybrid models are also possible, where service providers are designated as agents\nin each network and route payments to the receiving bank’s network of choice. A broad reach is achieved\nby relying on relatively few service providers, each of which establishes connections to all of the payment\noperators for that payment type, thereby acting as hubs. This type of interoperability characterizes\ntoday’s debit card networks.\n\nThe Fed will be exploring the various possibilities, working with private-sector stakeholders, to arrive at\nthe best solution for ensuring that we deliver a faster payment service that is broadly accessible to\nconsumers and businesses alike so that it best serves the public.\n\nBeyond the development of FedNow, the Fed is actively monitoring and studying new technologies and\napproaches to payments. These approaches don’t always rely on sovereign currency or a country’s\ncentral bank to settle payments, or on traditional bank accounts to transact payments. I will use the\nremainder of my time to discuss one of these payments innovations: digital currencies.\n\nDigital Currencies\nCryptocurrencies\nBy now, everyone has heard of Bitcoin, an example of a digital currency, which was introduced in 2008,\n\n\f7\nholding the promise that it could serve as a means of faster payments, as a unit of account, and as a store\nof value. 7 Since Bitcoin’s introduction, thousands of other digital currencies have been created. Such\ncurrencies present an innovative approach to processing payments in which a bank or central authority is\nreplaced with a distributed group of anonymous people who verify the accuracy and trustworthiness of\nthe transaction over the internet. Distributed ledger technology, open source software, and a\ndownloadable database of account balances allow decentralized members of the network to vote with\ntheir computing power to determine whether a transaction is valid or not. 8 Since transactions are\ncryptographically secured, many have adopted the term “cryptocurrencies” to describe Bitcoin and other\nsimilar products.\n\nAlthough its market capitalization has grown to over 100 billion euros, Bitcoin has not seen wide\nadoption as a means of payment. 9 Its value is volatile, driven by speculation in the currency, making it\nless useful as a unit of account. Its settlement time has been too slow to make it practical for mainstream\npayments. In addition, the real costs of operating the system, driven by energy consumption to power a\nvast web of computers, are much higher than those associated with traditional sovereign currency. The\ndistributed nature of the governance system around Bitcoin and similar digital currencies also makes it\nmore difficult to resolve any disputes that may arise or to decide on technical changes that likely would be\nneeded as the platform grows. 10\n\nStablecoins\nIn part to address some of these challenges, there has been a proliferation of so-called “stablecoins.” 11\n\n7\n\nSee Nakamoto (2008).\n\n8\n\nSee Craig and Kachovec (2019).\n\n9\n\nBrainard (December 18, 2019).\n\n10\n\nSee Craig and Kachovec (2019).\n\n11\nFor informative overviews of stablecoins, including their benefits and challenges, see Bank for International\nSettlements (October 2019 and December 2019), Financial Stability Board (October 10, 2018; June 6, 2019; and\nOctober 18, 2019), Brainard (October 16, 2019 and December 18, 2019), and Evans (2019).\n\n\f8\nStablecoins are digital currencies designed to minimize price volatility by pegging their value to the value\nof a stable asset or basket of assets, such as commodities, commercial bank deposits, government\nsecurities, or sovereign currencies. This limits the price volatility in the stablecoins, making them\ncandidates for payments that require a stable medium of exchange.\n\nThe practice of backing a form of money by a stable asset is not new. The gold standard, in which the\neconomic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold, was widely used in the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies. Another example is Kenya’s M-PESA system, established in 2007 to enable transfers of\nmobile phone account balances backed by deposits held at commercial banks, which in turn hold\ngovernment securities. Facebook’s June 2019 announcement of Libra, a stablecoin to be made available\nto its more than 2.5 billion users, garnered considerable attention because of its potential to reach a global\nscale in a short period of time. Announcements such as this have served as a wakeup call to regulators,\nstandards-setting bodies, and central banks around the world for the need to study the benefits and risks of\nstablecoins.\n\nA global stablecoin has the potential to deliver some benefits by increasing the speed of certain payments\nand improving competition in and lowering the cost of making cross-border payments. By enhancing the\ndiversity of the payment system infrastructure, global stablecoins could increase resiliency. Stablecoins\nmight also be attractive to countries that prefer an alternative to the U.S. dollar or the euro for making\ninternational transactions, and they could provide an efficient mechanism for commercial banks to settle\nthe payment leg of a wholesale transaction involving the sale of another digital asset.\n\nBut against these potential benefits, stablecoins also pose some challenges, including a range of legal,\ngovernance, and compliance issues. It is likely that there are conflicts in the legal frameworks of different\njurisdictions that a global currency may traverse, and such conflicts would need to be reconciled before\nadoption. For example, there would need to be clarity about when the finality of the payment is achieved\n\n\f9\nand around the rights and obligations of all parties, including on whom or what the stablecoin holder has a\nclaim. Regulators would need to understand who is responsible for operating different aspects of the\nsystem, and how international safety and soundness standards, such as the principles for financial market\ninfrastructures, would apply to this type of payments system. In recent congressional testimony, Fed\nChair Jerome Powell highlighted some of the concerns about compliance with consumer privacy and\nprotection statutes, including the rules around know-your-customer, anti-money laundering, and\nconsumer data privacy. 12 Policymakers also need to assess potential risks to financial stability if\nstablecoins gain traction. While the availability of stablecoins may enhance payments system resiliency,\nit could also undermine stability if there is a loss of confidence in a global stablecoin that leads to runs on\nstablecoin redemptions. Similarly, understanding whether stablecoins would impact the effectiveness of\ntraditional monetary policy tools must also be part of the research agenda.\n\nCentral bank digital currencies\nAnother development under study is digital currency issued by a central bank. 13 This would be just like\nthe physical currency issued by central banks today, but in a digital form and, potentially, without the\nanonymity of physical currency. Depending on how these currencies are designed, central banks could\nsupport them without the need for commercial bank involvement via direct issuance into the end-users’\nwallets combined with central-bank-facilitated transfer and redemption services. Of the 66 central bank\nrespondents to a 2020 survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, 80 percent are\ncurrently or soon will be engaged in digital currency work, mostly related to researching, planning for, or\npiloting the technology. 14 China, Europe, and Russia, among other jurisdictions, have initiatives\nunderway. Some countries, like Sweden, cite the declining use of cash as motivating their interest in\n\n12\n\nPowell (July 10, 2019).\n\nPowell (November 19, 2019) discusses the Fed’s view on this subject. Also see Brainard (September 16, 2019,\nand December 18, 2019), and Evans (2019).\n13\n\n14\n\nSee Boar, Holden, and Wadsworth (2020).\n\n\f10\ncentral bank digital currencies.15 To the extent that they displace cash, such currencies may help to\nprevent money laundering and tax evasion. Of course, for the same reason, if they are designed without\nanonymity, they could be used by a totalitarian regime to control its citizenry. In other jurisdictions, like\nUruguay, central bank digital currency offers the promise of broadening financial inclusion by being more\naccessible to underserved segments of the population compared with bank accounts. In another survey,\nmany of the responding central banks expressed interest in central bank digital currency as a way to\nmaintain payment systems that are competitive with costly cash issuance or emerging private-sector\nalternatives, like Libra. 16 Others have suggested that central bank digital currency could enhance the\ntransmission of monetary policy, offering a more practical way to implement negative interest rates,\nwhich some central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss\nNational Bank, are currently imposing on reserve deposits to address low inflation and low growth. 17\n\nJust as with private-sector digital currencies, a range of potential risks and policy issues surrounding\ncentral bank digital currency need to be better understood, and the costs and benefits evaluated, before a\ncentral bank would implement a central bank digital currency. In the U.S. a basic question is whether the\nFederal Reserve has the legal authority to issue such a currency and offer transfer and safekeeping\nservices directly to consumers and businesses. Another is whether the central bank would need to gain\naccess to sensitive consumer and business information in order to issue digital currency and how privacy\ncould be protected. In addition, the design features necessary to prevent illicit activities would need to be\ndetermined. Finally, monetary policy transmission, potential disruption to short-term funding markets,\nand financial stability issues would need to be evaluated.\n\nInformation on the Swedish central bank’s e-krona project is available on its website at\nhttps://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments--cash/e-krona/. See also Sveriges Riksbank (2018) for several articles on\nthe e-krona, the Riksbank’s potential digital currency.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nSee Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (2019).\n\n17\n\nSee Rogoff (2016) and Bordo and Levin (2017).\n\n\f11\nThe outcome of the cost-benefit analysis may differ across countries. The status of the U.S. dollar as a\nglobal reserve currency, the stable demand for U.S. bank notes, and the mature, developed nature of the\nU.S. financial system are all distinguishing factors that would need to be taken into account when\nconsidering the benefits vs. the costs of central bank digital currency in the U.S. Central banks around the\nworld, including the Federal Reserve, continue to research this potential payments innovation, and they\nare sharing what they learn with one another and the public.\n\nConclusion\nThe payment system is undergoing a period of rapid change. The emergence and widespread adoption of\nnew technologies have shaped the public’s expectations for faster, more efficient, secure, and broadly\naccessible payment services. In the U.S., FedNow, a new real-time payments system, will be an integral\npart of this modernized payment system. As work on FedNow proceeds, so does the evolution of other\npayment methods like digital currencies. While each payments innovation offers benefits, it also comes\nwith some risks and policy implications that need to be evaluated. The Federal Reserve is monitoring\ndevelopments, evaluating potential new payments enhancements, and engaging with private-sector\nstakeholders and fellow central banks, as we work to modernize the payment system on behalf of the\npublic.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nBank for International Settlements, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, “Wholesale\nDigital Tokens,” December 2019.\n(https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d190.pdf)\nBank for International Settlements, G7 Working Group on Stablecoins, “Investigating the Impact of\nGlobal Stablecoins,” October 2019.\n(https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d187.pdf)\nBoar, Codruta, Henry Holden, and Amber Wadsworth, “Impending Arrival – A Sequel to the Survey on\nCentral Bank Digital Currency,” Bank for International Settlements, BIS Papers No. 107, January 2020.\n(https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap107.pdf)\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Announces Plan to Develop a New\nRound-the-Clock Real-Time Payment and Settlement Service to Support Faster Payments,” August 5,\n2019.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190805a.htm)\nBordo, Michael D., and Andrew T.
