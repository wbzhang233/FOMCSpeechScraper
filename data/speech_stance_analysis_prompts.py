EXAMPLES = """
1. 鹰派（Hawkish）：
政策倾向：强调控制通货膨胀，倾向于提高利率或减少货币供应。
经济观点：认为经济过热，需要通过紧缩政策来抑制通货膨胀。
讲话内容：经常提及提高利率的必要性，强调通货膨胀的风险，对经济增长的乐观态度可能被对通货膨胀的担忧所掩盖。
语气：坚定、果断，可能表现出对当前宽松政策的不满。

2. 偏鹰派（Leaning Hawkish）：
政策倾向：虽然倾向于鹰派，但对紧缩政策的推行可能更为谨慎。
经济观点：认为经济存在过热风险，但对通货膨胀的担忧不如鹰派强烈。
讲话内容：可能会提到提高利率的可能性，但同时也会强调需要更多数据来支持这一决策。
语气：相对温和，但仍然倾向于支持紧缩政策。

3. 中立（Neutral）：
政策倾向：既不倾向于紧缩也不倾向于宽松，而是根据经济数据和市场情况灵活调整政策。
经济观点：认为经济状况复杂，需要综合考虑多种因素。
讲话内容：避免明确表态，强调等待更多经济数据，可能会提到多种可能的政策路径。
语气：平衡、客观，避免表现出明显的倾向性。

4. 偏鸽派（Leaning Doveish）：
政策倾向：虽然倾向于鸽派，但对宽松政策的推行可能更为谨慎。
经济观点：认为经济增长和就业市场仍有改善空间，对通货膨胀的担忧不如鸽派强烈。
讲话内容：可能会提到维持低利率或增加货币供应的可能性，但同时也会强调需要更多数据来支持这一决策。
语气：相对温和，但仍然倾向于支持宽松政策。

5. 鸽派（Doveish）：
政策倾向：强调刺激经济增长和提高就业，倾向于降低利率或增加货币供应。
经济观点：认为经济复苏脆弱，需要通过宽松政策来支持。
讲话内容：经常提及降低利率或增加货币供应的必要性，强调经济增长和就业的重要性，对通货膨胀的担忧相对较小。
语气：温和、支持性，可能表现出对当前紧缩政策的不满。
