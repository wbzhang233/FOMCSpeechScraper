Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n1 \n  \n \n \n \nFive Questions About Current  \nMonetary Policy \n \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n  \nGreater Providence Chamber of Commerce \nProvidence, Rhode Island \nNovember 17, 2010 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThank you for inviting me to speak with you here  in Providence.  Over the past 25 years \nor so, my family and I have followed and enjoyed the rebirth that happened in Providence – from \ntrying some of the great downtown restaurant s to occasionally taki ng in the WaterFire \ncelebration.   \nHowever, I have also witnessed what has happened to many Rhode Island communities \nover the past three years, as a re sult of the recession.  Rhode Island has suffered to an even larger \nextent than the rest of New England.  Despite the downtown rebirth I mentioned, unfortunately a \ndrive today through Providence includes some empty storefronts and foreclosure signs.  \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n So, it is particularly appropriate to be in Rhode Island to discuss what national monetary \npolicy is doing to address economic pr oblems, here and around the country. * \n There has been a great deal of attention paid to the monetary policy actions that were \ninitiated by the Federal Reserve at the last Fe deral Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.  \nThere has been much commentary, from a wide range of observers, on our decision to pursue \nlarge scale asset purchases.  Given the intensity of the public debate, I have decided to take a \nsomewhat different approach today than I usually  do in my talks.  Today I am going to do my \nbest to answer the five questions I most often hear about these recent monetary policy actions in \nmy conversations and mee tings around New England. \n [Slide 2]  \nQuestion 1 is, Why was policy changed at the November FOMC meeting?  \n Before we look at the data, I’ll preview my answer.  The policy change we at the Fed just \nannounced was consistent with the central ba nk’s mandate, given how far the national economy \nis from our gauges of health.  \nCongress, which created the Federal Reserve in 1913, has provided significant guidance \nover the years on what should be our primary areas of focus.  Unlike some foreign central banks \nthat only have one target – pr ice stability – the Federal Reserve has been tasked with pursuing \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n the lowest possible unemployment rate consistent with price stab ility.  So we refer to a “dual \nmandate,” meaning both maximum employment and stable prices.   \nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC – the presidents of the \nReserve Banks and the members of the Board of Governors in Washington – all provide \nquarterly estimates of where we expect infla tion and unemployment to be in the long-run. We \ncan consider those long-run estimat es to reflect what members see as achieving our dual mandate \nfor price stability and maximum sustainable empl oyment.  According to past submissions, most \nmembers expect that inflation is likely to settle  close to 2 percent and that the unemployment rate \nis likely to settle between 5 a nd 6 percent, in the long run. \n Obviously the national economy is quite some distance from those long-run targets.  And \nin places like Rhode Island, the gap is ev en larger.  From a national perspective, Figure 1  \nhighlights that the unemployment rate, which is cu rrently 9.6 percent, has been well above that 5 \nto 6 percent range for some time, as a result of  the long recession.   Most  of this unemployment \nlikely reflects the dramatic de cline in demand for goods and serv ices that characterized the \nrecession.  With inadequate demand leading to  very high unemployment rates, one would \ngenerally expect that such a la rge gap (in rela tion to the long-run targ et) would yield a strong \nbias towards more accommodative monetary policy. \n Turning to the stable pri ces side of our dual mandate, Figure 2  shows that core inflation \nhas fallen quite significantly.  The core consumer  price index or CPI, which had been above 2 \npercent before the recession, is now below 1 percent.  With the current amount of slack in the \nlabor markets, it is certainly possi ble that inflation could fall furt her.  Thus, on inflation we are \nalso far from where we want and expect to be  in the longer run – a nd we are continuing to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n experience disinflationary pressures.  Again, su ch a large gap on the in flation side of our \nmandate should provide a strong bias towards more accommodative monetary policy. \nIn short you see unemployment close to double the mandate-consistent target, and \ninflation about half of what we consid er consistent with price stability. \n Still, an argument against further moneta ry easing could be ma de if one thought the \neconomy was about to take off.  But are things ab out to turn, or turning now – as some suggest?  \nUnfortunately, recent data have not been particularly encouraging.  Figure 3  shows that GDP \n(shown in blue) grew by only 2 percent in the thir d quarter.  Even less encouraging is the fact \nthat final sales (shown in green) – which is a better measure of  demand for our products, since it \nexcludes inventory investment fr om the GDP number – was quite anemic in the third quarter, \nand indeed growth in final sales has been falling ove r the past four quarters.  As I have noted in \nprior talks, we are likely to need  four to five years of relativel y strong growth (above “potential”) \nto bring the unemployment rate down signifi cantly (to a rate cons istent with “full \nemployment”1). \nFurthermore, Figure 4  shows that the growth in fina l sales from the low point of the \nrecession (shown in the dark line extending out five  quarters) has been quite weak, and certainly \nin the weak camp among previous recessions.  With these doubts as to the strength of final sales \nshown in the data, one has to question the likeli hood that, other things equal, the economy will \ngrow fast enough to significantly reduce the unemp loyment rate in an acceptable timeframe and \nreduce these disinflationary pressures. \n With both employment and inflation falling shor t of the long-run expectations that reflect \nthe Fed’s mandate, one would expect additiona l accommodative monetary policy.  However, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n with the federal funds rate close to zero, the Fed’s usual policy tool could not be utilized.  \nHowever, monetary policy can st ill be conducted.  The asset-purchase policy announced at the \nNovember FOMC meeting was in my view stro ngly consistent with our dual mandate from \nCongress – in other words, the pur suit of maximum sustainable em ployment and stable prices.  \n  Still, some have argued very forcefully that  we should not have taken further action.  This \nleads to the second question. \n [Slide 7]  \nQuestion 2 is, What is the likely cost of not\n changing monetary policy?  \n Again, as we turn to the evidence, let me sum up my answer to this important and at \ntimes overlooked question.  Not changing policy risked further disinflation, a ri se in the real cost \nof funds tantamount to monetary tightening, and risks of continued and possibly worsening pain \nin labor markets.  Allow me to explain. \nFigure 5  highlights how severe the recession ha s been, in terms of output.  We saw \ndramatic declines in GDP in the United States  (the black line), but the chart shows that many \nother countries experienced an even more  severe decline in output, a nd for some countries it is \nnot clear they have reached thei r recession trough as yet.  Partic ularly in Europe, where some \ncountries have had sovereign debt problems and si gnificant fiscal austerit y, the output decline is \nstriking. \n While that chart shows that in fact the impact on output  was lesser in the U.S. than in \nmany countries, Figure 6  shows that the impact on labor markets  here in the U.S. has been more \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n severe than in most countries; in fact, only se verely distressed Spain a nd Ireland have seen a \nbigger effect on employment.  The U.S., again s hown by the black line, is still well below the \npeak employment of prior to the onset of the r ecession, and the decline has been more significant \nthan in many other countries.  Firms in the U.S.  moved particularly aggressively to cut jobs, \nparticularly as the recession deepened in the af termath of financial problems in the fall of 2008. \n Figure 7  shows one of the problems with labor markets remaining extremely weak for a \nprotracted period.  The percent of jobless work ers who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or \nmore is over 40 percent.  This is much higher th an in recent recessions, as you can see in the \nshaded recession sections of the char t.  In fact, it is the highest read ing on record for this series.   \nLong periods of unemployment can have par ticularly corrosive effects.  Not only do \npeople have to deplete their sa vings, but unfortunately long-te rm unemployed job-seekers can \nfind it quite difficult to re-enter the workforce – because skills may atrophy and because hiring \nfirms may shun those who have been unemployed for a long time.  In short, there are real and \nsignificant long-term costs to individuals and the economy when the unemployment rate remains \nstubbornly high.  \n Allow me to walk you through the next couple of charts, which highlight that it can be \ncostly to not do anything to counteract further disinflation.  As those of you in this room know, \nmany economic decisions are influenced  by the real cost of borrowing.  Figure 8  gives us a \nhistorical perspective, going back to 1980, comp aring in the top chart the short-term federal \nfunds rate and the inflation rate.  The botto m chart shows what you get when you put the two \ntogether – the real federal funds rate resulting from the effectiv e rate minus the change in the \ncore CPI.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n If we simply narrow the time frame of the chart, as in Figure 9 , we see clearly that if \nshort-term interest rates are fixed – say at a bout the zero bound, as now – but the inflation rate \ndeclines, then the real interest rate actually increases.   You see this in the red line on the bottom \nchart.  As a result, a decline in the inflati on rate when interest rates are fixed amounts to \nmonetary tightening.  Given the state of the eco nomy, a monetary contra ction right now is both \nunintended and undesirable.   So we want to prevent any further disinflation – not only because it \ngets us closer to a harmful deflationary situat ion, but also because it represents a monetary \ntightening when conditions are indicating that further accommodation is desirable. \n If the federal funds rate wa s not close to zero right now, the arguments for reducing it – \nthat is, for easing in monetary policy – would be quite strong.  However, the federal funds rate is \nquite close to zero.  And this l eads us to the third question. \n [Slide 13]  \nQuestion 3 is, How Different are large scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from traditional \nmonetary policy?  \nBefore we look at the data, I’ll preview my an swer to this question.  Are large-scale asset \npurchases a fundamentally different  policy, either in intent and mechanics?  The answer is no, \nLSAPs are much closer to trad itional monetary policy than ma ny commentators assume.  We \nsimply move in other markets than the federa l funds market.  And, like traditional monetary \npolicy actions, we’re not talking about “bailouts”  or stimulus spending or placing a debt burden \non future generations.  Let me explain.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n In more normal times when the FOMC want s to ease monetary policy, we buy Treasury \nbills and, in paying the sellers for them2, we create additional bank reserves.  By making more \nreserves available to the banking system, we ease conditions in the overnight market for funds – \nthe federal funds market – so the primary impact of these purchases is a reduction in the federal \nfunds rate.  But more importantly for the economy, we expect the reduction in the funds rate to \nover time translate into declines  in mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, exchange rates, and a \nrise in stock prices – all of which of course help s timulate economic activity.   \nNow that the federal funds rate is near zero a nd the reserves in the system are quite large, \nthe usual course is not an option.  Instead of relying on the indirect effects of targeting a lower \nfunds rate, we are opting to more directly aff ect the interest rates th at have the greatest \nconnection to real spending; by buying Treasury bonds and creating additional bank reserves.  \nSince there are already substantial reserves in th e system, the primary expected effect is lowering \nthe long rate by purchasing a significant amount of longer-term Treasury bonds.  Like \nconventional policy, one would expect that mortga ge and corporate rates will fall, and exchange \nrates will be impacted, providing additional stimulus to the economy.  That is in fact what has already happened, which leads to Question 4.   \n \n[Slide 14]   \nQuestion 4 is, What has been the impact of the LSAP to date? \nBefore we explore the data, I’ll again shar e the punch line, which is that these policy \nactions, like more standard reductions in the fede ral funds rate, have basically had the expected \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n effects and – despite some short-run volatility as we get under way – should be broadly effective \nand helpful to the economy going forward.   \nStarting with Chairman Bernanke’s Jacks on Hole speech, the markets have gradually \ncome to expect that more monetary accommodation was likely.  As a result, the impact on financial markets of any easing was likely inco rporated into prices prior to the actual \nannouncement.  The next set of charts highlight s that the effects one might expect from a \nconventional monetary accommodation do indeed seem to have occurred in anticipation of this \nless-conventional action.\n3 \nI should note that while longer rates have been  trending down as desired, there has been \nsome recent movement up, too.  Lots of things af fect rates in the marketplace, but I am certain \nthat our purchases over time will contribute to lower rates than we would otherwise be seeing. \nFigure 10  explores inflation expectations, and highlights the fact that the implied \ninflation rate over the next 10 ye ars as measured by the differen ce between the 10-year Treasury \nyield and the 10-year inflation-indexed  Treasury yield had fallen to we ll below 2 percent.  As the \nmarkets began to anticipate the LSAP program, the implied inflation rate has risen to a little over \n2 percent.  Thus, the action seems to have convinced market participants that further \ndisinflationary pressures in the U.S. were likely to be resisted by monetary policy. \nFigure 11  shows that corporate bond  rates and mortgage rate s have fallen over this \nperiod, although there has been an  uptick over the last couple of days.  Lower rates on these \ninstruments will make it easier for firms to fina nce investments and for home buyers to purchase \nhomes, all other things equal. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n10 \n Figure 12  shows that there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar exchange rate.  While not \na goal of our policies, this should stimulate expo rts and reduce imports.  It is important to re-\nemphasize that in the U.S., as in any country wi th a flexible exchange rate system, a modest \ncurrency depreciation is the normal consequence of  easing monetary policy.  By lowering short- \nand long-term interest rates, investors will, on the margin, seek assets that provide somewhat \ngreater returns than U.S. assets, and in the process, will lower the demand for dollars and \ndepreciate our currency.   \nWhile this is an issue that has been passiona tely discussed in many parts of the globe, I \nthink it is important to note – as shown on Figure 13  – that the current trade weighted exchange \nrate is really not much different than what it was before the recession.  Exchange rates have at \ntimes fluctuated for a variety of reasons during this period, including periods of so-called flight \nto quality that pushed U.S. rates down, and periods of flight from European currencies as a result \nof some sovereign debt issues – both of which tended to push the dollar up.  At the same time, \nthe data show that the Federal Reserve’s curr ent monetary accommodati on to date has merely \nhelped restore the dollar exchange rate to the level it was three years ago . \nFigure 14  shows that the stock market has genera lly risen over the last several months, \ndespite some downward movement over the last coupl e of days.  While this is not a targeted goal \nof our policy, it is an indicator that the combin ation of lower rates and better economic prospects \nare being manifested in a rise in stock prices.  This increases  household wealth for those who \nown stocks and should provide for somewh at stronger consumption, going forward. \nFigure 15  provides some rough estimates of what the impact of the LSAP easing could \nbe, over time, using the Boston Fe d’s internal simulation models.  While such estimates are by \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n11 \n nature quite uncertain, we estimate that the impact could be a reduction in the unemployment \nrate by the end of 2012 of a little le ss than half a percent.  This would translate into more than \n700,000 additional jobs that we would not have ha d in the absence of this monetary policy \naction.   \nIn short this action, like more standard reduc tions in the federal funds rate, has broadly \nspeaking had the expected short-run effect and should be helpful going forward.  This leads to \nthe final question. \n \n[Slide 21]  \nQuestion 5 is, What are the risks of the current policy? \nThe short answer is that ther e are – of course – some risks.  We should not gloss over \nthem, but neither should we overstate them.  I am  very confident that they can be managed and \nare worth taking. \nNormally the Federal Reserve buys primarily short-term securities.  By purchasing long-\nterm securities the Federal Reserve is in fact taking on the risk that their value will fall as interest rates rise.  The reason is that as  interest rates rise above the ra tes paid on the securities we hold, \nthe lower-rate securities we hold will (not surp risingly) fall in value, as investors favor the \nhigher-rate newer-issue securities.  Of course, an environment in which most interest rates were \nrising would imply an economy where disinflation was no longer a problem, which is one of the \nmacroeconomic outcomes the policy is indeed se eking.  But in fact the Fed has a number of \noptions and plenty of flexibility to manage the ho ldings in the best interests of the economy and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n12 \n taxpayers.  We could hold instruments to maturity, or could sell securities of certain maturities.  \nAnd, of course, interest income will accrue.  I believe the most likely net outcome will actually \nbe a benefit to the taxpayer, al though that is not the objective of  our balance sheet moves (rather, \nour dual mandate is). \nA second risk arises from the fact that the Treasury market is quite large – much larger \nthan the federal funds market in which we normally  operate.  While relatively small purchases of \nsecurities during normal times can be sufficient to  move the federal funds rate, it takes large \nasset purchases to have a significant impact on a market as large and deep as the Treasury bond \nmarket.  As a result, this policy requires the Fe deral Reserve to expand its balance sheet much \nmore than would a traditional monetary easing.  Large expansions of the balance sheet can \ncomplicate exit strategy, when that becomes a ppropriate.  While the Federal Reserve has a \nvariety of tools designed to tig hten policy, either by raising inte rest on excess reserves, removing \nreserves, or selling secur ities, some of these tools have not been  used in the past.  Naturally this \nmakes the exact impact of various tools somewhat more uncertain than normal.  Still, I am very confident of the Fed’s ability and will to exit, when necessary. \nA third risk is that these measures have not  been conducted in the United States, at least \nat the current scale.  While there are many simila rities with typical mone tary policy and several \nother countries (for example Ja pan and the U.K.) have also b een pursuing large scale asset \npurchases, the lack of recent U.S. historical precedent makes the possibility of unintended \nconsequences higher than with more  typical monetary policy actions. \nAnother risk is that we might be too successful in raising inflation.  Thus any policy \naction needs to take care to make clear that the desire is to maintain well-anchored inflation \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n13 \n expectations.  But this can best be achieved by insuring that inflati on does not get too high nor \ntoo low .   \nFinally, some have argued that the Fed is embarking on a policy of monetizing the federal \ndebt.  I would counter  that this is a temporary  monetary policy action ta ken to return inflation \nand unemployment somewhat more quickly than otherwise to levels consistent with our \nmandate.  It is a policy designed to help reduce longer term rates over a fi xed period of time, not \nat all a policy to finance government debt indefinite ly.  I have noted in prev ious talks that it is \nimportant to provide short-term stimulus, given the current economic situation, but that long-run \nbudget projections are not sustainable and will need to  be addressed.  It is important to note that \nlarge scale asset purchases do not necessarily need to use Treasury -security purchases to \nstimulate the economy; indeed in our first round we did so with mortgage-backed securities.   \nSo all in all there are of course risks to ev aluate in light of th e current state of the \neconomy and our mandate.  We are aware of these risks.  I fully expect that we will be able to \nmanage them.   \n \n[Slide 22]  \nConcluding Observations \nAs I conclude I would like to reiterate th at the actions taken earlier this month are \nconsistent with the important mandates that Congr ess has set for the Federal Reserve in terms of \nemployment (reflecting growth) a nd prices.  With unemployment so high and inflation unusually \nlow, most models indicate that further mone tary accommodation is warranted.  In addition, I \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n14 \n believe the cost of having high unemployment rates for an extended period of time, or likewise \nfurther disinflation, could be quite high and potentially very damaging.   \nThe recently announced LSAP program has many similarities with more typical \nmonetary policy actions, but of course there ar e risks with any policy that we have not had \nsignificant experience with.  Nonetheless, the initial reactions seem similar to what we would \nhave expected from more typical monetary po licy.  And the Fed has the tools to minimize its \nown particular risks.   \nIn short, these actions are likely to reduce the unemployment rate and reduce the risk of \nfurther disinflation relative to not  taking action.  This is exactly wh at I hoped would be the result \nof the program. \nLet me leave you with an analogy – and a season ally appropriate one at that.  This past \nweekend, many New Englanders woke up to a lawn  full of leaves.  Many took out their lawn \nmower intending to get to work picking up those leaves.  When pulling on the starter cord, some \nno doubt heard the engine sputter and cough.  The im mediate reaction is to fiddle with the choke \nswitch and give a little more gas to the engi ne.  Once you get the engine started and running \nsmoothly, you still have the task of mowing up all those leaves.  But you won’t make any \nprogress unless you first get the e ngine operating.  And so it is  with monetary policy.  Our \neconomy has been faltering and sputtering, so it wa s necessary to take some steps to get it \nactually “running.”  Of course this Fed policy will not solve the economy’s problems, just as \ngetting the motor started does not in and of itself take care of the leaves  in your yard.  Solving \nthe economy’s problems will take time and actions by the public and private sectors – but getting \nthe economic engine running is the essentia l first step to the broader work ahead. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, N ovember 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n15 \n  Thank you again for having me join you today.  I hope that in the fu ture we will gather \nunder very different and much improved economic circumstances, and I can assure you that we \nat the Federal Reserve will work diligently towards that end. \n \n                                                             \n \n \n1 See my talk “Considering the Routes to a Policy Destination” available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2010/050510/050510b/index.htm  \n2 The Federal Reserve Act does not permit purchase of new Treasury issues for cash.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n \nRevisiting Monetary Policy in a \nLow Inflation Environment: \nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston’s 55th Economic Conference \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nOctober 16, 2010 \nBoston, Massachusetts \n \n \n \n \n \nI’d like to welcome everyone to the second day of our conference.  As has been \nmentioned already, this is in some sense a retrospective.  The first conference on monetary \npolicy in a low inflation environment was held in  Vermont in October of 1999.  I would note that \nseveral speakers we will hear from today also provided comments at that gathering 10 years ago, \nand I am pleased to have them back in New E ngland to see if a decade of relevant data has \ninfluenced their thinking on the topic.* \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n1 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n2 \n [Slide 2]  At that conference, Alan Blinder was on the policy panel, a place he finds \nhimself again today.  He said at the time that it was of some interest that the conference was \nbeing held at the U.S. Federal Reserve, and not  in Japan or Europe.  One might attribute the \nlocation to unusually good forecasting prowess evid enced by our Research Director, Jeff Fuhrer, \nwho was actively engaged in organizing the ea rlier conference as well as this one.   \n The earlier conference took place under very different economic circumstances.  It was \nheld in the midst of the period that I believe Ji m Stock named “the Great Moderation,” reflecting \nthe reduced volatility we were seeing in unemployment and inflation.  There was a growing \nsense of confidence that seve re business cycles had been tamed, as policymakers better \nunderstood and calibrated fiscal and monetary policy.  At the time of the conference, the \nunemployment rate was 4.1 pe rcent and the core infla tion rate was 2.1 percent.1\nDespite the propitious economic environment at the time, I will say that participants at \nthe conference said quite clearly that monetary policy in a low inflation environment would be \nquite challenging. \n[Slide 3]  Perhaps the best summary of this conc ern was provided those ten years ago by \nKazuo Ueda, who is on the policy panel again this  time.  His summary of policy when the zero \nbound was hit was that “it will be a lot more painful than you can possibly imagine.”  \nUnfortunately, his comments have been accurate and prophetic – and quoted rather prominently \nof late. \n Perhaps, as well, they were more true in Ja pan than anywhere else in the world.  At the \ntime of our first conference on th is topic, many participants were expecting the Japanese \ndeflation to be quickly eradicat ed and the country to be “on the mend.”  Now, more than a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \ndecade later, Japan continues to combat deflation with its policy still r unning up against the zero \nlower bound. \n Other participants at the earli er conference for the most part  viewed Japan as an anomaly, \nand seemed to think that the likelihood of ot hers ending up in Japan’s predicament was quite \nlow.  Unfortunately, that probability seems to  have shifted, and we now face a world where \nJapan, Europe, and the U.S. are challenged by th e need to conduct monetary policy with short-\nterm interest rates close to zero. \nAll in all, there was some disagreement over how effective alternate policies could be, \nbut there was a sense that there was little reas on not to try them, should circumstances merit it. \n [Slide 4]   Figure 1 highlights just how different this so-called Great Recession has been.  \nThe chart shows the percent employment change from the peak of employment in post-war \nrecessions.  The scale of the job loss during this recession, shown by the black line, is sobering.   \n[Slide 5]  Another feature of this Great Recessi on involves the significant difficulties \nwithin financial institutions and financial markets, and the contri butions of those difficulties to \nthe economic downturn.  While at the earlier conference ther e was due concern about the \nbanking and financial systems, I think it fair to sa y that the role that financial institutions and \nmarkets can play in aggravating the business cycl e was not fully appreciated.  A challenge that \nremains is how best to incorporate financial market developments in our economic models, as \nmuch of the modeling only ra ther poorly captures the role of financial intermediation. \n[Slide 6]   It goes without saying that the circumstances su rrounding this conference are \nvery different than those of te n years ago.  Unfortunately at today’s conference, unlike ten years \nago, we find unemployment at 9.6 percent, core CPI inflation well below 2 percent, and short-\n3 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nterm interest rates bound by zero.  Japan is stil l fighting deflation.  So the problems faced by \npolicymakers in the United States and abroad are no longer just matters of academic debate.   \nToday I would like to briefly discuss how we should, in my opinion, interpret some of the \ndata and experience we have seen since that prior conference.  In particular, I would like to draw \nsome observations from the Japanese experience,  and from the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale \nAsset Purchase (LSAP) Program. \n \nThe Case of Japan \n[Slide 7]   Japan is the one indus trialized country that ha s faced the zero bound and \ndeflation problem for well over a decade.  I woul d note several points we can draw from Japan’s \nbattle with deflation.   \n \n• First, while the Japanese stock market a nd real estate markets peaked in 1990, and \nwere substantially off their peak prices in  the middle of the 1990s , the core inflation \nrate remained low but definitely positive (as shown in Figure 2).  While every such \nsituation is unique, the conditions in Japan  that moved a low-inflation environment to \none of actually falling prices were moneta ry and fiscal tighten ing, and also deferring \nthe process of addressing significant problems in the financial sector.   \n • [Slide 8]   Second, it is worth noting that Japan and Europe and the United States are \nfacing substantial challenges in monetary policymaking, in part because of lingering \n4 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nfinancial problems.  Because the transmi ssion of monetary polic y occurs through the \nbanking system, impaired banking systems a nd financial markets greatly complicate \nthe conduct of monetary policy.   \n \n• Third, the fact that Japan is still battling deflation highlight s how pernicious deflation \ncan be, and how difficult it is to countera ct once it has been firmly established. \n \n[Slide 9]   It is important to note that Japan has significantly a ltered monetary and fiscal \npolicy to try to address its defl ation problems.  For fiscal polic y, as shown in Figure 3, Japan has \nmore than tripled its debt-to-GDP ratio since the early 1990s, as the government has tried to \nignite the economy with more expansionary fiscal policy.   \n[Slide 10]   Similarly, the Bank of Japan has more th an tripled the size of its balance sheet \nsince 1990, to try to combat deflat ion – as shown in Figure 4.   \n[Slide 11]  These expansionary monetary and fis cal policies no doubt prevented deflation \nfrom being a much more severe problem than it nonetheless has been.  Concerns expressed at our \nearlier conference, and many economic models, highlig hted a risk of a str ong deflationary spiral, \ngiven the significant slack in the Japanese econo my.  Thankfully, policy did prevent this severe \noutcome.  However, it was not sufficient to prevent a low but persistent degree of deflation.  This \nexperience may indicate that a gradual response  may not be as effective as a more active \nresponse to arrest deflationary pressures – before they become  embedded in thinking that can \naffect household and business spending. \n5 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nFrom a policy perspective I take several less ons from the Japanese experience.  First, \nshould deflation occur, it can be quite difficult to  overcome.  Second, insuring against the risk of \ndeflation may be much cheaper than waiting until it has occurred and then trying to address it.  \nFinally, financially fragile economies may be par ticularly vulnerable to negative impacts from \npremature austerity measures. \n \nMonetary Policy Lessons from the LSAP Program \n[Slide 12]  Now I would like to touch on some le ssons for monetary policy from the \nLSAP program.  As you know, after reaching th e zero lower bound in rate-setting and seeing \ncontinued problems in economic outcomes, the Federal Reserve made a policy decision to \npurchase large quantities of govern ment-backed securities in the s econdary market, in its Large \nScale Asset Purchase or “LSAP” program.  Because such programs are relatively new \nphenomena in the United States, it was difficult  to predict with preci sion how the economy \nwould react.2  Without good historical experience to re ly on, and because we are operating at the \nzero bound for the first time in post-war history, it is  important to use the evidence we have to \ndraw out a better understanding of LSAP  programs and related channels.   \nThere are many potential impediments to accu rately measuring the effects of the LSAP \nprogram.  First, it is difficult to isolate the im pact of the program from  other relevant changes \nsuch as shifts in fiscal policy, changes in policie s of major trading partners, or developments in \nsupervisory or regulatory policies that can have an impact on financial markets.  Second, these \nprograms have been operating when many economi c and financial variables are outside their \nnormal ranges.  Thus, the impact of the pr ogram may differ depending on economic and \nfinancial conditions prevalent duri ng their operation.  Third, to the extent that policy changes are \n6 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nanticipated, the effect of a po licy change may be difficult to measure with any degree of \ncertainty. \n[Slide 13]  Despite these challenges, many research ers have begun to evaluate the policy \nchannels that are impacted by an LSAP program.3  While there is much work to be done, and the \nsample of U.S. experience is fairly limited, a llow me to provide my own take on the evidence \nthat is currently available. \n[Slide 14]   Figure 5 shows the impact on mortgage rates of the announcements of the \nLSAP program – when it was first announced and at the March FOMC  meeting when the \nparameters of the initial program were detailed.   \nSince the initial program focu sed on purchases of mortgage securities, one might expect \nthe largest impact to be on mortgage rates.  Mortgage rates that  had been trading at 6 percent \nprior to the announcements declined to roughly 5 pe rcent.  Empirical even t studies that try to \ncorrect for possible confounding events tend to find an impact on mortgage rates in the range of \n25 to 100 basis points.  Thus, I think the empiri cal evidence supports the view that an LSAP \nprogram can influence the market rate of the asse t being purchased.  Certainly the impact may be \ninfluenced by the economic and financial c onditions at the time of the announcement and \npurchase.  The scale of the program should be sensitive to the prevaili ng conditions, and the size \nof the program would need to vary to acco mplish a particular interest rate outcome. \n[Slide 15]  An LSAP program will be most effectiv e if it not only influences the rates on \nassets being purchased, but also in fluences rates on other assets with similar characteristics.  For \nexample, purchases of mortgage securities are li kely to influence the price and yield of other \nlong-term securities that may also be held by inve stors looking for long-term assets.  As the rate \n7 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \non MBS securities falls, some investors will l ook to buy these other assets, and the increased \ndemand will bid up their prices and push down their rates.   \n[Slide 16]   Indeed, as Figure 6 high lights, other long-term rates did fall with the LSAP \nannouncements.  Both long-term Treasury and cor porate bond rates fell wi th the announcements. \nSeveral studies have concluded th at the cross-correlation is rela tively high, indicating that a \nbroader array of long-term rates will be influenced by an LSAP program.  Thus, the precise focus \nof the program’s asset buy may be less critical th an the broader fact th at the central bank is \npurchasing long-duration securiti es, and that rates on all long-duration securities will be \nimpacted by the program.  Lower long-term rates should stimulate demand for assets influenced \nby the cost of borrowing long – such as investme nts by businesses, and home and car purchases \nby consumers. \n[Slide 17]   Another channel that LSAPs may in fluence involves conveying the likelihood \nthat short-term rates will remain low.  While the Federal Reserve has used language referencing \n“an extended period” in the FOMC minutes for some time, the markets interpretation of that \nperiod is likely to be infl uenced by actions taken.   \n[Slide 18]   Indeed, as Figure 7 shows, prior to  the LSAP program announcements the \nthree-year Treasury rate had been  trading above 2 percent.  Si nce the announcements, the three-\nyear Treasury rate has been below 2 percent – and more recently has been trading closer to the \nrate on shorter-term Treasuries.  As of Wednesd ay of this week, the one-year Treasury was \ntrading at 0.22 percent, the two- year was trading at 0.37 percent, and the three-year was trading \nat 0.57 percent.  This compression of rates is consis tent with market partic ipants anticipating that \nlow rates are likely to continue for quite some time .   Of course, not only  Treasury securities are \n8 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M.

This is par ticularly true for the \ndollar exchange rate, where the precautionary de mand for dollars can cause large movements in \nthe exchange rate as investors look to park  funds in dollars during periods of economic \nturbulence.  Nonetheless, one might think that th e exchange rate would be influenced by policies \nto reduce domestic interest rates as investors move funds to countries yielding a higher return.   \nAs Figure 8 highlights, the relationship with th e LSAP and exchange rates is not visually \ncompelling, but nonetheless this is a channe l worth studying and be tter understanding. \n[Slide 21]  Another potential channel involves bank lending.  As large corporations issue \nlong-term debt at attractively lo w rates, they become less dependent on loans or lines of credits \nfrom banks.  As larger firms move to capital  markets for financing, it should free up bank \nbalance sheets to allow a focus on those firms that really depend on banks for financing.  The \nstrength of this channel needs to  be explored more thoroughly.  \n \nConcluding Observations \n[Slide 22]  This conference, more than 10 years af ter our earlier conf erence on the topic, \nhas benefitted from the additional experience that countries around the world have had, in the \ninterim, with monetary policy in a low inflati on environment.  I would summarize by saying that \nclearly, conducting monetary policy in a low inflation environment is difficult – and particularly \n9 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \nso when that low inflation environment also  includes wrenching financial difficulties and \nstubbornly high unemployment rates.  At our earli er conference there was probably too little \nappreciation of the potential challenges, and too low a weight placed on how a low inflation \nenvironment could be hampered by the zero lower bound on short-term  interest rates. \nWhile it may be too early to draw firm conclusions about monetary policy at the zero \nbound for short-term interest rates, I would lik e to draw some tentative conclusions.   \n \n• First, a policy of graduall y adjusting monetary and fisc al policy, as conducted in \nJapan after deflation first occurred, may not  be as effective as an active policy \nresponse taken before deflation has become  embedded in the economy.  Of course, it \nshould depend on the given situation and incoming data. \n \n• Second, while monetary policy may have difficulty fully offsetting a severe shock \nwhen the zero bound is hit, ther e are still important channe ls for monetary policy to \nuse to mitigate the negative shocks.   \n \n• Third, it is not a coincidence that in Japan, the United States, and Europe these economic problems have been encountered in conjunction with banking and financial \nmarket problems.  Analysis of monetary  policy with the zero bound needs to more \nrichly capture the aspects of the financial  sector that are major contributors to \neconomic difficulties.   \n \n10 \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at  8:15 A.M.

This  of course must be factored into any \nanalysis of policy options. \nThank you, and I look forward to the rest of today’s discussion on this crucial topic. \n \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 The inflation rate was 2.1 percent in October 1999 as measured by the year over year change in the core CPI, and \n2.56 percent as measured by the overall CPI. \n \n2 In the discussion paper entitled “Flow and Stock Effect s of Large-Scale Treasury Purchases,” Stefania D’Amico \n and Thomas B. King of the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Monetary Affairs note that “During the crisis of 2008, policymakers took a number of extraordinary steps to improve the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy. Among the most im portant of these measures, in terms of both scale and prominence, were \nthe Federal Reserve’s purchases of large quantities of government-backed securities in the secondary market, \nconventionally known as the Large Scale Asset Purchase—or “LSAP”—programs. The LSAPs included debt obligations of the government-sponsored housing agenci es, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by those \nagencies, and coupon securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, and they coll ectively amounted to $1.7 trillion over a \nperiod of about 15 months—the single largest government intervention in financial-market history. Given the unprecedented size and nature of these programs and the speed w ith which they were proposed and implemented, \npolicymakers could have had, at best, only a very rough ex ante sense of their potential impact.” \n \n3 See for example “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Fe deral Reserve: Did They Work?” by Joseph Gagnon, \nMatthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack; Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 441, \nMarch 2010.  \n\nRevisiting Monetary Policy in a \nLow Inflation Environment\nEric S.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \n“Rethinking Central Banking” Conference \nWashington, D.C. \nOctober 10, 2010 \n \n \n \n[Slide 1] \n \n Thank you for inviting me to offer a few observations on some design and implementation issues we all face with rega rd to macroprudential supervisory policies.\n*   \nPerhaps a positive offshoot of the recent severe financial crisis is that it has galvanized \npolicymakers to expedite work  on macroprudential s upervision and regula tion.  The sense of \nurgency has helped regulators make significant progress on increasing bank capital buffers and \nhas sharpened the focus on liquidity risk.  Thes e efforts are important, and should improve the \nstrength and resiliency of the financial system when fully implemented. \n \n  \n                                                             \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n 2[Slide 2] \n  \nOver the last year I have sometimes made a comparison between new and needed \nfinancial regulations and the regula tions developed in the 1800s to prevent the “great fires” that \nhad plagued many major cities.  One thing that gr eatly reduced the risk of such fires was the \ndevelopment and enforcement of tough new buildi ng codes.  This meant using building materials \nthat were less flammable, and ra ising structures that made it far less likely that a building would \ncatch fire – or that would suppress the spread  of a fire, should it nonetheless occur.  In many \nrespects I see enhanced capital a nd liquidity rules as e quivalent changes in our financial system, \nwhich should make financial institutions far le ss susceptible to “fin ancial firestorms.” \n Another aspect of the soluti on to great fires was the move  to hiring professional fire \nfighters with adequate equipment and sufficient access to water to quickly respond  to a fire.  This \nreduced the risk that if a fi re occurred, it would spread in some catastrophic way.   \nThe importance of response time is highlighted  in the questions that get asked when you \ntake out fire insurance on your hous e.  They ask how close you are to the nearest fire station, and \nhow close you are to a fire hydran t.  The questions are important because the answers impact the \nextent of the damage a fire can cause.  They al so impact the likelihood that  a fire at a neighbor’s \nhouse could spread and impact your home. \n Response time is also critically important in  financial regulation a nd in limiting financial \ndamage.  Today I am going to briefly discuss one type of financial “first  response” – the ability \nto retain capital in the banking system by cutting bank dividends when problems first emerge.   \nGiven the evidence in the data, I will highlight the fact that in relation to dividends, bank \nmanagement and supervisors responded quite slow ly in the United States during the financial \ncrisis.  I will suggest that macroprudential supervision shoul d include early detection of \nproblems, and in a troubled banking system th e reduction of dividends  to retain capital. \n \n  \n\n 3The Timing of Dividend Reductions \n \n[Slide 3] \n  \nFigure 1  shows that in August 2007, as the fi nancial crisis emerged, banks became \nwilling to lend to each other at one-month maturity only at rates dramatically different from the \nprevious year.  While the increase in August 2007 looks a bit less spectacular than the spike that \nfollowed the events of the fall of 2008, it was nonetheless a dramatic change.  The economic \nimplications of emerging financial problems contri buted to the significant  response in monetary \npolicy. \n [Slide 4]  But as Figure 2  highlights, the 2007 events did not l ead to similarly significant changes \nin supervisory  policy.  The dividends on common stock declared by the largest banking \norganizations (the 19 SCAP\ni participants and others) actually increased in the fourth quarter of \n2007, and did not show dramatic reductions until af ter the financial crisis hit a crescendo in the \nfall of 2008. \n \n[Slide 5] \n   \nFigure 3  puts in perspective the cumulative cash dividends of the largest banks by \ncomparing them to the Capital Purcha se Program (CPP) funds they received. \n [Slide 6]  This suggests that if dividends had been ha lted at the SCAP banks once the LIBOR rate \nrose, nearly $80 billion would have been retained as capital.  This repres ents close to 50 percent \nof the CPP funds used to recap italize these banks in the fall  of 2008.  Clearly a proactive \napproach to dividend retention could have substantially reduced the need for an emergency \ninfusion of public funds. \n\n 4Financial Indicators of Emerging Problems \n \n Regulatory dividend policy was focused on the ability of banks to pay dividends out of \nearnings.  However, earnings declines occurred later than the financial market responses to \nemerging problems.  In addition, banks’ management and boards of directors rarely are proactive \nin reducing dividends, because of concerns that it will signal that they are experiencing more \nsevere financial problems than their peers.  W ith earnings somewhat slow  to react to emerging \nproblems, and boards reluctant to signal problems, most of the large banks were very slow to \nreact to the crisis w ith reduced dividends. \n [Slide 7] \n  \nSimilarly, banks’ supervisory ratings were  also slow to react, as shown in Figure 4 .  The \nmeasure of the share of assets  in so-called “problem” banks\nii – the blue line – responds only with \na delay.  A similar pattern emerges if one looks at the percentage of ba nk assets in the three \nlowest supervisory ratings (CAMELS ratings of  3, 4, or 5), although it captures a much higher \npercentage of total bank assets.  In contrast, the credit default sw ap spread for the four largest \nU.S. banking organizations – the green line – began to climb in the fall of 2007 and continued to \nclimb throughout 2008 and into 2009.  I should note th at we use the four largest banks simply \nbecause of the availability of hi storical credit default swap data, but our modeling suggests this is \nrepresentative for the larg est banks more generally. \n [Slide 8] \n \nFigure 5  shows that a similar pattern emerges if one uses the market capitalization \nrelative to assets of the four  largest banking organizations.\niii  Like the credit default swaps, the \nmeasure (the green line) began to decline si gnificantly in the fall of 2007 and continued to \ndecline through 2008 and into 2009.  Again this fina ncial indicator of bank health moved far \nmore quickly than regulatory ratings (s ee the blue line) or dividend reductions. \n  \n\n 5[Slide 9] \n  \nFigure 6  highlights another issue – that as fi nancial markets took a bleaker view of \nbanks’ financial prospects (in th e top chart), banks had begun to tighten credit standards (in the \nbottom chart).  By the end of 2007, credit standards had tightened substantially, relative to where \nthey were in the beginning of th at year.  Banks seek to mainta in reasonable capital-to-assets \nratios and loans are, of course, assets for banks .  If capital is eventually reduced due to loan \nwrite-downs, and banks reduce lending to main tain capital-to-asset ratios, the “collateral \ndamage” to those who would like to borrow from  “supply-constrained” banking institutions can \nimpose a significant cost to the economy more broadly.  So the impact of only slowly reducing \ndividends, rather than retaining capital in the banking system, extends well beyond losses to \nstockholders and poten tially taxpayers.   \n \nPolicy Implications \n \n[Slide 10] \n  \nEven from the perspective of micro prudential supervision, mo re proactive dividend \nreduction would have ameliorated some of the cost s of the financial crisis .  Rather than basing \nregulatory dividend policy on accounting constructs that tend to be slow moving and backward \nlooking, regulatory policy should pr ompt supervisors to look forwar d and thus more proactively \nseek reductions in dividends in appropriate ci rcumstances.  In particular, given the financial-\nmarket signals of impending problems that I have  highlighted today, I believe that supervisors \nneed in such circumstances to be more proac tive in seeking capital retention through reduced \ndividends at banki ng organizations. \n [Slide 11] \n  \nOf course, signaling problems can make it di fficult for supervisors to mandate reductions \nat individual institutions.  When  a wide variety of indicators suggest potential problems in the \nbanking sector, signaling problems c ould be avoided if, hypothetically, all banks were required \n\n 6to reduce dividends – or all banks with outsized exposures .  For example, banks with large real \nestate exposures in loans and secu rities could in such a situation be required to reduce dividends \nbefore accounting losses were realized.  Such a policy might very well reduce the credit-availability problems that have  unfortunately been a hallmark  of this financial crisis. \n In retrospect, empirical analysis suggests that bank management and supervisors had an \nopportunity to retain capital once problems became identifiable, but before the full extent of the \ncrisis emerged in the fall of 2008.  In the spir it of learning and appl ying lessons, one must \nconsider whether this dynamic c ould repeat itself – or indeed is repeating itself.   For example, in \nsome parts of the world today, sovereign risk ex posure seems problematic and elevated credit \ndefault swaps and low stock market valuations have not prevented some banks from continuing \nto pay dividends.   \nIn sum, I suggest that more aggressive policy may not only reduce potential taxpayer \nexposure to the banking sector, but also insulate  the broader economy from the sorts of loan-\nsupply shocks that can provide significan t headwinds to an economic recovery. \n Thank you.  \n                                                             \nNOTES: \n \ni Supervisory Capital Assessment Program \n \nii Problem banks, as defined by the FDIC, are banks with a CAMELS rating of 4 or 5.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 1 \n \n \nHow Should Monetary Policy \nRespond to a Slow Recovery? \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nThe Forecasters Club of New York \nSeptember 29, 2010 \n \n \n \n \nThank you for the opportunity to speak w ith you today at the Forecaster’s Club.*  \nWorking at the Fed over the last 25 years has given me a healthy regard for the challenges \nyou face every day as you attempt to divine the future path of the economy.  Even during the \nbest of times it is not easy, but this has been a particularly challenging time in forecasting.  It \nhas proven to be very difficult to  incorporate the effects of the financial  system into models of \nthe economy – in part because the financial sect or may have a significant impact on economic \nforecasts only during the rare occasions when the sector is badly disrupted.  \nWhile financial markets and financial instituti ons are now in far better shape than two \nyears ago, the collateral damage  on the economy from the financial shocks has been severe.  \n                                                 \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board \nof Governors or the Federal Open  Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 2The damage has, unfortunately, followed the patte rn established in the aftermath of previous \nsignificant financial disruptions, which tend to cause an extended period of subpar economic \ngrowth.1 \n  These days, as in past recoveries, it is not uncommon to hear some observers say that \nthere is little that policymakers can or should do .  This is not my perspective, and I want to \nuse this opportunity to share some of the analytical and empirical underpinnings for my \nviews. \nWhile these topics are getting a lot of atten tion of late – understandably – many of us \nhave been researching them for so me time.  And I would just like  to reiterate that I take an \nempirical, data-driven approach to policymaking responsibilities – a fact I believe my talk \ntoday will demonstrate. \nWhile certainly the economic problems we are facing are daunting, I do not see them \nas insurmountable.  In fact, although the economy is  far from where we would like it to be, we \nare in a far better place than we were two y ears ago, when financial markets and economic \nactivity were in the process of “seizing up.”  Th e stock market is well off its lows, interest \nspreads have narrowed, and the economy has had four quarters of positive, if anemic, growth.   \nAnd it was policy – monetary policy and fis cal policy, and to some degree supervisory \npolicy – that played a critical role in the impr ovements we have seen over the past two years.  \nWe have a long way to go, but it would have be en much longer but for a number of parties \nmaking difficult but appropr iate policy decisions.   \nHowever, while we have seen positive growth  over the past year, it has been slow.  \nWe have seen some increases in employment, but there has not been any significant reduction \nin the high percentage of workers who ar e unemployed.  And, while financial market \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 3conditions have improved dramatically, cred it availability remains an issue for many \nindividuals and businesses.  In short,  policymaking has been effective at stabilizing  the \neconomy, but the recovery remains far too weak to restore what we consider full employment \nwith the speed I would like to see.   \nToday I would like to touch on a number of issues, including some of the recently \nhypothesized impediments to a more robust recove ry.  I would also like to explore some of \nthe options for generating a more robust reco very – options that policymakers need to \nconsider and debate, thoughtfully and analytically, as we go forward.    \nAllow me to preview my punch line.  I’ve called this talk “How Should Monetary \nPolicy Respond to a Slow Recovery?”  My answer  to that question is: vigorously, creatively, \nthoughtfully, and persistently, as long as we  have options at our  disposal.  And we do have \noptions, despite having pushed short-te rm rates to the zero lower bound.   \n \nDislocations in the Labor Market? \nSome hypothesize that a more r obust recovery is impeded by dislocations in the labor \nmarket.  Indeed, history shows that even w ith a relatively mild recession there can be \nsignificant dislocations.  The 2001 rece ssion provides a good example.  As Figure 1  shows, \ninformation technology and manufacturing were two industries that saw significant declines \nin employment in that downturn.  The end of the “dot-com” euphoria and structural shifts in \nthe manufacturing sector caused those two industr ies to be disproportionately affected, while \nwe had only modest declines in the cyclical construction industry, and increases  in \nemployment in several industries.  Similarl y, the 1990 recession had a decline in employment \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 4of more than 5 percent in onl y the construction industry, when overbuilding in several regions \nof the country led to a signif icant readjustment in constr uction-industry employment.   \nIn fact, in each of the three previous reces sions there was a decline of 5 percent or \nmore in no more than two industry categories – as the figure shows – with many industries \nexperiencing little or no net j ob loss over the course of the rece ssion.  Structural shifts across \nindustries are not uncommon in recessions – a nd also, some structur al dislocation seems \ninevitable as it will always take some time fo r capital and labor to flow to those industries \nwith the greatest opportunities.  In rather stark contrast, the most recent re cession is far less a re flection of dislocation \nin a few industries but rather reflects a general decline in almost all  industries.  As the chart \non the far right shows, in this recession there has been a peak to trough loss of employment of \n5 percent or greater in co nstruction, manufacturing, reta il trade, wholesale trade, \ntransportation, information technology, financia l activities, and professional and business \nservices.  To me, this does not suggest that th e driver is structural change in the economy \nincreasing job mismatches – although no doubt some of that exists – but instead I see here a \nwidespread decline in demand across most industries.   \nNot surprisingly, given this far-reaching d ecline in labor demand, job vacancies are \nremarkably low.  Not only are they low, but th ey are also well below the experience in most \nrecent recessions, making small movements in j ob-vacancy rates particularly difficult to \ninterpret.  For example, economists and forecas ters are estimating Beve ridge curves (plotting \nthe relationship between job vacancies and unemployment)\n2 well outside historical \nexperience, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about recent movements.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 5 Figure 2  highlights that job mismatches are not the primary problem.  The bottom \nchart shows that the percentage of  small businesses with one or more hard-to-fill jobs open is \nnear the low point for the series over nearly 25 years.  According to survey data, businesses \nare having no problem finding skilled workers for what were considered hard-to-fill \nvacancies.  This is consistent with my ongoing di scussions with representatives of businesses, \nwho generally report no difficulty finding quali fied workers even for quite specialized \npositions.   \nHowever, as the top chart on the figure  shows, most small businesses are not \nexpecting to increase employment.  When I ta lk with representative s of businesses, the \nprimary reason they give for this  is they are not seeing suffici ent demand for their products.  \nIf they were confident that demand would pi ck up, they would – and easily could – hire \nadditional workers. \n \nBalance Sheet Adjustments? \n Another impediment to a more robust recovery could well be balance sheet \nadjustments by financial and nonfinancial firm s, and households.  To  explore this, let’s \nexamine this cycle in some more detail.  Figure 3  splits the time since the onset of the \nrecession into three periods:   \n• The first period runs from the beginn ing of the recession in December 2007 \nthrough August 2008.  Up to that point, the recession looked quite similar in depth \nand duration to previous recessions.  Th e only sector with a very substantial \ndecline in employment was th e construction industry.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 6• The second period is from August 2008 through June 2009.  After the large \nfinancial shocks that occu rred in September and Octobe r of 2008, there were large \nand widespread declines in employment ac ross a wide variety of industries.  Both \nthe disruption of credit and concerns that we could see an extremely severe \ncontraction caused most businesses to become far more cautious.   \n• The final period, from June 2009 to the presen t, encompasses the recovery to date.  \nThis recovery has been quite slow, with continued sharp declines in construction \nactivity.  In fact, the first y ear of the recovery has an em ployment pattern similar to \nshallow recessions, indicating just how w eak the recovery has been so far. \n Most forecasts of employment and unemploym ent during this period did not anticipate \nthe severe turn of events.  Figure 4  provides the Blue Chip for ecast for unemployment at the \nbeginning of the first two periods in the charts  we just saw – and the actual unemployment \nexperience.  In December 2007, few saw cause fo r great alarm.  The expectation was that \nunemployment would remain stable near 5 percent, when in fact what actually happened was \na marked increase in the unemployment rate.   \nIn part, the forecasts were off because ma ny of the financial disruptions that were \nalready evident were not well captured in econometric models.  Also, recessions are \nnotoriously difficult to predict, and most models struggle to cap ture turning points. \nThe second chart on Figure 4 shows that even in August 2008, many forecasts did not \npredict great difficulties.  For the most part, th e unemployment rate was expected to remain \nnear 6 percent, when in reality it rose to over 9 percent.  Thus, one month before the worst of \nthe financial crisis emerged, there was little expe ctation of a significant financial shock or the \nmajor impact that it would ha ve on the overall economy.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 7Fortunately, the Federal Reserve had alrea dy begun to ease – and continued to ease \nquite dramatically – despite most forecasts predicting a more benign outcome.  We had already reduced the federal funds  rate very substantially by A ugust, and as a result of the \nfinancial crisis eventually pushed the federal f unds rate essentially to its lower bound of zero.  \nThus, during much of this period monetary po licy was quite proactive.  While it could not \noffset the effects of the severe problems emer ging in the economy, the policy stance was more \nresponsive than if it had been in synch with most private forecasts at the time.  This \npolicymaking was key to avoiding far worse outcomes.   \nFigure 5  looks at the forecasts for unemployment at the end of this year over the span \nof time I referred to as the recovery  period.  At the beginning of 2010, the unemployment rate \nwas 9.7 percent.  As the figure shows, there ha s been a consistent vi ew that the recovery \nwould be weak and make only limited progre ss on reducing unemploy ment.  While through \nApril the forecasts were getting more optimis tic about labor market trends, since then \nforecasters have been raising  their forecasts for unemployment.  Regrettably, I have to concur \nwith the view expressed in these forecasts – th at the unemployment rate is likely to be very \nclose to the very elevated level at the beginning of the year.   \nFigure 6  provides some context for that pessi mism.  While two of the past four \nquarters had growth (in blue) above estimates of potential, the expans ion in what we call \n“final sales” (in red) has been below potenti al.  Since by definition the difference between \nGDP and final sales reflects inventories, we need final sales to pick up – especially as \ntemporary stimulus from inventories, and governme nt, subsides.  Unfortunately, there is little \nevidence in the data of that ha ppening, with growth in the sec ond half of 2010 likely to be in \nthe vicinity of 2 percent.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 8The bottom graph on Figure 6 shows the ch ange in the employment-to-population \nratio (in green).  While there was employment growth in the first half of 2010, it has only resulted in a slight improvement in the employment-to-population ratio. \nWith that background, let me note that one ch allenge in getting th e economy to grow \nfaster has been the desire of households and bus inesses to essentially “rebuild” their balance \nsheets in the wake of this so-called “Great Recession.”  Figure 7  highlights that the personal \nsavings rate has risen, and Figure 8  shows that households have  increased their holdings of \ncash and securities.  While rebuilding wealth a nd remaining more liquid are natural reactions \nto recent conditions – and positive in a long-te rm sense – the fact is they portend rather \nmodest increases in consumption in the near term, until consumers become more confident about their prospects.   \nFigure 9 highlight that businesses an d banks have also been increasing their holdings \nof cash and securities.  While this is natural, su ch behavior will likely keep growth in business \nfixed investment rather restrained. \n \nThe Policy Response \nSo how should monetary policy react to a ve ry anemic recovery?  The usual monetary \npolicy response to slow growth in nominal GD P would be to continue  reducing the federal \nfunds rate, and during the past tw o slow recoveries that is what the Federal Reserve did.  As I \nhave already highlighted, by central bank standard s we moved rather quickly to recognize the \nseverity of the problem in this downturn, and responded with mone tary accommodation.  \nHowever, since the end of 2008 the federal funds rate has been bounded by zero, which has eliminated the ability to decrease  short-term interest rates.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 9A simple Taylor Rule calculation, shown in Figure 10,  relates movements in the \nfederal funds rate to deviations  in inflation and unemployment from their targets.  The far \nright section of the chart highlig hts that given the very low leve l of inflation and the very high \nlevel of the unemployment rate, the Fed would have continued to reduce the funds rate over \nthe past two years, but for the zero lower bound. \nConstrained by the zero bound, the Federal Re serve utilized less conventional policies \n– as shown in Figure 11.   Most of these approaches had never been tried in the United States \nprior to the crisis.  New polic ies outside of historical experience necessarily involve some \nuncertainty about their impact. We  were fortunate that Chairman Bernanke and the Federal \nOpen Market Committee had the courage to undertake unconventional policies in the “teeth” of a crisis. It is easy – and I dare sa y commonplace – to underestimate the economic \ndisruption that would likely have arisen if we  at the Fed had stuck to our ”comfort zone.” \nIt is easy with hindsight to see the financ ial meltdown as an historic economic crisis, \none that galvanized officials to push out the boundaries of policymaking and take action.  But \nin my view, current economic conditions – an unemployment rate near 10 percent, sluggish \ngrowth, and undesirably low infl ation – together constitute  a serious economic problem. \nWhile it’s clear to everyone why a high unemplo yment rate is a problem, one of the reasons \nwe worry about a too-low rate of inflation is that  the closer to zero the inflation rate gets, the \ngreater the risk it could fall into a harmful deflation.   \nAs I said earlier, we do have options, despite having pus hed short-term rates to the \nzero lower bound.  One of the ch allenges is that with unconven tional policies, costs can be \napparent but benefits more indire ct, and harder to track.     \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 10The Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purch ases – primarily purchases of mortgage-\nbacked securities – arguably had multiple effects, including maintaining market function in the mortgage markets. But in my view thei r primary impact on the economy was achieved by \nreducing mortgage rates. Rates had been around 6 percent prior to the change in policy, and \nmoved closer to 5 percent as our purc hases began to accumulate, as shown in Figure 12 .  It \nalso appears that by “removing duration” from the market, other long-term rates were also \nreduced in response to our purchases.   \nOf course, none of this is easy or without  complications.  There are concerns about \nthings like creating distortions  in credit allocation, complicating exit strategies when they \nbecome appropriate, and exposing the Federal Rese rve to interest-rate ri sk.  Those issues are \nimportant to recognize, and to work to mitigate.  At the same time, we cannot take lightly how \nfar off the mark unemployment and inflation seem to be. \nNow I’d like to make a few observations on Fed purchases of Treasury  securities.  \nFirst, the positives: Purchases of long-term Treasury securities are likely to push down \nlong-term interest rates on Treasury bonds, but also are likely to re duce rates on other long-\nterm securities. Some have argued that it woul d be difficult to reduce Treasury rates further, \nbut Figure 13  highlights, importantly, that U.S. Treas ury rates are still well above the zero \nbound, roughly equivalent to rates in Germany, a nd well above long-term rates in Japan.   \nNow some concerns: While purchases of Treas ury securities have the advantage of not \ndirectly “allocating credit” to  a particular industry, they have the disadvantage of only \nindirectly affecting the private  borrowing rates that more direc tly affect private investment \nspending.  In addition, Treasury pu rchases raise for some a con cern that the Fed intends to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n 11monetize the federal debt, using monetary policy to accommodate the financing of fiscal \npolicy.  I can assure you that we have no de sire or intention whatsoever to do so.   \nWhile lower long-term rates are likely the primary channel through which asset \npurchases would influence the economy, purchases  of Treasury or mortgage-backed securities \nalso expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  and increase the amount of reserves in the \nfinancial system.  This expansion of reserves mi ght serve as an effective signal that highlights \nthe determination of the Federal Reserve to reduce disinflationa ry pressures.   \nCertainly, views on securities purchases di ffer within the ranks of policymakers and \nall manner of observers. I would just reiterate th at it is important to keep firmly in mind the \ngoal of such purchases: to stimulate the econom y by reducing long-term interest rates to a \nlevel that is more consistent with where they  would be, were we able to further reduce the \nfederal funds rate. \n \nConcluding Observations \nWhile the economy is growing, it is curren tly growing too slowly to significantly \nreduce the unemployment rate or stem disinfla tionary pressures created by the high degree of \nslack in the economy.  While fiscal policies may be the most effective way to stimulate the \neconomy when short-term interest rate s approach the zero  bound, unconventional monetary  \npolicies provide additional policy options. Of c ourse, policymakers need to carefully weigh \nthe benefits and costs of unconventional moneta ry policy – some of which I have tried to \nshare with you today.  Yet all in all, my firm view is that it is  important that policymakers be \nopen to implementing policies consistent with achieving full employment, and an appropriate \nlevel of inflation, within a r easonable time frame.  Thank you. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n \n \nRemarks at the Federal Reserve \nConference on REO and Vacant Property \nStrategies for Neighborhood Stabilization \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nWashington, D.C. \nSeptember 2, 2010 \n \n \n \n \n [Slide 1]  \n \nI’m very happy to be here today, to take part in a conference on topics of such importance. Housing has played a central role in the fi nancial crisis and the subsequent economic \ndifficulties that we have been experiencing now for more than three years.\n* \n This conference brings together  people from around the country who have been on the front \nlines looking for solutions to mitigate the personal and societal costs of mounting \nforeclosures, and the buildup of REO properties.  By gathering together , we can learn from \neach other’s successes – and also from each  other’s well-intentioned failures.   \n                                                \n \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board \nof Governors or the Federal Open  Market Committee (the FOMC). \n 1\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nI expect we will learn that a single solution may not work in all regions of the country.  What \nseems promising in Cleveland and in other cities  in the northern Midwes t may not be the best \nsolution for New England, or for Southern Californ ia.  The reason, I suspect, is that the effects \nof the housing and financial crisis on any community depend, importantly , on the attributes of \nthe community.  For example, how susceptibl e is the population to extended spells of \nunemployment or other income disruptions ?  How healthy was the local economy and \nindustry before the crisis?  And how well- equipped are local nonpr ofit and governmental \ninstitutions – and civic leaders – to re spond to the fallout from the crisis?  \n \n[Slide 2]  \n \nMy comments today will focus on the forecl osure and REO problem in my region – New \nEngland.  In particular, I want to ask how best to understand the problem: Is it a housing \nproblem that affects all communities similarly?  Or is it a foreclosure and REO problem that affects all communities in a similar way?  Or is  the problem better understood as a crisis that \nis reflected differently in each community, and t hus requires solutions that are very likely to \ndiffer, across communities?    \nI’ll just take a moment to preview my remarks.  I will first show that New England locations, \ndefined by zip codes, with a high concentration of REO properties have (not surprisingly) incurred larger declines in home prices than zip codes with lower REO concentrations.  I will \nthen highlight that many of these same communities were areas that faced challenges even before the foreclosure crisis – challenges that made these communities more likely to suffer disproportionately the cons equences of the crisis.\n1    \n I will then touch briefly on research and policy implications.  In particular, do we need more \nholistic approaches to addressing this crisis?  Should there be more state and federal revenue \nsharing focused on providing flexible funds to th e communities most affected?   My answer to \nboth of these questions is a yes.  But I would also argue that we need to not only explore \nalternative solutions, but also do a much better job of establishing which solutions work – and then try to replicate effective solutions on a larger scale. \n 2\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nHow Should the Foreclosure Problem Be Framed?  \n \n[Slide 3]  \n \nFinding the right solution require s asking the right question.   So I want to begin by asking, \nwhat is the question we are trying to answer?    To that end I suggest we do a little exercise.  We might gain some insight into how the \nattendees at this conference are framing the question by looking at the non-profit organizations on the program.  What is their key focus?  If we assume the name of an organization was chosen to indicate its central  mission, by noting the keyword in the name we \nmay learn something about their primary focus.  On the agenda for this conference, five non-\nprofit organizations have “community” or “neighborhood” in their names; two have \n“housing”; and one has “foreclos ure” or “REO.”  Most of you are no doubt focusing on rising \nforeclosures and REO properties, but it seem s that you see these through the “lens” of \ncommunity.  However, it is less clear that public policies have been similarly aligned. \n \n[Slide 4]  \n \nTo help illustrate why the framing of a problem is important, we should consider what the focus might be if we assume different primary objectives.   \n \n• If one looks at the problem as primarily a foreclosure and REO problem rooted in the \nhousing bubble, the solutions will tend to emphasize mitigating the foreclosure problem or accelerating the disposition of REO properties.  Some will also advocate \nfor a reconsideration of the legal system’s approach to personal bankruptcy and foreclosure.  \n \n \n• If, instead, one views the problem as being primarily a housing problem, you might address the problem differently.  You might focus on solutions that result in \nsustainable home ownership.  For exam ple, what should be the minimum down \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \npayment on a house, and what financing appr oaches would results in sustainable home \nownership?  The solutions to this sort of a problem might be focusing on financial \neducation, addressing predatory home fi nancing, and redefining appropriate \nunderwriting standards.  The availability of  affordable rental housing might also be a \nfocus.   \n \n• If the problem is seen through the lens of community, however, foreclosure may be \nviewed as a symptom of broader problems  affecting neighborhoods – such as high \nconcentrations of unemployment, elevated cr ime rates, and poor code enforcement.  \nLet me be clear; I am not saying that “the community is the problem,” but rather that, \nin this view, different communities will e xperience problems differently because of \ntheir different characteristics,  requiring different solutions  in many cases.  The public \npolicy solution for this problem may be to have more general revenues available for \nnon-profits and local governments to addre ss the problem in a more holistic fashion.  \n \n[Slide 5]  \n \nClearly there are elements of a ll three in the current crisis.  This is a foreclosure problem.  \nThis is a housing problem.  This is a community  problem.  However, as I just illustrated, the \nsolutions may be somewhat different, depending on how one frames the problem.  So, we should ask, do we have the right balance as we th ink about the best way to address a serious – \nand I would argue multifaceted – public policy problem ?  My own view is th at too little focus \nhas been on community problems because the focus has been more targeted to housing and foreclosures.  \n  \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nEvidence from New England  \n \n[Slide 6]  \n \nAs we consider these questions, I’d like to share with you some evid ence from New England \n– and in particular Greater Boston.  \n[Slide 7]  \n \nThe first chart provides REO per square mile in three New England states by zip code and compares that with the change in the medi an housing sales price from 2005 to 2008 for the \nsame zip code.  As you can see in the chart, in  areas with a lower con centration of REO there \nis not a strong correlation with changes in median  sales price.  However, as the concentration \nof REO increases there is a much stronger corr elation with median sales price change.  Zip \ncodes with higher concentrations of REO tend to have seen larger declines in median sales \nprice.  Let me be quick to acknowledge the open questio n of causality.  We ar e doing more statistical \nwork to try to understand the causality in th e REO-concentration and house-price relationship.  \nThat work needs to also control for factors such as population density.   \n \n[Slide 8]  \n \nThe next figure highlights that high concentrations of REO are not the only problem afflicting \nthose communities.  Zip codes with four or mo re REOs per square mile also have higher \nproperty crime rates, higher rates of low birth- weight babies, higher unemployment rates, and \nweaker small business activity.  Note that all th ese charts are for the time period that generally \nprecedes the foreclosure crisis, so these communities were already challenged.   \n  \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n[Slide 9]  \n \nIndeed, the next figure highlight s that children in these comm unities were being impacted \neven before the dramatic increase in foreclos ures.  Communities that would eventually have \nfour or more REO properties per square mile had higher high school drop -out rates and higher \nfailures in statewide math tests.    It is hard to imagine that dramatic increases in foreclosure rates woul d not exacerbate these \nproblems.  A foreclosure is likely to mean not  only a loss of home, but  also a disruption in \nwhere, or whether, kids are in school.  Since foreclosure is often related to unemployment, \nmarital stress, or physical ailments, the foreclos ure is likely to make it difficult for even the \nmost determined student to excel.  The impact of the foreclosure crisis on children is something we are trying to bett er understand at the Boston Fed. \n The bottom chart on slide 9 highlights that thes e communities have a large gap between their \nmunicipal service needs and thei r ability to raise revenues to pay for those needs (…the so-\ncalled “fiscal gap”).  A recent study at the Bo ston Fed highlights that non-school revenue \nsharing in Massachusetts is not well aligned with communities’ fiscal gaps.\n2  Changes in \nrevenue sharing are critic al to helping those communities address their problems.  Potentially, \na federal revenue sharing program at the na tional level that focuses on these communities \ncould help.  These funds could be provided in a flexible way so they could target those areas \nof most importance – since loca l governments may be in a bette r position to determine if the \nfunds should be directed to more teachers, mo re code enforcement, more police, or more \nassistance to non-profit organizations that ar e making a difference in their communities. \n \n[Slide 10]  \n \nNow, since a picture is worth a thousand word s, I would like to show you some maps that \ndemonstrate how clusters of REO are associat ed with a host of othe r community problems. \n \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \nThe next five figures [Slides 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]  show the community pa tterns in the data.  \nThose communities with very high REO per squa re mile also fare poorly in many other \ndimensions.  Many communities are performing poor ly in all the criteria illustrated in the \nfigures.  If these are community problems, we may need to search for community solutions. \n \nImplications for Research and Policy  \n  \n[Slide 16]  \n \nThe patterns in these data imply a need for more  holistic approaches to the problem.  This is \nnot a one-size-fits-all foreclos ure or housing problem; these are community problems.  Of \ncourse, I am showing you examples from Ne w England and one needs to examine how \nsimilar or dissimilar the patte rns are in other regions.   \n But it seems, in sum, that communities with some of these challenging attributes are likely to experience higher rates of foreclosure and RE O.  And the same communities experience \ngreater hardships in th e face of rising foreclosures and REO.   \n \nRather than treating the symp tom – the high REO problem – we need to better understand \nhow to resolve the more general problems in co mmunities that lead to higher concentrations \nof REOs and exacerbate the eff ects of high REOs.  However, the challenge of finding holistic \nsolutions is significant,  and longstanding.   \n \nI am encouraging Boston Fed staff to work to better understand how foreclosures and REO \ncan exacerbate problems in troubled communities – and to look for data that can better determine which solutions work, under which ci rcumstances.  For example, we have been \nexamining the issues and barriers keeping th e city of Springfield, Massachusetts from \nprosperity, with an eye to assi sting Springfield and also shari ng the lessons more broadly.  As \npart of that work we have examined the fact ors that have helped other similar cities around \nthe country achieve a greater  degree of resurgence.\n3 \n \n 7\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n 8                                                I am particularly encouraging my staff to look at how foreclosures affect children.  While not \nresponsible for the foreclosure problem, childre n may be affected by its consequences for \nyears to come, if it prevents them from meeting their potential in school and eventually in the \nlabor force. \n \n[Slide 17]  \n \nWhile more research needs to be done on the communities, and on which solutions work, we should also reflect on how we ar e spending our public policy dolla rs.  Are they appropriately \nbalanced to the problems of housing, foreclosure, and community need?  If a more holistic approach is needed, states and the federal government may need to examine the most effective \nand efficient way to address the broader problems in these communities, including potentially looking at revenue sharing that provides a flex ible way to address the fiscal gap faced by \nmany of our hard-pressed communities.   Thank you.  I believe we are now proceeding to the next session on the conference agenda. \n  \n \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 Since New England housing prices were less variable than those in other regions, its foreclosure problems may \nbe slanted towards areas with secular problems. \n \n2 See “Does Springfield Receive Its Fa ir Share of Municipal Aid?

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nThe Money Marketeers of New York University \n  \nNew York \nMay 5, 2010 \n \n \n \n I am happy to be with you this evening.  I appreciate your warm welcome, and your \ninvitation to join the long a nd distinguished line of indivi duals who have addressed the \nMoney Marketeers over the decades.\n*  \n \nI have always taken some delight in Yogi  Berra quotes.   As a Red Sox fan, I could \nalways hope that garbled metaphors by the legendary Yogi would be as confusing to the players as they were to the public, which mi ght translate into opport unities when the Red \n                                                \n \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n 1\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nSox came to New York.  Alas, in the early go ing this season it is not the Yankees that \nseem confused.   \n Yogi Berra was not only a great catcher and mana ger, but also an astute observer of the \nobvious.  If he were to summarize this talk  he might suggest a title like “Knowing Your \nDestination is a Good Start in  Getting Where You Are Going”  or some other derivation \nof what I believe is his actual quote: “You' ve got to be very careful if you don't know \nwhere you are going because you might not get there.”    When setting monetary policy, it is very importa nt to have a clear idea of where you want \nthe economy to go.  And fortunately, there is  now much more transparency about the \nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) expected destination, because the FOMC \nreleases its long-term projections for in flation and unemployment.  Unfortunately, \nhowever, actually reaching our desired dest ination will prove challenging and involve \nchoices, as I will discuss this evening.  At our January meeting, the central te ndency of the FOMC members’ long-run \nprojections for unemployment was 5.0 to 5.2 pe rcent, and for inflation (measured by the \npersonal consumption expenditures price inde x or PCE) was 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  At \npresent, both unemployment and inflation di verge significantly from these longer-term \ngoals, with the March unemployment rate at 9.7 percent, and core PCE inflation over the \npast year at 1.3 percent.  In such circumstances, one might th ink that the current path of \nmonetary policy would be particularly straightforward. \n 2\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \nUnfortunately, just knowing your destinati on doesn’t get you there.  To reach your \ndestination you need to know how you want to get there.  If  I plug a destination into my \nnew GPS device, it asks whether I want the quickest route, or the geographically shortest route, or a route that meets some other crite ria. The quickest route is likely to involve \nhighways, but may cover more miles.  The shor test route may take side roads that reduce \ndistance and save gas, but take  substantially more time.  A nd, of course, you may run into \ntraffic or construction that for ces you to adapt your route. \n When setting monetary policy there may be a variety of paths you can take to reach the \ndestination.  For instance, aggressive pursu it of accommodative monetary policy by the \nFed and stimulative fiscal policy by Congress and the Administration might get us more \nquickly to our desired destination – but could enlarge the deficit or risk igniting inflation \nexpectations.  Alternatively, aggressive pursuit of less accommodative policies – that is, \nremoving monetary and fiscal stimulus sooner rather than later – could result in a more \nextended period of underutilized resources; or wo rse, significantly in crease the length of \nthe journey to our ultimate destination.    Right now, we are far from our destination, and the rest of my remarks will focus on \nselecting among the alternate routes to our objective.  The economy is currently beginning to reco ver from what many ar e calling the Great \nRecession.  While real GDP began to increase in the third quarte r of last year, growth so \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nfar has been insufficient to improve conditi ons much in the labor markets.  This \nunfortunate reality can be seen in Figure 1 , which shows the employment-to-population \nratio over the past 30 years w ith the shading representing recessions.  The decline of \nabout five percentage points in the employ ment-to-population ratio in this recession is \nstriking, as many workers have either beco me unemployed or dropped out of the work \nforce.   \n While it is not uncommon for the employmen t-to-population ratio to decline in a \nrecession, Figure 2  shows how dramatic the decline has been in this recession, compared \nwith previous ones.\n1  The loss of jobs has been par ticularly acute in construction and \nmanufacturing.  The severity of the job losse s in these male-dominated industries is one \nof the reasons that males in some age groups have experienced such a significant decline \nin their employment-to-popul ation ratio, as shown in Figure 3 .    For example, the March \nunemployment rates for males between the ages of 20 and 24 was 18.4 percent, more \nthan 5 percentage points higher than for females in the same age group.  The sharp reduction in the ratio of employm ent to population highlights our challenge – \nachieving a full recovery will require creating jobs for  those currently unemployed and actively seeking work, those entering the labo r force as the population grows, and those \nlikely to return to the labor force once jobs become more available.  Employing all these \nworkers within a reasonable period of time will require very strong economic growth.  \nThe question is, how likely is that?  \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nFigure 4  shows the growth rate in e ach of the first three years of the last three recoveries, \nas well as the average rates for all three recoveries.   The most  recent two recoveries were \nquite slow to get started, but picked up steam over time.  This is the pattern projected in \nmost forecasts for this recovery.   \n Over the past three quarters, GDP has increased 3.7 percent.\n2  However, some of the \ngrowth resulted from temporary rebalancing of  inventories by businesses, as suggested by \nFigure 5 , which shows that the percent change in real final sales was quite a bit smaller \nthan the percent change in GDP.  The gap be tween them would be inventory rebuilding.   \n Most private forecasts expect growth in the next four quarters to be fast enough to begin \nto make more improvement in the labor market .  My own expectation is consistent with \nthis.  As financial headwinds subside, and consumers and businesses gain more \nconfidence in the recovery, expenditures that ha ve been deferred will  be made – and we \nshould begin to see stronger economic growth.    Despite this forecast of an improved outlook, we will need very strong growth if we are \nto return to 5 percent unempl oyment in a reasonable time frame.  Economists frequently \nuse a rule of thumb, called Okun’s Law, to characterize the relationship between output growth and unemployment. According to Okun’s Law, if the economy grows one \npercentage point faster than its potential for one year, the result will be a decline in the unemployment rate of approximately one-half of a percent.  Of course, I would highlight \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nthat this is a rule of thumb, and that the relationship is more  complicated than this and, of \ncourse, subject to error.    \n But using the simple rule of thumb im plied by Okun’s Law, the left side of Figure 6  \nshows the rates of GDP growth  necessary to return unemp loyment to 5 percent over \ndifferent time frames.  The chart highlights th at we need several years of very strong \ngrowth to reach 5 percent unemployment.  For example, to reach 5 percent unemployment by the end of 2013, real GDP growth would have to average 5 percent per \nyear.\n3  Such a growth rate has some historical precedent, as shown on the right side of the \nchart, but it is much faster than the growth rate in the past two recoveries. And to reach 5 \npercent unemployment by 2015 would still take growth av eraging 4.2 percent per year – \nconsiderably faster than the average rate of growth after the 1991 and 2001 recessions. \n \nGiven the need for very rapid growth to get unemployment back to 5 percent, let me pose \nan oversimplified question – why would policymakers not keep monetary policy very \naccommodative, and fiscal policy very stimulativ e, until we had a sustained growth rate \nthat brought the economy much closer to fu ll employment?  At least on the monetary \nside, one reason might be concern among po licymakers that rapid growth would be \ninflationary.    To explore that, let’s turn to  Figure 7 , which shows the total and core inflation rates, \nmeasured by changes in the CPI, with recessi on shading.  What the chart shows is that \ninflation has declined in each recession, includ ing this so-called Great Recession.  It also \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nhighlights that inflation tends to continue falling in the early stages of a recovery.  Figure \n8 shows the change in the infl ation rate from the business cycle peak.  From the peak \n(shown at zero on the horizontal axis) the infl ation rate is very re strained, and generally \nnegative, for many months.  With substantia l excess capacity in the economy during the \nearly stages of a recovery, workers don’t te nd to demand higher wages, and firms don’t \nfeel at liberty to substantially increase pric es.  Since the Great Recession has resulted in \nsubstantial excess capacity, it woul d be unusual to see increases in  the inflation rate in the \nearly stages of this recovery. \n However, while inflation does not normally increase in the early stages of a recovery, some economic observers may be concerned that this recovery will be different, because of the unusual actions that the Federal Reserv e needed to take.  As you know, the Federal \nReserve took extraordinary measures to stab ilize the financial system – measures that \nwere critical to setting the stage for the current recovery. Figure 9  depicts the additions to \nthe central bank’s balance sheet from these temporary operations.  As you can see in the \nchart, the liquidity facilities that we set up to restore more effective financial market functioning have wound down.  At the same time,  however, in response to the severity of \nthe economic recession the Federal Reserve deci ded to expand its purchases of mortgage-\nbacked and agency securities.  These purchases were undertaken to improve market functioning in the mortgage market, and even more importantly, as a way to reduce a key \ninterest rate at a time when many short-term interest rates were cl ose to, or at, the zero \nlower bound.    \n 7\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nThe purchase program ended in March, and these balances will naturally be dropping \nover time as households prepay mortgages, sell their homes, or refinance.  This decline in \nour balance sheet will actually occur without  the Fed taking any specific actions. But it \nwill occur slowly, and absent any action of the Fed’s part, the balance sheet will remain elevated for years.  This expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet raises concerns for some observers \nand commentators.  An important side effect of our asset purchases has, necessarily, been \na dramatic swelling of so called excess reserves  in the banking system .  When the central \nbank purchases assets, it credits the selling institution with reserves.  Over time, banks \ncould choose to lend out these reserves, whic h would turn the reserves into broader \nmoney – and a rapid expansion of the broa der money supply would be inflationary.  \nHowever, as Figure 10  suggests, the current problem is not a rapid expansion in lending \nand the money supply.  In fact, quite the oppos ite; banks have been reluctant to lend.  \nMany have taken significant losses that have drained their capital; and, at the same time, \nthe financial condition of many potential borrowe rs is worse than before the recession.\n4 \n Were that situation to change and bank le nding to accelerate, the Federal Reserve could \ndrain the excess reserves from the banking syst em. We have a variety of tools. We could \nsell some of our long-term assets, thereby in creasing longer-term interest rates. We now \npay interest on reserves, and that rate could be increased  to discourage bank lending. The \nsize of our balance sheet, the composition of the balance sheet, and our short-term interest rate target are all instruments that we have available to reach our destination of \n 8\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nfull employment with stable prices. Fundament ally, decisions about shrinking our balance \nsheet – like decisions to tighten interest rates – should be conditional on economic \nconditions.    Some analysts warn of rapid inflation aris ing from the expansion of the Fed’s balance \nsheet; but these forecasts have not been borne  out.  In fact, despite  the buildup in excess \nreserves, the inflation rate has been falling – and I expect this tre nd to continue over the \nnear term.  The experience in both Japan and the United States is that after a banking \ncrisis, excess reserves have not been inflatio nary in the short term.  Of course, once the \nbanks have recapitalized and economic resour ces are more fully utilized, we would not \nwant to have a large stock of excess reserves.  Again, as noted, we ha ve a variety of tools \nto remove excess reserves at a tim e when that becomes appropriate. \n \nAs a result, I agree with many forecasters who expect disinflation in the near term.  The \nsubstantial excess capacity in labor market s that I mentioned earlier has caused \ncompensation to decline quite markedly (see Figure 11 ).  Because employee \ncompensation is the main cost component for most companies, lower labor costs enable \nbusinesses to improve profit margins without su bstantial price increases – particularly as \nthe demand for goods and services improves.  This brings us back to Yogi Berra, who famously said, “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.”  At times, a fork in the road is exactly what confronts monetary \npolicymakers.  We would face a fork, for example, if inflationary pressures were building \n 9\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \ndespite  a high unemployment rate.  In this case, the choice between restraining inflation \nand supporting employment is  a difficult one, and the pol icy decision becomes more \ncomplicated.  However, with employment well below the level of full employment, and \ndisinflation continuing to move us away from my own inflation target of 2 percent, one \ndoes not currently need to make such trade-offs.  Another possible complication could occur if  very low interest rates were causing \nexcessive, leveraged bets that were inflating the price of assets that have macroeconomic \nimportance.  While we need to be vigilant against the buildup of asset bubbles, there is \nlittle evidence of such a problem now.  Many fi nancial institutions are still deleveraging – \na factor in why we are seeing too little lending rather than too much.  Real estate can be a \nvery important asset because it serves as co llateral for many loans.  However, in the \ncurrent situation both residential and commercial real estate are, at best, stabilizing.   \n Even if we were to see asset prices rising, it is not obvious that somewhat  tighter interest \nrates will make a significant difference.  A mo re targeted approach would be to examine \nwhether supervisors should require tighter lending standards,  or higher capital \nrequirements, in areas where asset prices ar e appreciating rapidly.   This would make \nsense from the perspective of good risk management – if institutions hold assets that appreciate quickly, they should re tain sufficient capital and be vigilant in credit standards \nto insure that they can weather a quick reve rsal in asset prices.  Raising short-term \ninterest rates because of exuberance in one market is a blunt, and possibly ineffective, \ntool against the exuberance of i nvestors in a particular asset.   As a result, in my view, \n 10\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nshort-term interest rate-setting is better suited for calibrating the growth in the overall \neconomy, rather than focusing on a particular asset class.    \n \nConcluding Observations \n \nIn sum, while the incoming economic data have certainly been more positive of late, we \nremain far from our “stated” destination.  Even with rapid growth in the economy, spurred by accommodative monetary policy and stimulative fiscal policy, it is likely to take years before we approach the growth a nd inflation rates that would really reflect \nachievement of the two elements of  the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. \n The economy, while in a much better place than a year ago, is still susceptible to negative \nshocks.  Serious fiscal problems loom for state and local governments, the U.S. \ngovernment, and governments around the world – particularly those that have expended \nlarge sums of money to recover from this fi nancial crisis and recession. Clearly over time \nwe need to have much more sustainable le vels of budget deficits, at all levels of \ngovernment, here in the U.S. and abroad.\n5  However, I would just note that rapid \nmovement to fiscal austerity, like rapid removal of monetary accommodation, could of \ncourse significantly delay the time it takes to reach full employment. \n While financial markets have improved signifi cantly, real estate problems, bank closures, \nand significant non-performing loans on the boo ks of many banks c ontinue to provide \nfinancial headwinds to the recovery.  And clearly  – as the headlines of the past week have \n 11\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 12                                                highlighted – financial problems abroad still ha ve the potential to result in slower U.S. \nexports, and may hold potential further pr oblems for global financial institutions. \n \nIn sum, my view is that w ith inflation expectations stable, core PCE inflation rates \ndeclining, and significant excess capacity in the economy, accommodative monetary \npolicy remains appropriate.    Thank you.    \n \n \n1 Of course, some of this is the result of the unusual  length of this recession. \n \n2 Year over year, the growth is 2.5 percent – which includes one quarter of negative growth (the second \nquarter of 2009). \n \n3 If the relationship is weaker, as some researchers su ggest, even stronger growth would be required to \nreduce the unemployment rate to 5 percent by year end 2013.  For example, if the reduction in the unemployment rate resulting from real GDP growth of 1 percent above potential is one-third of a percent \ninstead of one-half of a percent, then real GDP growth of 6.25 percent would be needed to reduce the unemployment rate to 5 percent by year end 2013.  \n4 Banks must, of course, maintain their capital ratios.  As some banks have taken significant losses that \ndrained capital, they have been reluctant to expand lending, so that the supply of loanable funds has likely been constrained.  But this supply-side effect has been exacerbated by the credit condition of potential \nborrowers in the wake of the Great Recession.  Even for banks that are less capital-constrained, with the \nbalance sheets of many potential borrowers in much worse shape than they were before the recession, \nlenders making prudent lending decisions will be relu ctant to lend to high-r isk potential borrowers. \n \n5 See for example the remarks by Chairman Ben Bernanke at the National Commission on Fiscal \nResponsibility and Reform on April 27, available at \nhttp://www.federalre serve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100427a.htm \n\nFigure 1 \nEmployment / Population Ratio\nJanuary 1980 - March 2010\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics000111\n54565860626466\nJan-80 Jan-83 Jan-86 Jan-89 Jan-92 Jan-95 Jan-98 Jan-01 Jan-04 Jan-07 Jan-10\nRecessionPercent\n\nFigure 2\nEmployment / Population Ratio:\nChange from Level at Business Cycle Peak\nLast Four Recessions\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics-5-4-3-2-1012\n- 1 2 - 9 - 6 - 3 0369 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0 3 3 3 6\nMonths before (-) and after PeakPercentage Point Difference from Level at Peak\nDecember 2007July 1981\nJuly 1990\nMarch 2001\n\nFigure 3\nEmployment / Population Ratio:\nChange from Level at Business Cycle Peak\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver AnalyticsAll Men, Age 20 - 24\n-14-12-10-8-6-4-2024\n- 1 2 - 9 - 6 - 3 0369 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0 3 3 3 6Months before (-) and after PeakPercentage Point Difference from Level at Peak\nDecember 2007July 1981 July 1990\nMarch 2001\n-14-12-10-8-6-4-2024\n- 1 2 - 9 - 6 - 3 0369 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0 3 3 3 6Months before (-) and after PeakPercentage Point Difference from Level at Peak\nDecember 2007July 1981\nJuly 1990March 2001\n\nFigure 4\nReal Growth in First Three Years of Recovery\nSource:  BEA, NBER / Haver AnalyticsLast Three Recoveries\n02468\nRecovery from      \n1982 RecessionRecovery from      \n1991 RecessionRecovery from      \n2001 RecessionAverage of Last       \nThree RecoveriesReal GDP Growth in First Year\nReal GDP Growth in Second Year\nReal GDP Growth in Third YearPercent Change from Year Earlier\n\nFigure 5\nGrowth in Real GDP and Real Final Sales\n2009:Q3 - 2010:Q1\nSource:  BEA / Haver Analytics0123456\n2009:Q3 2009:Q4 2010:Q1Real GDP Real Final SalesPercent Change at Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate\n\nFigure 6\nEstimates of Annual Real GDP Growth Needed to \nReturn to 5% Unemployment Rate\nSource:  BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics and author’s calculations01234567\nAnnual Growth Needed to Return to 5%   \nUnemployment Rate by Year EndFor Comparison:  Average Annual Growth in First    \nThree Years of Recovery from Last Three RecessionsBy 2012 By 2013 By 2014 By 2015Percent\n1982 Recession\n1991 Recession\n2001 RecessionRecovery from:\nNote: Estimates based on a modified Okun's Law. \n\nFigure 7\nInflation Rate:  Core and All-Items\nConsumer Price Index\nJanuary 1959 - March 2010\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics000111\n-40481216\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecessionPercent Change from Year Earlier\nCore CPI\nCPI All Items\n\nFigure 8\nChange in Inflation Rate (Core CPI) from \nInflation Rate at Business Cycle Peak\nLast Four Recessions\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics-10-8-6-4-202\n-12 -9 -6 -3 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36\nMonths Before (-) and after PeakPercentage Point Difference from Rate at Peak\nJuly 1981July 1990March 2001\nDecember 2007\n\nFigure 9\nFederal Reserve System Assets:\nSelected Temporary Operations\nMarch 19, 2008 - April 28, 2010\nSource: Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1\n02004006008001,0001,2001,400\n19-Mar-08 2-Jul-08 15-Oct-08 28-Jan-09 13-May-09 26-Aug-09 9-Dec-09 24-Mar-10GSE/MBS\nCP Funding Facility\nAsset-Backed CP Liquidity Facility\nPrimary Dealer Credit Facility\nCentral Bank Liquidity SwapsBillions of Dollars\n\nFigure 10\nLoan Growth at Commercial and Savings Banks\n2009:Q1 - 2009:Q4\nSource:  Bank Call Reports and author’s adjustments for mergers and failed-bank acquisitions.Total Loans -1.6 -0.1 -2.6 -0.5\nCommercial Real Estate Loans 0.0 -0.8 -1.6 -2.1\nCommercial and Industrial Loans -4.2 -4.7 -6.2 -4.42009:Q1 2009:Q2 2009:Q3 2009:Q4Percent Change from Previous Quarter\n \n\nFigure 11\nEmployment Cost Indexes for Civilian Workers\nMarch 1983 - March 2010\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n00000111111\n01234567\nMar-83 Mar-86 Mar-89 Mar-92 Mar-95 Mar-98 Mar-01 Mar-04 Mar-07 Mar-10\nRecessionPercent Change from Year Earlier\nWages & SalariesCompensation",

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n  \nThe Global Interdependence Center's Conference on \n\"Financial Interdepen dence in the World's \nPost-Crisis Capital Markets\" \n  \nPhiladelphia \nMarch 3, 2010 \n \n \n  Thank you, Charles, for your kind introduction.  I am very happy to be here today, to \noffer some perspectives on central banking and systemic supervision in an interdependent \nworld – and in particular some lessons from th e past that may serve us well in the future.\n*  \n The past three years have dramatically unde rscored the interdependence of the world’s \nfinancial institutions and financial markets.   The financial crisis also, by the way, \nincreased awareness of the interdependence of the actions of monetary and fiscal \nauthorities around the world.  In light of the crisis and the reality of financial \ninterdependence, the Federal Reserve expande d the types of policy actions it was willing \nto take.  My view is that our  openness to innovative measures  was critical to avoiding far \nmore severe outcomes – by which I mean cas cading failures of financial firms and a \nlocking up of liquidity and credit extensi on, further impeding households and companies \nand eventually leading to unemployment that  far exceeds our current, far too high, level. \n However, I must also stress that the nation’s “f inancial crisis toolki t” was, unfortunately, \nincomplete, resulting in the Federal Reserve needing to reluctantly take some controversial actions – notably as a result of government in gene ral lacking adequate \n                                                \n \n \n* Of course, the views I express today are my ow n, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n 1\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \ntools or powers to address the resolution (or “winding down”) of certain institutions, \nespecially systemically important nonbank financ ial firms.  If the U. S. puts in place better \nresolution powers for such institutions, the Federal Reserve will not need to be involved in lending under unusual and exigent circumstances to systemically important institutions that we have no regulatory or supervisory pow ers over, to prevent even worse outcomes. \nUnfortunately, at this point the U.S. is operating with the same incomplete toolkit \navailable to policymakers that we had befo re the crisis.  I know that Congress is \nconsidering various proposals for financia l regulatory reform.  My hope is that \nestablishing resolution authority for system ically important nonbank financial firms will \nbe an area with broad bipartisan agreement and support for change.    \n \n  Looking Back, to Look Forward \n \nDespite the Fed’s aggressive use of both trad itional and non-traditiona l policy tools, the \neconomy is experiencing a slow recovery from  a very severe recessi on, particularly when \nit comes to jobs.\n1  Still, with recent events fresh in our minds it is an appropriate time to \ndiscuss the actions a central bank should take  during a crisis – and in the periods that \nprecede a crisis – and the tools and powers needed  to help avoid future crises.  Of course, \npolicymakers and lawmakers are studying these matters right now.    So now is the time to be compiling and applying the lessons of the cris is and its lead-up.  \nBut as I’ve noted in other talks, we must learn the right  lessons, not necessarily the \ncommonly accepted ones.  The generally accepted narrative does not always stand up to \ncloser scrutiny, and reacting to  these narratives might lead to the wrong remedies.  When \nyou consider the human toll of this financial crisis and recession, nothing is more \nimportant than making sure we parse out a nd learn the “real” less ons.  Otherwise the \nfixes may miss the mark and i nvite unintended consequences. \n So today I would like to pose some key que stions:  Did monetary policy cause the \nhousing bubble that played such a large role in this crisis?  Was it, as some have \nsuggested, mainly due to the Fed keepi ng rates too low for too long, after the 2001 \nrecession?  Or should our attention be  less on monetary policy and more on supervisory  \npolicy?  Looking forward, what are the best remedies to avoid a similar crisis in the \nfuture?  Do we need traditional supervision done better, as some assume, or do we need \nsomething quite different?  And does the recen t financial crisis and recession suggest, as \nsome say, that the central bank should not be involved in supervising financial \ninstitutions and mitigating financia l instability, going forward?   \n Again, my focus is on avoiding future financial crises.  In that spirit, I will touch on the \nways that the Federal Reserve could and should use a combination of monetary and \nsupervisory tools to foster better macroeconomic outcomes.  To do this, I will look back \nat our recent economic history – specifical ly, the early part of the last decade\n2 – to \ninvestigate whether we could have employed a better mix of policy actions to strengthen \n 2\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nthe economy after the 2001 recession while a voiding the buildup of financial imbalances \nthat occurred – in other words, avoiding the bubble that eventually burst.   \n \nCauses of the Crisis? \n \nAs we unpack these issues I should begin by emphasizing that understanding the causes \nof asset-price “bubbles” is ve ry difficult.  Most economists are uncharacteristically \nhumble in admitting their ignora nce about what causes asset prices to diverge from their \nfundamentals (in other words, what causes bubbles).    Still, research by Boston Fed economists points  to a clear role fo r house prices in the \nrecent crises. The rapid ascent of house pric es – which started in 1998, accelerated in \n2004, and reversed in 2006 – is in our vi ew central to understanding the eventual \nchallenges.  The expectation of rising pr ices provided the incentive for potential \nhomeowners to invest more in housing, and made them – and their lenders – more comfortable with putting relatively little m oney down.  Rising prices also mitigated the \nrisk to institutions and invest ors that held assets based on th ese mortgages.  After all, as \nlong as prices continued to rise, mortgage holders who got into fi nancial trouble could \nsell or refinance rather than default, insu lating the holders of their mortgages from \nfinancial loss. This encouraged more relaxed credit standards, including low \ndownpayments.  Of course, a higher loan-to- value ratio exposed the homeowner and the \nlender to risk should prices fall significantly, but this risk was judged to be minimal.  \nHouse prices were expected to continue rising.  There is evidence that financial institutions understood the risks that  would arise if house \nprices fell, but assigned too low a probability to this potential outco me.  Thus they were \nwoefully unprepared to weather the conseque nces when prices did indeed fall.  Many \ninvestors believed that rising house prices made  the possibility of significant losses on \nsecuritized pools of subprime loans remote.\n3  They realized that a significant decline in \nhouse prices would indeed cause subprime secu ritization deals to suffer enormous losses, \nbut assigned a very low (or nonexistent) proba bility to the sort of drop in house prices \nthat actually occurred.  Alt hough some housing experts had rais ed concerns that the rise \nin housing prices was not sustainable, noti ng unusually high ratios of house prices to \nincome or rent, most took comfort in the fact that nominal housing prices had not fallen \nat the national level since World War II.  Even the pessimistic forecasts tended to envision a gradual leveling off of prices  rather than an outright decline. \n The story fits with the notion of a classic bubble.  The key feature of a bubble is that \ninvestors willingly pay high prices not because of the asset’s intrinsic value, but because \nthey believe some other investor will pay more  for it in the future.  The other key element \nof a bubble is that it almost always bursts.  All of this implies an important role for supervisors in undertaking scenario analyses that would make clear the exposures to such risks,  both for individual institutions and for the \nfinancial system as a whole.  I will return to this theme in a moment. \n \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nDid Monetary Policy Cause the Bubble? \n \nAgain, understanding asset bubbles is not easy.  One of the most prevalent theories on the \nsource of the bubble involves the low interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve during \nthe recovery from the 2001 recession, when the federal funds rate remained quite low –  \nstaying at 1 percent from  June 2003 to June 2004 (Figure 1). \n   Let’s look closely at the episode .  At the time, the rationale for maintaining such a low \nfederal funds rate seemed clear.  That rati onale is summarized in the FOMC’s outlook for \ninflation and unemployment.  Figure 2  shows the internal Board of Governors staff \nforecast – a well-respected input to the FOMC’s  policy deliberations – for core inflation \nand unemployment as of the end of 2003.  At the time, the Board staff had forecast that the unemployment rate would gradually fall to  5 percent over the next two years, while \ncore inflation (as measured by changes in th e core consumer price index or CPI) would \nedge down slightly and remain around 1.5 percent.   Five percent was the staff estimate of \n“full employment” at that time; so to put this another way, the unemployment rate was \nexpected to be above the fu ll employment level for the next two years.  Meanwhile, \ninflation was expected to be low.\n4  \n While the unemployment forecast was spot on, th e inflation forecast was, in contrast, too \nlow.  Actual inflation was higher and more erratic.  Had the Federal Reserve’s inflation forecast been more accurate, monetary policy might have been somewhat less accommodative.    Additionally, in the post-Sept ember 11 environment, poten tial downside risks to the \neconomy from other terrorist at tacks were a concern.  Policy makers were also anxious \nnot to repeat the mistakes of their Japanese  counterparts in the 1990s, who had withdrawn \nsupport prematurely, leading to deflation and a lost decade of economic growth. \n So, did accommodative interest rates fuel th e housing bubble?  Actually, the relationship \nbetween interest rates an d bubbles is not as obvious as one might think.  Figure 3  \nhighlights the federal funds rate and the 30-ye ar fixed mortgage rate.  While the 30-year \nrate declined during the pe riod of federal funds rate easing, the drop was relatively \nmodest relative to the decline in the fed funds rate.  Over the 10 years shown in the chart, the 30 year mortgage rate averaged 5.99 pe rcent; while during the one-year period when \nthe federal funds rate was 1 percent, the 30-year  mortgage rate averag ed 5.51 percent.  As \nthe federal funds rate increased in 2005 a nd 2006, the 30-year mortga ge rate fluctuated \nclose to the 10 year average.    So mortgage rates were a bit lower wh ile Fed policy was accommodative – but not \ndramatically lower.\n5  Most economic models of housing price movements would suggest \nthat such relatively modest fluctuations in mortgage rates – less than half a percent – would produce only modest changes in house prices.\n6 \n Moreover, contrary to the generally-assumed narrative, the empirical link between \nperiods with low interest ra tes and asset bubbles is not pa rticularly strong.  Generally \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nspeaking, lower interest rates lead to higher pr ices for a wide variety of assets, but they \ndo not necessarily lead people to expect continued increases  in asset prices – that key \ncharacteristic of a bubble that  I mentioned a moment ago. \n \nIn addition, house prices also ro se rapidly in other countries – in many cases more rapidly \nthan in the United States.  See Figure 4 .  Ireland and Spain, in  particular, witnessed \ndramatic booms in house prices – and subsequent declines.  Note  that in contrast \nGermany, which had the same monetary policy as Ireland and Spain, did not experience a \ndramatic increase.  All this makes it difficult to root an explanati on for the bubble entirely \nin the choices made by U.S. monetary policymakers.  I am not saying that low rates could have had no role in moving housing prices higher.  But I suspect the booming demand for real estate  derived in large measure from incorrect \nexpectations that housing prices would not fall,  rather than from the short-run effect on \nhousing demand of low short-term rates a nd slightly lowered mortgage rates. \n Policy Responses \n \nIf we cannot predict when bubbles will happen – or even, as many suggest, identify their \npresence – then what can policymakers do?  Financial policymakers can ameliorate the \nproblems that bubbles cause by taking a forwar d-looking and systemic view of financial \nrisk regulation. Traditional “prudential” superv ision tends to focus on areas of high risk at \nindividual institutions.  Systemic or “macroprudential” supervision needs to focus on possible misperceptions (and mispricing) of risk  more generally and the way that risk is \ndispersed throughout the system, di rectly and indirectly.  More scenario analysis, such as \nthat done in the so-called “stre ss test” of large institutions last year, needs to be a focus \nfor future systemic supervision – whether accomplished by a given agency or a council \ncharged with systemic oversight.    In the financial context, forward-looking risk  regulation focused on scenario analysis may \nhave done a better job of identifying potential risks from a bursting bubble.  Properly done, scenario analysis would have highlighted the sensitivity of fina ncial institutions to \nvarious risks, like falling house prices.  Not that this is ea sy to do.  But certainly it is \nrealistic to say that scenario analysis could have identified that values and ratings of subprime securities (especially the most e xotic) were extraordinarily sensitive to \nassumptions for which no one had especially good information.  This suggests the need, \ngoing forward, for more “stress-test” type exer cises – to first identify, and then address,\n7 \nemerging risks.    Traditional bank supervision tends to focus on the current condition of a firm by identifying write-downs of nonperforming assets  and validating the ra tings of loans and \nthe adequacy of reserves.  This partly refl ects the current focus in accounting on incurred \nlosses.  In contrast, the systemic supervis ion that is needed would focus on possible \nfuture losses and is inherently forward-looking.  Doing this well requires an \nunderstanding not only of institutions but also markets, and it requires taking into account \nthe full range of outcomes, both expected and potential – including those that have a low \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nlikelihood of occurring but that could have serious adverse consequences.  While we may \nnot be able to eliminate all bubbles, we s hould be able to limit the degree to which the \nfinancial sector feeds and propagates these booms, and the sector’s vulnerability to subsequent busts.     Such work is particularly well suited for the Fe d.  Its role as “lender of last resort” (where \nwe lend  at a penalty rate and have never had a Discount Window loss), its responsibility \nfor bank supervision, and its constant monitoring of the economy provide the Federal Reserve with a unique window on financial-stability  issues.  It is a se rious gap that there \nis no assigned responsibility for forward-looki ng, systemic risk supervision – and filling \nthis gap in some way is probably the hi ghest priority in regulatory reform. \n I would also emphasize the systemic nature of optimal supervision and regulation, because another aspect of achieving financial stability involves understanding the interdependence of financial institutions.  Ideally, supervis ors should have a good idea of \nhow a failure of one institution would imp act its counterparties;  as well as the \ncircumstances under which a large number of institutions would become insolvent.  Most accounts of the financial crisis  make clear how concern abou t counterparty risk fuelled \npanic among market participants.  It also weighed mightily on policymakers trying to \ncobble together solutions to the crisis.    It goes without saying that  understanding counterparty ri sk can be exceptionally \ncomplicated.  Large financial in stitutions have a variety of subsidiaries around the world.  \nAs a result of acquisitions they often have legacy information systems that can make it \ndifficult to aggregate their true counterparty e xposure to one entity.  Certainly this is an \narea where financial institutions and regulator s need to do more work, to be better \nprepared for any future crises.    As part of scenario analysis, firms should be  asked by supervisors to provide information \non counterparties and exposure, to examine how  major counterparty failures would affect \nthem – and, if possible, how their own failure  would impact their major counterparties.  \nThe regulators should then be able to compar e results across institutions to get a better \nappreciation of, and ability to m onitor, the counterparty risk.   \n We want analysts within a given financial in stitution to realize their firm would take big \nlosses if, for example, a particular asset pr ice were to fall. A systemic supervisor, \nconducting similar analyses across a variety of institutions, could see if others were in \nsimilar shape. And even if this supervisor saw only a small chance of a “meltdown” scenario for a particular asse t price, they could evaluate the impact and perhaps conclude \nthat the chance of a cascading systemic financ ial crisis was too big of a chance to take. \n Of course, it is also import ant to understand under what econo mic or financial situations \nsuch problems might rear their heads.  Supervisors need to collect this information regularly, and some public repo rting of interconnectedness w ould provide the public with \na useful understanding of the ri sks inherent in the institut ions, markets, and systems on \nwhich they rely.  \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \nConcluding Observations \n \nTo conclude, I would just stress that s upervisory tools can and should provide an \nalternative to monetary polic y actions for addressing bubbles or other imbalances in \ncertain areas of the economy or financial syst em.  If we take a good hard analytical look \nat the last recovery, we see that the lo w fed funds rate was not the standout, and \nstandalone, culprit that many assume.  This is a crucial ma tter to consider right now, \nwhen rates are very low – in my opinion, totally appropriately – because some are \npredicting that these rate s will fuel another bubble. \n Financial regulatory reform needs to addre ss who has responsibility for regulating and \nsupervising systemic risk as well as who ha s responsibility for regul ating and supervising \nsystemically important institutions.  In partic ular, reform should enhance the potential to \nwind down or resolve systemically important ins titutions that are faili ng.  This is critical \nto avoiding future crises.    Because of the substantial synergies between  monetary policy, the lender-of-last-resort \nrole, and supervision of banks, I believe th e Federal Reserve shoul d play a significant \nrole in overseeing systemically important institu tions and addressing systemic risks.  It is \nalso important that the Federal Reserve c ontinue to supervise community banks, which \nprovide a window on lending to small busines ses and other bank-dependent borrowers.  \nThe reality is that supervisory policies should not be inde pendent of monetary policy – \nand similarly monetary policy should not be  conducted without th e valuable insights \ngained from supervision of large and small banks.  Understanding the business cycle and \nits potential impact on the institutions under supervision should be integral to bank \nsupervision and to understanding systemic ri sk.  And supervisory powers provide an \nimportant alternative tool to traditional m onetary policy as a way to address bubbles and \ninsure the best possible economic outcome.    The crisis has highlighted how undesirable it is  for the U.S. central bank to have to be \ninvolved in the rescue of individual institu tions.  However, it has also reinforced the \nimportant role that the central bank can and s hould play in maintaining financial stability.  \nRemember that concerns over financial instab ility and the experience of financial panics \nwere key motivations for the founding of the Federal Reserve by Congress.  No one is happy with the current state of the economy and the suffering of so many Americans who \nseek jobs or face foreclosure.  But the Federa l Reserve’s efforts to help maintain financial \nstability have averted much worse outcomes.    I believe the Federal Reserve can and should be  more focused on financial stability issues \ngoing forward.  As a result, whatever actions  are taken in Washington with regulatory \nreform, it is in everyone’s interest that any changes not impede the ability of the Federal \nReserve to be a lender of last resort or  to troubleshoot the functioning of financial \nmarkets during a crisis.    \n 7\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 8                                                With all this in mind, I would say that le gislation that does no t provide a significant \nsupervisory and systemic responsibility for the Federal Reserve risks making us as a \nnation even less prepared for the next crisis than we were for this one. \n Thank you.  \n \n \n \n1 See my recent remarks on prospect s for employment and evidence from  prior recoveries, available at \nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2010/010810/index.htm \n \n2 A disclaimer: while the comparison yields insights, we should also r ecognize that the 2001 recession and \nrecovery were of course somewhat diff erent than the current situation.   \n \n3 For example, an August 2005 Lehman Brothers report on the expected performance, under various house-\nprice scenarios, of securitized pool s of subprime loans suggests that Lehman Brothers realized that a \nsignificant decline in house prices would cause subpri me securitization deals to suffer enormous losses. \nSpecifically, in the report’s “meltdown” scenario for house prices, the cumulative collateral losses would be 17.1 percent as all but the highest-rated secur ities in the subprime pools defa ult.  To understand why \ninvestors might have viewed these securities as a good investment anyway, one need only see that \nLehman’s analysts assigned the “meltdown” scenario a probability of only 5 percent.  Note that the \nmeltdown scenario implied a smaller drop in housing prices than what actually occurred.    \n4 For an in-depth analysis of monetary policy during th is period, as well as the re lationship of interest rates \nto housing prices, see Dokko et al. (2009): \"Monetary Policy and the Housing Bubble,\" by Jane Dokko, Brian Doyle, Michael T. Kiley, Jinill Kim, Shane Sh erlund, Jae Sim, and Skander Van den Heuvel.

(http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2009/200949/ 200949pap.pdf).  Also see Chairman Bernanke’s \nspeech at the annual meeting of the American Eco nomic Association, entitled \"Monetary Policy and the \nHousing Bubble.\" (http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100103a.htm) \n \n5 Fixed-rate mortgages generally account for the ma jority of conventional mortgage originations, \napproximately 81 percent of purchase originations on average over the past decade, and 75 percent over the \nJune 2003 to June 2004 period (while adjustable-rate mortgages account for 19 percent and 25 percent, \nrespectively).  Over the decade the one -year adjustable-rate mortgage rate averaged 5.06 percent and fell to \n3.71 percent over the June 2003- June 2004 period. \n \n6 Nor is the theoretical logic that links housing prices and asset bubbles to low interest rates nearly as \nobvious as many suggest.  Standard models of housing prices, based on the user cost of owning a home, imply that housing prices rise only modestly when interest rates fall.  This does not neces sarily mean that \nthose models are correct, only that it is hard to bu ild a prima facie case that monetary policy caused the \nhousing bubble.  \n7 For example by requiring that capital be raised or certain activities curtailed. \n\n1Figure 1\nFederal Funds Target Rate\nJanuary 3, 2000 - February 26,  2010\nSource:  Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics01234567\n3-Jan-00 2-Jan-01 2-Jan-02 2-Jan-03 2-Jan-04 3-Jan-05 3-Jan-06 3-Jan-07 3-Jan-08 2-Jan-09 4-Jan-10Percent\nRange:\n0 - 0.25% \n2Figure 2\nUnemployment and Core Inflation Rates:\nBoard of Governors Internal Staff Forecast\nand Actual Results\nFourth Quarter 2003 - Third Quarter 2005\nSource:  Federal Reserve Board, BLS / Haver AnalyticsUnemployment \nRateCore CPI Inflation \nRateUnemployment \nRateCore CPI Inflation \nRate\nYear Quarter % % Change % % Change\n2003 Q4 6.0 1.8 5.8 1.0\n2004 Q1 6.0 1.6 5.7 1.9\n2004 Q2 5.8 1.5 5.6 2.6\n2004 Q3 5.5 1.5 5.4 1.7\n2004 Q4 5.3 1.5 5.4 2.5\n2005 Q1 5.2 1.5 5.3 2.5\n2005 Q2 5.1 1.5 5.1 1.9\n2005 Q3 5.0 1.5 5.0 1.3December 2003 Greenbook Forecast Actual Results\n\n3Figure 3\nMortgage Rates and the \nFederal Funds Target Rate\n2000:Q1 - 2009:Q4\nSource:  Bloomberg, Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics0246810\n2000:Q1 2002:Q1 2004:Q1 2006:Q1 2008:Q1Percent\nFederal Funds Target Rate30-Year Fixed-Rate Conventional Mortgage Rate\nRange: \n0 - 0.25%\n4Figure 4\nReal House Price Increases\n1994 - 2008\nSource:  OECD050100150200250300350400\n1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008Ireland\nSpain\nUnited States\nGermanyIndex, 1994=100",

I thank Jim Smith for that generous introduction, and the CBIA and the \nMetroHartford Alliance for inviting me to share my perspectives with you.* \nAs we begin a new year, financial markets are in a much better state than they \nwere a year ago.

But as  I see it, the economy faces three significant \n“headwinds.” \nFirst, while the banking crisis  has passed, banking problems  remain.  Most \neconomies that experience signif icant banking problems have been slow to recover, and \nthat is likely to be true this time in the U. S.  Loans at banks have declined over the past \nseveral quarters, as many businesses are cons trained by their balance sheets and reluctant \nto take on new debt.2  Many banks are also concerned with their  balance sheets – and \nparticularly their capital ratios3 -- and have restrained their terms of lending to avoid \ntaking on too much additional risk, given that  they are still working through problems \nwith existing loans. \nSecond, consumers and businesses will likely remain cautious – which is \nconsistent with positive but slow growth.  Consumption will continue to be subdued, as \nconsumers are fully aware that housing prices are well off their peak, unemployment rates are high, and home foreclosures are con tinuing.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nrebuild savings will likely result in some incr ease in the savings rate, which is of course \ngood in the long run but dampens growth in th e short term.  Many businesses seem likely \nto only gradually expand investment, at l east until they are more confident that the \neconomy will continue expanding even after so me of the stimulative government support \nwinds down.  Also, many businesses may be li mited in how much external funding they \ncan raise. \nThe third headwind involves the fact that  recessions this severe have broader \nramifications for labor markets.  Workers be come discouraged and leave the labor force, \nwhile the skills of workers that are unemployed for long periods may atrophy, and new \nentrants in the labor market often have to se ttle for jobs at levels below what they would \nbe offered in a more robust economy.   \nIndeed, to most Americans, economic prospects are better measured by an \nexpansion of jobs rather than growth in GDP.  So I would like to spend the rest of my \ntime with you reviewing some of  the patterns we have seen in labor markets during early \nstages of previous recoveries.  Of course, given the severity of this recession, consumer and business behavior this time may be somewhat  more restrained than in past recoveries. \nTo reveal a bit of the “punc h line,” my conclusions from  the analysis I am about \nto walk through are that the employment response in the last two recoveries was much \nslower than it was in the two earli er recoveries in the 1970s and 1980s.\n4  And \nunfortunately the financial headwinds, linge ring labor market problems, and a cautious \nattitude of consumers and businesses in the wake  of the financial crisis make it likely that \nrecovery in employment terms will also be slow this time.   \n 3\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nUnfortunately, I expect a rath er slow recovery in output, and a rather slow \nrecovery in employment given  the level of output growth – and I will explain why, this \nmorning.  But since unemployment is so funda mentally important, I think it is good to \nstudy our labor markets and earlier recovery periods so policymaker s, businesses, and \nworkers can anticipate and adapt to the experience we are likely to see. \nIn addition, I would note that during the ea rly phases of a recovery, improvements \nin unemployment tend to lag those in the ec onomy.  But the strength of the recovery is \npartly dependent on how confident businesses and consumers are becoming that the \neconomy will be able to grow fast enough for tangible progress in labor markets and the \nrecovery will become self sustaining. \n \nEmployment Patterns in the First Year of Recovery \nAllow me to walk you through a few slides  that help illustrate employment \npatterns in the first year of recoveries. \nGDP growth in the just-com pleted fourth quarter of 2009 looks like it will prove \nto have been stronger than in the third quarter, a result largely driven by businesses \nbringing their significant inventory draw-down to a close.   \nAs shown in Figure 1 , this is not unusual for the firs t year of a recovery. Consider \nthe following logic.  The difference between re al GDP and real final sales is the change \nin inventories.  In the first year of the r ecovery from the four previous recessions, real \nGDP grew faster than real fi nal sales.  This shows how the normalizing of inventories has \nbeen an important source of economic growth in the early stages of  most recoveries.   \n 4\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nThe figure shows that the smallest invent ory response was in the recovery in the \nearly 1990s.  Since inventories are often ba nk-financed, so-called headwinds provided by \nthe troubles in the banking syst em that result in credit cons traints are, unfortunately, a \npotential source of restraint on inventory replenishment now, as then.  Indeed, research I \nhave done with colleagues Joe Peek and Geo ff Tootell confirms that inventory buildup \ntends to be more restrained during peri ods of significant banking problems.   \nThus today, as in the early 1990s, invent ory levels became quite low during this \nrecession as businesses prepared for the worst, and I expect that inve ntory buildup will be \nan important source of growth – but also that it will likely be more restrained than one \nmight have otherwise expected, beca use of tighter credit conditions.   \nFigure 2  shows that the past two recoveries did not feature job growth in the first \nyear of the recovery, in sharp contrast to the recoveries of the 1970s and 1980s.  The past \ntwo recessions had positive economic  growth in the first year of the recovery, but it was \nnot rapid enough to generate job growth.  In contrast, in th e recoveries in the 1970s and \n1980s, growth was sufficient to yield employment  growth in the first year of the recovery. \nFigure 3  illustrates another pattern typical of  recoveries.  While there has been a \nlongstanding downward trend in  the average weekly hours of  production workers, it is \ncommon for average hours to decline more steeply during a recession.  Note that in \nprolonged recessions, where the shading is th e widest, average weekly hours decline \nmore significantly – as workers are placed on shortened work weeks.   \nAs the economy begins to recover, businesses will restore the hours of such \nworkers before hiring additional new workers.  Note that in our current recession, there \n 5\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nwas a significant decline in th e hours of production workers, which are just beginning to \nshow signs of a rebound. \nAnother harbinger of a recovery in employ ment is growth in temporary services.  \nFirms often extend work weeks and hire tem porary workers before committing to hiring \npermanent workers.  As Figure 4  highlights, the use of temporary workers fell quite \ndramatically during the rece ssion, but has been rebounding more  recently.  Of course \ntemporary jobs reduce the unemployment rate, and provide a needed bridge for workers \nlooking for, but not yet finding, more perm anent employment.  But when businesses \nbecome more confident of the strength of th e recovery, they will begin to hire permanent \nworkers rather than rely on temporary workers. \n \nLabor-Market Dynamics that Impact Employment Growth \nNow I would like to explore with you so me of the labor-market dynamics that \nwill likely restrain employment growth in this recovery. \nThe severity of a recession can have a significant impact on how quickly firms \nresume hiring.  As Figure 5  shows, this recession was qu ite severe in a number of \nrespects.  This recession was much longer than  typical, making it diffi cult for those that \nlost their jobs to find employment.  Research  has highlighted the fact that workers that \nhave been unemployed for extended periods ca n have significant difficulty being rehired.  \nIt may be that their skills atrophy, or just th at their sector of the economy is particularly \nhard-hit.  And potential employers may worry  about the underlying reasons for the long \nunemployment spell.   \n 6\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nAs shown in the figure, currently the percentage of the unemployed who have \nbeen out of work for 27 weeks or more is much  higher than in previous recessions, at just \nunder 40 percent.  This is likely to be one impediment to our seeing significant, speedy \ndeclines in unemployment. \nThe next set of challenges is  related to the lack of business confidence that I cited \nearlier.  Businesses are most lik ely to hire new workers when they are confident that their \nsales and orders will increase significantly fo r an extended period of time.  Absent this \nconfidence, businesses have at their dispos al several alternatives for deploying more \nlabor without incurring all the co sts entailed in new hires. \nThe first of these alternatives is  reflected in the blue line in Figure 6.  Roughly 6 \npercent of the labor force is working part tim e for reasons related to the economy.  Such a \nhigh percentage of workers being placed on part time work schedules is, as you can see in \nthe figure, much higher than in the past two recessions – and was last at these levels in \nthe 1980s.   \nMany workers reflected in these data ha d their schedules reduced to part time \nbecause employers want to retain them but did not have sufficient work to keep them on full time.  Before an employer is likely to do any significant new hiri ng, they will usually \nreturn these workers to full time work.  While  that defers new hiri ng, it does of course \nmean additional income for the worker. \n A second alternative to permanent hire s is evident in th e data for weekly \novertime, which declined quite significantly during this recession, as shown in Figure 7 .  \nBusinesses frequently will not only restor e the aforementioned workers to full time \nstatus, but also begin incurring overtime befo re making the investment in new hires.  \n 7\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nWhile there has been some rebound in overtim e work, you can see in the figure that it \nremains well below pre-recession levels. \nA final alternative to employment growth  is improving the efficiency of the \nexisting work force.  In recent quarters, employers have found ways to produce more \ngoods with fewer workers.  While a more pr oductive work force is very good news for \nthe economy in the long run, it lessens the need for hiri ng in the short run.   \nThe combination of these labor market  challenges and the headwinds from \nproblems in the banking sector make it quite likely that the unemployment rate will \ndecline only gradually.  While layoffs are s ubsiding, in sum it seems that new hiring is \nlikely only after employers more fully utilize existing employees.  \n \nIndustry Patterns  \nNow I would like to share some thoughts on various industries and recoveries.  \nFigure 8  shows the changes that have o ccurred in the industrial mix of \nemployment over the past 30 years.  Overall, much less of the work force is employed in \nmanufacturing, which has fallen from 21 percent of the work force to  only 9 percent of \nthe work force now.  The two areas that have  increased significantl y are professional and \nbusiness services, and education and health serv ices – both areas that  have tended to be \nless responsive to economic downturns. \nGiven the difficulties in predicting overall employment trends going forward, it is \neven more difficult to determine which industr ies are likely to be engines of growth.  \nHowever, it is instructive to see which industrie s, in the past, have tended to grow in the \nfirst year of a recovery. \n 8\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nFigure 9  shows four industries that have tende d to perform well in the first year \nof a recovery – professional and business serv ices, education and heal th services, leisure \nand hospitality, and to a lesser extent governme nt.  The first three are areas that have \nincreased their share of total employment, a nd all have tended to be less sensitive to \neconomic downturns.    \nWhile it is quite possible that these areas wi ll grow in the initial stages of this \nrecovery, that growth is likely to be restrained by various fact ors.  In education and health \nservices, there is the matter of the significant retrenchment in college endowments, and  \nuncertainty as national health reform proposal s are debated in Washington.  Government \nspending grew modestly in the first year of the past recoveries from recessions.  This \ntime, however, the outlook for government empl oyment remains quite dim – as federal, \nstate, and city governments struggle with ra ther severe revenue shortfalls and budget \nissues.  \nProfessional and business services, and leisure and hospita lity, have often \nincreased employment in the first year of a recovery; however, the degree has been significantly less in the past tw o recoveries compared to the 1980s (and in fact negative \nfor professional and business services in 2001- 2002).  The strength in these sectors this \ntime around will depend on how quickly consum er and business confidence returns. \nFigure 10  highlights industries that have had more mixed results in the first year \nof a recovery and are uncertain this time as well.  While construction employment will be restrained by low housing prices and el evated foreclosures – and commercial \nconstruction employment is restrained in many areas by falling co mmercial real estate \n 9\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \nprices and high vacancy rates – employment levels in these sectors have experienced \nsuch significant declines that we may still see some rebound.   \nThe behavior of the consumer will help determine employment in manufacturing \nand retail trade.  It is uncl ear how willing consumers will be to increase spending once \nthe government’s various stimulus programs abate.  If consumption is relatively \nrestrained, as many expect, then these sectors are not likely to hire significantly until \nconsumers become more confident.  On th e bright side, though, a potential upside to \nmanufacturing employment is  the strong growth occurring in some emerging economies \nand prevailing exchange rates that favor U.S. exports. \n \nConcluding Observations \nTo sum up my remarks and conclude, I think we can gain insights on this \nrecovery from the experience and trends of  the past.  Certainly for economies that \nexperience substantial financ ial shocks, recovery is normally quite slow.  While \ninventory rebuilding will likely provide some  spark, the strength of underlying demand as \ngovernment stimulus subsides is an open question.   \nThe employment picture overall has improved, and the outlook is  certainly much \nbrighter than one year ago.  Layoffs are ab ating, although many firms are not yet ready to \ndo new permanent hiring.  Any significant hiring will likely have to wait while current labor resources are more fully utilized. \nSo it appears that this recovery will li kely experience only a slow improvement in \nthe employment picture, and that the unemp loyment rate will remain quite elevated \nduring the early phases of the recovery.  GDP growth is expected to be strong enough to \n 10\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 11                                                produce some employment growth, but that rate of employment expansion will not likely \nbe rapid enough to put a large dent in the unemployment rate.     \nOur research and analysis at the Bost on Fed suggests that with significant \ncapacity in labor markets, wages and salaries  and the ability of businesses to increase \nprices are all likely to be restrained, resulti ng in little immediate inflationary pressures.  \nIn my view this should allow for accommodativ e monetary policy to continue to support \nthe economy until the underlying demand of consumers and businesses becomes self-\nsustaining. \nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.  I do wish each of you \nsolid improvements in your businesses in th e year ahead, and better economic times for \nall New Englanders as the recovery proceeds.  Thank you. \n \n \n \n \nNOTES: \n \n1 While most private forecasters have inventories declining in Q4 of 2009 and Q1 of 2010, the \ndecline is projected to be at a slower rate (i.e., firms cutting less  from their inventories), thus \nadding to GDP growth.  \n2 In a recent speech, Federal Reserve Governor E lizabeth Duke noted that “the decline in bank \nloans outstanding has been stark. For example, our data show that total loans on banks' books fell \nat an annual rate of more than 11 percent during the third quarter of 2009, with all major loan categories contributing to the decline…”  She goes on to describe a number of factors at work in \nexplaining the reduction in bank loans in her remarks, available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/duke20100104a.htm. \n \n3 As I have noted in prior talks, the losses of  capital and de-leveraging of balance sheets at \nfinancial institutions serve as a drag on th e economy, as financial institutions focus on \nrestructuring their balance sheets with the conseque nt tightening of lending standards.  Recall that \na loan is counted as an asset on a bank's bala nce sheet. Banks hold capital in part to reserve \nagainst the possibility that a loan defaults, and must maintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets. If a bank experiences a reduction in the value of its capital, it must take steps to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet in order to restore its desired capital-to-assets ratio. The bank \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10: 15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 12                                                                                                                                                 \nbecomes more restrictive in its lending – no small matter for the broader economy when you \nconsider that, thanks to levera ge, when a bank's capital declines, the bank must reduce its loans \nby much more to maintain its capital-to-assets ratio . In addition to this state of affairs, often \nreferred to as a \"credit crunch,\" a new and unwelco me wrinkle occurred in many short-term credit \nmarkets during the recent financial turmoil − something you might call a \"liquidity lock.\" By \nliquidity lock, I mean extreme risk aversion by  many investors and institutions, which makes \nshort-term financing difficult to come by for even the most creditworthy firms – even financing \nfor very short maturities, measured in days.  See “The Impact of Financial Institutions and \nFinancial Markets on the Real Economy: Implications  of a 'Liquidity Lock'”, delivered at The \nUniversity of Wisconsin – Madison in October 2008 (available at http://www.bos.frb.org/news/spe eches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm  \n \n4 As is often done, here we lump the very brief 1980:Q2 “credit” recession with the 1981-82 \nrecession.  \n\nFigure 1\nReal Growth in First Year of Recovery \nSource:  BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics02468\n1975:Q1 -1976:Q1 1982:Q4 -1983:Q4 1991:Q1 -1992:Q1 2001:Q4 -2002:Q4Real GDP\nReal Final SalesPercent Change from Trough (Year Earlier)\n\nFigure 2\nEmployment Growth in First Year of Recovery \nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics9899100101102103104\nTrough Q1 Q2 Q3 Q41975:Q1 -1976:Q1\n1982:Q4 -1983:Q4\n1991:Q1 -1992:Q1\n2001:Q4 -2002:Q4Index, Trough = 100\n\nFigure 3\nAverage Weekly Hours of Production and \nNonsupervisory Workers\nJanuary 1964 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics00000111111\n3234363840\nJan-64 Jan-68 Jan-72 Jan-76 Jan-80 Jan-84 Jan-88 Jan-92 Jan-96 Jan-00 Jan-04 Jan-08\nRecessionAverage Weekly Hours\n\nFigure 4\nGrowth in Temporary Help Services Employment\nFebruary 1990 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics00000111111\n-5-4-3-2-101234\nFeb-90 Feb-92 Feb-94 Feb-96 Feb-98 Feb-00 Feb-02 Feb-04 Feb-06 Feb-08Percent Change from Previous Month\n\nFigure 5\nEmployment Challenges: \nPercent Unemployed for 27 Weeks or More\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics012345678\n0510152025303540Jan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecessionPercent\nPercent of unemployed out of\nwork for 27 weeks or more \n\nFigure 6\nEmployment Challenges: Percent of Labor Force \nPart Time for Economic Reasons\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics012345678\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecessionPercent\nPercent of labor force part time\nfor economic reasons \n\nFigure 7\nAverage Weekly Overtime Hours of Production \nand Nonsupervisory Workers\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics00000111111\n0123456\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecessionAverage Weekly Overtime Hours\n\nFigure 8\nEmployment Composition by Major \nIndustry Sector\nSource:  BLS / Haver Analytics1.2%4.9%\n20.5%\n20.3%\n2.6% 5.6%8.4%7.9%7.4%3.1%18.1%November 1980\nMining and Logging\nConstruction\nManufacturing\nTrade, Transportation & Utilities\nInformation Services \nFinancial Activities\nProfessional & Business Services \nEducation & Health Services\nLeisure & Hospitality \nOther Services  \nGovernment0.5%4.5%\n8.9%\n19.1%\n2.1%\n5.9%\n12.8%14.8%10.0%4.1%17.2%November 2009\n\nFigure 9\nRecovery in Employment by Industry Sector:  \nGrowth in First Year of Recovery\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics-8-6-4-202468\n1975:Q1 -1976:Q1 1982:Q4 -1983:Q4 1991:Q1 -1992:Q1 2001:Q4 -2002:Q4Professional & Business Services\nEducation & Health Services\nLeisure & Hospitality\nGovernmentPercent Change from Year Earlier\n\nFigure 10\nRecovery in Employment by Industry Sector:  \nGrowth in First Year of Recovery\nSource:  BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics-8-6-4-202468\n1975:Q1 -1976:Q1 1982:Q4 -1983:Q4 1991:Q1 -1992:Q1 2001:Q4 -2002:Q4Construction\nManufacturing\nRetail TradePercent Change from Year Earlier",
