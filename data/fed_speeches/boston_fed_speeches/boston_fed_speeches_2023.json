Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n  \nRemarks  at the Conference  \n“Housing, Place, and Flexible Work: The Future of the \nNew England Economy ”  \n  \nJanuary 19, 2023 \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n                         \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time , \nThursday, January 19, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n   \nKey Takeaways  \n1. Restoring price stability remains the imperative for monetary policymakers, and there is more \nwork to do.   I anticipate the need for further rate increases, perhaps at a slower pace, depending on \nincoming data, before holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time.  More measured rate \nadjustments will better enable us to address the competing risks that monetary policy now faces.  \n2. While realistic about the risks and uncertainties, I remain reasonably optimistic that the re is a \npathway to reducing inflation without  a significant economic downturn. I see ongoing resilience in \nthe economy, evidenced by many firms’ continued hiring plans , and household and business spending that \nis holding up relatively well.   \n3. New England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to address. \nThis is an opportunity to take stock , look ahead, and assess long- term trajectories, opportunities, and \nimperatives – especially related to the availability of both work ers and housing.  \n4. The Fed’s mandate and mission involve an economy with opportunities for all – but outcomes \npersistently  differ in certain places, and for certain people or groups. The region’s economy is \nhealthiest when it’s providing opportunities for all to contribute and prosper, not leaving some people and \nplaces behind. Today’s  conference will explore the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the post -\npandemic economy for New Englanders . \n5. Since 2014, the Boston Fed has been  leading  promising work focused on encouraging local \nefforts to find economic resurgence  – in smaller cities where manufacturing once flourished, and rural \nareas facing challenges. We call it the Working Places Challenge  – and the model is proving effective.  \n6. “Working Places” is based on research that showed a key to resilience , through waves of \neconomic change and challenge , is cross- sector collaboration among local individuals  willing to \ntake on shared leadership. The program  is structured as a competition for grant money (not from the Fed \nbut from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders are building cross -sector vision  and \npriorities , and working on them together . It helps communities weave together many small individual \napproaches into one, coherent system – and then improve the system. The Fed hosts, convenes, and \nsupports  these efforts . \n7. Working Places helps the Fed encourage economic progress in local economies, grounded in \nour mission of a vibrant and  inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price stability and \nmaximum employment – for all not just some.  It is one example of strategic partnerships the Boston \nFed creates to improve New England’s economy. Like other community development efforts of the Boston \nFed, it complements our monetary policy, research, payments, and supervision work as we seek to fulfil l \nour mission and mandate.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I want to thank  our organizers : my \ncolleagues at the Boston Fed’s New England Public Policy Center – part of our Research \ndepartment  – as well as our partners at the New England Economic Partnership, and the \nDonahue Institute  at the University of Massachusetts.  \n  This gathering provides an opportunity  to explore key aspects of the future of the N ew \nEngland economy, especially given the pandemic effects that are still with us , and still evolving.  \nIt is important to  study  the shifts we  are seeing – in work, commuting, housing, and economic \nactivity  – with an eye to navigating them  effectively , and ensuring a vibrant regional  economy \nwith opportunities for all.  \n  In my remarks , I’ll speak briefly about monetary policy, then touch on what I’ve seen in \nthe N ew England economy during my first six months in this role, and finally talk about an  \napproach we at the Fed have found helps local community efforts to coalesce around  \nchallenges , in support of  economic resurgence.  \n \nThe National Context: The Macroeconomy and Monetary Policy  \n  My comments about monetary policy and the national economy focus on recent \ndevelopments related to the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum sustained employment and price \nstability.  Of course , these comments are my own; I’m not speaking for my fellow  policymakers.   \n  With the inflation  rate well above the 2 percent target, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (or FOMC) has been resolute in its  goal of restoring price stability  – raising interest \nrates aggressively  since last March . High inflation takes a toll on households, especially the \nmost vulnerable ones . And it complicates investment and planning decisions for firms. Price \nstability is essential for a well- functioning inclus ive economy that works for all, and for healthy \nlabor market conditions that are sustainable over time.  \n  We are starting to see some effects of the cumulative policy  actions the FOMC has \ntaken so far. Less demand ( from higher interest rates ), combined with lower input costs (from \neasing supply bottlenecks ), are contributing to notic eably  slower  inflation  for goods  – with the \nprice s for some goods  actually declining. These  development s, together with decreas ing energy \nprices, are at the root o f the inflation improvement  we saw in the last quarter  of 2022 . But \nhouseholds  consume far more services than goods , and services  inflation remains persistently \nhigh.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n   A key piece of this has been s izeable increases in shelter costs. However , monetary \npolicy tightening has slowed new rent growth considerably, which should lead to a moderation in \nshelter inflation starting in the spring of this year. For services o utside of shelter, labor tends to \nbe the most important input  – so developments in this component of services inflation are \nultimately tied to the behavior of wages.  \n  Bringing labor market conditions into better balance will therefore be critical to achieving \nour inflation target . While labor market activity has show n some signs of moderating, there is \nstill a long way to go. Indeed, high job vacancies and “quit rates ” are signs that labor demand \nremains  strong.  And while the latest average hourly earnings data  suggest some softening of \nwage pressures, labor costs continue to grow more rapidly  than is consistent with 2 percent \ninflation.  (I’ll note that  workers  do not benefit from nominal wage gains  that are eroded by too -\nhigh inflation.  What matters for workers are gains in real wages. ) \n  While it is promising to see  the effects of higher rates starting to spread from the most \ninterest -sensitive sectors to the broader economy , more is required to ensure a steady path \ntoward our inflation  target . As monetary policymakers,  restoring price stability remains our \nimperative. Thus, I anticipate the need for  further rate i ncreases, likely to just  above 5 percent, \nand then holding rates at that level for some time.   \n  Now that rates are  in restrictive territory  and we may (based on current indicators) be \nnearing the peak , I believe it is appropriate to have shifted from the initial expeditious pace of \ntightening to  a slower pace – though appropriate policy  will, of course,  depend on a holistic \nreview of available data. More measured  rate adjustments in the current phase will better  \nenable us to  address the competing risks monetary policy now fac es – the risk that our actions \nmay be insufficient to restore price stability , versus the risk  that our actions may cause \nunnecessary losses in real activity and employment. I am well aware that, as with inflation, the \ncosts of higher unemployment are disproportionately borne by people of color and economically \nvulnerable groups.  \n  I’ll conclude my comments about monetary policy by noting that I continue to be what I \ncall a “realistic optimist.” The ongoing resilience of our economy –  from many firms continuing to \nincrease their payrolls, to business and household spending still holding up relatively well \ndespite an uncertain economic environment –  make me reasonably optimistic that there is a \npathway to reducing inflation without a significant economic downturn.  But I also recognize risks \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n and uncertainties to that outlook, including the possibility of a more substantial downturn driven \nby a self -fulfilling loss of confidence in the economy.  \n  These are among the many considerations for both determining and communicating \nmonetary policy. I’ll shift now from national policy to some of the longer run opportunities and \nchallenges with a focus on New England – the Fed’s First District, which the Boston Fed serves .  \n \nNew England’s Economy… and the Issue of Gaps  \n  New England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to \naddress. The conference  today provides  an opportunity to take stock , to look ahead, and to \nassess long- term trajectories, opportunities, and imperatives – especially around the availability \nof both work ers and housing.  \n  Some of the greatest strengths of New England can be found in our workforce,  and the \ninnovative institutions located here. Our workforce is among the most highly skilled and \neducated in the world.1 The region also hosts many organizations leading in healthcare, \ntechnology (including biotechnology ), clean energy, and higher education.2  \n  These enviable characteristics suggest  New England is favorably positioned for the \nfuture . I see the Fed’s mandat e and mission, however, as encompassing an economy with \nopportunities for all – not just those with advanced degrees , and not just the cities and towns \nthat are thriving. When we look across New England, we see places and communities that are \nnot fully participating in the region’s  overall  prosperity. For example,  some small cities , and rural \nareas with dwindling employment , struggle to sustain local schools and services.   \n  And we see some demographic groups –  particularly when looking by  race and ethnicity \n– with lower levels of income, wealth, and educational achievement  than their white and Asian \npeers.  For instance, students in New England perform better on math and reading tests than \nmost other states, but there are large gaps by race and income.3,4 And household incomes \ndiffer widely by race.5  \n  The region’s economy is healthiest when it is providing opportunities for all to participate, \ncontribute , and prosper , not leaving some people and places behind. As we head into a future of \nslowing population growth and likely continued labor challenges , we need the contributions  and \ncapabilities  of all communities and places across the region.  So this confe rence is timely and \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n important, as we think together about the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the \npost-pandemic economy for people and places.  \n \nWorking Places: Local Successes from a Productive Model  \n  I’ll turn now to an effort the Boston Fed has been involved with for nearly a decade, \nbegun under the leadership of my predecessor, Eric Rosengren. Since 2014, staff here have \nfocused on encouraging local efforts to find economic resurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long- term struggles. We call it the Working Places Challenge.  \n  These places were once centers of the manufacturing and natural resource economies \nin New England. With the employment decline in those industries, many of these communities have st ruggled to reimagine and rebuild their economies. They face m yriad  challenges: aging \nhousing stock and infrastructure, a dwindling tax base, and often high rates of poverty. Of course, they also have strengths and potential.  \n  “Working Places” is based on research that showed the key to economic resilience, \nthrough waves of change and challenge, is cross -sector collaboration among local individuals \nwilling to take on shared leadership.\n6 This collaborative leadership seems to be the “secret \nsauce” in resurgent communities. The Working Places  model  helps it blossom.  \n  The program is structured as a competition for relatively modest grant money (not from \nthe Fed but rather from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders –  now in 30 \ncommunities across 5 states –  are building cross -sector vision and prior ities, and working on \nthem  together . The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports  these efforts .  \n  It starts with teams choosing a shared goal for improving the economy that benefits low -\nincome people. Many teams focus on improving conditions and capabilities fo r the local \nworkforce, or  for locally owned businesses. If the independent jury  (not the Fed!)  selects a \ncommunity in the competition, that team receives several hundred thousand dollars over  three \nyears  (again, not from the Fed) , to use in  coordinat ing efforts and creat ing new interventions.  \n  I’ll share some examples :  \n The team in rural Lamoille County in northern Vermont is  newly focused on \nresponding to the need for housing voiced by low - and moderate -income residents \nand the employers in need of work ers. The county has low-income  areas of poverty  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n alongside higher income  and second- home communities associated with ski ing. The \nneed for housing is  made more acute by the influx of new residents –  many working \nelsewhere, remotely – and the growth of the short -term rental market, which \nsqueezes out long- term renters. Local s from a variety of sectors are working together \nto move the needle on housing,  by experimenting with novel approaches  such as \nextending water and sewer  infrastructure  to enable new development, and creating a \nlandlord liaison to facilitate  rental housing for local residents.    \n \n In East Hartford , Connecticut,  people across sectors saw the need to align job \nopportunities for local residents  with local employers ’ workfor ce needs . East Hartford \nis a diverse community . Compared to nearby towns and the state as a whole, it has  \nhigher poverty rates, more working poor, fewer with college degrees , and more \nfemale- led single -parent households. The Working Places team  focused on local-\nresident job training,  local recruiting and placement with major  employers, and \nsummer jobs for high school  student s.7  For example, the Professional Skills \nAcademy has now trained three cohorts of local residents for placement with local \nemployers,  in cooperation with a local college – including relatively well paid, career -\nladder jobs.  \n \n Lawrence, Massachusetts, once a textile manufacturing powerhouse, has been \none of the lowest -income cities in the Commonwealth for decades, with deteriorating \nservices and high rates of poverty. People in city government, nonprofits, the school \ndepartment, the community college, and local firms decided to focus on rais ing the \nincome prospects of parents with children in the public schools.  They provided job \ntraining and wraparound services for more than 600 parents , assisted 200 families \nwith job placement s (with  an average wage inc rease of 25 percent ), created new \ntraining pipelines with employers and the local community college,  and integrated \nsome long-term interventions into the school system, aimed at improving family well -\nbeing.8  \n   \n  In sum, w e see progress , and promise . Working Places  helps communities weave \ntogether many small individual approaches into one, coherent system  – and then improve the \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n system.  It has been wonderful to see  relatively  limited  awards be followed by substantial private \nand public investment, capitalizing on new  cross- sector frameworks and creating new hubs of \neconomic activity. For example,  in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, work  by the  local team was a key \nfactor in  now more than $100 million in new investment downtown and in  surrounding \nneighborhoods. In Massachusetts, the  Executive Office of Economic and Housing Development \ncreated the Urban Agenda grant program , modeled partially on Working Places , which has now \ninvested in collaborative economic growth projects in over 50 communities over 5 years, \nincluding Lawrence – and a national funder9 created a small -city investment fund for follow -on \ninvestment.  \n  Independent outside evaluations cite progress such as  heightened involvement of \nanchor  institution s like educational  and health care organizations,  and other private employers ; \nevaluations also find city government spending more aligned with local  priorities.10 And from \n2011 to 2016, poverty dropped and high school graduation rates improved faster and more \ndramatically in our Round 1 winning “ working cities ” (Lawrence, Fitchburg, Holyoke, Chelsea) \nthan in the state as a whole a nd other similar cities.  \n   There are important lessons from Working Places. Complex issues cannot be solved by \none sector, one organization, or one person. Successful collaboration requires attention to \nprocess, and new voices at the table to expand insight . It requires the flexibility to seize \nopportunities – and to change  along the way, including admitting when efforts need to be \nrethought . A neutral, trusted convener can help.  The most successful Working Places teams \nhave robust community engagement, local government supporters , and an urgent shared \npurpose.  \n  While still unfolding, i t’s a great story  that deserv es to be told – and hopefully  replicated \nas well as studied.  \n \nConcluding Observations \n  The Working Places initiative helps the Fed encourage progress in local economies . It is  \ngrounded in our mission of a vibrant and inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price \nstability and maximum employment for all , not just some. Like other community development \nefforts of the Boston Fed, it complements our monetary policy, research,  payments, and \nsupervision work , as we seek to fulfil our mission and mandate.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n   If we are to move toward a more inclusive economy over time,  the capacity for low -\nincome places to adapt to economic change, which Working Places supports, is ever more \nimpo rtant. This is particularly true in the context of the kinds of changes in housing and work we \nare discussing at today’s conference.  \n  I’ll conclude my remarks there. We have important topics to cover today, and some \nterrific experts to share their perspectives. I look forward to hearing from our panelists about shifting economic conditions , and invite moderator John Ballantine to begin that session. \n  A gain, thank you all for joining us  today.    \n \n \n \n1 Forty -seven percent of Massachusetts residents 25 and older hold a bachelor’s or advanced degree, the highest among states \n(although bested by Washington, D.C.).

Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \n2023 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum  \nsponsored by the Initiative  on Global Markets at the  \nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business \n \n \nFebruary 24, 2023 \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or  the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n \n                         \n   EMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, February 24, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n \n   \n  Key Takeaways:  \n1.  Inflation remains too high.  I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then \nholding there for some, perhaps extended, time.  My views will continue to be based on a holistic assessment of available information.  And while aware of the risks and uncertainties, I remain optimistic there is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn. \n2.  The root of the inflation surprise was an imbalance between demand and supply.  During 2021-22, \nrealized demand exceeded supply, and forecasters were ov erly optimistic about supply recovering to meet \nthe increase in demand as the economy reopened.  The interaction of supply chain bottlenecks and \nconstraints to labor supply compounded the forecasting misses.  Supply chains were under strain due to \ncontinued bouts of COVID variants; and later, Russia’s war in Ukraine.  \n3.  My view is that, in 2021 – in the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant \ncontinued uncertainty, and with inflation expectations in a reasonable range – supporting the economy versus pre-empting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision.   \n4.  Policy lessons from this still-evolving episode in clude that capacity constraints can lead to a less \nfavorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment – and this potentially has implications for the \nfuture conduct of monetary policy, as we at the Fed fulfill our dual mandate. Furthermore, I’ll observe that \nadditional wide-ranging indicators can be especially helpful for evaluating policy options in unusual \ncontexts. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n1 \n  \n It is a pleasure to be part of the 2023 Forum.  I’ll begin by noting that, of course, I speak \nonly for myself, not for colleagues at the Board of Governors or other Reserve Banks.  After some brief remarks about current monetary policy, I’ll turn to the important topic of this panel.   \nInflation remains too high, and recent data – including several strong labor market \nindicators, as well as faster than expected retail sales and producer price inflation – all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target.  While optimistic there is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn, I am also well aware of the many risks and uncertainties, including the risk of a self-fulfilling loss of business \nand consumer confidence.   \n  Policy actions to date continue to demonstrate the committee’s resolve – and it is helpful \nto see further declines in longer term inflation expectations, consistent with the credibility of our commitment.  I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, and then \nholding there for some, perhaps extended, time.  My outlook and policy decisions will continue \nto be based on a holistic assessment of available information and rooted in pursuit of the Fed’s Congressional mandate for price stability and maximum employment. \nFew forecasters inside or outside the Fed anticipated the inflation surge that began in \nthe first half of 2021, as the economy reopened from the pandemic.  Indeed, for months, many – \nincluding the Fed – miscast how high, broad, and recalcitrant inflation would prove to be.  Fed \nactions to remove accommodation began in late 2021, with winding down asset purchases.  As this shifted to an asset run-off (from our balance sheet) that is still underway, the FOMC began raising rates in March 2022.  Since then, our unusually aggressive actions increased the federal \nfunds rate by four and a half percentage points in just nine months. These actions, along with \nthe ones I expect will be taken going forward, should bring inflation back down to target in a reasonable amount of time.   \nWhile I’ll say a bit more about recent policy, my remarks focus on the topic of this panel \n– why were the inflation forecast misses so large and persistent?  Examining the nature of the \nerrors is important and will help us improve policy going forward.  The following are key aspects \nof my current perspective, recognizing that this complex episode is still unfolding.   \n  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n2 \n The Miscast Inflation Forecast \nInflation has several determinants, but unsurprisingly, the root of the inflation surprise \nwas an imbalance between demand and supply.  Over the course of 2021 and 2022, realized \ndemand exceeded expectations while the opposite was true for supply, causing significant price \npressures and much higher-than-expected inflation.  I’ll highlight a few important factors. \nThe first relates to the behavior of consumption and gross domestic product (GDP), \nrelative to pre-pandemic trends.  Output fell suddenly and sharply in the pandemic, prompting \nstrongly accommodative monetary and fiscal policy actions (from the central bank and the \nfederal government, respectively). \nAs shown in Figure 1 , the rebound in demand was also quick, and especially so for \nconsumption.  Perhaps more focus on consumption rather than GDP would have helped forecasters better assess the implications of demand for consumer price inflation dynamics.\n1 \nBy early 2021, both GDP and consumption were above trend.  But although notable at \nroughly 3 percent, even the consumption gap was not that large by historical standards.  By itself, such a gap cannot account for most of the inflation surge. \nUnanticipated supply shortfalls that lowered capacity relative to pre-pandemic trends \nclearly had to play an important role in the supply-demand imbalance and in miscasting inflation.  \nMonetary policy, of course, cannot remedy supply disruptions.  But an understanding of supply conditions is central to assessing the economic context, developing the outlook, and \ndetermining appropriate policy.  And the FOMC does need to respond to supply-driven inflationary pressures that have the potential to un-anchor longer-run inflation expectations.\n2  \nThe errors in assessing the speed of the supply recovery were, for most policymakers \nand observers, large and persistent. There were certainly efforts then, which continue today, to better understand constraints on global supply chains and their impact on inflation.  The New \n \n1 The consumption basket includes domestic and impo rted goods and services so that both domestic and \ninternational developments will impact consumer pric e inflation dynamics.  However, much of the \nspending in the early stages of the recovery was on  imported goods, likely somewhat mitigating the initial \neffects on domestic prices.   \n2 See “Inflation levels and (in)attention,” by A nat Bracha and Jenny Tang, Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston Working Paper 22-4 (2022), for details on how the relationship between inflation news and \ninflation expectations becomes stronger when inflation rates are high. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n3 \n York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index ( Figure 2 ) is an example.3  Still, it is difficult to \nassess the extent and duration of supply challenges in real time – especially if they depend on pandemic developments and unexpected shocks such as Russia’s war in Ukraine.     \nAnother factor to consider is that the consumption recovery after the initial phase of the \npandemic was disproportionately concentrated in goods, rather than on service sector spending that required face-to-face interactions.  This pattern by itself was bound to create supply pressures, which were in turn amplified by pandemic-related constraints.  This dynamic is \nreflected in the chart ( Figure 3 ) showing the large increase in goods consumption and the surge \nin goods price inflation.  \nPerhaps equally notable is the fact that, despite the large drop in services consumption, \nthere was little decline in services price inflation ( Figure 4 ).  Here, the contrast with the \nexperience from the Great Recession – w hen the mild slowdown in consumption was \naccompanied by a noticeable deceleration in inflation – is instructive, and again suggests a key \nrole for supply constraints this time. \nSurprises on the inflation front continued in late 2021 and into 2022.  The expectation \nwas that, as the economy reopened, demand would shift back from goods to services, and \ngoods inflation would subside without a significant rise in service-sector inflation.  Supply – and \nmost notably labor  supply, since services tend to be labor intensive – would increase to meet \ndemand.  \nReality was a bit different.  Services consumption rose somewhat, without a material \ndecline in goods consumption.  This meant little relief to supply chains, which were also under \nsignificant strain due to continued global bouts of COVID variants and, later, Russia’s war in \nUkraine – thus keeping pressure on inflation.  \nMost importantly, the expected pickup in labor  supply to meet the increased services \ndemand has been taking much longer to materialize than expected, creating a demand-supply \ngap in the labor market that fueled wage and price inflation. \n \n \n3 See https://libertystreeteconomics.ne wyorkfed.org/2022/01/a-new-baro meter-of-global-supply-chain-\npressures/ . More broadly, there was an expansion of type s of information considered by policymakers, \nincluding an effort to better understand consumer behavior as the economy re-opened by using high-\nfrequency data on mobility and foot traffic, transportation,  dining, and hotel occupancy, among others.    \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n4 \n There are several ways to think about the labor market imbalance.  One is illustrated in \nthis chart ( Figure 5 ), which compares the GDP recovery to the employment recovery, again \nusing pre-pandemic trends as benchmarks.  Although fast by historical standards, the \nemployment recovery was noticeably slower than the GDP recovery.4  Only near the end of \n2022 did the cyclical position of employment become more in line with GDP.  \nThe fact that employment took more time to recover than aggregate demand reflected a \nslower than expected recovery in labor supply, which caused fierce competition among firms for \navailable workers.  Given these unusual patterns, the unemployment rate has clearly not been a \nsufficient statistic for gauging labor market conditions.       \n Just before the pandemic, infl ation was seemingly stuck below  the 2 percent target, with \nan unemployment rate at similarly low levels.  Perhaps more weight should have been placed on indicators such as quits and vacancies – but their possible superiority as measures of labor \nmarket tightness relative to the unemployment rate was not clear from past experience. \nAgain, the pandemic was uncharted territory for forecasters and policymakers alike, and \nthere was little reason to expect an accurate real-time read on how much, for example, fear of Covid and remote education arrangements would affect labor supply decisions, especially given \nall the uncertainty associated with the pandemic’s evolution.\n5     \nIn sum, an important reason for underpredicting inflation was that forecasters were \noverly optimistic about supply recovering to meet the increase in demand as the economy \nreopened.  The fact that both supply chain bottlenecks and constraints to labor supply were \noperating at the same time compounded the forecasting errors.   \n \nMonetary Policy in Real Time \nMy comments so far have highlighted the importance of supply constraints in generating \nhigh, unexpected inflation during the pandemic recovery.  I’ve noted that there is little the Fed \n \n4 On this point, see also “A new interpretation of pr oductivity growth dynamics in the pre-pandemic and \npandemic era U.S. economy, 1950-2022” by Robert J. Gordon and Hassan Sayed, NBER working paper \n30267 (2022). \n \n5 Incidentally, I will note here that it was also difficult  to predict that the pandemic would lead to increased \ndemand for residential space, stemming from remote work, which in turn resulted in higher house prices \nand rents.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n5 \n can do to alleviate supply challenges, but that policy should lean against supply-driven inflation \nthat risks un-anchoring longer-run inflation expe ctations.  In particular, a temporary but \npersistent  dislocation can increase such a risk.    \nIt is also clear from my previous comments and charts that demand played a role in the \ninflation rise as well.6  One question, then, is whether monetary policy should have tightened \nearlier to reduce the risk of un-anchoring inflation expectations and to offset the demand increase.  \nSome may say that policy was too accommodative in the first place.  In my view, such a \nstatement ignores the real time concerns created by the pandemic; the associated risk \nmanagement required; and the difficulty of inferr ing, in real time, how quickly adverse supply \nshocks would unwind. \nWhile not involved in policy decisions until becoming Boston Fed President in July 2022, \nI was a keen policy observer.  I agree with Chair Powell and other colleagues who have stated \nthat, with the benefit of hindsight, policy could have been tightened sooner.  But to me in 2021, in the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant continued uncertainty, and with inflation expectations in a reasonable range, supporting the economy versus pre-\nempting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision.  I’ll note that \nmy view was not predicated on the 2020 revisions to the Fed’s policy framework.  \nWould earlier rate increases have significantly helped reduce inflation pressures?  That \ndepends on how early and how quickly the Fed would have moved.  In my view, given the significant uncertainty that continued to surround the pandemic, earlier action by the Fed may \nhave been less aggressive, taking longer to reach a restrictive range.  \n Where Are We Now?   \nWhile the misses in inflation were large, key aspects of prior forecasts are playing out, \nalbeit with a lag.  With improvements on the supply side – both in terms of supply chains and, to \n \n6 For a decomposition of inflation into demand- and supply-driven components, see “How much do supply \nand demand drive inflation?” by Adam H. Shapiro, Fe deral Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic \nLetter (June 21, 2022) and “Are the Demand and Supply Channels of Inflation Persistent? Evidence from \na Novel Decomposition of PCE Inflation” by Viache slav Sheremirov, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \nCurrent Policy Perspectives (2022).   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n6 \n some degree, labor supply – we are now seeing initial signs of deceleration in goods-price and \nwage inflation. These improvements took longer than expected to materialize but do appear to be providing some relief to inflation.  \nIn addition, despite the risk of longer-run inflation expectations becoming un-anchored, \nthey have remained in check throughout this period.  And now that policy is in restrictive territory, the process of realigning demand with supply is underway.   \n \nSome Policy Lessons \nThere are several important policy issues to be studied from this still-evolving episode.  I \noffer a partial list and reiterate that these are my views alone. \nThe belief that inflation dynamics during the pandemic recovery would remain similar to \nthe 1996-2019 period was too optimistic.  Thus, forecasters likely underestimated implications of \nexcessively strong labor markets for wages and prices.  And especially when unemployment is \nlow, it is clear that labor market tightness is best assessed with a broad range of indicators.   \nReliance on a small trade-off between inflation and unemployment – that is, on a linear \nand flat Phillips curve even at low unemployment rates – implied more willingness to risk \nprobing down on the unemployment rate than may have been warranted.  Recent experience \nsuggests that capacity constraints can lead to a nonlinear Phillips curve with a higher slope at low unemployment rate levels. This less favorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment has implications for how best to probe going forward, as we at the Fed fulfill our dual mandate.  \nUltimately, the nature of the pandemic represented unchartered waters for policymakers, \nand as I have argued, supply factors played an important role.  Indeed, there may be a somewhat stronger case than previously thought for taking out insurance against adverse inflation outcomes, with policy tightening, when there is the risk of supply constraints being \nbinding.  Moreover, we have learned that additional, wide ranging, indicators may be helpful for \nevaluating if there is a need for preemptive policy in these contexts.     \nIn sum, I believe a collective dose of humility and openness is appropriate, as we focus \non all we can learn from studying this episode.  I am pleased to see that work well underway, including at the Fed and through discussions such as this panel.",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n  \nAt the 39th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference  \n  \n \nMarch 30, 2023 \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n                         \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n   \n  Key Takeaways  \n1. Financial stability : The banking system is strong and resilient, with well -capitalized \ninstitutions and ample liquidity. Recent difficulties, and the decisive actions taken in \nresponse, demonstrate commitment to use all our tools to ensure the financial system \nremains safe and sound, and to take action as needed. The lessons learned from the \nreview underway will be welcome, and instructive.  \n2. Monetary policy and the macroeconomic outlook : Recent data show that inflation is still \ntoo high, continuing to take a toll on households and firms. I anticipate that some additional \npolicy tightening will be needed as we follow through on our commitment to price stability. \nHowever, while recognizing the risks and uncertainties to the outlook, I remain optimistic \nthere is a path t o bringing inflation down without a significant downturn, because of the \nresilience I see in the economy.   \n3. Financial infrastructure and payments services:  The Fed provides essential financial \ninfrastructure the economy depends on – and innovates to meet evolving needs and \npreferences. In today’s world, people want quick and easy ways to make payments \ninstantly, with immediate access to those funds. To help financial institutions offer instant payment services to their customers around the clock, we will launch the FedNow\nSM \nService in July.  \n4. Community economic development and opportunity:  While the Fed’s activities are \nbroad, they all relate to supporting a vibrant and inclusive economy, consistent with our \nmandates – stable prices and maximum employment. That’s why, for example, we have for \ndecades studied the gaps and disparities behind the aggregates. It is also why the Boston \nFed is helping spark collaboration among the private, public, nonprofit, and philanthropic \nsectors, to find local solutions to complex economic problems in urban and rural areas.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Good afternoon. It is truly a pleasure to be with you today. I thank NABE for the \ninvitation, and Elaine Buckberg for moderating the discussion.  \nMy thanks to all of you, for being here, and for the work you do – using the tools \nand insights from economics  to support your organizations, and our economy.  \nBy way of introduction, I am honored to serve as an economic policymaker at the \nFederal Reserve. It is a privilege, a responsibility, and an opportunity –  and I am \ncommitted to an inclusive approach to serv ice in the public interest.  \nBefore turning to questions, I will share some perspectives from my first nine \nmonths as a Fed president and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant. I’ll \ncover some obvious topics (financial stability, monetary policy , and the macroeconomy). \nI’ll also touch very briefly on some things about the Fed that get less attention (including payments infrastructure and supporting economic resurgence). When you think about \nthe economy – as those in this room do, all the time –  recognizing the breadth of the \nFed’s work is important, because it all connects to our mandate and mission, and to our overarching goal of a vibrant, inclusive economy with opportunities for all.  \nFirst, I’ll give my standard disclaimer: These perspectives are my own. I am not \nspeaking for any other Federal Reserve policymakers.  \n Monetary Policy, and the Macroeconomic Outlook  \nInflation remains too high, and recent indicators reinforce my view that there is \nmore work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target associated with price \nstability. I’ll say more about why  this is so important, in a moment.  \nOur banking system is strong and resilient, with well -capitalized institutions and \nample liquidity. The banking industry plays an important role in the economy –  banks of \nall sizes are important for meeting saving and credit needs across communities. However, recent bank failures underscore how difficulties in just a few institutions have \nthe potential to undermine confidence in the entire banking sys tem.   \nThe Federal Reserve, in concert with the Treasury and FDIC, took decisive \nactions to strengthen the public’s confidence in the U.S. banking system and to protect \nthe U.S. economy. I note that while these actions assisted depositors of the failed \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n banks, shareholders and certain unsecured debt holders were not protected, and the \nbanks’ senior management were removed. Vice Chair Barr has a comprehensive review \nunderway to determine what went wrong and whether changes are needed. We will \ntake what is lea rned to heart and strengthen practices accordingly – consistent with our \nmission to ensure a safe, sound, and stable banking system supporting a healthy economy for all.\n1 \nThe Federal Reserve continues to monitor financial conditions closely, and is \nprepar ed to use all tools at its disposal in keeping the banking system safe and sound.  \nI will now turn to monetary policy, mindful of course that challenges to financial \nstability – and credit conditions generally – have implications for the macroeconomy and \nby extension, for policy.  \nIn March of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began \nraising interest rates to bring inflation down. But despite progress, inflation remains too high, and there is more work to do to restore price stability.  \nWhy is the inflation fight so important? The starting place is the Fed’s dual \nmandate from Congress, for price stability and maximum employment – representing \nstrong and stable economic conditions that benefit everyone.  \nHigh inflation creates hardship for all, particularly those at the lower end of the \nincome distribution who can least afford price increases – especially for essentials such \n \n1 See the Joint Statement describing “actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon \nValley Bank…in a manner that fully protects all depositors,” emphasizing “No losses associated with the \nresolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer”, and continuing “We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank … which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to \nsupport uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law. \nFinally, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.” ( https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm\n). Also \nnote the announcements that Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr is leading a review of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, in light of its failure \n(\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230313a.htm ), and of coordinated \ncentral bank action to enhance the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity \n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230319a.htm ). \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n as food, housing, and transportation. Inflation also complicates investment and planning \ndecisions for firms throughout the  economy.  \nI lead the Fed’s First District, which covers most of New England, and as I meet \nwith constituents, many highlight the challenges they face from inflation. In Vermont \nearlier this month, I heard from small business owners ending projects due to cost \nincreases, parents having to take on second jobs given rising prices on necessities, and \npeople unable to accept attractive jobs because living costs are rising too fast where the \njob is located.    \nImportantly, the two dimensions of the Fed’s mandate – price stability and \nmaximum employment –  are intertwined. Low, predictable inflation is an important \nprecondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. Price stability is essential for a well -functioning economy and labor market.  \nInflati on reflects a gap between demand and supply, resulting in pressures that \nfuel wage and price increases. In raising interest rates, the Fed intends to slow demand, \ncool a still- hot labor market, and bring demand and supply back into sustainable \nalignment.   \nSince March, the FOMC raised rates from near zero to the range of 4.75 to 5 \npercent. After initial, expeditious moves, recent increments have been small and deliberate – which in my view is appropriate as we approach a level that is sufficiently \nrestricti ve.    \nThe recent data show signs of more underlying strength in the economy than \nmany anticipated. The unemployment rate remains at historically low levels, job growth remains robust, and spending indicators through February were stronger than expected. \nThis strength might reflect the fact that policy did not enter fully restrictive territory until \nthe second half of 2022, and it may be too soon to see its full effects on real activity.  \nBut special factors may also have limited the impact of policy action s thus far, \nrelative to historic norms. On the household side, a sizable amount of “excess” savings accumulated during the pandemic remains – although this is less evident at the lower \nend of the income distribution, where some signs of stress are emerging. On the firm \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n side, balance sheets also remain quite strong overall, limiting the need for external \nfinance.  \nSustained household and business spending, and limited pickup in labor supply, \nhelp explain why the labor market remains robust. But there are some emerging signs \nof slowing labor demand. In particular, a large portion of the recent strength in payrolls \ncomes from sectors that were hit especially hard early in the pandemic –  such as leisure \nand accommodation, and health care – and faced significant hiring challenges in the \nrecovery. As this “catching up” process ends, I expect more moderation in hiring, which \nshould help to relieve wage pressures.2 Here, it is important to note that workers do not \nbenefit from nominal  wage gains that are eroded by too -high inflation –  what matters for \nworkers are gains in real  wages.  \nWhile we may be seeing some initial signs of wage moderation, more will be \nneeded for a sustained improvement in price inflation. In determining whether inflation is \nmoving toward tar get in a reasonable amount of time, it is informative to look separately \nat three key components.  \n First, core goods  price inflation has slowed, but a full passthrough of supply chain \nimprovements and lower input costs to goods prices will take more time.  \n Second, shelter  inflation remains quite high. Slowing growth in new rents (with \nactual declines in some areas for rents and house prices) should feed through into lower shelter inflation in the coming quarters.  \n But, third, services inflation excluding shelter, which tends to be closely tied to \nlabor costs, remains particularly elevated and will require wage pressures  to \nease more.   \n \n2 The recent slowdown in job quits is another potential sign of slowing labor demand. In addition, cross -\nstate data suggest that wage inflation tends to be more strongly correlated with quits than vacancies, \nimplying that the slowdown in quits may help to ease wage pressures despite vacancies remaining \nelevated.  Wage inflation, however, also continues to be highly correlated with unemployment, suggesting \nthat at least some rise in unemployment rate will be needed to bring about a more significant decline in \nwage growth.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n In all, the challenge ahead lies in determining the level and path of the federal \nfunds rate to bring inflation back to target in a reasonable amount of time, without undue \nlabor market disruptions.  \nAs I noted earlier, recent financial sector stress has added to this challenge by \nincreasing the uncertainty around appropriate monetary policy. While the banking \nsystem remains strong and resilient, recent developments will likely lead banks to take a \nsomewhat more conservative outlook and tighten lending standards, thus contributing to \nslowing the economy and reducing inflationary pressures. These developments may \npartially offset the need for additional rate increases.  \nWhile recognizing the heightened uncertainty, I believe staying the cours e with a \none-quarter -percent increase in the policy rate at last week’s FOMC meeting was \nappropriate. Similarly, given current information, I see the median federal funds rate path for 2023 in last week’s Summary of Economic Projections  from Fed policymakers \n(the SEP)\n3 as reasonably balancing the risk of monetary policy not being restrictive \nenough to bring inflation down, and the risk that activity slows by more than needed to \naddress elevated price pressures.  \nSimilar to the SEP median, I currently anticipate some modest additional policy \ntightening, and then holding through the end of this year. Of course, I’ll be carefully \nwatching a range of indicators including data on inflation, spending, labor markets, and \nfinancial conditions.  \nOverall, I continue to be what I call a “realistic optimist.” I am well aware of the \nmany risks and uncertainties facing our economy – including the risk of a self -fulfilling \nloss in business and consumer confidence.  However, I’ve also mentioned reasons to be optimistic the economy may prove more resilient to tight financial conditions than in \nthe past – including business and household fundamentals that remain relatively strong. \nSo, I am still optimistic there is a path to bringing down inflation without a significant economi c downturn.   \n \n3 https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20230322.pdf  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n A Range of Activities in Support of a Vibrant Economy  \nAs I mentioned at the outset, I want to touch briefly on some things the Fed does, \nthat get less attention. In my view, understanding the breadth of the Fed’s work is \nimportant because I see the Fed’s mission as fostering a vibrant, resilient, inclusive \neconomy; and we do that in a wider range of ways than most people realize – from \nmonetary policy, to economic research, financial stability efforts, community \ndevelopment activities, and initiatives related to payments, technology, and finance. I \nwill be happy to elaborate during the discussion, but for now I’ll just mention two \ninitiatives that show the breadth and depth of the Boston Fed’s commitment to a strong, \ninclusive economy with opportunities for all.  \nFirst, the infrastructure for making and receiving payments is a foundation of \neveryone’s economic lives and our financial system. In today’s world, people \nincreasingly want quick and easy ways to make payments and immediate access to \nthose funds.  \nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve System, the Boston Fed has been leading the \nbuild of a new, real -time payments service, referred to as the FedNowSM Service .  \nLaunching in July, the infrastructure will provide access to instant paymen ts for \nparticipating financial institutions and their customers.  \nFedNow will offer real economic benefits to the American public, who will be able \nto send and receive instant payments safely and efficiently through participating \ninstitutions – giving greater flexibility to manage money at any time of the day or night, \n365 days  a year. We encourage financial institutions across the country join in the \nservice, so their customers can broadly enjoy the benefits of instant payments.4 \nSecond, for decades we have studied gaps and disparities in economic \noutcomes. This relates directly to our mandates from Congress, which include \nmaximum employment. Because unemployment rates that are persistently higher by \n \n4 Learn more at FedNowSM Explorer – Instant Payments Learning & Resources . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n race, or by place – as they have been for a long time – reflect underutilization of our \ncountry’s labor resources, adversely affecting productivity and prosperity.  \nOne effort proving important in this regard is the Boston Fed’s Working Places \nprogram, which touches 30 urban and rural areas across New England. Research \nshows that the “secret sauce” in economic resurgence seems to be cross -sector \ncollaborative leadership from local people, working together to identify issues and solutions. The Fed’s role is to provide a framework for convening and for increasing \ncollaboration among the private sector, philanthropy, local organizations, state \ngovernment , and residents. The program supports efforts by local leaders to help their \nareas address challenges such as workforce development and affordable housing – and \nthe results are promising.\n5  \nI’ll conclude with a final observation. As I travel and hear about peoples’ \nexperiences, I’m struck by the opportunities and strengths in our economy, as well as \nthe challenges. Hearing from a wide range of  voices rounds out the economic data, \ndeepens our understanding, and helps us all make progress. My Fed colleagues and I will continue to prioritize this type of engagement, which is essential to our work.  \nWith that, I’ll be happy to discuss some questions , with Elaine.\n   \n \n \n5 In a January speech, I discussed the Working Places framework and local efforts to find economic \nresurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing challenges. https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-\nevents/speeches/2023/the- national -and-regional -economy -navigating- near-term- changes -and-long- term-\nchallenges.aspx",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n   \nMay 25, 2023 \n \n  \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n                         \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, May  25, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n   \n \n  Key Takeaways  \n1. Collins wanted her first visit to an educational institution as Boston Fed president to be at a \ncommunity  college  – because they provide affordable, accessible higher education to learners \nfrom all backgrounds.  Community colleges play a crucial role in helping students develop the \nnecessary skills to contribute in the economy of today and of the future.  It is essential that our \neconomy has opportunities for everyone to thrive, and that makes community colleges particularly important.   \n2. High inflation impacts everyone – and we need to make sure it does not become entrenched.  \nAn inflation rate that is low and predictable is needed for fostering conditions that promote a \nvibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment that is sustainable over \ntime. This is why it is so important to remain resolute in bringing inflation back down to the Fed’s 2 \npercent target in a reasonable amount of time.  \n3. While inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation.  Colli ns believes \nwe may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising interest rates.  This will provide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the actions taken to date and the general tightening of credit conditions on economic activity.  However, it is important to make each policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of information available at the time.  \n4. Collins noted the breadth of ways the Fed advances its mission – e.g., providing back -end \ninfrastructure that underpins the financial system that people and organizations depend on; \nsupervising banks for safety, soundness, fair lending, and community reinvestment and serving \nas a “lender of last resort”; working to support community economic development and identify \nimpe diments to participation in the job market and economy; and conducting economic research \nand analysis to support monetary policymaking, in  pursuit of the dual mandate from Congress to \npromote price stability and maximum employment.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  \nGood morning.  It is truly a pleasure to be here with you today, at CCRI, the \nCommunity College of Rhode Island.   \nSince I started in this job about 10 months ago, being out and meeting with \nstakeholders has been a key focus.  I like to say that the Fed’s overa rching mission is to \nfoster conditions supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for all.  So it is \nessential for us to connect with and learn from people across the Boston Fed’s district \n(which is essentially New England) – about their experiences, challenges , and \nopportunities.    \nMy initial remarks today revolve around what we at the Fed are doing, and you at \nCCRI are doing, to support a vibrant and inclusive economy that works for all.  \nGiven my background as a professor, dean, and provost, I’ve been fortunate to \nreceive speaking invitations at a number of educational institutions.  But this is the first \ntalk at an educational institution that I am giving as p resident of the Boston Fed, \nbecause I wanted my first visit with students, and faculty to be at a community  college.   \n \n \nOverview  \n \nI would like to touch briefly on three things – and then look forward to a \nconversation with President Hughes, and to questions from all of you:   \n \n• First, I want to highlight why I wanted to prioritize speak ing at a community \ncollege like CCRI ; and why com munity colleges, and all of you engaged with \nthem, are so important to our economy and society.  \n• Then, I’ll talk briefly about the range of things we do at the Federal Reserve, to \nadvance our mission.  \n• And finally, I’ll share some of the lessons I’ve learned from my own career path,  \nin case my experiences may be helpful to you.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n  \nBut before I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks today are my own \nviews; I’m not speaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks or at the Board of Governors.  \n  \nThe Importance of Community Colleges  \n \nCommunity colleges provide affordable, accessible higher education to millions \nof learners from all  backgrounds.  They support a wide range of needs for students, \nemployers and communities, and provide opportunities for upward mobility.\n1   And \ncommunity college students  exemplify working hard, juggling multiple responsibilities, \nand developing additional skills to contribute to the economies of today and the future.   \nI would especially like to acknowledge the cohort of entrepreneurs and owners of \nsmall businesses who ar e here today.  You play such an important role in a vibrant \neconomy.   \nAs I travel around New England and talk with employers, one of the most \nprevalent themes is the need for skilled personnel, to power their organizations and \nindustries.  Indeed, our region’s labor market provides opportunities for good jobs, \nenabling people to prosper and thrive.  But those jobs require evolving sets of skills and \nexpertise.  So I congratulate all of you for investing in yourselves and your skills here at \nCCRI.  Doing so  is not only good for you; it also helps the organizations, households, \nand communities that make up our economy.  \nAs a policymaker, it is critical to me that our economy provides opportunities for \neveryone, not just for some.  This makes community colleges , like CCRI, particularly \nimportant in the broader higher education and skill -development landscape.   \n \n1 See the recent study by Jack Mountjoy, “Community Colleges and Upward Mobility,” American \nEconomic Rev iew, 2022, 112(8): 2580 –2630.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n At the Fed, part of our mandate from Congress is to use our tools to maximize \nemployment.  So if things like a lack of childcare, or insufficient housing, prevent some \npeople from participating in the job market and economy, we need to study those \nimpediments.  We need to deepen our understanding of the obstacles  and help explore \nways, locally and more broadly, that progress can be made to address them.  T he \nBoston Fed has been doing this through our research- based Working Places program, \nin locations across New England – including Cranston, Newport, and Providence here in \nRhode Island.2  Working Places encourages and fosters local, cross -sector \ncollaborat ion to identify issues and work on solutions to address complex economic \nproblems.  \n  \nOur Roles at the Federal Reserve  \n \nIn fact, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of activities is much more extensive than \nmany realize – and I’d like to speak briefly about the breadth of ways we, at the Fed, \nwork to achieve our mission.  \nThe Fed, which is the U.S. central bank, was created almost 110 years ago by \nCongress.  I’ll mention four of our key roles:  \n \n• We provide a lot of back -end infrastructure that underpins the financial system, \nsupporting stable and reliable payments that people and organizations \nthroughout the economy depend on. Think cash, direct deposits, wire transfers, \nand a new service we’re about to unveil, FedNow\nSM instant payments.3  It is the \nfirst new payments “rail” the Fed has built in 50 years, and it will allow individuals \n \n2 Learn more about these efforts at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx  \n \n3 Learn more about the FedNow  service  at https://explore.fednow.org/  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n and businesses to send and receive instant payments and have access to the \nfunds immediately.  \n• Second, we supervise some of the country’s banks for safety, soundness, fair lending, and community reinvestment.  And we serve as a “lender of last resort” \nto the financial system, to ensure liquidity and t o support financial stability.  \n• Third, we work to support community economic development initiatives, like the \nWorking Places program I just mentioned.  \n• Fourth, and importantly, we conduct monetary policy in the pursuit of our dual mandate from Congress to promote price stability and maximum employment.   I’ll \nsay a bit more about this area of our work.  \n \nTo me, maximum employment refers to the broad, inclusive goal of job \nopportunities for all.  Price stability means inflation that is low and stable enough th at it \nis not on people’s minds.  Inflation at 2 percent, the target the Fed has defined, accomplishes that goal.  But as you all know, prices have been rising more rapidly than \nthat, so much attention has been focused on inflation.  In my conversations wit h people \nacross the region, I have heard from small business owners ending projects due to cost \nincreases, and from workers having to take on additional jobs given rising prices on \nnecessities.  \nThese and other discussions are a constant reminder that inflation impacts \neveryone, and is particularly challenging for those with lower incomes.  The Federal \nReserve has been responding forcefully to make sure that high inflation does not \nbecome entrench ed.   \nI’ll note that wage increases that are simply chasing higher prices do not make \nworkers better off, they just fuel more inflation.  What matters for workers are gains in \ninflation -adjusted, or real wages.  \nThus, I see the two dimensions of the Fed’s m andate – stable prices and \nmaximum employment –  as intertwined, especially over the medium and longer term.  \nLow, predictable inflation is needed for fostering conditions that promote a vibrant, \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n resilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment  that is sustainable \nover time.  This is a key reason why it is so important for us to remain resolute in \nbringing inflation back down to the 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time.  \nThere are several factors behind the inflation we’ve been experiencing, but \nultimately it reflects demand outpacing supply, resulting in pressures on wages and \nprices that fuel inflation.  The Fed raising interest rates is intended to slow spending, \ncool t he labor market, and bring demand back into alignment with supply.   \nSince March 2022, the Fed has raised rates from near zero to just over 5 percent \n– with the most recent increase occurring just a few weeks ago.  And recent stresses in \nthe banking system  are likely to  further  tighten credit conditions for businesses and \nconsumers, also cooling demand.    \nWhile inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation.  I \nbelieve we may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising  \ninterest rates.  This will provide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the actions taken to date and the general tightening of credit conditions on economic \nactivity.  However, I also believe it is important to make each policy decision based on a \nwholistic assessment of information available at the time – and the next policy meeting \nwill be in mid -June.  In the meantime, we continue to monitor a wide range of data –  \nabout price developments, labor markets, financial conditions and more – to evaluate \nhow the economy is doing.  \n \n \nMy Own Path, and Some Lessons Along the Way  \n \nLet me turn, for a moment, to my own career path.   I’ll just mention a few \ndimensions of my journey, and then wrap up.  \nFirst, I was inspired to be a lifelong learner by my parents and relatives.  While I \nrealize that not everyone has that support, I hope you will be inspired by those you meet here at CCRI, to never stop learning and developing your skills.   The pace of change in \nour economy, and the sk ills it requires, make that essential.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Ma y 25, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n During my studies, I encountered instructors who were inspiring, challenging … \nor both.   It was the challenging ones who taught me the most.  I encourage you to seek \nout opportunities to stretch yourself – maybe by as king questions, to be sure you have \nmastered a subject, or taking a class here at CCRI that will push you.  I know many \npeople around you at CCRI care about your success –  so, seek out those who will \ninspire and challenge you.  \nAnd throughout my career, I have been fortunate to have encouragement from \nfriends and family – especially my husband and (now adult) children.   Again, I realize \nnot everyone is so fortunate.   I’ll just say that it is vital to have allies and supporters as \nyou do the hard work of juggling everything, both while attending CCRI and in the future.   So I encourage you to seek out allies … and perhaps most importantly, to be an \nally.  I’ve found that working together, building networks and partnerships, is a key to success – whether in school, or in a new job, or as President of the Boston Fed.   \n  \nConcluding Observations  \nLet me close by encouraging you to keep at what you are doing here at CCRI, \nand to embrace being a lifelong learner.   I have such respect for all of you, who are \nworking so hard to broaden your skills.   You’re building a more prosperous future for \nyourselves, and also for our economy.  \nIndeed, as someone who thinks about and works on our economy all the time, I \nwant to thank you, students –  and your instructors and supporters  as well as the staff \nhere at CCRI –  for helping to build a vibrant, high- skill, inclusive economy –  in Rhode \nIsland and beyond.  \nWith that, thank you again for having me here today.   I look forward to questions \nand conversation.",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n   \nMay 31, 2023 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n                         \n Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, May  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n Opening Remarks  \n \nGood morning. I am Susan Collins, president of the Boston Fed, and it’s my \npleasure to welcome you –  whether here in person or online -- to the Federal Reserve \nBank of Boston for this half -day forum on several aspects of the post -pandemic \neconomy.  \nThank y ou all for joining us today. Special thanks to Fed Governor Michelle \nBowman for coming to the Boston Fed for our FedListens event. Before I invite \nGovernor Bowman to give some opening remarks, I’ll just say a few things about our \nevent today.  \nAs you may know, it is part of a series the Federal Reserve began a few years  \nago, and the second we’ve hosted here in Boston.1   The FedListens series is an \nimportant opportunity for Fed policymakers, at both the regional banks and the Board of \nGovernors in Washingt on, to expand the ways we hear from participants in the \neconomy.  \nThat’s why, today, we’ve brought together panelists and audience members who \nreflect the diversity of the New England region.  For some of you, this may be your first \nopportunity to engage w ith the Boston Fed – we look forward to your participation.   \nThere are a number of Fed leaders in the room today, including those \nresponsible for economic research and for community development, among other key \nareas. Our goal today, as leaders at the Fed eral Reserve, is that we really listen to you,  \nto help us deepen our understanding of post -pandemic experiences, and of the \nchallenges and opportunities facing each of you, and our region.  \nOur conversations today focus on three key topics -  labor markets, housing, and \nstate and local fiscal health.  We’ve distributed some background materials on each, \nand hope you’ve found them informative and helpful.  \nAnd as you’ll hear more about shortly,  we have ensured a variety of ways for you \nto share your views with us, whether you are on a panel, in the room or online.  \nSo, I want to welcome you all again  – and i t’s now my pleasure to invite Governor \nMichelle Bowman to the podium.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Ma y 31, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Governor Bowman has  served as a member of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System since 2018. Before joining the Board in Washington, she \nserved as the state bank commissioner of Kansas, and prior to that, as vice president of \nFarmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. A t the Federal Reserve, Gov. Bowman has been a \nleader and a proponent of these FedListens gatherings, and we’re thrilled to have her here with us today.  \n### \n \nClosing Remarks  \n \nLet me close out our gathering by first offering my sincere thanks to our \nmoderators, panelists, attendees.  We greatly appreciate today’s robust discussion, and \nyour valuable insights – in the panel sessions, around the tables, and from input shared \nby those online.  \nThanks as well to Governor Bowman and the other members of the Board of \nGovernors for promot ing events such as this one. It is so important for policymakers to \nhave windows like this, into regional experience and perspectives.  \nI want to say j ust a few things about how I believe we can use the insights gained \ntoday to advance the work we are charged with doing here at the Fed.  First, I will give \nmy standard disclaimer, which is that the views I share today are my own and not the views of my co lleagues on the Board or at other Reserve Banks.   \nI like to say that the Fed’s overarching mission is to foster conditions that support \na vibrant, inclusive economy that works for all –  not just for some people.   \nThat is why it is essential for us to conn ect with and learn from people across the \nBoston Fed’s district, which encompasses most of New England, about their \nexperiences, challenges, and opportunities.   \nThe Boston Fed prioritizes engaging with the community in a variety of ways, \nfrom collaborations, to serving as a nonpartisan resource, to convenings such as this \none.  And since I started in this job nearly 11 months ago, being out and meeting with \nstakeholders across the region has been a key focus.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Ma y 31, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n The perspectives you’ve all shared today augment what I have heard from my \ntravels. Community leaders in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont, \nMassachusetts, and just last week, New Hampshire, have raised many recurring \nthemes – in particular, the tol l from high inflation, challenges related to worker \navailability and retention, and barriers to full participation in the region’s economy and job market, such as the availability and cost of housing, and childcare.  \nYour input today helps to us to flesh out what we learn from the statistical data, \nand to connect quantitative analyses to the real -world experiences of people.  \nThis is particularly relevant as we, at the Fed, focus on our dual mandate from \nCongress: price stability and maximum employment.  We  are intent on reducing inflation \nthat is simply too high and impacting everyone, with particular challenges for those with lower incomes.  I’ll note that price stability is a foundation for maximum employment that \nis sustainable -  a robust job market with opportunities for all.  \nOur next monetary policy meeting is in mid- June.  And as I shared in remarks \nlast week to an audience at the Community College of Rhode Island, I believe it is \nimportant to make each policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of all the \navailable information.\n2   \nPolicymakers continue to monitor a wide range of data –  about price \ndevelopments, labor markets, financial conditions and more.  And we will continue to \nhave conversations such as these with business and community leaders, in order to \ncomplement the economic data and to help us more comprehensively assess how the \neconomy is doing.  \nHere at the Boston Fed, the insights we’re gathering today will broadly help to \ninform the wide range of work we do to advance our commitment  to promoting a strong \nand equitable economy.  \nAgain, I want to thank you for your active participation. We have enjoyed this \nFedListens event and look forward to continuing these conversations with many of you over lunch, and to future opportunities to engage.  \n \n### \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:50 A .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Ma y 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n  \n1 For more about the FedListens series, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -\ntools -and-communications -fed-listens -events.htm  \n2 See May 25, 2023 remarks by Susan M.

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \n \nAugust  31, 2023 \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, August  31, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n   \n Key Takeaways  \n1. To build a vibrant, inclusive economy, we need the best ideas, energy, and participation \nfrom everyone. Community colleges play a critical role in this important work by providing \naffordable, accessible higher education and essential skill devel opment – ultimately \nstrengthening our economy and society.  \n2. Collins said we can and should do much more to discover and nurture the potential in \npeople with a range of experiences and backgrounds – including individuals who may be \nthe first in their family to attend college and individuals who may look different in \nappearance from those who’ve traditionally held particular roles.    \n3. Reflecting on her first 14 months as Boston Fed president, Co llins said she’s been \nimpressed and encouraged by the leaders and residents she’s met who are working to \nensure everyone has a chance to participate and thrive in the economy. The Boston Fed \nbelieves in the power of collaborative leadership to make local e conomies stronger and \nmore inclusive. The Bank knows from experience that tangible, practical, community -based \nefforts serve to strengthen our region.   \n4. Collins commended community college students for having resilience, determination, and \nthe ability to overcome challenges. These traits, she added, give them the potential to be \nhighly capable contributors to economy. She also shared her appreciation for t he faculty \nand staff supporting those students.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n It is truly a pleasure to join you this morning for the 2023 Bunker Hill \nConvocation!  It’s always wonderful to be among faculty and staff, and I am delighted to \nknow many students are here as well. I want to thank President Eddinger and Provost \nCaniff for  inviting me to be with you today.    \nThe start to a new academic year is a very exciting time – and I know, also an \nextremely busy one.   Having spent most of my career in academi a, your convocation \nreminds me of so many starts to the academic year – initially as a student, then for \nabout 25 years as a faculty member , and for nearly another 15 as a university  \nadministrator.  I have  many wonderful memories of meet ing students ; launching \nprograms ; and welcoming , and welcoming back , faculty and staff – who are the \nessential pillars  in every higher education institution.   \nIn my current role , I lead an institution that , like yours,  has a public mission .  At \nthe Federal Reserve , we work to  foster  a vibrant, inclusive economy  – characterized by \nour congressionally mandated goals  of price stability and maximum employment  – an \neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people.  However, w e know that \neconomic outcomes for some people , some communities, and some places have \ndiverged – despite bes t efforts – and therefore, many  have been unable to  fully \nparticipat e in the econ omy.  A healthy economy needs the best ideas, energy , and \nparticipation from everyone  – with the opportunity to work hard, contribute, and prosper.   \nIn that context, I have a particular appreciation for the critical role that Bunker Hill \nCommunity College plays in the greater Boston region .  More  broadly, I’m thinking \nabout the essential ways  community colleges serve  our educational system in New \nEngland , and nationally .  Simply put, c ommunity colleges a re foundational to  higher \neducation in this country .  They  enroll nearly half of all first-time undergraduate \nstudents1 and provid e an affordable, accessible opport unity for investing in essential \nskills .  Here at Bunker Hill, you are supporting students of all ages and backgrounds , \n \n1 See “Community Colleges and Upward Mobility” by Jack Mountjoy, American Economic  Review,  Vol. \n112, N o. 8, A ug. 2022 (pp. 2580 -2630) : https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181756 . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n many  who are the first generation in their families to attend college .2  Your students are \nwonderfu lly diverse, and you’ve earned the designation of a Hispanic -Serving \nInstitution , and a n Asian American and Native American  Pacific Islander -Serving \nInstitution , from the U.S. Department of Education.   I want to express my  admiration and  \nappreciation for a ll that you do to support and invest in your students .  You are \nstrengthen ing our economy and our society.  \n In my remarks this morning, I’ d like to talk about t wo things.  First, I’ll briefly discuss  \nmy own career trajectory , with a bit of reflection on lessons and takeaways that I hope \nyou will find helpful.  Then  I’d like to share my perspective on the importance of a \nvibrant , inclusive economy and mention some of the ways  we at the Fed , community \ncolleges like yours , and people across the region  are working  to achieve that goal.  In \nthis discussion, I have a few key themes , including : the vital role of community colleges , \nespecially your work here at Bunker Hill.   I’ll also touch on the importance of \npartnerships and collaboration  – since s uccess  in my work, and yours,  require s all of us \nworking together.   And finally , since this is a convocation beginning a new academic \nyear, I’ll offer a thought on beginning, persisting, and finishing.  \n \nMy Own  Path  \nI’d much prefer to  talk about the work  of the Boston Fed , or Bunker Hill \nCommunity College,  than about myself .  But I am often asked how I got to be  in this \nrole, and whether I have advice for others  – especially since  I am the first woman of \ncolor to lead a Federal Reserve Bank .  I see this as an honor, a privilege,  and a \nresponsibility.  So, I’ll share some brief reflections based on  my own path.  \nLike many of your students, I have a n international background .  I was  born in \nScotland to Jamaican parents, and raised in New York City with frequent visits to \n \n2 See “Community Colleges and the Future of Higher Education” by Michael Patrick Rutter and Ste ven \nMintz in Inside Higher Ed  (March 2019): https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher -ed-\ngamma/community -colleges -and-future -higher -education . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n Jamaica.  I see exposure to different cultures as something to joyfully embrace  and \nlearn from  – and a source of strength for naviga ting the inevitable challenges each of us \nencounters.  \nMy parents certainly passed on their love of learning , and  I see myself as  a \nlifelong learner .  I hope you see yourselves that way, too.  While many things interested \nme early on, I took courses in econ omics in college , and found it really appealed to me  \n– including a fascination with  how analyzing data could help us understand the complex \neconomy.  Studying economics i n grad uate school, my experience s visiting Jamaica  \nand other countries  led me to speci alize in  the international aspects of \nmacroeconomics , with a focus on econometrics, or data analysis .   \nLike my father, I began my career in academia as a  professor, engaged in \nresearch and teaching, and becoming increasingly interested in using my experti se to \nhelp improve public policies .  I eventually moved to academic administration – as dean \nof a public policy school , and then provost.  Then f ourteen  months ago , I started in this \nposition, giving me the opportunity to use my background and experiences now as a \npolicymaker , serving the public interest.    \nI know many Bunker Hill students are the first in their families to attend college , \nand recognize  how helpful  it was for me to have parents and other family members with \nadvanced degrees .  Observing the m made it easier for me to see myself as a \nprofessional , possibly in a  leadership position  one day .  But while my family saw m y \npotential, I can tell you that not everyone in society s aw a small, very young -looking \nblack woman as likely to become an econom ist, a professor, a dean, a provost, or \npresident  of a Federal Reserve Bank .   \nThere is much more we can , and should,  do to look for  and nurture  the potential \nin people from all background s, including – perhaps especially – people  who look \ndifferent from those  traditional ly seen in particular roles .  We should avoid making \nassumptions about  the capabilities and possibilities that lie behind mere appearance.   \nThis mi ndset influenced my work as a faculty member , and is one factor that led me to \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n academic administration.  It is also critical for the Fed  – as I’ve said , a healthy economy \nneeds ideas, energy , and  participation from everyone.   \nI also recognize that I’ve been blessed with considera ble support throughout my \neducation and career.  I’ve benefitted from having a family – parents, as well as a \nhusband and now adult children  – who supported and encouraged me along the way.  I \nhad instructors , advisors , and mentors too; and the best ones w ere those who \nchallenged me the most.   I am very grateful to each of them . \nBut not everyone has that level of support , which  makes the work you do here at \nBunker Hill all the  more important.  People like to talk about trailblazers opening doors, \nbut a n image that resonates with me  involves  the responsibility , once through  that door, \nto hold it open  for excellent, high -potential  people.  I want to congratulate and commend \nyou for opening doors – and holding them open – for your students.   \nThis is a con vocation, a gathering to mark a beginning of a new school year.  \nBeginnings are important, but I suspect you and your students are focused on the entire \njourney – including its resolution.   I’m reminded of the extraordinary Jamaican sprinter \nUsain Bolt, wh o said “There are better starters than me, but I’m a strong finisher.”   A \nchallenging start to a journey – whether a sprint or a career – does not determine the \noutcome.  What matters is staying the course and finishing .  And to be clear, I do not \nsee the most important journeys in life as races.  I wish you great success in your own \njourneys as you support your students throughout this school year and beyond.   \n \nCreating a Vibrant, Inclusive Economy – Together  \nThe Fed  works  to foster a vibrant, inclusive economy, and we do that i n a much \nwider range of ways than most people realize – monetary policy , economic research, \nfinancial stability work and bank supervision , community and economic development \nactivities , and ini tiatives and infrastructure related to payments, technology, and finance.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Today I want to mention a few aspects of the Boston Fed’s work that show the \nbreadth and depth of our efforts to  support a strong economy  characterized by equitable \nopportunity .   \nThe Boston Fed has a reputation for analytical rigor  and analysis of current \necono mic data.  This is absolutely vital for policy work – as is our long -term research on \na variety of empirical and theoretical topics.  We hope our nonpartisan, unbiased \nresearch is a public service.  Of course, we study a range of topics related to credit, \nemployment, and inflation.  But our work is much broader than that.   \n Unfortunately, we can see through our own research that not everyone has the \nsame opportunities to contribute to our economy  – which limits i ts strength and \nvibrancy .  We are committed to doing our part to help address this challenge  by \nfostering inclusion.  Key  ways we do this are by examining factors that could limit  \npeople participating in  the economy going forward , and by collaborati ng with other \norganizations.  \nAs part of that work, the Boston Fed has a decades -long history of studying \nwealth disparities  for groups and places .  We believe better understanding these gaps \ncan expand opportunities, making them more equitably available, help bring more \npeople into the workforce , and stren gthen economic growth and competitiveness.  \nIn this context , the Boston Fed recently launched a multi -year research initiative \nto explore wealth disparities in Greater Boston and across Massachusetts.   It’s a \ncomplex issue, and we aren’t taking it on oursel ves.  Our community partners include \nthe Boston Foundation, the Barr Foundation, Eastern Bank Foundation, and the Greater \nBoston Chamber of Commerce.3 \n \n3 See Federal Reserve Bank of Boston press release , “Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and community \npartners laun ch research effort to explore wealth divides ” (April 2022 ): https://www.bostonfed.org/news -\nand-events/press -releases/2022/boston -fed-and-community -partners -launch -research -effort -to-explore -\nwealth -divides.aspx    \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n The initial priorities for this work include measuring family wealth and exploring \nwealth differences between racial -ethnic groups and across geographies .  We want  to \nbetter understand why certain disparities persist .  We hope the  findings  will be used by \na broad group of public, p rivate, and nonprofit organizations to develop solutions that \npromote equity in wealth – which is a key foundation for greater economic opportunity.  \nI’d also briefly mention the Boston Fed’s work to support community economic \ndevelopment, expanding opportu nities for everyone to participate in the economy.  \nSince 2014, our staff have focused on encouraging local efforts to find economic \nresurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long -term struggles.   We call it \n“Working Places .”4   \n This initi ative , started in 2014, is based on research that showed that an essential \nelement of place -based economic resilience is cross -sector collaboration among local \nindividuals willing to take on shared leadership.  Now in 30 communities across 5 \nstates, t eams of lo cal leaders  choose a shared goal for improving the economy that \nbenefits low -income people , and then develop and implement strategies to address \nthem .  They  focus on issues such as  workforce development, poverty reduction, \naffordable housing, and removing barriers to entrepreneurship. This initiative  has helped \nfoster collaboration among state government, the private sector, philanthropy, local \norganizations, and residents. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts.  \nThis ongoing work demonstrates  our belief in the power of collaborative networks .   \nAs I talk to people in all parts of our region, I hear that people really do want to \ncollaborate and work together to solve problems.  Efforts large and small are essential, \nand in combination they can make a real difference and build resilience.  In this, I’m \nreminded of the Kenyan proverb, that  “Sticks in a bundle are unbreakable.”  \nI think about all the working people, leaders, and organizations I’ve visited with \nover the 14 month s I’ve been in this job.  And in addition to being so impressed with \n \n4 Learn more about the  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston ’s “Working Places ” initiatives : \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n what they are doing, I’m also incredibly encouraged that local, tangible efforts are \nadding up to real strength in our region.  I’d like to tell you about a few of them , and  \nhope  you find  them inspiring and motivating, as I do.  \nOften these efforts focus on the basic, practical things that get in the way of \nparticipation in the job market and economy – whether skillsets and training, or reliable \nand affordable childcare, or transportation, or the ability to find housing that’s affordable \nin the vicinity of a job or school.  It is important for us to celebrate these sorts of efforts, \nlearn from them,  and build on them!  \n• A first, obvious example would be right here – the way community colleges give \npeople options to affordably develop skills to lead better lives. I note in your \nmission statement that “The College provides inclusive and affordable access to \nhigher education, supports the success of all students, and forges vibrant \npartnerships an d pathways...”  And I know you work so hard to provide \n“wraparound” services that help smooth the issues that may be getting in the way \nof students continuing to progress.  I also note the range of partnerships with \norganizations you’ve built, to give your  students options and opportunities.  As \nsomeone who thinks about the economy’s health all the time, I just want to thank \nand commend you for that vital work.  \n• Another  example – another stick strengthening that bundle – is in Connecticut, \nwhere East Hartfor d CONNects has launched a Professional Skills Academy with \nthe goal of connecting residents with local employers – in the words of their \ndirector, trying to fill the gap between folks saying, “We need training,” and \nemployers saying, “We will hire anyone a s long as they’re career -ready.”  A \nrelated effort recruits underrepresented groups into manufacturing with training, \nand stipends that make it possible for people to take time for that  training.  \n• Other examples touch on the critical economic issue of chil d care, which gives \noptions to parents who want or need to participate in the workforce .  To that end, \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, August  31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n Leaders for Equitable Local Economies5 is an outgrowth of our Working Places \neffort , and in Fitchburg, the team has implemented a bilingual child  care \nentrepreneur training program to help support individuals in opening up their own \nsmall businesses in childcare.  The program has 80 graduates and started its fifth \ncohort this month!  Similarly, the Waterbury, Connecticut  Working Places  team \nhas provided training for residents looking to open licensed , home -based child  \ncare facilities.   So far, 15 new facilities have opened.  \nThere are so many other examples I could mention, from longstanding initiatives \nsuch as the public -private partnership facilitated by the Boston Private Industry Council \nfor the Boston Fed and many other employers to hire summer interns  from Boston \nPublic Schools , to very recent  ones such as the Boston Fed ’s Economic Research \nImmersion pilot p rogram this past summer  for a small number of community college \nstudents – most from here at Bunker Hill.6  As I go around the region and meet with the \nwide range of the Fed’s stakeholders, people I talk to cite many challenges in our \neconomy in New England,  and also many  strengths and opportunities.  I find the se \nstories of people and organizations making a difference to be inspiring and so gratifying . \nWhat you do, what your students do , what we at the Boston Fed are doing , and \nwhat people are doing across N ew England are all part of making our economy resilient , \nvibrant,  and inclusive .  Efforts like these are adding to that Kenyan proverb ’s bundle and \nhelping to make it unbreakable . \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn conclusion, I’ll just say tha t it is so essential that all in society have \nopportunities to enhance skills.

        "content": "“Perspectives on the Economy \nand Policymaking” \n \n  \nSusan M. Collins \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n  \nSeptember 6, 2023 \n \n  \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or  the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n \n                        \n   Remarks as Prepared for Deliver y\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n \n   \nKey Takeaways  \n1. Holistic Assessment:  Collins reviews a wide range of information to assess the evolving \neconomy.  She looks for patterns and trends showing sustained reductions in inflation, and progress \non the underlying goal of bringing demand and supply back into better balance.  She notes that price \nstability is essential for a well-functioning econ omy and an important precondition for maximum \nemployment that is sustainable over time.  \n2. Current Indications:  Strong demand relative to supply has been a key factor driving higher \ninflation.  While we are seeing some signs of moderation, demand continues to outpace supply, \ncreating price pressures.  Core inflation shows modest and relatively recent moderation.  There are \npromising developments, but given continued strength in  demand, Collins’ view is that it is just too \nearly to take the recent improvements as evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to the 2% \ntarget.  \n3. Patience and Data Dependence:  This phase of monetary policy calls for patience and holistic \ndata dependence.  One reason is the difficulty of extrac ting signal from noise in the data.  Another is \nincreased uncertainty about the timing and ultimate impact on the economy of policy tightening to date \n– including some reasons to expect longer lags than normal due to some unique aspects of the \npandemic recovery.    \n4. Staying Resolute:  Importantly, patience does not mean indecision, or a change in commitment to \nthe 2 percent target and to achievi ng price stability in a reasonable amount of time.  Collins expects \nwe’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for so me time.  And while we may be near, or even at, the \npeak, further tightening could be warranted, depending on incoming data.  We are well positioned to \nproceed patiently, carefully, yet deliberately; re cognizing the risks while remaining resolute.  \n5. Optimistic While Realistic: Continued restrictive monetary policy should temper demand further, \nto bring it into better balance with supply – however,  Collins does not believe a significant slowdown is \nrequired.  She remains realistic about the risks and uncertainties around the outlook, while optimistic \nthat price stability is achievable with an orderly  slowdown and only a modest unemployment rate \nincrease – ideally preserving some of the cu rrent favorable labor market dynamics.  \n6. Engagement and Collaboration: The Fed’s mandate and concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy \nlead us to study economic issues that prevent people from participating in the economy or workforce, \nas well as the gaps in wealth accumulation and prosperity.  Collins will continue to prioritize hearing \nfrom those in a wide range of roles, who make up and shape our region’s economy.  The Boston Fed \nwill continue working to support a vibrant, inclusive economy full of opportunity, working \ncollaboratively with organizations across the region to understand and address challenges.    \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n1 \n Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be with you, at this podium where the New \nEngland Council hosts so many distinguished leaders.  I’d like to thank Jim Brett for \ninviting me, early on, to speak with you.   \nI have been looking forward to this, because of my great appreciation for the \nCouncil, and its members, working to k eep New England’s economy vibrant.  As a \nmacroeconomist and former dean of a public poli cy school, I appreciate your focus on \nthe ways policymakers, and organizations ac ross New England, can collaborate in the \npublic interest.  \nI also appreciate the New England Council’s non-partisan nature, and the \nbreadth of industries and sector s you work in.  This an extraordinary region, in part \nbecause of that range – and t he brainpower, innovation, and character New Englanders \nbring to the table. \nMy thanks as well to Jim, for contributi ng his insights over many years to an \nadvisory council made up of sm all- and medium-sized busine sses we convene at the \nFed every quarter. \nToday, I’ll start with a bit of  context about our work at the Fed.  Then, I’ll share \nsome of my current views on the economy and monetary policy.  Finally, I’ll comment on \nsome of the challenges and opportunities  ahead, and the roles the Boston Fed and \nothers can play.  Then, I’ll be happy to take ques tions.  But first, my standard disclaimer: \nThese perspectives are my own; I’m not speaking for any other Federal Reserve policymakers.  \n Context: Roles and Responsibilities Entrusted to the Fed  \nI like to say our work at the Fed is all about supporting a vibrant, inclusive \neconomy that works for everyone, not just so me people.  As you know, the strength of \nan economy has many dimensions – so the Fed is involved in a number of activities, all \nin the public interest.   \nBut let me underline an important dist inction, which is not always well-\nunderstood.  The Federal Reserve’s activities are in monetary – not fiscal – policy.  At \nthe Fed, we’re entrusted with monetary  policymaking – in particular, setting short-term \ninterest rates that ultimately  affect the availability of  money and credit for businesses \nand households.  In this, we are guided by our dual mandate from Congress: stable \nprices and maximum employment.  So we spend a lot of time analyzing economic \nconditions – using data, doing research, and listening to stakeholders locally and \nnationally.  \nThe economy also needs reliable credit, and payment systems.  The Fed is \nentrusted with responsibilities regarding th e safety, soundness, and stability of the \nbanking and financial systems; and we serve as  a lender of last resort to financial \ninstitutions.  We also provide back-end infrastructure to the banking system and the U.S. Treasury, ranging from currency and coin circulation, to various ways to transfer \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n2 \n funds electronically.  For many years we  have been involved in innovating to make \npayments systems more effective and efficient.   \n The Economy, the Outlook, and Monetary Policy \nI’ll turn, now, to sharing some of my cu rrent views on the ec onomy, the outlook, \nand monetary policy.  Our focu s at the Fed remains bringi ng inflation down to our 2 \npercent target.\n1  Price stability is essential fo r a well-functioning economy and an \nimportant precondition for maxi mum employment that is sustainable over time – so \nreducing inflation relates to both parts of our dual mandat e from Congress.  And I \ncontinue to hear, in travels around New Engl and, about the toll from high inflation on \nhouseholds – especially those with lower income s, struggling to make ends meet – and \non businesses, often as they grapple with higher costs and more co mplex planning and \ninvestment decisions. \nI like to give my bottom-line up front, and in my view, this phase of our policy \ncycle requires patience, and holistic data asse ssment, while we stay the course.  I \nexpect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive le vels for some time.  And while we may be \nnear, or even at, the peak for policy rate s, further tightening could be warranted, \ndepending on the incoming data.  Pa tience will give us time to better separate “signal” \nfrom “noise” as we assess available data; and to balance risks, as t he effects of tighter \npolicy continue to work through the economy.  \nLet me briefly explain my  rationale. Since I see holistic data assessment as \nparticularly important in t he current context, I’ve s hared a handout with some charts \nshowing just a few of the m any data series I review, as  part of the wide range of \ninformation I use to assess t he evolving economy.   \n Current Economic Conditions \nIn reviewing economic data, I look  for patterns and trends that show both \nsustained reductions in inflation, and pr ogress on the underlying goal of bringing \ndemand and supply back into better balance.  I’ll start there, because strong demand \nrelative to supply has been a key factor driv ing higher inflation.  While we are seeing \nsome signs of moderation, demand cont inues to outpace supply, creating price \npressures.  \nThe black line in Figure 1  shows how the level of real  GDP (or the production of \ngoods and services adjusted for inflation) has evolved relative to trend , shown by the \n \n1 “The FOMC judges that low and stable inflation at the rate of 2 percent per year, as measured  by the annual \nchange in the price index for personal consumption  expenditures,  is most consistent  with achievement  of both \nparts of the dual mandate.”  https://www.federalreserve.g ov/monetarypolicy/monetary ‐policy‐what‐are‐its‐goals‐\nhow‐does‐it‐work.htm  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n3 \n dotted line.  The trend is an estimate of su stainable output for the economy over time.2   \nA key takeaway is that GDP remains abov e trend — a sign of demand continuing to \noutstrip supply.  Many forecasters expect continued above-trend grow th this quarter.  \nGDP growth has been supported, important ly, by resilient household consumption \nexpenditures – shown by the light blue lin e – which is the largest component of \naggregate demand.  \nWhat about inflation, in this context of demand still outpacing supply?  There are \nmany inflation indicators to watch, of  course.  Focusing on the Fed’s preferred \nmeasure,3 Figure 2,  Panel A  shows that on a year-over-year  basis, total inflation (the \ndark blue line) has come down significantly  from its peak but remains somewhat \nelevated.  However, core inflation (the light  blue line) shows considerably less progress, \nalthough with some improvement in recent m onths.  While the core measure excludes \nthe important but volatile f ood and energy components,  it tends to bette r predict future \ninflation.     \nI’m showing these two panels side by side so you can see how the monthly \ninflation data – including core inflation, shown in Figure 2, Panel B  – tend to be more \nvariable than measures on a year-over-year bas is.  This variability has increased since \nthe pandemic, a point I’ll return to in a mo ment, and is one reason for being patient in \nassessing the data.  \nFigure 3 Panels A, B, and C  show the three main components of core inflation.  \nSince the components behave quite differently, looking at them se parately helps to \nbetter assess price pressures.  These charts  include 3- , 6-, and 12- month annualized \nchanges. The shorter horizons highlight recent  developments – but are typically more \nvariable, or “noisier.”  Lookin g at multiple time horizons c an help paint a fuller picture of \nhow inflation is evolving.   \nPanel A shows that the moderation in co re inflation has come mainly from a \nsignificant decline in the core goods  sector, where the resolution of supply chain \nbottlenecks has helped to better align dem and with supply.  Panel B shows that shelter  \ninflation, though still high, has slowed recently  as well: the 3-month change is below the \n6-month.  As moderati on in new market rents continues to pass through, this decline will \nlikely continue.  However, as shown in Panel C, core services  price inflation, excluding \nshelter, has slowed only modestly so far.   This component accounts for about 55 \npercent of core inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption \nexpenditures (PCE).        \n \n2 This trend assumes real GDP growth of 1.8% per year. The shaded bar in the chart represents  the pandemic  \nrecession.  \n \n3 The Personal Consumption  Expenditures  or PCE index.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n4 \n So, there are promising developments, but given the continued strength in \ndemand, my view is that it is  just too early to take the recent improvements as evidence \nthat inflation is on a sust ained path back to 2 percent.  \nI’ll next turn briefly to the labor market.  There too, demand continues to outstrip \nsupply overall – a very familiar refrain in much of New England and across the country, \nfor some time now – but we are s eeing evidence of improved alignment.  Panel A of \nFigure 4  shows that payroll employment conti nues to grow above trend, but has been \nslowing.  Lower voluntary quits and lower, though still high, job vacancies (not shown) \nare also consistent with a cooli ng but resilient labor market.  \nOn the labor supply side, we’ve seen some recent increases in labor force \nparticipation, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25-54) as shown in Panel B.    \nIt is encouraging that more people are entering the labor force, which is the reason why \nthe unemployment rate ticked up to 3.8 percent in August — notably, a level that is still \nvery low by historical standards.  \nI also review disaggregated labor ma rket data, recognizing that aggregate \nnumbers do not show the wide range of experi ences across groups of people, sectors, \nand places.  For example, Figure 5 shows the persistent dispar ities in unemployment – \nfor different racial and ethnic groups in panel A, and for people with different education \nlevels in panel B.  I’ll have more to say about such disparities, in a moment. \nOverall, then, rebalancing demand and supply in the labor market has some way \nto go.  In particular, Figure 6 shows wage inflation, measur ed here by the Employment \nCost Index or ECI on a quarterly and yearly  basis.  Wage growth remains elevated in \nthe current high inflat ion environment.  Recognizing that  workers benefit from increases \nin their real wages, or purchasing power, I look fo rward to returning to an environment \nwith wage growth consistent with the 2 percent inflation target.4 \nContinued restrictive monetar y policy should temper demand further to bring it \ninto better balance with supply – however, im portantly, I do not believe a significant \nslowdown is required.  I have described myself  for some time as a “realistic optimist” – \nrealistic about the risks and uncertainties around a baseline outlook, while optimistic \nbecause the resilience I see leads me to believe  price stability is achievable with an \norderly slowdown and only a modest unemploym ent rate increase – ideally preserving \nsome of the favorable labor supply dynamics.  \nMonetary Policy Lags and My Outlook \nI’ll shift now to a brief assessment of the impact of monetary policy actions to \ndate, and my outlook.   \n \n4 Fed Chairman  Jerome Powell has noted, “To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to \nbe sustainable,  it needs to be consistent  with 2 percent inflation.”   (see \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newse vents/speech/powell20221130a.htm ). \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n5 \n As Figure 7 shows, starting in March 2022, we raised the federal funds rate \ntarget by five and a quarter per centage points in just 18 mont hs, the fastest policy rate \nincrease in 40 years.  While t he effects of higher interest ra tes were almost immediately \nevident in the housing sector, they have been slower to show through to broader \nindicators of activity, such as GDP and labor market statistics.  \nTypically, monetary policy actions are es timated to meaningfully affect broader \nmeasures of economic activity with a lag of four to six quarters.5  But there is \nconsiderable variation around this estima te, and special factors in the pandemic \nrecovery are likely making t hese lags longer than usual.  \nIn particular, policy tightening ha s occurred amidst sound business and \nhousehold fundamentals, compar ed to previous hiking cycles – likely implying a longer  \ntime for tighter credit conditi ons to work through the economy.   For example, many firms \nhad refinanced when interest rate s were very low, somewhat insulating their investment \nplans from higher rates.  And households th at accumulated excess savings during the \npandemic have needed to borrow less than usual so far, to finance expenditures.    \nSo monetary policy may take longer than no rmal to affect the broader economy.  \nBut given that policy is clearly in restrictiv e territory, I do expect to see slowing growth \nby the end of this year and throughout 2024.   And there are already some signs \nconsistent with this outlook.  Firms’ cash levels are returning to pre-pandemic trends, \nand households’ excess sa vings are declining.6  Demand should slow as spending \nbecomes more interest sensitive.   \nThe goal is an orderly slowdown that be tter aligns demand with supply, which is \nessential to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to target.  \n \nImplications for Monetary Policy in an Uncertain Environment \nI’ll conclude my discussion of the economy by highlighting some considerations \nthat underpin my outlook.  The economic ci rcumstances surrounding the pandemic and \nrecovery have been, and continue to be, highly unusual, with implications for monetary \npolicy.  This complex topic is likely to be a long-term focus for anal ysis and research.   \nI’ve flagged two key dimensions:  First, we’r e in a period where it is difficult to \nextract the signal from the noise  in the data.  As I noted, some data, such as monthly \n \n5 These lags appear in various estimates  of the effects of monetary  policy, for instance those surveyed by Ramey \n(Ramey, V.A., 2016; \"Macroeconomic  Shocks and Their Propagation,\"  in: J. B. Taylor & Harald Uhlig [ed.], \nHandbook  of Macroeconomics , edition 1, volume 2, chapter 2, pages 71‐162, Elsevier). A more recent study \nconfirming  significant  lags in the effects is Romer and Romer (Christina  D. Romer & David H. Romer, 2023; \"Does \nMonetary  Policy Matter? The Narrative  Approach  after 35 Years,\" NBER Working Papers 31170, National Bureau of \nEconomic  Research,  Inc.). \n \n6 Some households,  including those at the lower end of the income distribution,  have likely already depleted any \nexcess savings.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n6 \n PCE inflation, are unusually volatile.7  Second, there is increased uncertainty about the \ntiming and ultimate impact on the economy fr om policy tightening to date.  Reasons \ninclude the unusually sound initial business and househ old fundamentals, and the \nunusually rapid initial pace of tightening.   \nThe risk of inflation staying higher fo r longer must now be weighed against the \nrisk that an overly restrictive stance of moneta ry policy will lead to a greater slowdown in \nactivity than is needed to restore price stab ility.  This context calls for a patient and \ncareful, but deliberate, approach to policy, al lowing time to assess the effects of policy \nactions to date, and then acting appropria tely.  Importantly, patience does not mean \nindecision, or a change in the commitment to the 2 percent target, but rather time to \nensure that the economy is on a clear tr ajectory to achieve price stability. \nOverall, we are well positioned to proceed ca utiously in this uncertain economic \nenvironment, recognizing the risks while re maining resolute and data-dependent, with \nthe flexibility to adjust as conditions warrant. \n A Vibrant, Inclusive Economy  \nI started with comments about t he strengths of Ne w England.  I’d like to close by \nalluding to some of the challenges  I hear about, too – and some of the things \norganizations like yours, and mine, are doing about them.  \nThe privilege and respons ibility of policymaking make engagement with \nstakeholders essential.  So I will continue to pr ioritize taking cross-sector visits to each \nNew England state, and heari ng from those in a wide range of roles, who make up and \nshape our region’s economy (see Figure 8 ). \nAgain, our domain at the F ed is monetary, not fiscal,  policy.  But our mandate \nand our concern for a vibrant, inclusive econom y bring our focus to the challenges that \nprevent people from participat ing in the economy or the workforce – real economic \nissues like childcare, housing, climate, and infrastructure, such as transportation and \nbroadband.  And like many of you, we worry about the gaps in wealth accumulation and \nprosperity by group and place.\n8   \n \n7 Month‐to‐month consumer  spending patterns have also been somewhat  unusual and continue to evolve, \ncomplicating  seasonal adjustment.    \n \n8 The Boston Fed has a decades‐long history of studying wealth disparities  for groups and places.  We believe \nbetter understanding  these gaps can expand opportunities,  making them more equitably  available,  help bring \nmore people into the workforce,  and strengthen  economic  growth and competitiveness.   A healthy economy \nneeds the best ideas, energy, and participation  from everyone  – with the opportunity  to work hard, contribute,  \nand prosper. In this context, the Boston Fed ‐ working with community  partners ‐ recently launched a multi‐year \nresearch initiative to explore wealth disparities  in Greater Boston and across Massachusetts.  Initial priorities for \nthis work include measuring  family wealth and exploring  wealth differences  between racial‐ethnic groups and \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n7 \n These are very real challenges.  But I remain optimistic about what we all, \ntogether, can accomplish when we care, co llaborate, study, and act.  Here are a few \nexamples.   \nMany parts of New England that were onc e centers for manufac turing or natural \nresources have faced long-term challenges.  Ou r Working Places initiative, started in \n2014 under my predecessor Eric Rosengren, is based on research showing that an \nessential element of place-based economic resurgence is local, cross-sector  \ncollaboration.  Now in 30 communities across 5 states, teams of local leaders choose a \nshared goal for improving the economy t hat benefits low-inco me people, and then \ndevelop and implement strategies.  The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts – but not financially.  The real wo rk is in local ingenuity and commitment.\n9  \nLack of affordable childcare is a very real economic issue across New England \nand nationally.  Childcare gives options to par ents who want or need to participate in the \nworkforce.  As an outgrowth of our Worki ng Places effort, a team in Fitchburg has \nimplemented a bilingual chil dcare entrepreneur training program to help support \nindividuals in opening up their own small businesses in childcare.  It has 80 graduates \nand just started its fifth cohort.10   \nClimate change is on many business and government leaders’ minds, and the \nFed’s responsibilities make it important and prudent for us to study the issues.  For \nexample, our recent research examines pot ential costs related to climate change for \nMassachusetts cities and towns – and ultimate ly taxpayers.  We find that per capita \nlocal spending could grow significantly in  the decades ahead, with hotter and stormier \nweather increasing the cost of public works,  government administrat ion, operation of \nschools, and other public services.11 \nLast but not least, I mentioned earlier the F ed’s work on payments.  It wasn’t that \nlong ago that paper checks had to be flown around t he country to settle at the bank they \nwere drawn on – a slow, costly  necessity.  The Boston Fed and others helped pioneer \ndigital check imaging, and ex panded automated clearing – and more recently, creation \nof an entirely new instant-payments infrastr ucture to help banks of all sizes meet \n \nacross geographies.  We want to better understand  why certain disparities  persist, and hope the findings will be \nused by a broad group of public, private, and nonprofit  organizations  to develop solutions.  \n \n9 Learn more about Working Places at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx  \n \n10 Learn more at https://www.bostonfed.org/work ingplaces/news/2022/tackling ‐the‐child‐care‐crisis‐lele‐\nteammates ‐see‐child‐care‐training‐need‐fill‐it.aspx .  And similarly, the Waterbury,  Connecticut  Working Places \nteam has provided training for residents looking to open licensed, home‐based childcare facilities, opening 15 new \nfacilities so far.  The vision and effort is local, but organizations  like ours can help spark or support the progress. \n \n11 See the summary  by Larry Bean and the study by Bo Zhao: https://www.bostonfed.org/news ‐and‐\nevents/news/2023/01/price ‐tag‐on‐climate‐change‐bo‐zhao‐report‐boston‐fed‐massachusetts.aspx  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time, \nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n8 \n customer needs.

Efforts large and small, in combination, can \nmake a real difference.   \nWe will continue, at the Boston Fed, work ing to serve the public interest and \nsupport a vibrant, inclusive economy full of  opportunity.

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nSeptember 22, 2023 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal O pen Market Committee.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00  A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\n \n    \nKey Takeaways  \n1. Price stability is essential for a well -functioning economy , and an important precondition for \nmaximum employment that is sustain able over time.   \nCollins  continue s to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too -high inflation. The \nfocus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to the 2 percent target.  \n2. While r ecent inflation readings have been encouraging , inflation remains too high. Some \nimportant components of inflation  have yet to show sustained improvement.   \nAlthough still elevated , inflation is down from its earlier peak. However, m ost of the moderation in core \ninflation has come from a decline in goods  inflation. Shelter  inflation has also moderated recently , and will \nlikely ease further . However, inflation in core  services excluding shelter  (over half of the Fed’s  preferred \ninflati on measure ) has yet to show improvement  consistent with price stability.   \n3. Collins fully supports the FOMC’s attentiveness to inflation risks and commitment to price \nstability .  \nSustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming into better balance with supply across the \neconomy.  While t here is some evidence this realignment is underway, especially in the labor market, \neconomic activity continues to be above trend  and it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a \nsustainable tr ajectory back to target . Collins  agree s with the policy guidance in the median SEP projections  \nwhich show rates  staying higher, and for longer, than previous projections had suggested ; and further \ntightening is certainly not off the table.  \n4. This phase of policymaking requires considerable patience, to extract the signal from noisy  data \nand to allow some  temporary  factors to play out. Collins is realistic about risks , but optimistic \nabout restoring price stability with an orderly realignment of demand with supply .  \nThe economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be, \nhighl y unusual. This phase of monetary policy requires patience. Collins is a “realistic optimist ” – realistic \nabout the uncertainties, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with only a modest increase in the \nunemployment rate. She believes  the pathway to achieving this outcome has widened.  \n5. Across Maine  (and New England) , local leadership efforts are addressing economic challenges \nand promoting resurgence.   \nThere are many dimensions to economic prosperity  – so the Fed has a broad  portfolio , including \nencouraging local initiatives  to foster  economic resurgence  in areas facing long -term struggles . An \nessential element  is cross -sector collaboration among local individuals. In Maine, there are six such  \n“Working Places”  efforts , and t he Fed  simply helps the local network s emerge and flourish. Collaborating \nto improv e opportunities for people and places to not be left behin d – but rather join in the economy – is \ngood economics, good citizenship, and good business . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Good morning. It is a pleasure being with you. I am always grateful for the \nopportunity to meet with Mainers, no matter the location, and have been to Maine \nmultiple times. In fact, I’ve made a point of visiting all the New England states in this role \n– and will continue to do so.  \nI’ll start by thanking two people. First is Jim Roche, president of the Maine \nBankers’ Association. We appreciate his continued engagement with us at the Boston \nFed, as we all work to support a safe and sound banking system, whic h is so essential \nto a vibrant and inclusive economy. Second, I want to thank Jeanne Hulit, president and \nCEO of Maine Community Bancorp. Jeanne is of course a member of your association’s \nexecutive committee. She’s also a member of the Boston Fed’s board of directors. We \nso appreciate the insights into Maine and New England business conditions she shares \nas a member of our board.  \nIn the time we have today, I’ll make some initial remarks, before taking a few \nquestions. Of course, I’ll share my views about t he economic outlook and monetary \npolicy. Then I’ll provide a few perspectives on banking in New England and in particular \nMaine – highlighting the importance of banks of all sizes to a vibrant, inclusive \neconomy. I’ll end with a few points about the Fed’s work across the region, and our \nshared opportunities to collaborate in the public interest.  \n \nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy  \nI’ll start with some of my current views on the economy, the outlook, and \nmonetary policy – especially given the Federal O pen Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) \ndecision on policy rates this week.1 But first, my standard disclaimer: the views I \nexpress are my own; I’m not speaking for any other Fed policymaker.  \nOur focus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to our 2 percent t arget.2 \nPrice stability is essential for a well -functioning economy, and an important precondition \n \n1 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230920a.htm  \n2 “The FOMC judges that low and stable inflation at the rate of 2 percent per year, as measured by the \nannual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n for maximum employment that is sustainable over time – so reducing inflation relates to \nboth parts of our dual mandate from Congress. And as I travel around  the district, I \ncontinue to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too -high \ninflation. On one of my trips to Maine I recall hearing about residents who were unable \nor unwilling to move within the state to take job offers, due in pa rt to the rising costs of \nfuel, shelter, transportation, and other necessities.  \nHowever, there has been some promising news. Although still too high, inflation \nis down from its earlier peak. And there is some evidence demand and supply are \nrealigning, espe cially in labor markets, which is needed to reduce the upward pressure \non prices. Importantly, the current policy phase requires patience , allowing time to better \nseparate the signal from the noise in the data.  \nI’d like to say a bit about the FOMC’s decis ion earlier this week, and the related \neconomic projections from policymakers. As widely expected, the FOMC left interest \nrates unchanged. However, the policy statement makes clear that this decision need not \nimply having reached the peak federal funds rat e in this tightening cycle. Future \ndecisions will depend on a holistic assessment of incoming data.  \nThe FOMC also released an updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) \nprepared by all the Fed Board’s governors and Reserve Bank presidents, which \ncertainly reinforces the statement’s message. The median expectation for the federal \nfunds rate in the SEP features one more 25 basis -point increase this year and, relative \nto the June projections, a more gradual process of policy normalization in 2024 and ’25.   \nThis federal funds rate projection underscores the Committee’s focus on \nrestoring price stability w hile also recognizing the other part of our mandate: maximum \nsustainable employment. Indeed, the median SEP forecast expects a normalization of \nlabor market conditions that contributes to inflation running at levels consistently close \nto target by 2025 to ‘26.  \n \nachievement of both parts of the dual mandate. ” \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary -policy -what -are-its-goals -how-does -it-work.htm  \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n I fully support the FOMC statement and agree with the policy guidance in the \nmedian SEP projections. I expect rates may have to stay higher, and for longer, than \nprevious projections had suggested, and further tightening is certainly not off the tabl e. \nPolicymakers will stay the course to achieve the Fed’s mandate.    \n My views on policy reflect my assessment of current conditions and the outlook \nfor inflation and real activity. I noted earlier that there are some promising signs that \ninflation is mod erating and the economy rebalancing. But progress has not been linear \nand is not evenly distributed across sectors.  \nStarting with inflation, I’ll focus on so -called core inflation, which excludes the \nimportant but volatile food and energy components, beca use it is typically a better \ngauge of underlying trends than total inflation. Recent readings have been encouraging \n– but disaggregating the key components provides valuable insight into recent pricing \npatterns. In particular, doing so highlights that most  of the moderation in core inflation \nhas come from a noticeable decline in core goods  inflation, as supply bottlenecks have \nresolved. A second key component, shelter  inflation, has also moderated recently, and \nwill likely ease further as slower growth in n ew market rents is reflected in the overall \nindex. However, inflation in core  services excluding shelter , which accounts for over half \nof our preferred core inflation measure, has yet to show the sustained improvement that \nwould be consistent with price st ability.  \nSo while there have been promising developments, it is too soon to be confident \nthat inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to the 2 percent target. I’ll also note the \nimportance of caution in reading too much from individual data points, or even from a \nfew months of information. The monthly inflation data, for example, have always been \nnoisy. But the variability of core inflation has increased since the pandemic. \nConsiderable uncertainty remains around underlying inflation conditions. Extr acting \ntrends and patterns from noisy incoming data will take patience.  \nI’ve also noted that sustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming \ninto better balance with supply across the economy. Some signs that a broad \nrebalancing process is und erway can be found in the labor market – which is still \nresilient overall, but cooling. In particular, the pace of hiring has slowed, although it \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n remains above trend. Job vacancies have declined and quit rates are nearly down to \npre-pandemic levels. Also c ontributing to the labor market rebalancing is an \nimprovement in supply. Indeed, we’ve seen some encouraging recent increases in labor \nforce participation, especially for prime -age workers (those aged 25 -54).  \nOver time, labor market rebalancing should res ult in wage growth that reflects, in \naddition to productivity gains, cost -of-living increases consistent with the Fed’s 2 \npercent target. Such rebalancing should contribute to a moderation in inflation in the \ncontext of maximum sustainable employment.    \nThis brings me to my outlook for the economy. Monetary policy has tightened \nconsiderably to date, but economic activity has been resilient – and it may be taking \nlonger than usual to see the broader economic impact of monetary policy actions.  \nIn particular, demand may have been less sensitive to higher interest rates so \nfar, because policy tightening has occurred amidst business and household \nfundamentals that are sound compared with previous cycles. Many firms have been \ninsulated from the rate hi kes by extending the maturity of their debt when rates were \nlow, and because of higher profit margins. But cash levels are returning to pre -\npandemic norms and debt -market activity is picking up. In addition, households’ excess \nsaving accumulated during the  pandemic is declining, while reliance on credit card \nspending is rising. This all suggests that business and household spending are likely to \nbecome more interest sensitive, helping to temper demand growth and realign it with \nsupply.  \nI continue to expect that the full effects of monetary policy will eventually show \nthrough and place inflation on a sustainable trajectory back to 2 percent. But I’ll note \nthat the timing and ultimate impact of policy tightening to date remain uncertain. \nHistorical evidence is  largely based on experiences in which policy rates moved more \nslowly than in the current cycle.   \nIn all, the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have \nbeen, and continue to be, highly unusual, with important implications for polic y setting. \nAs I’ve said before, this phase of policy requires considerable patience, enabling \npolicymakers to better extract the correct signal from the incoming data, and allowing \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n some factors that have been supporting near -term activity to play out. The risk of \ninflation remaining persistently high must be weighed against the risk that activity will \nslow more than expected. I also recognize the potential for higher short -term rates to \nplace more pressure on some banks' balance sheets and reduce bank credi t provision \nmore than I anticipate.  \nI continue to be a “realistic optimist” – realistic about the uncertainties and risks \nto my baseline outlook, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly \nslowdown in activity, and only a modest un employment rate increase associated with \nsupply and demand in labor markets coming into better balance. Importantly, the \nongoing resilience I see in the economy and the progress on inflation so far lead me to \nbelieve that the pathway to achieving this desi rable outcome has widened.  \nPolicy remains well positioned to proceed cautiously in this uncertain economic \nenvironment, recognizing and balancing the risks while remaining resolute and data -\ndependent, with the flexibility to adjust policy appropriately as conditions warrant.  \n \nMaine’s Economy and Banking Sector  \nI’ll turn now from the national economy to Maine’s.  In my recent visits to your \nstate, I spoke with a range of people, and learned about some of the unique challenges \nand economic strengths. Challeng es include the fact that Maine has a population that is \nolder, and aging faster, than the New England region and the rest of the nation. That \nreality tends to reduce the availability of labor, which is something businesses large and \nsmall mentioned often.  \nAccess to affordable housing also remains a major issue. Maine employers told \nme about their difficulties finding and hiring workers for needed roles, in part because \nprospective employees are unable to find affordable housing in the area. And I know \nthat expanding access to broadband in Maine’s rural counties has been challenge, but \nremains a priority.  \nI’ve also learned about Maine’s many wonderful economic strengths. Among \nthem are the state’s rich natural resources – on land and in the Gulf of Maine – as well \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n as strong retail and healthcare industries, robust tourism and hospitality sectors, \nabundant small businesses, and a strong sense of community and pride of place.  \nAnother strength, of course, is Maine’s banking industry. Your banks employ as \nmany a s 9,000 Mainers, serving households and businesses across the state in \ncommunities large and small. Of course, banks face challenges, in addition to those in \nthe current interest rate environment. Evolving customer preferences require increasing \ninvestment  in technology, and you’re seeing increased margin pressure related to \ncompetition for deposits, and competition from new market entrants.    \nToday I want to recognize the critical role that banks of all sizes play in creating \nvibrant, inclusive economies. Community banks, like those in Maine, have remained \nresilient and continue to leverage the close working relationships they have within \nsmall er cities, towns, and rural areas. Community banks provide a critical source of \nfunding for small businesses. This was demonstrated, for example, during the \nimplementation of the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program, as \ncommunity banks played a  major role in ensuring those funds reached businesses.   \nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that a robust and dynamic banking system, \nalong with effective and efficient regulation and supervision, helps to ensure that banks \nof all sizes can meet the needs of households and businesses in every community \nthroughout our country, in good times and in bad. And I fully agree that we must \npreserve and build on these strengths, and that diversity.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve and the New England Region  \nFinally, let me say a bit about the Fed’s activities. I like to say that our \noverarching mission at the Boston Fed is supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that \nworks for everyone. As you know, an economy’s strength has many dimensions – so \nthe Fed has a broad portfolio of activities and engagements – all in the public interest – \nincluding monetary policymaking, economic research and analysis, bank supervision, \nfinancial stability work, serving as lender of last resort for banks, community and \neconomic development activities , and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments, \ntechnology, and finance. They all support our mission and our mandate.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n I’ll very briefly mention some of our work to support economic vibrancy in all \nareas of New England, with a goal of expanding o pportunities for everyone to \nparticipate in the economy. Since 2014, we have focused on encouraging local efforts to \nfind economic resurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long -term struggles – \nwe call it “Working Places.” It’s based on research  showing that an essential element of \nplace -based economic resilience is cross -sector collaboration, among local individuals \nwilling to take on shared leadership. In Maine, there are such local efforts in six areas: \nGreater Bangor, the Katahdin region, Lew iston -Auburn, Maine Highlands, Sagadahoc \nCounty, and in Washington County with the Passamaquoddy Tribe.   \nThe Fed’s work helps the local, collaborative networks emerge and flourish. We \nfind that people really do want to work together to solve problems. I s uspect that’s \nbecause improving opportunities for people and places to not be left behind – but rather \njoin in the economy – is good economics, good citizenship, and good business! I’m \nencouraged that local, tangible efforts like these are adding up to rea l strength in our \nregion. I know Maine’s bankers work to provide the services and credit that help \ncommunities prosper, and at the central bank we look forward to continuing to \ncollaborate with you in the public interest.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn conclu sion, I’ll say that the privilege and responsibility of a policymaking role \nlike mine makes frequent engagement with stakeholders essential. So I will continue to \nprioritize taking cross -sector visits to each New England state, and hearing from those \nin a wide range of roles, who make up and shape our economy and the financial \nsystem.  \nSince its inception 110 years ago and by its very design, the U.S. central bank \nhas deep and varied interactions with banks and bankers; ranging from safety and \nsoundness to payments infrastructure, to credit access and economic development. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with you to support the people and places of Maine, \nNew England, and the nation with a vibrant, inclusive economy and financial system.  \nThank you  again  for having me join you today .",

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n  \nOctober 11, 2023 \nWellesley , Massachusetts  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday , Octob er 11 , 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednesday, October 11, 2023  \n Key Takeaways  \n1. Collins highlighted three main forms of uncertainty that monetary policymakers confront, all present in the \npandemic era.  The first relates to data and measurement  – how accurately statistics describe the variables they \nintend to measure.  The second relates to relationships between key economic variables  that influence policy \ndecisions – examples include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics .  The third is related to \nunforeseen events,  such as pandemics, natural disasters, or geopolitical developments.     \n2. For policymaking, the appropriate response to uncertainty depends on its type as well as the context.  \nUncertainty can call for policy  to move unusually rapidly –  or to take a more wait -and-see approach.   In the current \npolicy cycle, this has contributed to different policy phases, starting with a period of holding rates low when pandemic -\nrelated risks were still high, followed by a peri od of aggressive moves, and then the current more gradual, patient \napproach to policy.  \n3. Some special factors have impacted the pandemic recovery that make it difficult to compare to previous business cycles, adding to the uncertainty.  Despite many expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained \nremarkably resilient to date.  Household balance sheets have been solid, partially due to savings accumulated during \nthe pandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated due in part to locking in fina ncing at previously low \nrates.  Factors like these have likely made the economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles, to \ndate.   \n4. With progress on inflation and continued elevated uncertainty, the FOMC appropriately shifted to a ne w, \nmore gradual and “patient” policymaking phase.   Though inflation levels are still too high, taking the time to \nholistically assess incoming information is warranted.  It reflects the fact that we are likely close to the peak of this \ntightening cycle, wi th the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely balanced with the risk of slowing \nactivity more than needed to achieve price stability.  Still, Collins expects we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels \nuntil we see evidence that infl ation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.  \n5. Collins remains realistic, but optimistic, about restoring price stability without a significant economic \ndownturn.  Overall, she continues to be realistic about the economic uncertainties and risks, but optimistic that price \nstability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and only a modest increase in the unemployment rate – \nan outcome consistent with both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate.  \n6. One key policy lesson, Collins suggests with th e benefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply \nshocks.   The pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers; and risk assessments, however difficult to \nmake, had to be made.   But Collins observes that the risk of widespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a \nstronger case than previously realized for insuring against too- high inflation by removing policy accommodation more \nquickly.   \n7. Collins also offered some takeaways to students about learning and careers.  She recommended a mindset \nof lifelong learning and seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives.  In working environments, \nshe also underlined the importanc e of gathering information broadly –  quantitative and qualitative – and intentionally \nhearing from a wide range of stakeholders, including voices that have not traditionally been “in the room.”  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n   Thank you for inviting me to be with you today.  It is such a pleasure to be on the \nWellesley campus with students, faculty, and community members.   \nBefore my remarks, there are a few people I would like to acknowledge.  First, \nthe late Marshall Goldman, whose legacy of insightful inquiry is rightly commemorated \nwith this annual lecture.  Second, the Wellesley economics department and your chair, \nCourtney Coile, for the invitation to deliver this year’s Goldman lecture.  Over the years, members of Wellesley’s economics faculty have had many substantive connections with \nme and also with the Federal Reserve System, and I want to express my appreciation \nfor your commitment to excellence, your intellectual curiosity, and your dedication to \nyour students.  I really must commend Wellesley as a whole, and certainly the \neconomics department, for sending into the world thoughtful, prepared, and very able \nwomen who have made an impact in so many fields –  not least, in economics and \nfinance.   \nLast but certainly not least, I want to acknowledge your president, Paula \nJohnson, and thank her for her leadership and, on a personal level, her friendship.  \nPaula and I got to know each other as undergraduates –  a few miles from here, and a \nfew years ago – and it has been so wonderful to see her many distinguished \ncontributions to societ y in the years since then, during her remarkable career in \nmedicine, public health, and higher education.  \n \nBrief Context  \nAllow me to preview what I’d like to cover today.  As you know, I’ve come to \nWellesley to speak about my role, and the Fed’s responsibi lities, in making policy –  in \nparticular, amidst uncertainty , and with a focus on the different phases  of monetary \npolicy during the pandemic.   \nI’ll start with a bit of context, to level set about the Fed’s policymaking and other \nroles.  Then I’ll turn to monetary policy and explore the important matter of uncertainty in \npolicymaking through the lens of the recent pandemic and ongoing economic rec overy.  \nI’ll discuss the evolution of the economy over this period and the corresponding phases \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n of policy –  bringing the essential element of time and changing conditions into the \nanalysis.  I’ll conclude with some very brief connections to thinking about careers in \neconomics and policymaking.  \nOf course, I offer my standard disclaimer –  these comments are my own, and \nmay not reflect the views of any other Federal Reserve policy maker.   \nSo first let me set the stage with a bit of context, in particular for the students who \nare learning about macroeconomics and the role of the central bank.  Created by \nCongress nearly 110 years ago, and refined over time, the Fed’s duties support the \nfunctioning of the U.S. economy, in the public interest.  We do a variety of  things, \nstarting with monetary policy.  For me and my colleagues at the Boston Fed, the overarching vision is a vibrant economy that works for all.  I see our mission as serving \nthe public in New England and the nation by promoting a strong, resilient, and inclusive \neconomy and financial system.  \nBeyond monetary policy, we have other duties – which I won’t have time to \ndiscuss today.  They include\n1: \n supporting the safety and soundness of the nation’s financial institutions, by supervising some of the count ry’s banks and serving as a “lender of last resort” \nto the financial system;  \n mitigating financial stability risks;  \n supporting safe and reliable payment and settlement systems –  back -end \ninfrastructure and services to the banking system and the U.S. Treasury (ranging \nfrom currency and coin circulation to various electronic channels); and  \n promoting community economic development in a variety of ways.  \n \nMost of my remarks today will be about our monetary policymaking, but I’d like to \ntake a moment, with many economics students and professors in the audience, to \nhighlight the variety of research we do – which is wide -ranging, because the economy is \n \n1 Learn more in “ The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does ,” a publication of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n so multifaceted.  Our economists and their research assistants and analysts do \nfascinating, data- driven, nonpartisan, policy -relevant work, and I’ll mention just two (of \nmany!) recent examples.  Some of our researchers have studie d the attention –  or \ninattention – that consumers give to inflation, demonstrating that the absolute level of \ninflation is important.  When inflation is low and stable, consumers don’t really think about it; but when inflation is higher, consumers are much  more aware of it, and \npossibly more likely to change their behavior.\n2  Another recent study looked at the \npotential causes of racial wealth gaps and found that inheritances and other types of \nwealth transfers from one generation to the next play only a s mall part –  the main \ncontributors to the gap, the authors find, are differences in lifetime earnings and pension assets.  Therefore, policies that successfully increase human capital can potentially help \nreduce this gap.\n3, 4 \n Monetary Policy  \n Let’s turn to monetary policy, and the core of my talk today.  It’s important to note \nthat at the Fed we are entrusted with monetary , and not fiscal, policy.  This involves \nactions that ultimately affect the cost of borrowing for businesses and households.     \nThe Fed spends a lot of time analyzing economic conditions –  using data, doing \nresearch, and listening to stakeholders locally and nationally.  Having prepared in great depth, I join the other 11 regional Reserve Bank presidents and the seven members of \nthe Board of Governors in Washington eight times a year to discuss appropriate \nmonetary policy.  After taking in substantive staff analysis, and multiple go- arounds by \ncommittee participants, there is a vote on policy actions by the current voting member s, \nsome of whom rotate year -to-year.  The committee’s decision and summary of \nappropriate policy is released in a statement, and then the Chair holds a press \n \n2 See Bracha and Ta ng (2022) . \n3 See Sabelhaus and Thompson (2022) . \n4 Additionally, the Boston Fed, in collaboration with a coalition of community partners, is launching a \nmultiyear research initiative to explore wealth disparities across Massachusetts. Our findings intend to  \ninform policy and will hopefully be used by public, private, and non- profit organizations to develop \nstrategies that promote equity in wealth, a key foundation for greater economic opportunity.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n conference to explain the committee’s decisions, which are then implemented in the \nmarket.   \nThe F ederal Reserve is charged, by Congress, with a “dual mandate” of price \nstability and maximum employment.  We currently define price stability as 2 percent \ninflation – a low level, where consumers and businesses do not see eroding purchasing \npower as a pres sing concern.5  Maximum employment, the other pillar of the dual \nmandate, is less specifically defined, but refers to the broad and inclusive goal of job \nopportunities for all Americans.  It's important to note that while often characterized as \ncompeting,  history has shown that price stability is essential for a well -functioning \neconomy, and an important precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time.  \n      Figure 1’s left panel  shows the evolution of the inflation rate since the 1960s, \nwith grey bars indicating recessions.\n6  While there are many inflation measures, I focus \nhere on the 12- month change in the price of personal consumption expenditures (or \nPCE), excluding the important but volatile food and energy components –  also known \nas “core” inflation7 and generally a good predictor of overall inflation’s path.   \nAs the figure shows, achieving price stability hasn’t always been an easy task \nover this period.  An inflationary buildup started in the mid- 1960s and persisted until the \ndisinflation achieved under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the early 1980s.  This was \nfollowed by an extended period of inflation moderation, with inflation typically near or below 2 percent since the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, lasting until th e \nrecent pandemic -related inflation flare- up.  \n \n5 While this argument holds even more strongly for a zero- inflation rate, one reason to target a positive \nbut low inflation rate is that it can be difficult for firms to cut wages. A positive inflation rate helps to \nachieve real wage declines that facilitat e adjustment when the economy faces a contractionary shock, \nthus alleviating the downward nominal wage rigidity constraint. For additional context see Bewley (1999).  \n6 See U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions , produced by the National Bureau of Economic \nResearch.  \n7 While this measure can be a better indicator of underlying inflation trends, the Fed’s inflation target is \nexpressed in terms of total PCE inflation. Salwati and Wessel (2021) is a helpful summary of different \ninflation measures . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Figure 1’s right panel  shows the unemployment rate along with inflation, further \nillustrating the challenges monetary policymakers face in trying to stabilize economic \nactivity at a level consistent with both aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate.8    \nBy raising or lowering interest rates, monetary policy affects aggregate demand \nin the economy –  and Figure 2  shows how the stance of policy has evolved over time.  \nPolicy tightening – an increase in the Fed’s policy  rate, the federal funds rate – raises \nthe cost of borrowing for firms and households, with the effect of slowing demand for \ncapital, labor, goods, and services, which in turn relieves price pressures, tempering \ninflation.  Conversely, lowering the federal  funds rate, or easing policy, reduces the cost \nof borrowing, thus supporting an expansion of aggregate demand and employment.  This tends to increase price pressures, raising inflation.\n9  \nIt is important to note that many of the deviations of inflation and unemployment \nfrom levels consistent with price stability and full employment have resulted from \nunanticipated events requiring the Fed to react.  The COVID -19 pandemic is a prime \nexample – a shock originating outside of the economic system and resulting in a \nsubstantial disruption to the economy, requiring a response from the Fed in pursuit of its \ndual mandate.    \nSo, I will now offer some reflections on conducting monetary policy during a time \nof heightened uncertainty stemming from the unprecedented nature of the C OVID -19 \npandemic.  I will note that, while a keen observer of monetary policy for many years, I \nwas not involved in policy decisions until joining the Boston Fed in July of 2022.   \nA key takeaway for me is that the elevated uncertainty, and the risk management \nconsiderations associated with that uncertainty, played an important role in policy \nsetting since the pandemic began, and appropriately so.  I see the most salient types of  \n \n8 Fed actions typically are not intended to cause a recession, possibly with the exception of the Volker \ndisinflation. The Fed’s limited ability at times to stabilize the economy could be due to events that are \nbeyond the control of monetary policy.  For further reflections on these topics see Blinder (2023).    \n9 The Fed can also affect interest rates through instruments other than its policy rate, such as by buying \nor selling government -backed securities. These so- called large- scale asset purchases have occ urred at \ntimes when the federal funds rate hit the zero- lower -bound. The Fed also provides information about \nfuture policy (so- called forward guidance) with its meeting statement and quarterly Summary of Economic \nProjections.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n uncertainty as having shifted, with somewhat different policy implications, as the \nsituation evolved – and will explore that with you today.   \nOf course, with the benefit of hindsight, some may argue that different policy \ndecisions would have been preferable.  However, I think it is too soon to judge how well \nthe Fed has managed the challenges of stabilizing the economy during this very \ncomplex p eriod.  We will have much to learn from the in- depth analysis that this period \nwarrants.  And much will depend on whether inflation returns to target in a reasonable amount of time with only modest effects on employment.   \nI will highlight that I remain a “realistic optimist,” based on my assessment of \ncurrently available information.  The ongoing resilience I see in the economy, and the \nprogress on inflation so far, lead me to believe there is a pathway to achieving this \ndesirable outcome.  In fact, that path seems to have widened recently –  although \nconsiderable risks remain.  \n \nUncertainty and Monetary Policy   \nFormer Fed chairman Alan Greenspan once noted that uncertainty is not just a \n“pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining  characteristic of \nthat landscape.”10  So, I’ll next highlight three main forms of uncertainty that monetary \npolicymakers must confront.11  \nThe first is uncertainty related to data and measurement .  This refers to how \naccurately available statistical data describe the variables they intend to measure, and \nto the fact that some variables are not directly observable.  Two examples are maximum sustainable employment, and the underlying “neutral” interest rate, above which policy \nbecomes restrictive (or below w hich policy becomes accommodative).  Both are \nimportant economic concepts that are certainly affected by uncertainty.  \n \n10 See Greenspan (2004).   \n11 Accessible and thoughtful discussions about the different forms of uncertainty and how they affect the \nconduct of monetary policy can be found in, for example, Bernanke (2004) and Mendes et al (2017).  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n The second form is uncertainty related to the relationships between key \neconomic variables  that influence policy decisions.  Examples of this type, in the current \ncontext, include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics, and the \nsize and timing of the effects of monetary policy –  the proverbial “long and variable lags” \nwith which policy exerts its effects on the econom y.  \nThe third form is uncertainty related to unforeseen events , such as pandemics, \nnatural disasters, or geopolitical developments.  While statistical methods can use past experiences to help quantify the first two types of uncertainty, these types of shoc ks \nresist prediction.  \nFor policymaking, the appropriate response to increased uncertainty depends on \nits type as well as the context.\n12  In many situations, uncertainty calls for a gradual and \ncautious approach to policy.  This can arise in periods of inc reased uncertainty about \nthe data, or the effects of policy actions on the economy.  Allowing time for the “signal” to emerge from the “noise” in the data, or to fully assess the economy’s response to \npast policy actions, can help –  leading to more informe d policy decisions, and balancing \nthe risks of doing too much versus not doing enough.  \nHowever, in some circumstances, uncertainty calls for policy to move \naggressively.  Examples often involve contexts where doing nothing or moving too slowly exacerbates the economic circumstances that policymakers are trying to \naddress.  For instance, too- small or too- slow actions to make monetary policy more \naccommodative at the outset of a major crisis could lead to severe labor market \ndisplacements that persistently lower employment, with significant pain for many.  On \nthe flip side, when there are risks of higher inflation expectations becoming entrenched, \na gradual inflation- fighting approach may limit policymakers’ ability to restore price \nstability without a significant downturn.\n13    \n \n12 See Brainard (1967).  \n13 For further discussions on this topic see, for example, Ball (1999), Friedman (1968 and 1977) and \nPhelps (1967).  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n The C OVID -19 pandemic was uncharted territory along all these dimensions of \nuncertainty, due to the size and speed of the economic disruptions it induced.  Figure 3 \nplots the severity of the pandemic in terms of hospitalizations and deaths.  This \nunforeseen public health event quickly moved the world to an eco nomic situation unlike \nany in the post -World War II period, with policymakers trying to decipher whether the \nusual rules governing the behavior of the economy still applied.  The pandemic also \naffected segments of the economy very unevenly, and in non- standard ways relative to \nprevious economic crises, making it more difficult to interpret incoming data and assess the effects of monetary policy on the economy.  And as time passed and the economy \nevolved, so did the nature of the pandemic -induced uncertainty .   \nThe nuances in how uncertainty influences policy decisions contributed to distinct \nphases  of monetary policy, which I will now discuss in more detail.  \n Background: The e conomy before early 2020  \nTo set the stage, I suspect it is helpful to highlight so me key features of the pre-\npandemic economy.  \nOverall, in early 2020 the economy was doing quite well, as can be seen earlier \nin Figure 1B .  Despite an unemployment rate that had fallen to near 50- year lows, core \ninflation remained below the Fed’s 2 percent target.14  Absent clear indications of \ninflationary pressures, the Fed was not actively restricting economic growth.  \nImportantly, this monetary policy strategy of letting the labor market “run hot” with \ninflation still below target was successfully draw ing more people into the labor market, \nbenefiting groups that traditionally endured higher than average unemployment rates, \nand fostering a broader -based and more inclusive notion of maximum employment.  \n \n \n14 Wage inflation was rising some but still relatively subdued.  It is possible that, given more time, wage \nand price pressures would have pic ked up.  Still, these pressures were potentially limited because output \ngrowth was moderate and relatively stable.    \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n COVID -19 [March 2020 to  November 2020]  \nIn March 2020, the C OVID -19 pandemic struck, and almost overnight much of \nthe U.S. (and global) economy shut down.  Economic activity plummeted, and by April \n2020, the unemployment rate had spiked to 14.7 percent –  an extraordinary jump in \nspeed and magnitude.  \nIn addition to enormous public health uncertainty, the C OVID -19 shock created \nunprecedented uncertainty about the extent and length of the economic shutdown.  It \nwas unclear how consumers and firms would react to social distancing requirements, \nand limits on mobility.  Concerns also emerged about an extended period of depressed \neconomic activity, and with that, the possibility of falling prices potentially resulting in a \ndeflationary spiral.  And there were worries about very high unemployment leaving a \nmore permanent labor market imprint, despite the hope that many of the layoffs would \nbe temporary.  \nThe pandemic also laid bare and exacerbated labor market inequalities, as \nlower -paid, customer -facing occupations were affected the most by the shutdowns while \nmany of the higher -paying occupations could be performed remotely.  The left panel of \nFigure 4 s hows the disparities in unemployment by race, and the right panel by \neducational attainment.  Separately, closures of schools and daycares forced some \nindividuals – especially women –  who could not work from home to drop out of the labor \nforce at least tem porarily.  \nSo the situation involved considerable uncertainty about the possible extent of \nthe economic damage brought on by the pandemic, and the potential for significant negative feedback loops.  This called for large and decisive monetary and fiscal policy \nactions to avoid a worst -case scenario.\n15  The Fed cut its policy rate to essentially zero, \n \n15 A description of the fiscal and monetary policy measures taken in response to the C OVID -19 pandemic \ncan be found, for example, in Romer (2021), and Milstein and Wessel (2021). See also Alicia Parlapiano, \nDeborah B. Solomon, Madeleine Ngo, and Stacy Cowley, “Where $5 Trillion in Pandemic Stimulus Money \nWent,” New York Times , March 11, 2022.  \n. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n and provided forward guidance on the future path of interest rates, indicating that rates \nwould remain near zero until the achievement of certain economic conditions.16  The \nFed also launched an array of programs to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, and state and local governments.\n17  The Fed gathered additional sources \nof information18 as well, in an effort to reduce uncertainty and better u nderstand the \nextremely unusual economic developments.  \nElected officials provided extraordinary fiscal assistance to the economy, and its \neffects are still reverberating.  The extent of the support to households, for example, is \ncaptured in the large rise  of disposable income above pre- pandemic trends, as show n in \nFigure 5  – something that had never occurred to such an extent in previous downturns.  \nThe timeliness and magnitude of these fiscal and monetary policy measures \nultimately succeeded in preventing the most -feared economic risks from materializing.  \nThe unemployment rate dropped rapidly, and inflation did not decline much from its low, \npre-pandemic level.  Of course, containing the virus and the swift development of \nvaccines were crucial to avoiding a broader crisis.  \n \nThe reopening of the economy and the  inflation surprise [Dec . 2020 to Nov. 2021]  \nAfter the acute phase of the pandemic, there was a noticeable rebound in GDP \nand its largest component – personal consumption expenditures – in the second half of \n2020.  This is shown in Figure 6 , where both ser ies are plotted relative to an estimate of \nlong- run trend.   \n \n16 Initially, the guidance in the FOMC statement affirmed that rates would stay near zero until \npolicymakers were “confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve \nits maximum employment and price stability goals.” In September 2020, guidance was strengthened to \nindicate that rates would stay low until “labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the \nCommittee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to \nmoderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”  \n17 In addition, the Fed resumed purchases of Treasuries and government guaranteed mortgage- backed \nsecurities, first to restore market functioning and later to support the economy with low interest rates across the maturity spectrum.  \n18 For an overview of these sources see Cajner et al (2022) . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n However, despite this progress, there were worries heading into 2021 that \neconomic activity could stall.  The real -world effectiveness of vaccines, which first \nbecame available in December 2020, was still uncertain.  Another wave of the virus was \nunderway.  And so consumers’ willingness to resume normal activities was quite \nunclear.  \nAmidst this backdrop of continued high uncertainty, monetary policy remained \nhighly accommodative, even as inflation  started to pick up in the spring of 2021, as \nshown in the lighter line in Figure 7 .  At the time, the rise in inflation was believed to be \nmainly tied to supply chain constraints that would resolve quickly.  Expectations of \nfuture price increases remained  low19, reinforcing the idea that inflation could rise \ntemporarily without leaving a persistent imprint on the economy.  And although the unemployment rate had improved considerably, it was still around 6 percent in the first \nhalf of 2021, above levels considered consistent with full employment.  This state of \naffairs did not suggest an immediate need to remove monetary policy accommodation \nand tighten financial conditions.  \n In such a context of heightened uncertainty, it is crucial to assess the costs \nassociated with each risk to the economic outlook and devise the best strategy to \nachieve the Fed’s dual mandate goals.  And in the early stages of the pandemic \nrecovery, given the still uncertain public health situation, risks of demand setbacks \noutweighed the risks of inflation.  \nWith the benefit of hindsight, one could argue for removing policy \naccommodation sooner.\n20  But to me at the time, given the continued significant \n \n19 After dropping sharply with the start of the pandemic, market -based inflation expectations rose through \nmuch of 2020 and into 2021, but by mid- 2021 had risen enough to only equal their long- run average. \nShort -term survey -based expectations measures, while up a bit in early 2021, did not rise sharply until \nMay and longer -term survey -based measures edged higher but remained in a fairly narrow range.   \n20 Chair Powell commented at the March 2022 FOMC press conference: \"… if we knew now that these \nsupply blockages [and] the inflation resulting from them, in collision with … very strong demand, if we \nknew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes, it would have been appropriate to \nmove earlier.\"   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n12 \n uncertainty, it seemed prudent for the Fed to support the economy versus pre- empting \nan inflation surge that few were forecasting.21   \nUltimately, the economy evolved quite differently than anticipated.  In particular, \ndemand exceeded expectations, while supply fell short, resulting in a large demand-\nsupply gap that fueled inflation.  By early 2021, GDP and consumption were already \nabove trend (see Figure 6) and subsequent waves of the virus did little to slow demand, \nwhich was unusually tilted toward consumption of goods, and away from services.  \nHowever, supply -chain constraints persisted as highlighted by the New York Fed \nGlobal Supply Chain Pressure Index in Figure 8.  While efforts were underway to \nunderstand the supply bottlenecks, including development of new indicators like the New York Fed index, it proved very difficult to assess the extent and duration of supply \nchallenges emanating from an atypical pandemic shock in real time.  Russia’s war in \nUkraine in early 2022 was yet another unanticipated event, adding to supply -chain \npressures and firms’ costs.  \nImportantly, there was  also the expectation that, as the economy reopened more \nfully, spending would shift from goods (which people could consume while sheltering at home) back to services, and ease price pressures for goods.  And given the expectation \nthat supply in the servic e sector could sufficiently meet demand, service- sector inflation \nwas not expected to rise significantly.  \nAgain, reality was different.  Households had accumulated substantial savings \nduring the early stages of the pandemic, thanks to the fiscal support and limited \nopportunities to spend.  So services consumption rose, but without a material decline in \ngoods consumption. Thus, there was little relief from supply chain bottlenecks.  And, \nmost crucially, labor supply did not rise as anticipated to meet servic e sector demand.\n22  \n \n21 See Collins (2023) .  \n22 The labor force participation rate collapsed when businesses shut down early in the pandemic. As firms \nreopened, the participation rate retraced some of its initial decline, but many workers stayed on the \nsidelines due to several factors , including fears of contracting C OVID -19, childcare problems and extra \nsavings built up during the pandemic. Participation was also held down by lower immigration (Peri and Zaiour 2022). Participation began to recover more robustly in the fall of 2021, the same time that the \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n13 \n This led to a noticeable pickup in labor costs and services inflation.  Given that services \nare a significant portion of the consumption basket, inflation became very broad based.    \n Monetary policy tightening [December 2021 to May 2023]  \nWith broad- based wage and price pressures by late 2021, it was increasingly \nclear that elevated inflation would be more persistent than initially thought.  \nPolicymakers therefore began the process of r emoving monetary accommodation in \nhopes of slowing economic activity and bringing demand into better balance with supply.\n23  \nIn March 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.  \nFinancial conditions had already started to tighten — especially in the mortgage market \n— owing in part to the Fed’s statements about its policy direction, or forward guidance.  \nAfter March, policy rate increases were swift, with a 50 basis points hike in May, \nand then 75 basis points at the four subsequent meetings, followed by another 50 basis points increase (see Figure 7 ).  By the end of 2022, the FOMC had raised rates \ncumulatively by 425 basis points —a very rapid pace, relative to the other tightening \ncycles that have occurred since the Volcker disinflation 40 years ago.   \nPolicymakers judged that high, unexpectedly persistent inflation, combined with a \ntight labor market, required rapid policy rate adjustments to fulfill the Fed’s mandate.  \nRates were increased an additional 25 basis points at each of the next three meetings, \nto over 5 percent in May of this year.  \nI will note that high inflation takes a toll on all of us.  In my travels around New \nEngland, I’ve heard repeatedly about the challenges households face from rapid price \n \nshare of foreign- born workers in the working- age population began to increase. As of August 2023, \nparticipation had increased by about one percentage point relative to August 2021, despite the \nlongstanding downward trend in participati on caused by population aging (Cooper et al. 2021).  \n23 In its December 2021 statement, the FOMC announced it was slowing the pace of long- term asset \npurchases and signaled that the end of such purchases was near. The Summary of Economic Projections \nthat acc ompanied this statement also showed an upward shift in policymakers’ expectations for the path \nof the federal funds rate over the next year.  The process of reducing asset holdings (so- called \nquantitative tightening) commenced in March 2022.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n14 \n increases, parti cularly those with lower incomes struggling to make ends meet.  Inflation \nis challenging as well for businesses forced to grapple with higher costs and more \ncomplex planning and investment decisions.  So this battle against inflation was and is \nimportant, in the public interest.  \nUncertainty also played an important role in policy setting as the Fed sought to \ncombat high inflation.  By late 2021 and early 2022, the source of uncertainty had \nshifted from implications of the public health situation to uncertai nty about key economic \nrelationships – most notably the inflation process.  In particular, persistently high levels \nof inflation led to concerns about a possible rise in longer -term inflation expectations, \nwhich had it occurred would likely have made it more difficult for policymakers to restore price stability.  This type of uncertainty also argued for aggressive rate increases.  \nThe focus on bringing inflation down and containing longer -run inflation \nexpectations in turn created additional uncertainty about the economy’s ability to \nwithstand a rapid tightening of financial conditions.  The banking stresses caused by the \ncollapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March 2023 added to this \nconcern, as many expected the banking turmoil to rest rict consumer and business credit \nbeyond the typical impact of policy tightening.\n24  \nDespite many forecasters expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained \nremarkably resilient to date.  Indeed, since the beginning of the tightening cycle, the econom y has remained in a relatively strong position.  Household balance sheets have \nbeen solid, partially due to savings accumulated during the early stages of the \npandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated, due in part to firms’ ability \nto lock i n financing at low rates early in the pandemic.  These factors have likely made \nthe economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles.  \nMore recently, however, there is evidence that firms’ cash holdings are declining, \nand households’ stock s of accumulated excess savings are diminishing.  Therefore, the \n \n24 To address the banking stress, the Fed in conjunction with the Treasury Department enacted the Bank \nTerm Funding Program (BTFP) , which helped relieve banking strains and likely limited additional credit \ncontraction.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n15 \n need for credit is rising.  These developments will eventually make demand more \nresponsive to high interest rates.  \n The most recent policy phase, and looking ahead  \nWith interest rates firmly  in a range that will restrict the economy, we are starting \nto see promising signs of policy having the desired effects.   \nIn particular, the darker line in Figure 9 shows that total PCE inflation (which \nincludes the volatile food and energy prices) is dow n considerably from its peak.  Core \nPCE inflation has also moderated some, but has some way to go to return to 2 percent, and it is too soon to tell whether recent progress will be sustained.  \nDisaggregating core PCE inflation into its three main component s, as shown in \nFigure 10, provides valuable insight into the different drivers of inflation.  Inflation for \ngoods  (the dark blue line) has decreased noticeably with the improvement in supply \nconditions.  And as lower market rents are starting to pass through, housing or shelter  \ninflation (the lighter blue line) is moderating as well.   But core inflation for non -hous ing \nservices (orange line) remains elevated, and this accounts for over half of core \nconsumption.  Bringing this component down will likely require labor market conditions \nto cool more, since labor represents a large share of costs in the services sector.   \nWhile the unemployment rate remains near historic lows, there is some evidence \nof demand becoming better aligned with supply in the labor market.  Despite the \nSeptember jump in employment, growth in payrolls this year has slowed relative to last \nyear though it is still significantly above trend (see Figure 11 ).  The previously very high \nvoluntary quit rate has fallen to pre- pandemic levels.  Lower, though still high, job \nvacancies are also consistent with a gradually cooling labor market.  We are also seeing promising developments in terms of labor supply as labor force participation has \nincreased, especially for prime- age workers (those aged 25 to 54), as also shown in \nFigure 11.   \nIn this context, the FOMC shifted to a new, more gradual, policymaking phase \nthis summer –  holding rates constant in June and again September, after a 25 basis \npoint hike in July.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n16 \n In my view, this transition to a more patient, approach –  taking the time to \nholistically assess incoming information –  was warranted for a number of reasons.  In \nparticular, it reflects the fact that we are likely close to, and possibly at, the peak of this \ntightening cycle, with the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely \nbalanced with the risk of slowing activity more than needed t o achieve price stability.   \nOnce again, appropriate policy in this phase is importantly influenced by \nuncertainty and related risk assessments.  With inflation expectations well anchored, the \nuncertainty now relates more to difficulty assessing the ultimate impact of our policy \nactions to date25 and to extracting signal from data that are noisier than usual.26  In \nreviewing incoming economic data, I avoid focusing on individual data points, looking instead for trends that show both sustained reductions in inflation, and progress on the \nunderlying goal of realigning supply and demand.   \nPatience will give us tim e to better separate “signal” from “noise” in the data and \nto balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to work through the economy.  \nI expect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see \nevidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.  And while we are likely \nnear, and could be at, the peak for policy rates, further tightening could be warranted depending on incoming information.  \nOverall, I continue to be realistic about the economic uncertain ties and risks, but \noptimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and \nonly a modest increase in the unemployment rate –  an outcome consistent with both \nparts of the Fed’s dual mandate.  \n \n \n \n \n25 Estimates of the peak effect of monetary policy on activity and inflation vary considerably in terms of \ntiming and magnitude. For a review see,  for example,  Havranek and Rusnak (2013).  \n26 For instance, monthly inflation readings have been more volatile than usual since the beginning of the \npandemic.  Co nsumers’ spending patterns have also changed, creating issues with seasonal adjustment, \nand with inferring the underlying strength of demand.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n17 \n Some closing policy thoughts  \nLooking ahead, there will be many important policy -relevant issues to be studied \nfrom the still -evolving business cycle induced by the pandemic. That said, I hope I have \nconveyed the important role for uncertainty considerations in setting monetar y policy.    \nThere are different types of uncertainty.   And depending on type as well as \ncontext, uncertainty can call for policy to move unusually rapidly –  or to take a more \nwait-and-see approach.   In the current policy tightening cycle, this has contribu ted to \ndifferent policy phases, with a period of aggressive moves followed by the current more \ngradual approach to policy.  \nThe pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers, and risk \nassessments, however difficult to make, had to be made.   One lesson I’ll offer, with the \nbenefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply shocks.   In particular, the risk of \nwidespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a stronger case than previously \nrealized for insuring against too- high inflation by removi ng policy accommodation more \nquickly.   More generally, I look forward to the extensive research and debate to come, \nas we endeavor to draw additional lessons, deepen understanding and improve policy.  \nStill, despite the evolving uncertainties about the econ omy and appropriate \npolicy, I hope that you, like me, are encouraged by the economy’s resilience and the \nprogress on inflation to date.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nI’ve shared a lot with you today, including about the need for reflection, learning, \nand humili ty for policymakers, especially in extraordinary times.  The backdrop has \nbeen uncertainty –  that will remain and be elevated at times.  In this context, I’ll end by \noffering some concluding thoughts from my own career journey, which I hope you may \nfind helpful.   \n First, lifelong learning is essential -  for individuals and for institutions.  I see this \nas more than an activity –  it is a mindset.  In an uncertain, evolving world, drawing \nlessons from past experiences will help us do better and improve outco mes.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n18 \n Developing new skills and expanding knowledge positions us for future opportunities.  I \nhope you also agree that it is great fun.  For me, learning is one of life’s joys.  \n Second, seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives –  \nincluding those you may disagree with – is a valuable practice, for policymaking, for \nwork, and in life.  Listen well so that you can learn.  Hopefully, you’ll also develop strong partners and collaborators who can assist and support you in navigating uncertain \ncontexts.  And I encourage you to share your own perspectives –  smart, capable \nWellesley women have a lot to contribute!  \nA third, related, point is the importance of gathering information broadly.  This \ndeepens understandings and can help moderate uncer tainty.  By information, I mean \nboth quantitative data, which is core to empirical economics, and  qualitative information, \nsuch as from case studies and narratives.  I’m excited to see technology leading to new data sets we can parse for insights.  I also see intentionally hearing from a wide range \nof stakeholders as complementary to the collection and analysis of statistical data –  \nincluding hearing from voices that have not traditionally been in the room.  \nThat brings me to where we started: economics.  It  is a field that opens doors –  \nthough there is important work, for those of us in this field, to ensure that economics \nitself is open and inclusive.  For me, the discipline that intrigued me as a teen has been \na great foundation for a decades -long (still u nfolding!) varied and fascinating \nprofessional career.  Time and again, I’ve valued the structured approach economics brings to analyzing complex contexts and to drawing inference from data sets.  Its \nframeworks are extremely useful for making decisions under uncertainty.  And so, I \ncongratulate, and hope to encourage and even inspire, those of you who are studying, \nand teaching economics.   \nThank you for having me here to discuss this period of extraordinary uncertainty \nand challenge ushered in by the COVI D-19 pandemic, and its implications for current \nand future monetary policy.  Of course, uncertainty is everywhere and a fact of life.  Learning, data, frameworks and flexibility can help us address it and can also enrich our \nlives professionally and personally.   \nIt has been a pleasure to share my views, and I wish each of you the very best.   \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nWednes day, Octo ber 11, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n19 \n References  \n \nBall, Laurence. 1999. “ Aggregate Demand and Long- Run Unemployment .”  Brookings \nPapers on Economic Activity  No. 2: 189– 251.  \nBernanke, Ben S. 2004.  “ Gradualism .” Speech delivered at an economics luncheon co-\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Seattle Branch) and the \nUniversity of Washington.

Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n   \nOctober 12, 2023 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n   Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday , October 12, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4: 00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, October 12 , 2023  \n    \n \n Key Takeaways  \n1. Collins knows inflation is still taking a toll across New England, but inflation is moderating.  \nIn her travels around New England, Collins has spoken with residents and business owners who are \ncontinuing to struggle with higher prices.  But she sees the  Fed making progress in its efforts to lower \ninflation, as some signs are emerging that demand and supply are realigning.  \n2. Despite some favorable indicators, Collins says it’s too soon to be confident that inflation is on a \nsustained trajectory back to  the Fed’s 2 percent target.   \nCollins says much of the recent moderation in the core inflation measure is due to declines in core goods \ninflation, which can be traced to improvements in supply chain conditions.  But she adds that firms’ \nincentives to pass on these costs savings may be short -lived unless demand slows.  Meanwhile, core \nservices inflation remains elevated.   \n3. The recovery from the pandemic has been unusual, and Collins says that in this highly uncertain environment, policymaking requires pat ience.  \nCollins says that policymakers need time to draw conclusions about the data and allow special factors that have been supporting near term activity to play out.  She adds it’s unlikely we’ve yet seen the full effects of \nthe Fed’s actions to date, so patience is critical as policymakers weigh the risk of inflation remaining persistently high against the risk of activity slowing more than expected.  \n4. Recent increases in long- term interest rates reinforce Collins’ view that we’re very near or \nperhaps at the peak of the current tightening cycle.  \nCollins noted the 10- year Treasury yield has moved up since mid- September, and that increase has been \naccompanied by higher corporate bond yields and mortgage rates.  Collins says the rise in these rates \nimplies s ome tightening of financial conditions, which if persistent could reduce the need for further \nmonetary policy tightening.  It also reinforces her view that we are very near or perhaps at the peak of this \ntightening cycle.  \n5. Collins’ travels around New England have given her insight into its strengths and challenges and shown her again how important community banks are to regional economic health.  \nShared concerns include childcare, housing, and infrastructure.  At the same time, the region benefits from \nits collective brainpower, a diverse and skilled workforce, and relatively high job opportunity.  Collins says \nthe region’s banking industry plays an essential role everywhere, serving communities of all sizes and providing households and businesses with the funding they need for economic health and growth. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Octo ber 12, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n Good afternoon.  I’m delighted to join you today, for the 22nd Annual Regional & \nCommunity Bankers Conference.   I’d like to thank the team here at the Boston Fed –  including \nthe Supervision, Regulation & Credit group , and our New England Public Policy Center –  for \ntheir contributions to this year’s conference.   \nAnd I’d like to thank all of you for attending.  It’s wonderful to have banking -sector \nmembers from all parts of New England here today.  In my visits to each New England state, to \nlearn from a range of stakeholders, I hear from workers, entrepreneurs, small businesses, local \nemployers, bankers, community development experts, civic leaders, and many others.  It’s clear \nfrom those conversations that regional and community banks are a crucial, valued element of \nthe financial and economic infrastructure of the region.   \nAnd we appreciate your constructive engagement with us at the Boston Fed.  It takes all \nof us to support a safe and sound banking system, which is s o essential to a vibrant and \ninclusive economy.  \nIn our time today, I’ll provide some remarks before sitting down for a discussion with my \ncolleague Mike Ravid from the Fed’s regional and community supervisory team.  For the most \npart, I’ll share my views about the economic outlook and monetary policy.  I will also provide \nsome perspectives on banking, and talk briefly about the Fed’s work across the region and in payments innovation.  \nBefore I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks today are my own v iews. I’m not \nspeaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks or at the Board of Governors.  \n The Economic Outlook & Monetary Policy  \n \nI’ll start with the economy , and highlight the impact of some of the recent data on my \nviews about the out look and appropriate monetary policy – recognizing that some readings have \nbeen a bit surprising, such as the stronger than expected September payroll employment. The \nConsumer Price Index or CPI report for September was released this morning,  and I’ll desc ribe \nrecent trends in inflation a bit later in my remarks.  \nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate from Congress, for price stability and \nmaximum sustained employment –  and our current focus remains on bringing inflation down to \nour 2 percent target in a r easonable amount of time.  Price stability is essential for a well -\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n functioning economy , and is an important precondition for maximum employment that is \nsustainable over time.  So, reducing inflation relates to both  parts of our mandate.  \nHigh inflation takes a toll on everyone.  As I travel around New England, I continue to \nhear about the challenges people face related to too- high inflation.  Households with lower \nincomes are struggling to make ends meet and businesses are grappling with the higher costs \nand added complexity that elevated inflation brings, for planning and investment decisions.  \nSo the battle with inflation is important, and in the public interest.  As a result, the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised rates rapidly, relative to prior m onetary policy \ntightening cycles, before shifting to a more gradual approach this summer.  We have made \nsome progress on inflation, as I’ll discuss, but it is still too high.  And given the persistent strength in economic activity, it is too soon to determine whether the slowdown in price growth will continue.   \nOverall, I continue to believe that the current phase of policy requires patience, allowing \nus time to review available information holistically, to separate the signal from the noise in the \ndata, and to balance competing risks.   \n \nOutlook  \nA few weeks ago, the FOMC released its Summary of Economic projections or SEP, \nreflecting the outlook of participants (the Fed Governors and Reserve Bank presidents).1  The \nmedian SEP forecast is for inflation to near our target by 2025 -26, as still -hot labor market \nconditions normalize.  Further, the median forecast sees the appropriate monetary policy to \nachieve such an outcome involving an additional 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate this year, and then holding rates in restrictive territory for an extended period.  \nThis outlook in the SEP remains similar to my own.  I believe we may be at, or very near, \nthe peak for this cycle, although I would not take further tightening off the table yet.   And looking \nbeyond the “how high” discussion to focus on the “how long” part of this tightening cycle, I will say I expect rates may have to stay higher for longer than previous  SEP forecasts had \nsuggested.    \nLet me add that I continue to be a “realistic optimist,” and I think that perspective is \nimportant to emphasize.  I’m realistic about the uncertainties and risks to my baseline outlook.  \n \n1 Summary of Economic Projections, September 20, 2023 (federalreserve.gov)  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n But I am optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity, and \nonly a modest increase in the unemployment rate to cool the mismatch in labor demand and supply.   \n \nProgress Realigning Demand and Supply  \nAs you know, recent reports on real economic activity have been strong, and overall \ndemand remains resilient.  Payroll growth jumped in September, with upward revisions to job gains for July and August.  And although the average pace of job gains has slowed this year relative to 2022, it remains well above trend.   \nSince demand outstripping supply in the labor markets has been a key factor driving \nwage pressures, and hence price pressures, some further rebalancing will be required for the deceleration we have seen in inflation to be sustained.  With rates in restrictive territory, I do expect that payroll growth and economic activity more generally will slow in the coming months.   \nThere is already some evidence of demand and supply realigning in the labor market, \neven though it remains strong overall, with unemployment still near historic lows .  On the \ndemand side, the previously very high voluntary quit rate has fallen to pre -pandemic levels.  Job \nvacancies have also been trending down overall, and are a good bit below their peak – though \nthey remain elevated, and posted a surprising increase in August.   \nWe are also seeing promising developments in terms of labor supply.  Labor force \nparticipation has increased, especially for prime -age workers (those aged 25 to 54), and since \nthe second half of 2022, there has been a noticeable pickup in empl oyment of foreign- born \nworkers, helping to alleviate labor shortages in some areas.  \nAnd importantly, despite the tight labor market, average hourly earnings growth \ncontinued to slow through September — especially on a 3 -month annualized basis.  This is \nconsistent with increased supply helping to alleviate some of the wage pressures.  These developments are promising, but to be sure demand and supply are coming into better alignment, we will need to see the recent labor market trends continue and broaden, including a moderation of hiring to a near -trend pace.  This would be evidence of the sustained cooling in \nthe labor markets needed to bring inflation to 2 percent in a reasonable amount of time.   \nIn addition, strong job growth and the overall tight labor market continue to support \nconsumption, which was quite solid in July and August.  High frequency data suggest spending \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n may have slowed in September, but we will have to see whether this is borne out in the official \nretail sales release next week. \nIndeed, household expenditures have remained remarkably resilient to date, even in the \nface of tighter financial conditions.  This continued strength is also likely due in part to healthy household balance sheets from savings accumulated during the pandemic.   These stockpiles \nare diminishing, but recent data revisions suggest the possibility of somewhat higher remaining excess saving than previously thought – which could support household spending a bit longer, \ngoing forward.   Still, we are seeing some signs  of consumers becoming more financially \nconstrained as credit usage is rising and delinquency rates are increasing.  So faced with high interest rates, it is unlikely that consumption will remain as resilient going forward.  \n \nInflation  \nTurning to inflation, I will focus on the core measure, which excludes the important but \nvolatile food and energy components, since it is typically a better gauge of underlying trends \nthan total inflation.  Core inflation, whether measured by the CPI or the PCE price index, has \nmoderated but a key question is whether the recent progress will be sustained.  Today’s CPI \nrelease is a reminder that restoring price stability will take time.     \nDisaggregating the key components of this measure provides valuable insight into the \ndrivers of recent movements.  Much of the positive news comes from declines in core goods  \nprice inflation, helped by the improvement in supply conditions.  But firms’ incentives to pass the costs savings from supply chain improvements through to prices may be short -lived, unless \ndemand slows.  \nHousing or shelter inflation is moderating overall, but the September pickup in CPI \nshelter inflation – driven in part by the volatile “lodging away from home” category – highlights \nthat progress may prove uneven. In par ticular, we will have to see whether the recent pickup in \nhouse price growth will put further pressure on new rents, slowing the deceleration in measured inflation in this sector.  \nThat brings me to core services excluding housing, which accounts for a significant \nportion of the consumption basket.  Inflation for this component remains elevated and overall \nprogress has been limited.  Bringing core non -housing services inflation down will likely require \nlabor market conditions to cool more, as labor accounts  for a large share of costs in this sector.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Overall, it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to \nthe 2 percent target we associate with price stability.  I’ll also note that it is important not to read \ntoo much int o individual data points, or even from a few months of information.  The monthly \ninflation data, for example, have always been noisy.  But the variability of core inflation has increased since the pandemic.  Extracting underlying patterns from noisy incoming data will take \nsome time.  \n \nPandemic Uncertainties  \nI’ll say that the mixed signals we are getting from the recent data highlight the need to \nfocus on trends and take a holistic approach to interpreting incoming information and determining the implications for appropriate policy.  Here I will highlight that the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be, highly unusual.  \nYesterday I spoke at length at Wellesley College about the role of uncertainty in \npolicym aking, notably after an episode like the pandemic.\n2  While the nature of the uncertainty \nhas evolved, there is currently a high degree of uncertainty about economic indicators, including around underlying inflation conditions and employment growth.  \nAs a result, this phase of policy requires considerable patience.  Policymakers need time \nto draw correct conclusions from the incoming data and to allow some special factors that have been supporting near -term activity – and perhaps limiting the impact of higher interest rates on \nthe economy – to play out.  This includes households’ excess savings that I mentioned earlier, \nas well as firms’ elevated cash holdings and debt previously refinanced at low rates.  As consumers’ savings and firms’ cash holdings decline further, and more corporate debt needs to \nbe refinanced, tight credit conditions should act to restrain activity.  We will need to continue \nmonitoring these trends carefully. \nSince it is likely that we have yet to see the full effects of our past policy actions, \npatience is also needed in order to best weigh the risk of inflation remaining persistently high against the risk of activity slowing more than expected.  I recognize that higher short -term rates \nmay place additional pressure on some banks' balance sheets and reduce bank credit provision \n \n2 Reflections on Phasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty  – 2023 Goldman Lecture at Wellesley \nCollege.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P .M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThurs day, Octo ber 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n more than anticipated.  I’ll also note that, before the FOMC meeting at the end of this month, we \nwill receive additional, important data on inflation and real activity that will help me, and the \ncommittee , in maki ng an informed policy decision.  \n \nLonger -Term Rates  \nFinally, as we consider appropriate policy, it is important to take movements in long -term \ninterest rates into account.  Since mid- September, the 10- year Treasury yield has moved up \nnoticeably, though it r etreated a bit this week. However, on net, this yield is now somewhat \nhigher, as are corporate bond yields and mortgage rates.  Several factors may be driving these overall gains in long- term yields, and it will be important to see whether the increase is \nsustained, especially given the rate volatility in recent days.  \nImportantly, the rise in long- term yields implies some tightening of financial conditions.  If \nit persists, it likely reduces the need for further monetary policy tightening in the near term.   This \nreinforces my view that we are very near, and perhaps at, the peak federal funds rates for this \ntightening cycle.  \nIn sum, I believe the current phase of the monetary policy requires patience and a \nholistic assessment of available data, while we stay  the course to restore price stability.  I \nexpect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see evidence that \ninflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.  \nPatience will give us time to carefully separate signal from noise as we assess the \nincoming data.  It will also allow us to balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to \nwork through the economy.  \n \nNew England’s Economy and Banking Sector  \n  \nI’ll now turn from the national economy to the regional economy, building from my \ncolleague Jeff Thompson’s remarks earlier today.  In my travels around New England, I’ve learned about unique challenges and economic strengths, as well as common threads that exist across much of the region.  The challenges I hear about that prevent people from participating in the economy or the workforce include real economic issues like childcare, housing, and infrastructure such as transportation and broadband.  In addition, pockets of the region face \npersistent social and economic challenges.  Those gaps for people and places are essential to \nrecognize, and can be hidden by overall aggregates that are quite favorable. \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Octo ber 12, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n I also hear about and see New England’s many economic strengths.  Among them: the \nregion’s collective brainpow er, a diverse and skilled workforce, and an ecosystem of innovation.  \nNew England is home to world- class institutions and organizations in many fields.  Additionally, \nwe are fortunate that job opportunities have historically been plentiful in this region –  though \nwith some variation by area.  \nAnother strength is the region’s unique regional and community banking industry. Your \nbanks serve households and businesses in communities large and small.  Of course, banks \nface challenges apart from those linked to the current interest rate environment.  Evolving \ncustomer preferences require increasing investment in technology, and you’re seeing increased \nmargin pressure related to competition for deposits and competition from new market entrants.    \nI want to recognize the critical role that banks of all  sizes play in creating vibrant, \ninclusive economies.  Community banks have remained resilient as they continue to leverage \nthe close working relationships they have within smaller cities, towns, and rural areas.  \nCommunity banks provide critical sources of funding for small businesses.  This was \ndemonstrated, for example, when the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program was \nimplemented, and community banks played a major role in ensuring those funds reached \nbusinesses.   \nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that a robust and dynamic banking system, along \nwith effective and efficient regulation and supervision, helps ensure that banks of all sizes can \nmeet the needs of households and businesses in every community, in good times and bad.  I \nfully agree that we must preserve and build on these strengths, and that diversity.  \n The Federal Reserve and the New England Region  \n \nAs I conclude, I’ll say just a bit about the Fed’s activities.  I like to say that our \noverarching mission at the Boston Fed is support ing a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for \neveryone.  As you know, an economy’s strength has many dimensions, so the Fed has a broad \nportfolio of activities and engagements, all in the public interest.  It includes monetary \npolicymaking, economic research and analysis, bank supervision, financial stability work, and \nserving as lender of last resort for banks.  We’re also involved in community and economic \ndevelopment activities and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments, technology, and \nfinance.  All of it supports our mission and our mandate.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Octo ber 12, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n I’ll briefly mention some of our work to expand opportunities throughout New England so \nthat everyone can participate in the economy.  Since 2014, we have focused on encouraging \nlocal efforts to bring economic revitalization to smaller cities and rural areas that have faced \nlong- term struggles.  We call this initiative “Working Places.”  Our approach is based on \nresearch that shows that an essential element of place- based economic resilience is \ncollabor ation among local individuals from different sectors who are willing to share leadership.  \nIn nine years, Working Places has expanded to 30 communities in five New England states.  \nThe Fed’s work helps local, collaborative networks emerge and flourish.  Com munities \nparticipating in Working Places report solving problems, making changes that create \nopportunities and jobs, and enlisting new voices and partners to shape progress.  Local teams \ndevelop goals and strategies in areas including workforce development , poverty reduction, \naffordable housing, and removing barriers to entrepreneurship.  Local, tangible efforts like these \nare adding up to real strength in our region.  \nAdditionally, I’d like to mention the Fed’s work in payments innovation.  Since its \nfounding, the Federal Reserve has played a role in ensuring the country’s payments \ninfrastructure can effectively meet the public’s needs.  We demonstrate this commitment \nthrough continuous improvements to our financial services, and by taking accountability for safe, accessible, and efficient payments.  As everyone in this room knows, the U.S. payments system – the way consumers, workers, and employers make and receive payments –  has evolved \nmightily over time.  Not that long ago, the Fed was helping move check s around the country.  \nBut we worked with the banking industry to digitize check clearing, and create other automated channels.  In July, the Fed launched the FedNow\n® Service, a new payments “ rail” to make \ninstant payments secure and convenient.  FedNow enables instant payments to be processed \nat any time of day, on any day of the year , for a broad array of transactions.  The FedNow \nService is core payments infrastructure available to all depository institutions.  \n  \nConcluding Observations \n \nIn conclusion, I’ ll note that since its inception 110 years ago, and by design, the U.S. \ncentral bank has deep and varied interactions with banks and bankers.  These range from \npreserving safety and soundness, to managing and improving payments infrastructure, to \npromoting access to credit that facilitates economic progress.  I look forward to continuing to \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4 :00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nThursday, Octo ber 12, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n work together to support the people and places of New England – and the nation – with a \nvibrant, inclusive economy and financial system.   \nWith that, thank you for the opportunity to be with you today.  I look forward to sitting \ndown with Mike for some questions.",

        "content": "Full Employment:  \nA Broad -Based, Inclusive Goal  \nOpening Remarks at the  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston’s  \n67th Economic Conference,  \n“Rethinking Full Employment”  \nSusan M. Collins  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \nNovember 17, 2023 \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  Remarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novemb er 17, 202 3 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17 , 2023  – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n    \n  Key Takeaways  \n1.  Collins emphasized that the two aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate are complementary.   \nWhile there often is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has \nshown that price stability is essential for a well -functioning economy – it is an important \nprecondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time.  So, both aspects of the dual mandate are interrelated and complementary.  \n \n2.  A challenge for the Fed, explored at this conference, is how to operationalize a broad \nconcept of full employment when setting monetary policy.   \nFull employment  has often  been defined by referencing an unemployment  rate. But no one \nstatistic can adequately characterize the labor market, since aggregate numbers do not show the \nwide range of experiences across people, sectors, and places.  \n3. Collins emphasized the connection between the full employment goal and the Fed’s role \nin fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone.  \nFor some people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in economic outcomes – including but not limited to employment. This underutilization of the workforce \nadversely affects national productivity and prosperity. \n \n4.  A better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if the \nFed is to meet both its full -employment and price -stability goals, said Collins.  \nThe aggregate unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full employment when the \nlabor force participation  rate is changing. If participation increases in a tight labor market, labor \nsupply expands, and higher levels of economic activity may not generate additional price \npressures requiring tighter monetary policy. And the higher levels of activity and participation can \nbenefit those drawn into the labor market.  \n5.  It is essential to examine factors that could limit people from participating in the \neconomy, and to support research and collaborations that promote economic progress.  \nThe Fed’s mandate and the concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to participation in the workforce, and the challenges that can prevent people from doing so (for example child care, housing, and infrastructure). Often these impediments are long- run, structural \nfactors that cannot be resolved with monetary policy. However, to assess the productive capacity of the economy, the Fed needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving. And a better understanding can lead to expanded opportunities for more people.\n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n1 \n  It is truly a pleasure to be opening my second Boston Fed economic conference, \nthe Bank’s sixty- seventh.  I’m especially pleased to be doing so with Egon Zakrajšek , \nour new Director of Research and chief economic advisor.   \n  Along with the entire economic research team, Egon and I are committed to \nmaintaining all that is special about the Boston Fed economic conferences .  Over the \nyears, these conferences have engaged a wide range of participants on complex issues \nwith practical policy relevance.  These conferences, and the learnings they yield, help \nus at the Boston Fed pursue our vision of a vibrant economy that works for all; and our \nmission to serve the public by supporting a strong, resilient, and inclusive economy.  \n  This year, we focus on full employment – one pillar of the Fed’s dual mandate.  \nAnd we build on last year’s conference, which addressed the potential effects of the \nCOVID -19 pandemic on the labor market.  Of course, our conferences do not always \ncover labor market issues; however, these topics have been especially critical lately.  \n  We have much to do over the next day and a half – so, let’s begin.  My role today \nis not only to welcome you and kick things off, but also to set the stage by providing a bit of my own perspective as a monetary policymaker.  Of course, I’ll add my standard \ndisclaimer – the views I express are my own, and I’m not speaking for any other Federal \nReserve policymaker.  \n \nFull Employment in Context  \n  I’ll begin with some historical context on full employment as a policy \nresponsibility.  In the wake of the Great Depression and World War II, Congress \ndeclared – in the Employment Act of 1946 – that the federal government was \nresponsible for fostering “conditions … to promote maximum employment.”  However, a Federal Reserve mandate for full employment was not formally adopted until the late \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n 1970s.1  The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 added the goal of “maximum \nemployment” to the Fed’s responsibility for price stability — leading to the dual  \nmandate.  This legislation was part of a broader effort in Congress to reaffirm the role of \ngovernment entities in promoting full employment, which culminated in the Humphrey -\nHawkins Act of 1978.2,3 \n  Of course, the Fed is not the only central bank that tries to balance price stability \nand full employment.  However, our legislative history has made the Fed one of the few central banks where a full -employment mandate is on an explicit equal footing wit h a \nprice -stability goal.  \n  In this context, I’ll reiterate my perspective on the dual mandate.  While there \noften is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has shown that price stability is essential for a well -functioning economy.  In particular, it  is an \nimportant precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time.  So, in a very real sense, both aspects of the dual mandate are interrelated and complementary.  \n \nFull Employment and a Vibrant Economy  \n  I want to emphasize the connection between full employment and the Fed’s role \nin fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone, not just for some people.  This is \ncentral to the questions we will explore at this conference.  \n \n1 Earlier legislation had referenced a role of the Federal Reserve,  but it was not until 1977 that such a role \nwas codified. See then- Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s 2013 speech “A Century of U.S. Central Banking: \nGoals, Frameworks, Accountability ”: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130710a.htm .  \n \n2 Humphrey -Hawkins stated  the government’s responsibility to “use all practicable programs and policies \nto promote full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, adequate productivity growth, \nproper attention to national priorities, and reasonable price stability.”  The act expired in 2000, though the \nFederal Open Market Committee is still mandated to present semi -annual reports to Congress assessing \nthe state of the economy and monetary policy.  \n \n3 For more on the history and evolution of the dual mandate, see Aaron Steelman’s Economic Brief for the \nRichmond Fed: https://www.richmondfed.tv/publications/research/economic_brief/2011/eb_11- 12 \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n   We know that aggregate data show average economic conditions, and not \nnecessarily the experiences of specific subsets or groups.  But we also know that, for \nsome people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in \neconomic outcomes – including but not limited to employment.  A truly healthy economy \nneeds the best ideas, energy, and participation from everyone – with ample \nopportunities to work, contribute, and prosper.  \n  The Fed’s mandate and our concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our \nfocus to participation in the economy and the workforce, and the challenges that can \nprevent people from doing so.  These include real economic issues like child care, \nhousing, and infrastructure such as transportation and broadband.   \n  The Boston Fed has a decades ‐long history of studying disparities for groups and \nplaces.4  We believe better understanding these gaps can lead to expanded \nopportunities for more people – and to those opportunities being more equitably \navailable.  This helps bring more people into the workforce, and strengthens economic \ngrowth and competitiveness.  We are committed to examining factors that could limit \npeople from participating in the economy, and where possible, to supporting research \nand collaborations that expand prospects for progress.  \n  This work relates directly to our mission and mandate.  And in that context, it is \nimportant to remember that the Fed’s portfolio of activities is considerably broader than \njust our core monetary policy work.  In our supervisory, payments, and community -\noutreach efforts, we promote financial stability and economic inclusion, access to credit for firms and households, and an efficient and reliable payments system.  Community \n \n4 We conduct research, and have hosted conferences , explor ing disparities in economic opportunities.  \nExamples include the 199 0s Boston Fed work  on discrimination in mortgage lending (see \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/news/2020/10/landmark -boston- fed-hdma- paper -\nrecapped.aspx ), an d the Boston Fed’s 2019 research conference, which explored the growing geographic \ndisparities in economic outcomes (see https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and -\nevents/news/2019/10/boston- fed-economic -conference -on-reducing- inequality -between- places.aspx  and \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/housedivided2019.aspx ). \n \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n development activities, including our Working Places initiatives5, provide examples of \nhow to encourage local partnerships in New England’s smaller cities and rural areas, to \nincrease economic opportunities and progress.  Our roles and responsibilities in the \npublic interest also include rigorous, nonpartisan research on key economic issues, \nalong with convening stakeholders, policymakers, and experts around issues of \nimportance – such as in conferences like this one.   \n \nAssessing and Measuring Full Employment  \n  Turning now to the relationship between full employment and monetary policy, a \nchallenge for the Federal Reserve is how to operationalize a broad concept of full \nemployment.  I’d like to highlight some of the issues we face when translating the broad \ngoal of full employment into specific monetary policy decisions.   \n  Full employment  has often been defined by referencing an unemployment  rate.  \nSpecifically, the economy has been thought to be at full employment when the \nunemployment rate equals the natural rate of unemployment – the rate of \nunemployment consistent with a normal pace of economic growth in the medium to longer run.  The aggregate  unemployment rate is a useful summary indicator for broad \noverall labor market conditions.\n6  But no single statistic can easily characterize a \ncomplex and evolving labor market.  \n \n \n5 The Boston Fed’s Working Places  programs are based on research into resurgent post -manufacturing \ncities, and support the Fed’s full employment mandate. Research suggested smaller -city economic \nresurgence depends on a city’s ability to mobilize its civic infrastructure — leaders, organiz ations, \nnetworks, and resources — to pursue a shared economic vision. So the programs support cross -sector, \nlocal leadership teams (with public, private, nonprofit, and community members) with shared goals. Team \ngoals and strategies are chosen locally, based on need and opportunity. Winning communities receive grants provided by partners (not the Fed) including states, the private sector, and philanthropy. See https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces/initiatives.aspx\n. \n \n6 In particular, the unemployment rate has proven helpful in modelling the short -run tradeoff between real \nactivity and inflation that is summarized by the Phillips C urve.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics also \npublishes multiple measures of unemployment that try to capture different dimensions of labor \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n   Since aggregate numbers do not show the wide range of experiences across \ngroups of people, sectors, and places, we also review disaggregated labor -market data.  \nFor example, one sees persistent disparities in unemployment for different racial and \nethnic groups, and across education levels.  \n  Unemployment rates that are persistently higher by race, or by place – as they \nhave been for a long time – reflect underutilization of our country’s labor resources, and \nthat adversely affects national productivity and prosperity.  Indeed, in the past – even \nwhen the unemployment rate was at what was considered the natural rate – many \npeople, groups, and places were excluded from full labor market participation.  That is, labor market conditions at “full employment” have not served as a rising tide that equally \nlifts all boats.  That had negative consequences for the affected people, as well as for \noverall economic performance.  \n  Recent history provides some important insights.  First, looking back at labor \nmarket developments during and after the 2007- 2009 Great Recession, we can see \nhow an aggregate unemployment  rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full \nemployment  when the labor force participation rate is changing.  After the Great \nRecession, the aggregate participation rate fell dramatically.  Some of this decline stemmed from long -run structural forces beyond the Fed’s control, such as population \naging.  But some of the decline resulted from the large drop in labor demand during the recession, which led to many workers becoming discouraged and dropping out of the \nlabor force.  To meet its full -employment mandate, the Fed had to determine how much \nof the participation decline was structural and how much was cyclical and could potentially be addressed by accommodative monetary policy.  \n  More recently, we’ve seen another example of how labor force participation \nmatters for full employment.  Since the acute phase of the pandemic ended, labor \ndemand has been outstripping the supply of available workers.  A goal of current \n \nunderutilization. For more detail, see https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/archive/the- unemployment -rate-and-\nbeyond- alternative- measures -of-labor -underutilization.pdf . \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n monetary policy is, of course, to restore a better balance in the labor market, with higher \ninterest rates working to slow labor demand in this realignment process.  \n  But recently, part of the move toward a better balance has come through an \nincrease in labor supply .  The labor force participation rate for prime- aged workers \n(ages 25- 54) is higher today than it was just before the pandemic –  a development that \nfew expected even a year ago.  And some of the larger gains in participation have \noccurred among women and m inority groups.  \n  A better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if \nthe Fed is to meet both its full -employment and price- stability goals.7  If labor supply \nexpands to meet demand in tight labor markets, then higher levels of economic activity \nin such times may not generate additional price pressures requiring tighter monetary \npolicy.  And the higher levels of activity and participation can benefit those brought into \nthe labor market, contributing to a vibrant economy that works for all.  \n \nA More Inclusive Perspective on Full Employment  \n  This process was at work in the late 2010s, when the aggregate labor force \nparticipation rate stopped falling as labor markets became progressively tighter.  \nMembers of some disadvantaged groups were drawn into the labor force as this \noccurred.  And the gains to those groups – and to the overall economy –  were \nsubstantial.8  \n  Fed Chair Jay Powell highlighted these significant and beneficial effects on \nseveral parts of the population in his August 2020 Jackson Hole speech announcing the \nnew monetary policy framework.  He recognized that “the robust job market was \n \n7 Other factors impacting full employment, not discussed here, are also important, such as the \nrelationship between job vacancies and unemployment.  \n \n8 After bottoming out in 2015, the labor force participation rate of prime age workers rebounded by about \n1.5 percentage points, roughly equivalent to 3 million additional workers.  Employment increased by an \neven larger amount – about 4.3 million –  given that the unemployment rate was falling over this period.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8: 45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n delivering life -changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, \nparticularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.  In addition, many who had been \nleft behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and \nincreasing the productive capacity of our economy.” 9,10 \n  Consistent with the recognition of the different labor market experiences across \nindividuals and groups, the Federal Open Market Committee, or F OMC , noted as part of \nthe 2020 framework review that full employment is a “broad- based and inclusive goal.”  \nThe new framework also removed references to the FOMC’s longer -run estimates of the \nunemployment rate in assessing progress toward full employment.  These changes de-emphasized the use of a natural or long- run rate of unemployment as the key metric for \nasse ssing full employment.  \n  In my view, the revised framework reflects the complexity of assessing full \nemployment in a rapidly evolving economy.  And, by moving away from a definition of full employment that is based primarily on aggregate unemployment, the new \nframework encourages Fed policymakers to better understand potential barriers to \nparticipation for some workers during “normal” times.   \n  In many cases, these impediments are long- run, structural factors that cannot be \nresolved with monetary policy.\n11  Government policies designed to reduce skills gaps or \nameliorate child care problems over the long run will be fiscal, not monetary, policies.12   \n \n \n9 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm . \n \n10 In 2019 and 2020 the System held several “Fed Listens” meetings to gain a better understanding of the \nlabor market experiences of different groups that were an important part of the monetary -policy \nframework review process. Fed Listens: Perspectives from the Public (federalreserve.gov) . The System is \ncontinuing these “Fed Listens” meetings.  See https://www.federalreserve.gov/fedlistens.htm . \n \n11 These barriers often reflect structural impediments such as lack of child  care options, lack of \ninformation about job opportunities, or lack of appropriate skills.  \n \n12 Improvements in technology and changes in business practices can also reduce barriers without policy \ninterventions. As an example, the growth of working- from- home is thought to be a key reason why the \nparticipation rates of persons with disabilities have risen so much since the pandemic.  Our conference \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n   However, to assess the long- run productive capacity of the economy, the Fed \nalso needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving over time.  And the \nlabor force participation increases during the late 2010s and after the pandemic indicate \nthat the impediments could be less problematic when labor markets are tight.  As a \nresult, understanding these barriers from both the long- run and short -run perspectives is \nessential, if the F ed is to fulfill its dual mandate.  And of course, as I noted earlier, this \nalso aligns with our broader portfolio of work, including our role as a nonpartisan \nresource, convener, and partner to support a vibrant economy for our region and the \ncountry.  \n \nOur Conference  \n  In that spirit, over the next day -and-a-half we’ll hear from paper authors, \npanelists, and discussants on many of the issues surrounding full employment, \nincluding how best to measure it.  Two panels will explore the challenge of assessing \nfull employmen t in real time, and whether the Fed should probe for full employment late \nin expansions.  These topics relate to the types of data that the Fed should use to \nevaluate full employment, as well as to the potential benefits and costs of tight labor \nmarkets.  \n  We will also learn more about potential barriers faced by some groups — \nincluding women, racial minorities, and people with criminal histories.  Other sessions \nwill review the evidence on programs designed to increase workers’ skills and will \ndiscuss the  growth of “gig” work in the economy.  Our keynote speaker, Cecilia Rouse, \nwill explore the roles that a strong labor market and supportive government policies may have played in generating the rapid and remarkably equitable recovery from the \npandemic.  \n \nlast year discussed potential long- run changes in labor markets brought on by the pandemic, so we won’t \nfocus as closely on those issues this year.  \n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery  \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8 :45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,  \nFriday, Novem ber 17, 2023 –  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n Concluding Observations  \n  In closing, I want to express my sincere thanks to our keynote speaker, the paper \nauthors and discussants, and the panelists for their contributions to this conference.  I \nknow we will also have excellent comments and questions from the floor and during the \nbreaks, so my thanks to each of you for joining us.  I also warmly welcome those tuning \nin to the live stream.  \n  Now it is my pleasure to turn things over to my colleague Chris Foote, who will \nmoderate our first panel.",
