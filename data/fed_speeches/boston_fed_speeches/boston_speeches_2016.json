Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nPortland Regional Chamber of Commerce  \n \n \nPortland, Maine  \nNovember 15, 2016  \n \n \n \n \nGood morning. I would like to thank the staff and members of the Portland Regional \nChamber of Commerce for having me here today  to share my views on the economy .  At the \noutset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (the FOMC).  \n The U .S. economy has continue d to gradually improve.  Payroll employment growth of \n161,000 jobs  in October  and the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent are two indications that we are \nat or close to most economists ’ estimate s of “full employment ” in the econo my.  My own \nestimate of the level of unemployment associated with full employment is 4.7 percent  – only two \n\n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n2 \n tenths less than the current unemployment rate.  I t has been  my expect ation that if trends \ncontinue, the remaining gap w ould close next year.   \n I would add that there has also been continued improvement in the outlook for inflation , \nwhich ha s been below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target for much of the recovery .  While \nour 2 percent target involves total inflation, it is useful to also examine the “core” inflation \nmeasure that excludes volatile food and energy  for a gauge on underlying inflation trends .  Core \ninflation ( measured using the Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index1) \nfluctuat ed between just 1.3 and 1.4 percent last year , but now stands at 1.7 percent.  Should \nrecent  exchange rate stabiliz ation  and higher oil prices  continue , I would  expect both total and \ncore PCE inflation to be at or near the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target in 2017 .  \n With the economy close to full employment and inflation nearing the Fed’s target, it was \nnot surprising that the futures market ’s probability of a tightening in December  has been high – \nin the vicinity of 75 percent  – with some volatility around the election.   Absent significant \nnegative economic news over the next month, the market’s assessment of the likelihood of \ntightening in December seems plausible . \n In my view , the goal should be  to have a continued , sustained economic re covery .  To \nachieve that , we must consider  the risks  inherent in waiting too long to gradually remov e \nmonetary accommodation.  I would much prefer that tightening be gradual, and that \npolicymakers try to avoid  circumstances in which we need  to tighten more  quickly .  My concern \nis that more rapid tightening , were it necessary,  could  risk disrupting the recovery that is now \nattaining  both elements of the Federal Reserve’s  dual mandate  – full employment and an \ninflation  target consistent with price stability .     \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n3 \n The Recent Outlook for Labor Markets  \n Now I would like to explore with you some of the subtleties and nuances I am seeing in \nlabor markets.  \nFigure 1  shows the recent movement of the unemployment rate.  The horizontal lines \ndefine  the central tendency2 of U.S. monetary policymakers’ expectations for the unemployment \nrate in the long run . Note that over the last year the unemployment rate has remained in the \nnarrow band defined by that range.  My own 4.7 percent estimate of full employment places me \nat the lower end of that range .  If we dip below 4.7 percent unemployment, we would be running \nthe economy somewhat hot , and probing for how low the unemployment rate c ould go consistent \nwith our inflation target.   \nLooking ahead to the end of 2017 , the blue dot represents the unemployment rate that I \nexpect at the end of next year  – 4.6 percent .  It is also the median unemployment rate expected \nby members of the FOMC , and is the Blue Chip Consensus  forecast .  The implication is that \nmany forecasters have been expect ing us to slightly overshoot the lower bound of the central \ntendency of full employment estimates by the end of next year.  \n Of course, the outlook for unemployment is in part tied to the outlook for r eal GDP \ngrowth next year.  The Survey of Professional F orecasters expects next year ’s growth to be \nhigher than this year and somewhat above 2 percent , as shown in Figure 2 .  My own estimate of \nthe sustainable  growth rate for the economy is a bout 1.75 percent, so th e growth  forecast above \nthat level implies  that we are likely to see some further tightening in labor markets.  \n Figure 3 shows the percent change from a year earlier for the labor force.  The labor \nforce is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those who are searching for \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n4 \n employment ( that is, are unemployed ).  When employment grows faster than the labor force , the \nunemployment rate goes down  – which has been the pattern for most of this  economic  recovery.  \nHowever, over the past year the unemployment rate has remained stable, despite relatively robust \npayroll employment  growth .  This is in part explained by relatively strong growth in the labor \nforce over the past year.  \n Many of us  focus on the n et increase in employment  in the monthly report , which  of late \nhas average d 100,000 to 200,000 jobs per month.  But that net change is the product of a much \nlarger flow of workers into and out of employment and unemployment.   \nFor example , the labor force  will grow if people not in t he labor force – such as  students, \nretire es, or discouraged workers – decide to enter the labor force, actively seeking work .  Figure \n4 displays the number of people flowing from out of the labor force into employment, as a share \nof the labor force.  Over the recovery period, there has been a dramatic increase in this share  as \nthe figure shows, accounting for much of the growth in the lab or force over that period.  But \nmore recently there has been a leveling off of these flows, albeit at relatively high levels.   \n However, this dynamic does not account for the levelling off of the unemployment rate \nover the past year.  Figure 5 focuses on labor market transitions over the past two years, and \nshows that , more recently , the number of people flowing into employment after being out of the \nlabor force has leveled off.  Rather, the levelling off of the unemployment rate in the last year \nseems to reflect the recent decline in the number of people flowing in the opposite direction – \nthat is, fewer people are leaving employment to step out of the labor force.   \n A reason to expect that the growth in the labor force may not be as robust going forward \nis the continuing impact of the aging of the workforce.  Figure 6  shows the share of the labor \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n5 \n force between the ages of 25 and 54, which  has been declining , while the share of th e labor force \nbetween ages 55 and 65 has been rising.  As more baby boomers reach retirement age, we should \nsee a continued increase in the number of workers shifting  from employed to retired and  thus out \nof the labor force.    \n Reflecting that ongoing demographic transition, Figure 7  shows that the labor force \nparticipation rate has been declining  for more than 15 years .  While the labor force participation \nrate leveled off recently, these demographic changes will almost surely c ontinue, and make it \nunlikely that the labor force will grow as quickly as recently experienced .  \n It is certainly good news that the labor force has grown more rapidly of late , and that \nworkers have been drawn from out of the labor force into employment .  But this trend is likely to \nbe limited going forward by the demographic changes  in the workforce.  As a result,  if the \neconomy  grow s even somewhat faster than potential, as  most forecasters are expecting, the \ncorresponding increase s in employment are likely to be accompanied by further declines in the \nunemployment rate.  Since the unemployment rate is already close to its full employment  level , \nfurther declines would increase the risk o f overshoot ing what is likely to be a  sustainable  \nunemployment rate  in the longer run .  That outcome cou ld lead at some point to the need for a \nmore rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation.  \n \nWages and Prices  \n As labor markets have tightened  recently , we have seen signs in many indicators that \nwages and prices are rising in  respon se.  Figure 8  shows that core PCE prices have been rising  – \n1.7 percent in the most recent  year-over-year reading, which is  just three tenths shy of  our 2 \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n6 \n percent target  for total inflation .  The Boston Fed  forecast has us reaching 2 percent core PCE \ninflation next year, slightly above the estimates of the median Summary of Economic Projections  \n(SEP) forecast for core PCE . \n Figure 9  shows the average probabilities that  Surv ey of Professional Forecasters \nparticipant s assign to core PCE falling into each of 10 ranges in 2017 , as of the fourth quarter of \n2016.  The chart shows that on average, forecasters assign a significant probability ( 70 percent) \nto inflation falling in a range near 2 percent – between 1.5 percent and 2.4 percent.  \n Figure 10 shows the forecast for total PCE inflation.  Total PCE inflation is still being \nheld down by the impact of earlier declines in oil prices and the rising value of the dollar.  As \nthese effects have subsided, total PCE has been rising.  The Boston forecast is currently at 2 \npercent for the end of 2017 while the median SEP is slightly lower .  While total PCE could still \nbe impacted by shocks, Figure 1 1 shows that  since the beginning of 2016, the exchange rate has \nbeen roughly stable, while oil prices have ris en on balance. Thus the combined effects of these \ntwo factors should act to increase inflation relative to previous years.  \n There is also evidence that wage pressures are beginning to show up more convincingly \nin the data.  Figure 1 2 shows that average ho urly earnings have been gradually rising as labor \nmarkets have tightened.  Over the past year average hourly earnings have risen 2. 8 percent, \nbelow what we saw prior to the Great Recession but above the 2 percent growth we experienc ed \nearlier in the recove ry. \n In sum , inflation  appears at last to be trending toward the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent \ntarget  for total inflation .  The Boston Fed forecast expects both the total and core PCE inflation \nmeasures to hit 2  percent  over the next year.  Progress to date and the expectation of further \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at  8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n7 \n progress likely explain , in part, why markets ha ve priced in a high probability of a rate hike in \nDecember . \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n At the September  FOMC meeting,  I voted to  increase interest rates , arguing that if we \nwaited too long to raise rates we could place at risk the sustainability of the recovery .  I was \nconcerned that waiting could risk the need to raise rates  faster and  more than desire d at some \npoint , and I felt that this was a risk that c ould be reduced by remov ing a bit of accommodation \nearlier.  At the FOMC meeting earlier this month, however, I felt that the changes in the FOMC \nstatement were well aligned with the notion (and the market perception ) of a high likelihood of \ntightening in December .  As a result, I did not dissent .   \nGoing forward, I will be attuned to assessing whether my forecast – continued progress \ntoward  achieving our inflation target and employment goals  – is on track.   \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                           \n \n1 The core PCE price index is defined as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices excluding food and \nenergy prices.

I am looking forward to the presentations and discussions over the coming days.  \nWhile much has been written about the causes and severity of the so -called Great \nRecession, much less has been written to date about the not -so-great recovery  that has followed.  \nWith this conference, we  hope to fill some of that gap – as we discuss  papers and analysis \ncovering some of the  key anomalies in this recovery.   \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n2 \n We are looking forward to hear ing from our keynote speaker, Federal Reserve Chair  \nJanet Yellen , a little later today .  I would also like to welcome some of my fellow Fed \npolicymake rs who are joining us .  It is wonderful to have them here, as well as all of our \npresenters and discussants , and all of you who are attending.  \nAt a high  level , what are the  facts that make this recovery unusual?   First, d uring this \nrecovery, growth in real  GDP h as been quite subdued – with growth rates that are percentage \npoints slower than the historical average .  Second, despite the tepid  growth, t he unemployment \nrate has fallen quite a bit faster than many expected .  And finally, inflation has lingered \nstubbornly below the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2 percent.   \nUnderstanding why this recovery has been different is important  for monetary \npolicymakers .  Understanding the source s of the difference will shape expect ations  going \nforward,  views on how to calibrate policy, and perspective s on the extent to which  monetary and \nother macro policies can support a retur n to more normal levels of long -run growth.   \nQuestions abound.  Is a slow recovery the unavoidable consequence of a severe \nrecession ?  Or of a financial crisis?   What role is played by the changing demographics in the \nUnited States? Will what may  seem like  temporary a nomalies become the “new normal ” for the \neconomy or economic cycles ?  Answers to questions like these will help us understand whether \nfirms and households have changed behavior  in ways t hat are likely to be more permanent than \ntransitory , whether slow growth in productivity is transitory  or permanent , and whether recent \ntrends in personal  saving behavior a re likely to persist well into the future.  In view of recent \nglobal inflation trends, the answers to these questions also have bear ing on whether the global \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n3 \n economy will continue to face bouts of undesirably low – rather than high – inflation , \nchalleng ing policymakers  in novel ways .  \nAgain, t he answers to these questions not only impact our understanding of the economy \nduring this recovery , but may also have important consequences for setting policy well in to the \nfuture.  For example, w ill a persistent change to long -run growth and long -run real interest rates \nrequire that nontraditional monetary policy actions become part of the traditional “ tool kit ” of \ncentral banks ?  Has this recovery changed views around using monetary policy rather tha n fiscal \npolicy to address slow recoveries?  And does the experience of a persistently  slow re bound alter \nviews on how quickly to  address any emerging risks to the current recovery? \nThis morning , I am going to briefly touch on some of the “ puzzles ” that we have asked \nthe presenters to address at this conference – leaving the difficult job of answering the questions \nto our paper givers and discussants .  I will then briefly examine how some of these puzzles have \nimpacted financial markets and how we m ight interpret  financial market reactions to this \n“nonconformist ” recovery.  \nBefore I begin, l et me note that the views I will express are my own, not necessarily those \nof my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n4 \n Economic Anomalies and the Current Recovery  \nFigure 1  displays the pace of the recover ies from the last three recessions.   This recovery \nhas been  notably weaker than the previous two.  G rowth has averaged just a little over 2 percent \nduring  the current  recovery .  The slope of the line is quite a bit flat ter, but relatively constant  – \nthat is, there has been no substantial surge in growth, as sometimes occurs at the beginning of \nrecoveries, but rather a decidedly  gradual recover y of GDP f rom a very deep recession.   \nDespite the only  gradual increase in real GDP, the unemployment rate has fallen faster \nthan in the previous two recoveries.  Given the slower growth, this  is somewhat surprising.  \nGiven the  unusually high unemployment rate coming out of the Great Recession, this more rapid \ndecline in unemployment was certainly  welcome –  but t he pairing of slower, sustained real GDP \ngrowth with a rapid decline in the unemployment rate is one of the clear puzzles of  the recov ery.  \nThe falling unemployment rate has also been accompanied by falling labor force participation , as \ndemographic aging of the U.S. workforce causes people to leave the labor force.  However , as \nFigure 2  shows, even within age cohorts there have been decl ines in participation rates during \nthe recovery, with declines in the labor force participation of both prime working age men and \nwomen.  These trends may have implications for how we might expect the economy to evolve , \ngoing forward.  \nAt least one of the r easons for relatively slow growth  has been the pattern of the saving \nrate.  As Figure 3 shows, t he earlier recoveries (the periods following the recession shading on \nthe chart) were accompanied by period s of secular decline in the personal  saving rate.  This \nallowed for somewhat stronger consumer spending , which serv ed as one of the foundations of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n5 \n earlier recoveries.  At least to date, the decline in  the saving rate prior to the Great Recession has \nbeen followed by a higher saving rate, whi ch may suggest  different saving s behavior stemming \nfrom the experience of  the Great Recession.  Should this pattern persist, it has implications going \nforward  for consumption patterns and the economy more broadly.  \nCore inflation has also remained subdued during the recovery from the Great Recession , \nas shown in Figure 4.  However, core inflation was also below 2 percent after the 2001 \nrecession, but returned to a bit  above 2 percent once labor markets tightened.  In contrast, while \nunemployment is now quit e close to most economists’ estimates of the natural rate, the core PCE \ninflation rate has remained consistently below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target over most \nof the recovery period, and currently stands at 1.7 percent.  \nThe real federal funds rate in the current recovery also differs markedly from previous \nrecoveries, as shown in Figure 5.  Reflecting the depth of the Great Recession, the real federal \nfunds rate has been significantly lower , and consistently negative , in contrast to the two earlier \nrecoveries.  T he need for more monetary policy accommodation is not surprising, given the \nseverity of the recession.   What is surprising, however, is that even near full employment, the \nreal rate is still so much lower  than in the earlier r ecover ies.  By the fourth year of those two \nearlier recoveries, the real federal funds rate had  almost reached  2 percent  (following the 2001 \nrecession ) or had exceeded  2 percent  (following the 1991 recession ).   \nIn contrast, in the current recovery the real federal funds rate has not rebounded, \nremaining quite negative .  And as Figure 6 shows, now seven years into the recovery , the real \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n6 \n federal funds rate remains below the nadir of the earlier two recoveries , even  though the \neconomy has returned to near full employment . \n \nEconomic Anomalies and Asset P rices  \nThe very short -term real federal funds rate is not the only segment  of the yield curve that \nis unusually low , as shown in Figure 7.  The 10- year Treasury rate minus 10-year inflation \nexpectations ( from  the S urvey of P rofessional F orecasters ) remains unusually low, even late in \nthe recovery.  There are a number of possible reasons for this , including the Federal Reserve ’s \nholding s of a significant quantity of longer -duration Treasury bonds ; depressed long rates \nglobally , stemming from weak national economies inducing asset purchases by  their central \nbanks ; and concerns that central banks in many parts of the world may have difficulty achieving \ntheir inflation targets.   \nHowever, looking at Figure 8, it is noteworthy that in the seventh year of the  recovery, \nthe 10- year real U.S. Treasury yield  remains negative  – in other words, purchasers of 10- year \nTreasuries are willing to accept a return that does not even compensate them for the inflation \nexpected over the holding period.  Th is suggests a  lack of confidence in U.S. and global growth \nprospects, and in the abili ty of policy authorities to offset weak growth.  \nWith both the real federal funds rate and the longer -term Treasury rate unusually low, \none might also expect other asset prices to behave differently than in earlier recoveries.  Figure 9 \nshows the price to operating earnings ratio for the S&P 500 in the period covering the past three \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n7 \n recoveries. While the price to earnings ratio for stocks is elevated, it still remains well below \nlevels reached prior to 2001.   \n Figure 10 shows an index of price to rent for residential housing.  While the index has \nbeen trending up more recently, it still remains much lower than in the years leading up to the \nGreat Recession.   \nFigure 1 1 shows  real commercial real estate prices during the past three recessions and \nrecoveries.  The recovery  from the 1991 recession saw declines in real commercial real estate \nprices at the beginning of the recovery ; even seven  years later , prices had not returned to their \nlevel  in the trough, in real terms.  Of course, c ommercial real estate had been a major c ause of \nthat recession, spurring significant bank failure s.  Unlike the 2001 recession, in which \ncommercial real estate suffered only collateral damage, it was many years before commercial \nreal estate prices stabilized after the 1991 recession.  Interestingly, the past two recoveries have \ncontained  relatively rapid appreciation in commercial real estate prices.  \nFigure 12  shows the overall capitalization rate for commercial real estate over the past \ntwo recessions and recoveries.  Cap rates now stand at historic lows. \nOverall, anomalies in this recovery are leaving an imprint on only some financial asset \nclasses.  Price to earnings ratios for stocks and price to rent for residential real estate are only somewhat elevated and are well below previous peaks in these series.  In contrast, 10- year \nTreasury rates and commercial real estate capitalization rates are unusually low  relative to the \npast.  Figure 1 3 shows that the duration of the Federal Reserve  System Open Market Account \n(SOMA)  holding s rose  as asset -purchase programs increased the holdings of longer -term \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n \n8 \n Treasury and agency  mortgage -backed securities.  More recently , there has been some decline in \nthe duration of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio as the previously  purchased , longer -term \nsecurities holdings  continue d to age.  However, if one were concerned about the historically low \n10-year Treasury and commercial real estate capitalization rates , perhaps because of potential \nfinancial stability concerns, the balance sheet compos ition could be adjusted to steepen the yield \ncurve.   \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n This recovery has been full of surprises, most of which have not been good.  Hopefully , \nthe discussions that we have over the next two days will help us better understand these \nanomalies, and whether they are likely to have a more permanent impact on the economy.  They may also have implications for the pricing of financial assets as the policy normalization process  \nproceeds .   \nWhile one must always be cautio us about assum ing that current trends reflect something \ndifferent from historical experience, it is important to consider whether this time has  indeed  been  \ndifferent.  If it has , then the lessons from this recovery  – perhaps an understanding of a “new \nnormal” environment  – may very well impact how we should be thinking about monetary policy \ngoing forward.  \nThank you.",

At the outset, let me note as I always do that \nthe views I express today are my own, not neces sarily those of my colleagues at the Federal \nReserve’s Board of Governors or on the Fe deral Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nOver the past year the United States economy has remained fairly resilient despite the \neconomic “drag” emanating from overseas.  Gl obal concerns – including a more significant \nslowdown in China – caused some market volatility at the beginni ng of this year, and the United \nKingdom’s vote to leave the European Union ha s refocused attention on continued lethargic \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n3 \n growth in Europe.  In fact, the Internationa l Monetary Fund recently downgraded its growth \nforecast for the world economy.  The expansion in many developed countries has remained so \nweak that their central banks have put in place even more stimulative monetary policies.    \nDespite these headwinds from abroad, labor ma rkets in the U.S. continue to gradually \ntighten, and inflation is slowly re turning to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target.  In \nfact, it is quite possible that we  will reach or even exceed full em ployment over the course of the \nnext year.   \nGiven how near the U.S. economy is to re aching the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate \nfrom Congress (stable prices and maximum sust ainable employment), it is reasonable to ask \nwhether the current degree of m onetary policy accommodation – hist orically low interest rates – \nremains necessary.  My personal view, based on data  that we have received  to date, is that a \nreasonable case can be made for continuing to pursue a gradual  normalization of monetary \npolicy. \n As usual, there are some conflicting signals  in the economic data that came out this \nsummer.  For example, payroll employment has been quite strong, averaging 232,000 net new \njobs per month over the past three months, a nd just over 200,000 per month over the past year.1  \nWhat’s more, that rate remains significantly higher  than long-run labor for ce growth.  Consistent \nwith the tightening in labor markets, measures of  wage and salary growth  have been increasing \nsomewhat, albeit from still relatively low levels.   \nIn contrast, real GDP growth for the first two quarters has been disappointing, averaging \naround only 1 percent, well below the pace the Fe deral Reserve’s policymakers were expecting \nwhen we first raised rates last December.2  However, I would observe that at least part of this \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n4 \n weakness reflects temporary inventory adjustments th at are likely to be reversed in the second \nhalf of this year.  While final sales (real GDP net of inventorie s) expanded 1.8 percent a quarter \nso far this year, real GDP was much weaker, wh ich reflected a run-down of inventories.  The \ncombination of the relatively strong domestic demand and the re stocking of inventories should \nprovide a basis for growth to exceed 2 percent over  the next two quarters.  This will increase the \nrisk that the unemployment rate wi ll be pushed over time to a poi nt below most estimates of full \nemployment – an outcome that is like ly to prove unsustainable over time.  \n  \nOverview of Recent Data \n Figure 1  shows the real GDP growth that economi c forecasters participating in the Blue \nChip forecast were predicting for the first two quarters of 2016, as of the middle of December \n2015, and the actual results.  Clearly,  the first two quarters did not live up to the forecasts.  The \nBlue Chip forecasters were expecting growth in the first two quarters to be comfortably above 2 \npercent, but as I noted a mome nt ago, actual growth fell short of that.  The forecasts over-\npredicted the strength of growth in each of the first two quarters by more than 1 percentage point. \n Figure 2  shows real GDP and real final sales growth  in the first two quart ers of this year.  \nReal final sales give a better reading on the demand for goods and services in the U.S. because \nthey exclude inventory fluctuations, which can a ffect GDP in the short term.  The figure shows \nthat inventories were a drag on GDP in the first half of the y ear as a sizable portion of demand \nwas met by reducing inventories.  Second-quarter  real final sales growth was 2.4 percent, \nindicating that these inventory adjustments – rather than a weak underlying economy – explain \nmuch of the economy’s apparent softness. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n5 \n  Figure 3  provides real final sales to domestic purchasers, which removes the impact of \nboth net exports and inventories from the growth  in real GDP.  This represents the demand \ncoming from U.S. firms, government, and consumers. Over the past two years, real final sales to \ndomestic purchasers grew at a healthy 2.6 percent.  So the data  show that the domestic economy \nhas been performing quite well despite the effect s of a strong dollar and weak growth among our \ntrading partners.  I expect some continuing dr ag from foreign activit y, but underlying domestic \nstrength is likely to be sufficien t to engender continued improvement.  \n Figure 4  shows several forecasts for the third quar ter.  Clearly forecas ters are expecting \nthird quarter growth to notch an increase.  Bo th the August Blue Chip Forecast and the August \nSurvey of Professional Forecasters predict gr owth well above 2 percent – and the “nowcast” \nstatistical forecast by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank (GDPNow3) expects an even stronger \nthird quarter. \n \nOverview of Labor Market Data \n Payroll employment growth of late can be described as somewhat choppy, as depicted in \nFigure 5 .  We saw a very weak payroll employme nt report in May, followed by two fairly \nsignificant increases in payroll employment in th e June and July reports.  With last Friday’s \nreport for August payroll employment showing an increase of 151,000 jobs, average monthly \npayroll growth is 232,000 jobs over the past th ree months and 204,000 jobs over the past twelve \nmonths.  Either figure is well above the 80,000 to 100,000 jobs a month that monetary \npolicymakers estimate are needed just to keep the unemployment rate constant over time.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n6 \n In sum, the data we have seen over the summ er continue to reflect a tightening of the \nU.S. labor market.  The national unemployment rate shown in Figure 6  is now 4.9 percent.  As \nthe chart shows, the unemployment rate has de clined steadily over the past four years.  \nPolicymakers’ views of the unemployment rate that will prevail in the long  run – indicated by the \ncentral tendency of FOMC part icipants shown in the chart shading – were 4.7 percent to 5 \npercent at the June FOMC  meeting.  So we are currently at or close to the estimates of full \nemployment held by FOMC participants.   \nLooking forward, most forecasters expect that labor markets will continue to tighten and \nthe unemployment rate will continue to fall.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast for the \nunemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year is 4.7 percent (see Figure 7 ), which is the \nsame as my own forecast for the end of this  year, and is equal to  my estimate of full \nemployment.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast fo r the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter \nof 2017 is 4.5 percent, somewhat below the FOMC participants’ consensus view of the long-run \nunemployment rate.  The figure shows that by th e fourth quarter of 2017, the average of the 10 \nhighest unemployment rate forecasts among the roughl y 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip survey is \nstill below 5 percent. \nAs the labor market has tightened, we have seen modest evidence of  the upward pressure \non wages and salaries that would support inflatio n reaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent goal.  \nFigure 8  provides wages and salaries from the em ployment cost survey and average hourly \nearnings from the payroll employment survey.4  The series have been  gradually rising over the \npast two years, although they still remain at levels that are low by historical standards.  However, \nmodest increases in wages and salaries seem to  me consistent with tightness in labor markets \nbeginning to appear more st rongly in the wage data. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n7 \n Risks to the Outlook \nOne potential concern is that while our best  guess for the economy is consistent with \ncontinued improvement, the economy faces particul arly risky global conditions.  And this adds \nan element of risk to actions that would furt her normalize monetary policy.  Some observers \nargue that the fragile global econom ic situation could just ify an even more patient U.S. monetary \npolicy, simply on risk management grounds.   \nIn this debate I would offer the observation th at, while it is importa nt to acknowledge the \npresence of global risks, market indicator s have so far provided little evidence of outsized  risks.  \nFor example, Figure 9  shows the VIX market volatility index.5  While the index was elevated at \nthe beginning of the year in re sponse to concerns related to Ch ina and more recently in June \nreflecting concerns about the poten tial impact from the Brexit vote,  the current value of the index \nis near its low for the year.  Given the number of global events over the past nine months, the \nVIX highlights the resilience of the U.S. economy in the face of potential shocks from abroad. \nIf an elevated risk of a severe financial shoc k existed, one might expect it to be reflected \nin stock prices, particularly prices in those markets that might be most sensitive to global shocks.  However, Figure 10  shows that the S&P has more than reco vered from its sharp declines earlier \nin the year.  Similarly, emerging market stock pr ices have made very substantial improvements \nover the same period.  The same cannot be said of the Euro STOXX index, which has not recouped its losses of earlier in the year. This likely reflects the ongoing weakness in the Euro \narea.  The figure suggests that, with the exception  of Europe, the potential concern with fragile \nglobal economies does not seem to be strongly pr iced into financial assets, at least to date. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n8 \n However, not all the risk is on the downside.  It is important to note that an overheated \neconomy – one that significantly exceeds sustainable output and employment – would pose risks \nto maintaining full employment over tim e.  Here history is instructive – Figure 11  shows the \nunemployment rate and the effective federal funds rate for the past 50 years, along with recession \nshading.  The chart suggests that  monetary policy has not been a precise tool, capab le of gently \nguiding the economy back to full employment in periods when we have exceeded sustainable, full employment.  As shown, the federal funds rate  frequently peaks prior to a recession as the \neconomy threatens to overheat, with unemplo yment potentially dipping below its long-run \nsustainable rate.  The figure s uggests that the calibration of monetary policy during such a \ntightening cycle is difficult: The U.S. econom y often slows down more than is optimal, \nfrequently resulting in a recession.   \nThis historical pattern illust rates the difficulty of slowi ng the economy to a sustainable \nrate without going too far and causi ng a recession.  This problem could be compounded if delays \nin tightening earlier in the cycle lead to conditions that require mo re rapid increases in interest \nrates later in the cycle,  risking a more pronounced slowing in growth and rise in unemployment. \nA second risk of waiting too long to tighten is that some asset markets become too \nebullient.  Figure 12  shows that real commercial real estate  prices have risen quite rapidly over \nthe past five years, particularly for multifamily properties.  Because commercial real estate is \nwidely held in the portfolios of leveraged institutions, commercial real estate cycles can amplify the impact of economic downturns as financial institutions need to write down the value of loans and cut back on lending to main tain their capital ratios. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n9 \n In sum, the risks to the forecast are beco ming increasingly two-sided, in my view.  \nWeakness emanating from abroad poses short-te rm downside risks to the domestic U.S. \neconomy.  However, the U.S. economy has been rela tively resistant to shoc ks from abroad of \nlate, as evidenced recently by the aftermath of th e Brexit vote.  Yet as I have described today, \nthere are also longer-term ri sks from significantly overshooti ng the U.S. economy’s growth – \ngiven the bluntness of monetary po licy tools, and the possibility of  growing imbalances in some \nasset classes. \n \nConcluding Observations \nFor some time now, we at the Federal Reserv e have taken a very patient approach to \nmonetary policy normalization, re flecting the low-inflation envir onment and more recently the \nglobal shocks experienced over the past year.  However, with the current degree of monetary \npolicy accommodation, the U.S. economy continue s to grow fast enough to yield continued \nimprovement in labor markets.  That degree of  accommodation increases the chances of driving \nthe core inflation rate closer to the Federal Re serve’s 2 percent target, but it also increases the \nchances of overheating the economy.   \nSo if we want to ensure that we remain at full employment, gradual tightening is likely to \nbe appropriate.  A failure to continue on the path of gradual remova l of accommodation could \nshorten, rather than lengthen, th e duration of this recovery. \nThank you. \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M.

I would like to thank our hos ts, the Shanghai Adva nced Institute of \nFinance, for inviting me to participate in th is exchange of ideas and perspectives.   \nLet me note as I always do that the views I express today are my  own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’ s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n It is a pleasure to be here in Beijing to share some observations.  Let me begin with the \nobvious: growth in the global economy has conti nued to underwhelm.  In response to these \ndisappointing economic results, cen tral banks in many developed c ountries have reduced short- \nand long-term rates to historic lows.  Indeed, a number of countries now have negative rates on a \nsignificant proportion of their sovereign debt.  In the financial sector, the low rate environment \nhas continued to challenge the business models of many financia l intermediaries, and troubles \nwithin some banking organizations continue to  present downside risks in many parts of the \nworld, particularly in Europe.  And it is not only developed economi es that are facing challenges; \nmany emerging economies are still suffering from th e decline in global commodity prices which \nhas resulted, in part, from the slow growth across much of the world.   \n Weak global growth has hindered the United States expansion sin ce the end of the so-\ncalled Great Recession.  The most recent two quart ers have been no exception, with GDP growth \nbelow 2 percent in both the fi rst and second quarters of 2016.   \nYet despite the weak growth in the U.S. economy, by historical standards U.S. labor \nmarkets are now at, or close t o, the rate of unemployment that  most economists consider full \nemployment.  And, while “core” inflation (usi ng the Personal Consumption Expenditures price \nindex or PCE1) remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 pe rcent target, there have been gradual \nincreases in our core measure of PCE inflation – from readings of 1.3 to 1.4 percent last year to \n1.6 percent currently.   \nWith the U.S. economy closing in on full empl oyment, and edging closer to the 2 percent \ninflation target, the Federal Reserve’s dual manda te – stable prices a nd maximum sustainable \nemployment – is likely to be achieved relativ ely soon.  But, considering the aforementioned \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n challenges in the global economy, important questi ons confront monetary policymakers in the \nUnited States.  When and how quickly should the Fe d normalize interest rate s?  And what is the \n“normal” rate? \n Given the persistently weak economic growth  in the United States during the recovery \nfrom the Great Recession, it has been appropriate to be patient about normalizing rates.  The \nFOMC raised short-term rates by one-quarter of a percentage point last December and has yet to \nraise rates again this year.  I have often spoken about the appropriateness, and clear benefits, of a \npatient and gradual approach to increasing rates.  One benefit is that gradual tightening allows \nfurther progress in labor markets,  helping those who are still une mployed or temporarily out of \nthe labor force.  In turn, tighter  labor markets should help the infl ation rate return to the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent inflation target, which is especially important as many countries around the \nworld are contending with low inflation rates, wh ich tends to depress our own inflation rate to \nsome extent.    \nBy slowly normalizing rates, we would hope to continue to support growth.  However, \nkeeping interest rates low for a long time is not without risks.  Today I will focus my remarks on \none of those risks.  \n Prolonged periods of very low rates pose chal lenges for some financial intermediaries \nand for households who derive significant income fr om savings.  Because of their crucial role in \nfacilitating economic activity, we must be attuned to the health of financial intermediaries.  \nMany financial intermediaries derive income from  spread lending – borrowing at low short-term \nrates and lending or investing at a higher return  over longer periods of time.  However, in an \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n environment where both short and long rates are quite low, the profit margins of financial \nintermediaries can shrink.2   \nMeanwhile, households can also be challenged by low rates prevailing over long periods.  \nSaving sufficient funds for retirement, for example, is much more challenging if low-risk investments generate ve ry little return.   \nFirms and households faced with long peri ods of low returns may react by “reaching for \nyield” – that is, buying riskier assets than one would otherwise, in orde r to achieve a desired \nprofit or savings goal.  The challenge is that in  a pervasive low-rate environment, the returns on \nrisky assets are also reduced.  A key risk to an environment charac terized by reaching for yield is \nthat, should a large negative shock occur, fi rms and households would be exposed to greater \nlosses through their holdings of ri skier assets than they would be  if they were not reaching for \nyield.  To the extent that reaching for yield is more likely in a low interest rate environment, \npolicymakers may need to weigh this particular ri sk related to low rates against the benefits of \nsupporting the economy.\n3  \n Today in my remarks I would like to explore the potential risks of the rapid increase in \ncommercial real estate prices in the United Stat es.  As interest rates have remained low, \ncommercial real estate prices have risen; capitaliz ation or “cap” rates on real estate (representing \nthe ratio of net operating income pr oduced by a property to the price paid4) have fallen to historic \nlows; and foreign investment in U. S. commercial real estate has in creased.  This raises a possible \nconcern that investors may be engaged in ex cessive risk-tak ing.  Should the U.S. economy \nexperience a large negative shock, this could pos e a problem for the stability of the U.S. \neconomy.  Current cap rates the Un ited States indicate that a long period of very low interest \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n rates can add to potential downside risks, and in my view this suggests that financial stability \nconcerns could be a considera tion in how long policymakers wa it before resuming the gradual \nremoval of monetary accommodation. \n \nCommercial Real Estate and Financial Stability \nLooking at the data, Figure 1  shows the percentage change in  real commercial real estate \nprices and real GDP in the U.S. over the past 30 years.  Over that pe riod, we have had three \nrecessions in the United States (shaded on the figure).  The most severe one – the Great \nRecession – was clearly exacerbated by declines in  real estate prices, both residential and \ncommercial.  Because these real estate assets were important collateral for loans, and because \nthere were also significant holding s of derivative financial instru ments tied to real estate, many \nfinancial institutions experienced large losses.  These real estate related losses within financial intermediaries led to credit av ailability problems for households and businesses th at contributed \nto the severity of the Great Recession. Weakened  banks may constrain lending to maintain their \ncapital ratios, significantly reducing access to  credit for all but the most credit-worthy \nborrowers.\n5 \nThe U.S. recession in the early 1990s also ha d a significant real es tate component.  Many \nof the initial problems in that recession be gan in the New England region, where large \ncommercial real estate exposures created problems for financial in stitutions.  As commercial real \nestate prices fell, we saw “fire sales” of commerci al real estate properties as financial institutions \nunwound their positions.  Eventually , the problems in commercial real estate extended to both \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n coasts and the Southwest region of the U.S., and resulted in what then Federal Reserve Board \nChairman Alan Greenspan referred to as “headwinds” in monetary policy.6 \nIn contrast, the recession in 2001 did not ha ve a large impact on financial institutions, \nlargely because the financial upheaval centered on  equities, an asset against which financial \ninstitutions were not highly leveraged.  As a re sult, the financial sector  was not suffering large \nlosses and pulling back on lending, so credit availa bility was not particul arly constrained.  The \nrecession was relatively mild by historical sta ndards, and the recovery  proceeded relatively \nquickly.   \nThese differing experiences in U.S. economic downturns, as well as in other countries, \nshow us that it is critically impor tant to closely monitor and unde rstand the assets held in highly \nleveraged financial institutions. \n Figure 2  utilizes the Financial Acco unts of the United States to  show the di stribution of \nexposures to commercial real es tate among lenders.  Out of the $3.6 trillion in total commercial \nmortgages and multifamily residential mortgage s, about $1.9 trillion are held by the banking \nsystem.  Among asset classes held by leveraged in stitutions, commercial real estate is large – \nalthough it is not particularly concentr ated in larger institutions.   \nSuch exposures, by themselves, are unlikely to trigger financial stability problems.  But if \nthe economy weakens, a large decline in commercial real estate collateral values could lead to \npayment defaults, and la rge losses to banks.7  This would have downs tream effects on credit \navailability to firms and households, as menti oned a moment ago.  The precipitating conditions \nwould conform well to the classic determinants of  financial stability problems: collateral values \nfall, and payment stream s are interrupted.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n In sum, commercial real estate problems can  increase the amplitude of distress during an \neconomic downturn.  And I would like to discuss toda y some data that highlight recent trends in \ncommercial real estate. \n  \nRecent Trends in Commercial Real Estate \n Several factors other than low interest ra tes have made commercial real estate an \nattractive asset class at this time.  Figure 3  shows the occupancy rate for apartments in the \nUnited States.  The dark green shading, which re flects at least 96 percen t occupancy, shows that \nmany regions of the country are now close to full occupancy.  This is particularly true on the two \ncoasts, around some of the larger c ities.  It is also quite striking that some of the areas severely \nimpacted by the decline in real estate prices during the Great Recession, such as Florida, now \nhave relatively high occupancy rate s – reflecting in part the movement  into rental units of former \nfinancially distressed homeowners. \n Given the high occupancy rates in many regions of the U.S., it is not surprising that rents \nhave been increasing, as shown in Figure 4 .  The dark green shading represents an annual \nincrease in rents of at least 6 percent.  Again, the two coasts  are among the areas experiencing \nhigh occupancy rates, and tend to ha ve rents increasing more rapidly. \n With high occupancy rates, rising rents, and very low interest rates on alternative assets, \nit is not surprising that commercial real estate prices have been on the rise.  Figure 5  shows that \nU.S. commercial real estate prices across the four property types have each experienced rapid \nappreciation in real terms, although only the apartment price index is above the 2007 peak.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n Interestingly, retail commercial real estate prices  have continued to rise, despite some of the \nlong-run changes affecting that pr operty type such as the rise of online shopping.  Particularly \nstriking is how much multifamily property prices have risen.   \nIt is also worth noting that commercial real  estate properties exhi bited very significant \nprice declines duri ng the Great Recession.  Certainly much a ttention has been focused on the role \nplayed by residential real estate price declines, which were important fact ors contributing to the \nseverity of the recession.  But commercial prop erty price declines al so were significant. \n Figure 6  shows real commercial real  estate prices by region.  Among the five regions \nshown, the U.S. Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, Southwest, and West have seen the most rapid price increases in recent years – and incr eases that are considerably more  rapid than in other parts of \nthe country. \n Figure 7  shows that real multifamily property prices have been particularly robust in six \nmajor metro markets.\n8,9  In Greater Boston, where I live and work, there have been rapid \nincreases in multifamily prices; I am reminded of this when I pass by numerous construction \nsites each day to and from my office.  On top of  low interest rates and rapidly increasing rents, \nBoston in particular has a large number of universities and robust high tech industries that have \nbeen attractive to millennials and have helped boost the demand for apartments. \n Figure 8  shows the capitalization or cap rates10 for the various propert y types.  Given that \nincreases in the market prices of commercial pr operties have outpaced rent increases (and thus \nnet operating income), cap rates have been declin ing and are quite low by historical standards. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n9 \n  Figure 9  shows the cap rate for apartments and th e 10-year Treasury rate.  As the 10-year \nTreasury rate has fallen, along with  rates on sovereign debt in mu ch of the world, households and \nfirms have been turning to the rela tively high returns possible in real  estate.   This should not be \nsurprising; one of the ways that monetary policy works in a low-interest-rate environment is to \nencourage investors to move into  somewhat riskier asset class ca tegories, to stimulate economic \nactivity.  Of course, should macroeconomic condi tions change, there is a potential for large \nlosses to those who moved into riskie r assets, as previously discussed. \n Figure 10  shows the increase in foreign investment in U.S. commercial real estate.  The \nUnited States is not alone in bei ng in a low-interest-rate environmen t.  Japan and parts of Europe \nhave negative interest rates, and in some countri es the negative rates extend well out on the yield \ncurve.  With the relatively strong U.S. economy, fo reign investors have been  attracted to an asset \nclass that still provides a relativ ely high rate of return.  As the chart shows, there have been \nsignificant inflows of funds from both Europe and Asia. \n \nPotential Implications \n Having explored some of the relevant data , it is useful to thin k through the potential \nimplications.  In my view, comm ercial real estate is, by itself, unlikely to trigger financial \nstability problems.  But should prevailing econo mic conditions change in response to a large \nnegative economic shock, commercial real estate prices could dec line relatively quickly, leading \nto large losses at leveraged firms.  Because co mmercial real estate debt is widely held by \ndepository institutions, this could cause a contra ction of credit – similar to the credit crunch \nexperience in the United States  in the early 1990s.  While Figure 2  showed that the holding of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n10 \n commercial real estate loans is relatively disp ersed, it is an important asset class for most \nleveraged institutions. \n Figure 11  shows the percentage of commercial real estate loans outstanding held by \nbanks with commercial real estate loans in excess  of 350 percent of their risk-based capital, for \nbanks under $1 billion in assets, in  each U.S. state.  This incl udes owner-occupied as well as \nnon-owner-occupied property.   Owner-occupied comme rcial real estate is not used for purposes \nof the commercial real estate guidance in bank supervision, but can be an issue for the economy \nif falling real estate prices occur and make it difficult to roll over or expand credit.  In some of \nthe coastal states, a high percenta ge of commercial real estate loans made by banks with under \n$1 billion in assets are held in institutions that ha ve a commercial real estate to risk-based capital \nratio above 350 percent.   \nSo the concern I put forward today is the scenario where widespread declines in \ncommercial real estate prices co uld ripple through the financial se ctor and lead to a significant \ntightening of credit for many borrowers.  And give n that, I would pose the natural next question: \nif one agrees that there is building pressure in commercial re al estate, should it have any bearing \non the setting of monetary policy?  \n U.S. monetary policymakers should focus on achieving maximum employment consistent \nwith stable prices currently , of course, but also over time .  Very low interest rates may move the \neconomy closer to the central bank’s dual mandate goals more quickly than  would higher interest \nrates, but it is important to evaluate “at what cost.”   \nWhen the economy is far away from achievi ng the dual mandate goals , asset prices tend \nto be weak – providing an added rationale for accommodative policy.  However, when the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n11 \n economy is close to achieving the dual mandate – as the U.S. economy is now – very low rates \nmay cause the economy to attain and exceed sustai nable employment, risking greater imbalances \nthat could negatively impact the economy in the future.  And this may be an unfavorable trade-\noff. \n Figure 12  shows the U.S. unemployment rate for the past 10 years, along with the \nCongressional Budget Office estimate of full em ployment.  After the Great Recession, the \nunemployment rate was very high, a nd the potential negative effects of low interest rates on asset \nprices were quite low given the depressed mark et for most assets.  However, over time the \nunemployment rate has fallen, and is now within many estimates of full employment – and some \nasset prices, such as for commercial real estate, have risen quite dramatically.   \nShould the macroeconomic environment cha nge, one could envision a scenario where \ncommercial real estate prices could decline signif icantly if underlying rent s, occupancy rates, and \nmarket interest rates become less favorable.  The probability of such a reassessment is, of course, each market participant’s to judge, and I am not ma king a prediction of this outcome, to be sure.  \nBut I have emphasized that such a revaluation, in conjunction with an  economic downturn, could \nmake a recession worse than it would have been had policymakers normalized interest rates more \nrapidly.   \nIn other words, a somewhat faster move to  rate normalization may defer somewhat how \nquickly we achieve the dual mandate goals of full employment and pric e stability, but could \nreduce the risk of a larger diverg ence from the dual mandate in the next downturn.  This is one of \nthe challenges of monetary policymaking that requ ires empirical analysis, historical perspective, \nand judgment. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, Chi na, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n12 \n Concluding Observations \n Low or even negative interest rates have  been the policy response of central banks \ngrappling with difficulties in reaching legislat ed mandates in many countries.  However, it is \nimportant that central banks thi nk about attainment of their manda tes not only at the current time, \nbut also through time.  Policymakers must weigh the benefi ts of low interest rates now against \nthe potential costs in the future of  possibly spurring financial instab ility that will ultimately have \ndownstream adverse effects on firms and households. \n In the United States, a potential collateral im pact of very low intere st rates has been rapid \nprice appreciation in the commercia l real estate sector.  While there are certainly fundamental \nfeatures that make commercial real estate an attractive asset class, I think it is fair to say that part \nof the attraction has been the low interest rate en vironment.  The financial stability concerns that \ncould arise from a low interest rate policy co ntinuing for an extended period of time should be \nconsidered in conjunction with how best to achieve the dual mandate goals, now and over time. \n Thank you. \n \n                                                            \n \n1 “The core PCE price index is defined as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices excluding food and \nenergy prices.

I would like to thank our hosts, the Bank of Finland and the Global \nInterdependence Center, for inviting me to  speak as part of this forum.   \nIn addition to discussing the main topic of th e panel, the experience in the United States \nand Europe with quantitative easing, I will provide a few comments on the current outlook for \nthe U.S. economy.  The U.S. experience is an impor tant part of the discus sion, as we are in the \nprocess of gradually normalizing in terest rates, and a key consid eration with quantitative easing \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n and nontraditional monetary policy tools more gene rally is the strategy fo r exiting when that \nbecomes appropriate. \nAt the outset, let me note as I always do th at the views I express today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my  colleagues at the Federal Reserv e’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nIn the United States, the central bank has taken the first step toward more normalized \nmonetary conditions with the 25 basis point increase  in the target range fo r the federal funds rate \nin December.  It is my expectation that econom ic conditions will continue to gradually improve, \nwhich in turn would justify further actions to normalize policy, continuing a gradual return to a \nmore normal interest rate environment.   \nLately the economic data have been choppy.  In  the first quarter, em ployment growth was \nstrong but spending data showed weakness.  To  date in the second quarter, we have had a \nreversal of that pattern, with economic data consistent with a pick-up in growth, but weaker \nemployment growth.  However, I still expect sufficient economic growth  to justify a gradual \nremoval of accommodation.    \nI would note that the move toward policy norm alization has been much slower than in \nprevious U.S. recoveries, because of economic c onditions characterized by a very gradual return \nto full employment and to the Federal Reserve’ s 2 percent inflation target.  I expect the \nnormalization process will continue to be gradua l, compared with previous episodes of U.S. \ninterest rate tightening.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n The most comprehensive and complete evalua tion of monetary policy tools can take \nplace only after a return to more normal economi c conditions and monetary policy.  Still, with \nthat caveat, my overall assessment of quantitative eas ing is that it was quite  successfully utilized \nin the United States.  One reason the U.S. is now  relatively close to achie ving both aspects of the \nFederal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – full employment and price stability (which the \nFederal Reserve targets at 2 percent inflation) – is the early and forceful use of quantitative easing in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Real rates that are rele vant to households and \nfirms have been quite low, in part as a result  of the accommodative monetary policy.  This has \nstimulated the U.S. economy despite forceful he adwinds stemming from the financial crisis and \nfrom economic struggles confron ting our trading partners.   \n With regard to the use of negative interest rates, I would say the e xperience in Japan and \nparts of Europe seems mixed.  It will take some time before one can fully assess the overall impact on the Japanese and European economies.  But my assessment so far of the effectiveness \nof the transmission mechanism of negative-rate policy, and of behavioral responses to negative \ninterest rates, make this a t ool to use only after other nontradi tional monetary policy tools – the \n“more-conventional unconventional” tools – have been exhausted. \n \nA Few Comments on the U.S. Economic Outlook \n The minutes of the April FOMC meeting in dicated the conditions that would make it \nappropriate to further raise inte rest rates include a rebound in spe nding (that is, growth from the \nfirst quarter level), continued st rengthening of labor markets, and additional progress toward \nreaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target.\n1   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n Figure 1  provides the forecasts for second quarter  real GDP from two groups of private \nsector forecasters, as well as the Federa l Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow “Nowcast.”2  All \nthree indicate an expectation that real GDP growth will pick up in the second quarter of this year.  \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s forecast sim ilarly expects growth in the second quarter to \nbe somewhat above 2 percent. \n One reason for the widespread optimism that  the second quarter will include something \nof a “snap back” from the weak growth of the fi rst quarter is the strong retail sales report for \nApril, as shown in Figure 2.   The April increase was large, relative to sales over the past year \nand was fairly widely distributed across retail cat egories.  Because consumption is approximately \ntwo-thirds of U.S. GDP, strong consumption provides a signifi cant boost to the overall economy. \n In terms of labor markets, the employment  situation report for May was disappointing.  \nNonfarm payroll employment grew by only 38,000 j obs; however, we should note that this \nnumber was held down by about 35,000 jobs as a re sult of a significant strike which has since \nended.3  In addition, the previous two months of  payroll employment were revised down by \n59,000 jobs.  The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percen t, in part due to a 0.2 percentage point \ndecline in the civilian labor fo rce participation rate.     \nGiven that the labor market contrasts with th e pattern in the first quarter, and the pick-up \nin spending observed so far from other data, it wi ll be important to see whether the weakness in \nthis report is an anomaly or reflects a broader slowing in labor markets.   \nDespite the weakness in the recent employment  report, at 4.7 per cent unemployment we \nare now at my estimate of full employment.  On Figure 3 , the shaded band shows the central \ntendency4 of the forecasts of the longer-run unemploym ent rate that Federal Reserve presidents \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n and governors submitted in the March Summary of Economic Projections (the SEP).  Note that \n4.7 percent is at the bottom of the cen tral tendency and is also the median  unemployment \nprojection for year-end 2016 by Fede ral Reserve’s policymakers. \nIn terms of inflation, the rise in energy prices  and the depreciation of the dollar relative to \nJanuary highs reverses some of th e factors that had been contributi ng to low inflation readings in \nthe U.S.  The core inflation rate, shown in Figure 4 , has been 1.6 percent over the past year, \nsomewhat higher than in 2015.  So, while it is  only gradual progress, we are seeing some \nevidence of inflation moving toward  the 2 percent inflation target. \n The normalization process has been very gr adual – appropriately so, given the very \ngradual return to full employment and to the Fede ral Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target – but \nthis also means that a truly comprehensive eval uation of quantitative easi ng in the United States \nwill not be possible for some time.  Still, evidence to date allows me to share my current assessment of the quantitative easing experience in the United States. \n \nQuantitative Easing in the United States \n I was a strong supporter of pursuing quantit ative easing in the Un ited States during the \naftermath of the financial crisis and in light of the very slow recovery.  My reasoning was quite \nstraightforward.  With short-term interest ra tes at the zero lower bound, an unemployment rate \nwell above the level associated with full employment, and infl ation too low – well below the \nFederal Reserve’s target of 2 percent – I was co nvinced the U.S. economy needed more stimulus.  \nIdeally, perhaps, more of that stimulus would have been generated by fiscal policy, but when \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n fiscal stimulus was not forthcoming, monetary po licymakers needed to act strongly to ensure \nattainment of our dual mandate goals. \n I would note that the U.S. central bank used  other tools in additi on to quantitative easing \n– most notably, forward guidance that highlight ed our plan to remain accommodative for some \ntime; and earlier on, liquidity fac ilities designed to address some of the stresses experienced in \nfinancial markets during and af ter the financial crisis.   \nHowever, I view quantitative easing as one of  our most important monetary policy tools \nin this cycle.  In the wake of the financial cr isis, the recovery to norma l levels of activity was \npainfully slow.  Lower long-term rates and highe r asset prices generally  would help to spur \nactivity, but with the federal f unds rate at its effective lo wer bound, monetary policy makers \nneeded another tool to affect long rates and other asset prices.  Purchasing  longer-term securities \npushes down the interest rates paid by households and firms,5 increasing aggregate demand in \nthe economy.  I would note that in the United Stat es, the central bank is limited to purchasing \nTreasury or agency mortgage-backed securities, while many other central banks have far more \nlatitude to purchase assets th at may more directly influence the borrowing costs of households \nand firms.   \nNumerous studies have examined announcem ent effects and found that quantitative \neasing significantly affected rates, although the studies find different impacts depending on the \nnature and circumstances of the quantitative easing.6  Today, I will not try to replicate those \nstudies by focusing on event dates, but rather wi ll simply examine whether financial conditions \nfor households and firms were generally easier after the onset of quantitative easing, with less \nspecific focus on the various programs.7  Note that interest rates were impacted not only by the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n quantitative easing in the United States, but also the quantitativ e easing implemented in Japan \nand Europe, as well as other factors such as relatively weak global economic conditions. \n Figure 5  shows the real rates on auto  loans in the U.S.  Prior to quantitative easing, real \nauto loan rates had generally been above 4 per cent, while over the past several years (after \nquantitative easing) real auto loan  rates in the United States have  been below 2 percent.  More \nrecently, with the increased expectation of rising s hort-term interest rates in the United States, \nthere has been a very modest upw ard trend in real auto loan ra tes.  Consumers seem to have \nresponded to the lower real interest rates and more  robust economy, as auto sales have been quite \nstrong over the past several years,  returning to pre-recession highs. \n Figure 6  shows the real rate on 30 -year fixed-rate mortgages.  Prior to quantitative \neasing, real mortgage rates had generally been above 4 percent, and afterward real mortgage \nrates in the United States have ge nerally been fluctuating between 2 and 3 percent.  Over the past \nseveral years, residential real  estate investment has been trending up, though many borrowers \nstill find it difficult to meet the post-cris is credit standards for home mortgages. \n Figure 7  shows the real rates on co rporate bonds.  Prior to quantitative easing, real 10-\nyear rates for AAA and AA corporate borrowers ge nerally fluctuated betw een 3 and 4 percent, \nwhile over the past several year s, real rates for AAA and AA bo rrowers have generally varied \nbetween 1 and 2 percent.   \n In sum, households and firms have seen lower real rates since the fi rst quantitative easing \nwas implemented in the United States.  In part be cause of this monetary stimulus, enacted after \nthe traditional policy rate h it the zero lower bound, the U.S. economy is approaching both \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate .  This stimulus led, in part, to conditions \nappropriate for the initial increase in  short-term rates in December 2015. \nWhile the full evaluation of quantitative easi ng in the United States will need to wait until \nmonetary policy has fully normalized, I expect the results will suggest that the tool was useful \nduring the crisis and therefore w ill be appropriate in the future , should we once again experience \na recession where short-term inte rest rates hit the zero lower bound. \n \nA Few Observations on Negative Interest Rates \n Turning to the issue of negative rates, let me first say that fortunately  I do not expect that \nthe United States will need to us e negative interest  rates given that we are slowly recovering, and \non the path to more normalized monetary policy.  Also, I will say that for several reasons which I will discuss today, I would only turn to the tool of  negative rates as a last resort.  While a number \nof central banks have implemented negative intere st rates, I think the Ja panese experience is \nespecially informative because th e announcement of negative interest  rates came as a surprise to \nmany, and the results to date seem so decidedly mixed. \n Unlike quantitative eas ing, which reduces long-term rates and credit spreads, negative \nshort-term policy rates have their most direct effects on short-term market rates.  As is the case \nwith low but positive policy rates, negative policy rates generally make holding short-term securities less attractive and, a ll things equal, are expected to depreciate the currency.  \nInterestingly, after the an nouncement of negative interest rates in Japan (see Figure 8 ), the \nexchange rate appreciated .  This decreased the costs of im ports, lowering their contribution to \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n9 \n overall inflation, and made hitting the inflation target more difficult.   The real cost of mortgages \nis modestly lower following the announcement (shown in Figure 9 ) while the real cost of \ncorporate borrowing (in Figure 10 ) actually ends up rising.  So the positive effects expected \nfrom the announcement are not clearly reflected in the data.   \n Furthermore, the announcement of negative rates in Japan does seem to have had some \nadverse consequences.  The monetary policy tr ansmission mechanism is more effective when \nbanks are healthy and able to pass on lower interest costs on to borrowers.  However, as Figure \n11 shows, Japanese bank stocks declined after the announcement of negative interest rates, \nperhaps reflecting concern, in part, that negative rates will prove challenging for the profit model \nof Japanese banks.8 \n An additional concern is that the presence of  negative rates could disrupt some short-term \ncredit markets.  As an example, the volume of trades in Japan’s call market decreased, and concerns have been raised over a lack of ma rket liquidity for short-term maturities (see Figure \n12). \n At this early stage, the beha vior of Japanese consumers and firms in response to negative \ninterest rates is as yet un clear.  If households view negative inte rest rates as a tool of last resort, \nthe behavioral response of hous eholds and firms may be dominated by risk-averse behavior, \nresulting in less consumption and investment.  Much more time, experience, and empirical \nobservation across countries will be needed to fully assess the impact of negative interest rates as \na monetary policy tool.  However, in my view the results to date do not seem particularly \npromising.  I believe that for the United States , negative rates would be a tool to be employed \nonly after most other tools had proved insufficient to stimulate the economy. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations \n Central banks around the world have tried a va riety of new tools to address the severe \neconomic problems experienced since the financial cr isis.  My view is that the positive response \nof the U.S. economy to quantitative easing is one of the reasons we are now approaching both \nelements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. \nIn contrast, I would observe th at negative interest rates seem  to have much more mixed \nresults.  At least that is the early conclusi on I would draw, based on in itial reactions to the \nannouncement of negative inte rest rates in Japan. \n Fortunately, in the United States I do not e xpect additional quantitative easing or negative \ninterest rates to be utilized gi ven that we are slowly recove ring, and on the path to more \nnormalized monetary policy.

Thank you very much for invi ting me to Concord, New Hampshire to \ntalk about the economy.  At the outset, let me not e as I always do that the views I express today \nare my own, not necessarily those of my colleag ues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors \nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nIn addition to this discussion, I am also l ooking forward to a meeting this afternoon about \nthe Boston Federal Reserve Bank’s work on post-industrial cities1 and how that work might be \nbeneficially applied in New Hampshire.   \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n I would also like to offer very special th anks to Richard Uchida for extending the \ninvitation to be here today.  I have gotten to know Richar d through our work on the Colby \nCollege Board of Trustees, and I know how dedi cated he is to so many legal, civic, and \ncharitable endeavors.  His public service is something I greatly admire.  \n Last Friday’s employment report for April wa s one of the first major indicators of how \nthe economy is unfolding in the second quarter.  Employers added 160,000 new jobs in April.  \nWhile this was a bit below mark et expectations, and below th e 203,000 average monthly gain for \nthe first quarter, it still reflects what I would consider to be re latively strong payroll employment \ngrowth.  Given broad demographi c trends, like the slowing of population growth and increased \nbaby boomer retirements, normal or “trend” pa yroll employment growth is now between 80,000 \nand 100,000 jobs a month.2   \nAs a result, if April’s payroll employment growth continues, it should be strong enough \nto bring some further tightening of  labor markets.  With the U.S.  unemployment rate at 5 percent \nin April, we remain only somewhat above my  estimate of “full” employment, which is 4.7 \npercent unemployment.   \nI would add that other elements of the jobs re port were positive.  Average hourly earnings \nincreased by 2.5 percent over the past year, a nd there was an increas e in the workweek.  \nSomewhat higher wages and hours worked will add to household income, and so should be \npositive drivers of future consumption.  \n First-quarter GDP growth, at only 0.5 pe rcent, was weaker than most economists \nexpected. But most private forecasters do not ex pect such weakness to persist.  And after \nconcerns about foreign growth at  the turn of the year impacted  U.S. and foreign stock markets \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n through mid-February of this year, markets ha ve since rebounded, both he re and abroad.  In \naddition, the dollar has recently depreciated on a trade-weighted basis, and the economic \nindicators for many of our trading partners have come in stronger  than expected.  For example, \ngrowth in the Euro area in the first quarter was actually faster than in the United States.  These \ndevelopments bode well for expor t-dependent U.S. industries.  Furthermore, domestic demand is \nstarting to rebound as auto sales, which had dippe d a bit in March, have returned to their mid-\n2015 levels.    \nAll this suggests that, with diminished h eadwinds from abroad and consumers responding \nto growing household income and wealth, consum er spending should improve over the course of \nthe second quarter.  Of course at th is point, this is still a forecast, as we currently have very little \nby way of actual spending data for this quarter. \n However, the limited second-quarter data to da te are consistent with my expectation that \ngrowth in real GDP in the second quarter will be somewhat above my estimate of the so-called \n“potential” growth rate for the economy – about 1.75 percent in my analysis.  The early data are \nalso consistent with some con tinued gradual improvement in labor markets and with inflation \nmoving gradually closer to the Federal Re serve’s 2 percent targ et for inflation.  \nIf the economic data that come in over the c ourse of this quarter confirm these trends, it \nwill be appropriate to continue the gradual normaliz ation of monetary policy that began with the \ninitial increase in short-term interest rates last  December.  In my view, the market remains too \npessimistic about the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy, and the likelihood of removing \nmonetary accommodation is higher than is curr ently priced into financial markets based on \ncurrent data.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n Exploring Recent Economic Data \n Allow me to walk you through some of th e analysis that underpins my views and \nexpectations. \nFigure 1 provides the quarterly patter n of real GDP over the past two years.  The first-\nquarter data are shown in red.  As  I mentioned a moment ago, first- quarter real GDP for this year \nwas a disappointing 0.5 percent.  Since 2014, firs t-quarter real GDP growth has tended to be \ndisappointing, but over the last tw o years it has provided a poor signal of subsequent quarters, \nwhich experienced stronger growt h.  This pattern may partly refl ect weather anomalies, or it may \nsuggest imperfect adjustments for changing seasona l patterns in the data.  Still, it will be \nimportant to obtain more data on spending to dete rmine whether it is likely that the economy will \ngrow above potential. \n An important area of weakness in firs t-quarter real GDP was consumption, which \naccounts for approximately two-thirds of real  GDP.  Consumption grew 1.9 percent at an \nannualized rate in the quarter.  This moderate pace is somewhat surprising, given the progress in \nthe usual supports for consumer spending during the quarter.  By the end of the quarter, stock \nprices had recovered, and housing pr ices rose, as did personal income, driven in part by gains in \npayroll employment.  Most forecasters expect these relatively strong fundamentals to spur \nconsumption, a key driver for most of their forecasts.  Without strong consumption, most \nforecasts look decidedly weaker.     \nWhile we have relatively scant data  so far on second-quarter activity, Figure 2  provides \nsome reassuring data for auto sales – which are re leased with a very short time lag.  The last two \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n months of data are shown in re d.  Fortunately, the sizab le decline in March did not persist, as \nauto sales rebounded, although they  are still below levels seen earlier this year. \n The most important second-quarter data poi nt we have in hand is last Friday’s \nemployment report, which indicated that Ap ril payroll employment grew by 160,000 jobs, as \nshown in Figure 3 .  While roughly the same as the growth in January, this was below the \naverage monthly increase in the first quarter.  However, these da ta still reflect relatively robust \nemployment growth at a time when the U.S. econo my is close to what most economists consider \nfull employment.   \nIn fact, as we approach full employment, we  expect employment growth to moderate \ntoward its long-run sustainable growth rate – a rate that will neither raise nor lower the \nunemployment rate.  Federal Reserve economists  currently estimate that rate, based on \ndemographic and population data, to be about 80,000 to 100,000 jobs per month.  So, while the \nApril jobs growth was below market expectati ons, it remained strong enough to continue the \ngradual improvement in labor markets.  \n Furthermore, other data in the employment report were even more positive.  While the \nofficial, widely reported  U-3 measure of the unemployment rate  remained the same as in March, \nat 5 percent, the broader U-6 rate (which incl udes the unemployed, as well as people “marginally \nattached” to the labor force, and peop le employed part time for economic reasons3) declined \nsomewhat further to 9.7 percent.   \nAs shown in Figure 4 , the U-6 unemployment rate was ove r 12 percent at the beginning \nof 2014.  The decline that has taken place since then  reflects continued reductions in the number \nof workers employed only part time for economic r easons, and also the tre nd of more so-called \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n discouraged workers finding work over the past two years.  The spread between U-6 and U-3 is \none of the major reasons for tightening monetary policy only  gradually even though we are \nrelatively close to full employment, with more workers being drawn into full-time employment \nas labor markets improve. \n Another positive effect of further gradual tightening of labor markets is that over time, \ntighter labor markets should lead  to higher wages and salaries.  Figure 5  provides some evidence \nthat we are beginning to see a te ntative upward trend in average hourly earnings.  Over the past \nyear, average hourly earnings have risen about 2. 5 percent, which represents a gradual increase \nfrom the 2 percent pace we had seen in earlier years. \n Figure 6  shows there has also been a somewhat positive trend in the rate of inflation, \nwhich had been extremely subdued.  Over the pa st year, inflation – measured by the Core \nPersonal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or Core PCE – has averaged 1.6 percent.  This \nis somewhat higher than the 1.3 to 1.4 percen t that we were averaging throughout 2015.  While \nstill below the 2 percent target set by the Fe deral Reserve as an op timum level of annual \ninflation, the most recent data hint  at a gradual move toward that  target – a trend that was not \nevident last year. \n So, while it is still early in the quarter, it appears that the economy is continuing to \ngradually improve.  We are adding jobs faster than trend, broader measures of unemployment \nhave continued to tighten, and th ere has been a welcome upward tr end in both wages and prices.  \nAnd while we have limited spending data for the quarter, the data we do have seem consistent \nwith growth a bove potential. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n Risks Associated with Leaving Rates Too Low for Too Long \n I believe that one of the benefits of our current accommodative monetary policy, even as \nwe approach full employment, is that it fosters co ntinued gradual improvement in labor markets.  \nAs I have noted in the past, it is quite appropriate to probe on the natural rate of unemployment \nto see how low it might be, given the benefit to wo rkers.  We have seen workers rejoin the labor \nforce, many of them previously having given up looking for work. \nHowever, there can be potential costs to accommodation if rates st ay too low for too \nlong.  One cost involves the potential of very low interest rates en couraging speculative \nbehavior.  One area where I have some concern in  this regard is the commercial real estate \nmarket.  Let me walk you through some of  the numbers that I find illuminating.   \nFigure 7  shows commercial real estate prices fo r four broad property types.  As labor \nmarkets have improved and vacancy rates have dec lined, it is not surprising that there has been \nsome appreciation in commercial real estate prices .  For apartments, prices have increased – as \nmany potential homebuyers have chosen to rent rather than own, presumably chastened by the \nexperiences of many homeowners during the fi nancial crisis, or constrained by stricter \nrequirements for down-payments and other mort gage qualifications.  However, prices now \nexceed the peaks reached prior to the financial cr isis, and are well above the levels reached in \n2005 as real estate prices were beginning to accelerate before the financial crisis.4 \nWhile Figure 7  reflects national commercial real estate prices, regional indices show that \nprices have been rising particul arly quickly on both coasts.  Certainly in Boston, one of the \nrelatively hot commercial real estate markets, the higher prices for commercial real estate are readily apparent.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n Figure 8  shows real multifamily residential mortgage growth from 1976 to 2015. Growth \nin mortgage debt on multifamily properties is up sh arply from lows reached in this cycle in 2010. \nIn the most recent quarter, multifamily mortgage gr owth was just shy of the pre-recession peak.  \nWe care about potentially inflated commercial real  estate prices because they might risk a \nbout of financial instability.  History shows that  most periods of serious financial instability \ninvolve a scenario in which debt  is high relative to a volatile underlying asset, and the value of \nthe asset subsequently declines.  These declines  not only create problems for the owners of the \nasset (in this case, prop erty), but also for the lenders – w ho may end up acquiring the asset in the \nevent of default.  Often these lender s are highly levered institutions.   \nIn fact, this exact scenario played out in New England in the late 1980s and early 1990s, \nresulting in slumping real estate  prices, failing financial institu tions, and broader problems of \ncredit availability for borrowers (both individu als and firms) that were dependent on financial \ninstitutions for loans.  Given that history, it is  important that we take actions early enough to \navoid a repetition of  that experience. \nPotential concerns surrounding commercial re al estate led to a recent Interagency \nStatement on Prudential Risk Management fo r Commercial Real Es tate Lending (SR 15-17)5 \nthat, along with the 2006 Intera gency Guidance on Concentrations of Commercial Real Estate \nLending (SR 07-1),6 emphasized the need for exposure th resholds, increased monitoring, and \nprudent risk-management practices.  While this guidance applies to regulated banks, it is notable \nthat commercial real estate loans are also  being provided by non-bank lenders (and foreign \ninvestors).   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n9 \n In sum, one potential cost to keeping rates too low for too long is that doing so might \nencourage excessive risk-taking in commercial real estate – a sect or likely to be influenced by \nlow borrowing costs. \nA second possible cost of keeping rates too low for too long relates to the limits we see in \nmonetary policy’s ability to “fin e tune” the economy.  Consider Figure 9 .  Once unemployment \nhas reached its low point in the economic cycle, it is unusual for it to proceed smoothly back to \nthe natural rate.  The red highlighting indicates the first time that the unemployment rate rises by \n0.4 percentage points after hitting a cyclical low.  There are no  episodes in which unemployment \nrose a bit and remained stable at its natural employment rate.  Instead, relatively soon after the \nperiods shown here with red highlighting, une mployment rises significantly – that is, we \nexperience a recession, as indica ted by the gray shading.   \nThe chart strongly suggests that it has prove n difficult to calibrate policy so as to \ngradually increase the unemployment rate, gen tly nudging it back toward full employment.  The \nlesson is that policymakers shoul d avoid significantly overshooti ng their best estimates of the \nnatural rate of unemployment.   \nToday, the unemployment rate is still somewh at above my estimate of the natural rate, \n4.7 percent.  But waiting too long to have more  normalized rates risks possibly overshooting on \nthe unemployment rate, and needing to tighten  more quickly than would be desirable. \n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations \nIn summary and conclusion, I would note th at the economy has continued to improve \ngradually.  While it has been a slow, methodical  recovery from the Great Recession, it is \nimportant to recognize that we are approachi ng full employment, and getting closer to the \nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target for inflation.   The real (inflation-adju sted) federal funds rate \nremains quite stimulative, which is unusual for an economy that is near both of the Federal \nReserve’s dual mandate goals (stable prices, which we target as 2 percent inflation, and \nmaximum sustainable employment).   \nIf the incoming economic data continue to be  consistent with gradual improvement in \nlabor markets and inflation getting closer to target, the Fed should be  ready to gradually \nnormalize interest rates, perhaps at a pace not cu rrently anticipated by the federal funds futures \nmarket, as I have noted in other talks.7   \nOf course, there is always the potential for di sruptions from abroad or  at home that could \nimpact the U.S. economy.  However, such concerns  are only pertinent if th ey materially change \nthe outlook for the U.S. economy.    \nAll in all, should incoming economic data conf irm that we continue  to make progress on \nboth inflation and labor markets, I believe the Fe deral Reserve should con tinue with the gradual \nremoval of monetary policy accommodation. \n Thank you. \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M.

It is a pleasur e to be joining you for the  American Savings Foundation \nDistinguished Lecture at Centra l Connecticut State University. \nAt the outset, let me note as I always do th at the views I express today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my  colleagues at the Federal Reserv e’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \nIncoming economic data for the first quarter suggest that growth in the quarter was \ndisappointing, with real GDP likely to have adva nced at a pace well belo w most estimates of \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n potential growth, about 2 percent.  However, I will point out that weakness in the first quarter has \nbeen a consistent pattern in recent years, and to  date, that weakness has generally been offset in \nsubsequent quarters, as the ec onomy has continued to improve slowly.  Certainly the March \nunemployment report showing 215,000 jobs created, along with an increase in the labor force \nparticipation rate to 63 percent,  is supportive of a more  optimistic reading of the GDP numbers.  \nAdditionally, the core PCE inflation rate is now  at 1.7 percent, much closer to the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent target than we re the core PCE readings in 2015.  \nDespite this gradual improvement in the U. S. economy, global financial markets have \nbeen quite turbulent.  Concerns that low infla tion and weak growth abroad might spill over into \nthe U.S. have had an impact, it appears, and pric es in financial futures markets now suggest that \nmarket participants expect considerably fewer interest rate increases in the United States than historically occur when the Federal Reserve begins to raise rates.  Federal funds futures currently \nreflect the expectation of approxima tely one-quarter of a percentage  point increase in each of the \nnext three years.   \n While I believe that gradual federal funds ra te increases are absolu tely appropriate, I do \nnot see that the risks are so elevated, nor the outlook so pessimistic, as to justify the \nexceptionally shallow interest rate path currentl y reflected in financial futures markets. The \nforecast for economic variables contained in th e most recent Fed policymakers’ Summary of \nEconomic Projections is consistent with my own estimate – GDP growth slightly above potential \nand a continued slow decline in the unemployment rate.   \nFurthermore, I would point out that the extr emely shallow rate path reflected in the \nmarket for federal funds futures seems at odds w ith forecasts by private sector economists and by \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n financial firms that serve as count erparties to the Federa l Reserve (the so-called primary dealers), \nas well as my own forecast for the U.S. economy.   Most of these for ecasts envision a much \nhealthier U.S. economy than is implied by that unusually shallow path of the funds rate, and \nmany of the major private forecasters expect shor t-term rates to rise more rapidly than implied \nby financial futures.  \nThe unemployment rate is currently 5 percent, and I expect it to continue to drift down.  \nAs I have noted publicly in the past, it is qui te appropriate to probe how low unemployment can \ngo, given that the inflation rate is below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target and wages are \nonly increasing modestly.  \nProbing just how low the unemployment rate can fall before risking overheating in the \neconomy can be beneficial for labor markets.  It  should encourage those w ho have left the labor \nmarket to re-enter, a welcome trend we have seen  recently.  Such probing is particularly helpful \nto those who became discouraged by the very weak labor market during and following the Great Recession, and thus stopped looking for work – as well as those who continue to be part-time \nworkers who would prefer full-time work.  In the parlance of labor economist s, I suspect that the \namount of so called labor market “slack” is grea ter than what is captured by the traditional and \nwidely reported U-3 measure of the unemployme nt rate, and we should welcome any remaining \nslack being absorbed by a healthy labor market. \n However, the unemployment rate is now at 5 percent – relatively close to my estimate of \nfull employment, 4.7 percent – and net payroll employment growth is averaging over 200,000 \njobs per month over the past quarter .  My concern is that given th ese conditions, an interest rate \npath at the pace embedded in the futures markets could risk an unemployment rate that falls well \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n below the natural rate of unemployment.  We ar e currently at an unemployment rate where such \na large, rapid decline in une mployment could be risky, as  an overheating economy would \neventually produce inflation rising above our 2 percent goal, eventually necessitating a rapid \nremoval of monetary po licy accommodation.  I would prefer th at the Federal Reserve not risk \nmaking the mistake of significantly overshooting the full employment level, resulting in the need \nto rapidly raise interest rates – with potentiall y disruptive effects and an  increased risk of a \nrecession.   \nIn sum, in my view the very shallow path of rate increases imp lied by financial futures \nmarket pricing would likely result in an overheating that necessita tes the Fed eventually raising \ninterest rates more quickly than is desirabl e, which could endanger the ongoing recovery and \ncontinued growth. \n \nFinancial Futures and the Expected Path for Interest Rates \n \n Figure 1  provides the path of the federal funds  rate in the rate-tightening cycles \nfollowing the last two recessions.  The Federal Re serve raised interest rates by a quarter of a \npercentage point at each FOMC meeting in th e two years following the first increase in 2004.  \nThe pace of increases was even quicker when the FOMC began to raise rates in 1994.  In \ncontrast, as noted in my introduction, the federa l funds futures market is currently reflecting the \nexpectation of a much more grad ual pace of tightening this time around.  The market is currently \nassuming only a roughly one-quart er percentage point increase per year  rather than per FOMC \nmeeting as in the 2004 episode, over the next three y ears – an exceptionally sh allow rate path.    \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n  The federal funds futures are not the only anom aly that I see in financial markets.  In \nFigure 2 , we see that the rate on 10 year Treasury secu rities is currently below 2 percent.  If one \nbelieves that the Federal Reserve will be successful in averaging 2 percent inflation over the next \n10 years, then investors in these benchmark secur ities are accepting a negativ e real rate of return \nover the 10 year period.   \n The pricing on both short- and long-term secur ities seems most consistent with either a \nfairly pessimistic best guess for the economy’s pr ospects in the near future, or with concern \nabout an unusually large “tail” risk (that is, a significant chance that the economy could be much \nweaker than expected).  Both s cenarios would affect th e path of federal funds rate futures prices. \nWith that in mind, I will turn now to private- sector forecasts for the economy, to see if \neconomists or financial forecasters are predicti ng either an unusually weak economy or very \nsignificant tail risk over th e next several years. \n \nPrivate-Sector Forecasts of the Economy \n Focusing first on the likely economic outlook, I would note that private-sector forecasts \ndo not seem particularly pessimistic.  Figure 3  shows the most recent Blue Chip forecast for real \nGDP, which aggregates the results of roughly 50 private sector economic forecasts.  Most of \nthese private sector forecasters are expecting a weak first quarter, but are not expecting that \nweakness to persist. \n Consistent with GDP growth that is e xpected to be somewhat above 2 percent, Figure 4  \nshows that the Blue Chip forecasters expect a gradual decrease in the unemployment rate.  The \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n consensus is that the unemploymen t rate will level off at 4.5 percen t, a little below my estimate \nof full employment. \n The Blue Chip forecast extends only through 2017.  An alternative survey is conducted \nwith the primary dealers, the financial firms that  serve as counterparties to the Federal Reserve \nwhen we buy or sell government securities as part  of our monetary policy responsibilities.  The \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York surveys the pr imary dealers on a regular basis regarding the \neconomic outlook and their forecasts.  Figure 5  shows the primary dealers’ forecast for the \nunemployment rate through 2018.  Like the Blue Chip forecast, the primary dealers see the \nunemployment rate drifting down to 4.5 percen t by 2017, but then have it returning to 4.7 \npercent by the fourth quarter of 2018.  One interpreta tion of this path would be that it predicts the \nunemployment rate modestly overshooting fu ll employment but then stabilizing at full \nemployment as the Federal Reserve takes step s to gradually normalize interest rates. \n So the evidence suggests that economic forecasters and primary dealers do not seem to \nexpect a particularly weak economy.  But, it is possible that while they view the most likely \noutcome as benign, they fear an elevated risk of  a much more worrisome outcome.  If true, such \na pricing-in of tail risk probabi lity could potentially justify a low federal funds rate and 10-year \nTreasury rate, even with a favor able expected economic outlook.1  \n One way of ascertaining the per ceived potential for a heightened possibility of a tail risk \nevent is to look at surveys that try to captu re forecasters’ assessmen ts of risks around the \nforecast.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) incorporates the ou tlook of private sector \neconomists and provides the distri bution of outcomes around their fore casts, as well as the most \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n likely outcome in their forecast.  A significant tail  risk event would likely be reflected in a higher \nprobability of an elevated unemployment rate, whic h would be more consiste nt with a recession.   \nTo that end, Figure 6  examines the average probabil ity among SPF forecasters that the \nannual average unemployment rate will be 6 per cent or higher in either 2016 or 2017.  A 6 \npercent unemployment rate is a fu ll percentage point above the cu rrent unemployment rate of 5 \npercent, and would be consistent with a relativ ely mild recession.   But rather than being \nelevated, the probability of such an outcome ha s fallen quite significantly over time – in the \nsurveys taken in 2014, 2015, and 2016.  While some of this multi-year trend reflects the drifting \ndown of the realized unemploymen t rate, the probability has c ontinued to fall over the past \nseveral quarters, while the unemployment rate has been relatively stable near the current rate. \n Figure 7  provides the entire distribution of the pr edictions for the unemployment rate in \n2016 according to the two most recen t forecasts by the SPF.  While the average probability or \nassessed likelihood of the unemployment rate bei ng at recession levels is relatively low, the \nsurveys show an increased probability of the une mployment rate falling below 4 percent, a rate \nmost forecasters would judge to be we ll below estimates of full employment.  Figure 8  shows \nthat for 2017, the probability that the unemploym ent rate will fall below 4 percent actually rises \nto just over 10 percent.   \n Figure 9  highlights one reason why it might be ri sky if the unemployment rate were to \nfall well below the estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.  The green line provides the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the na tural rate of unemploym ent.  As the figure \nshows, prior to the last three recessions, the unemp loyment rate fell well below the green line.  \nAt times like that, the economy has exceeded it s sustainable level of activity, and monetary \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n policy often needs to react to try to m odestly slow the economy.  Unfortunately, modestly  \nslowing down the economy is difficult, and as the chart shows, during these previous episodes \nthe unemployment rate subsequently rose significantly above the natu ral rate of unemployment.    \n Recently, the unemployment rate has been fluc tuating around 5 percent.  In part, this \nreflects positive news on labor fo rce participation.  Unemployment has remained stable in the \nface of strong growth because many of the new j obs have gone to workers re-entering the labor \nforce.  As Figure 10  shows, for the preceding five year s, the unemployment rate has been \ndrifting down along with the labor force participation rate.   \nOne reason for the decline in labor force participation involves changes in the \ndemographics of the labor market.   As the pe rcentage of the population (notably baby boomers) \nreaching retirement age rose, labor force particip ation was expected to decline.  However, at \nleast some of the decline in labor force partic ipation has reflected th e poor job prospects of \nworkers who have become discouraged or have not  looked for work over the past year given the \njobs that are available to them.  As the labor market has become tighter, some individuals have \nreturned to the labor force, as we had long expected.2   \nOne reason for probing how low the unemploymen t rate can go is that it will encourage \nmore people to return to the labor force.  Part icularly for those workers who may need additional \ntraining, there are benefits to th e individuals and to the economy  of having a higher percentage \nof the population working.  However, these advantag es need to be weighed against the risk that \nsignificantly more people might not actually be drawn into the labor force, and in that case with \ncontinued employment growth, the unemployment rate would fall well below the natural rate. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n9 \n At the Boston Federal Reserve Bank we have been expecting only a slow decline in the \nunemployment rate, a forecast in part predicated  on people being drawn into the labor force.  \nHowever, given the difficulty in accurately estim ating labor force participation, our model has \nassumed that real GDP growth somewhat over 2 percent will be consistent with some gradual \nfurther decline in the unemployment rate.  In pa rt it is gradual because of increased labor force \nparticipation, but also in part as a result of a gradua l normalization of interest rates, which we \nalso assume. \nFigure 11  shows that in addition to the financia l market prices, the Survey of Primary \nDealers reports a rising probability of seeing no federal funds rate increase  this year.  As of the \nMarch 21 update, the survey indicated somewhat more than a 20 percent probability of no change this year.  Even more st riking is that the federal funds futures market does not price a 25 \nbasis point increase in the federal funds rate wi th near-certainty until 2017.  In my view, such \ndour interest rate projections do not seem consis tent with the outlook for the economy that I and \nmany others share. \n \nConcluding Observations \n High frequency real economic data are indi cating that the real economy likely grew less \nthan its estimated potential growth rate in the first quarter of this year.  N onetheless, most private \nforecasters – and my own forecast – expect the economy to continue to improve over the next \nseveral quarters.  In addition, while there have  been significant headwinds from abroad, and \nmarket turbulence relate d to those headwinds, I view the U.S. economy as fundamentally sound \nand likely to perform better than the domestic  economies of most trading partners.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n10 \n In my view, this represents an outlook st rong enough to engender fu rther decline in the \nunemployment rate, even with some gradual normali zation of interest rates.   As I see it, the \npricing in the federal funds futures market, which implies roughly three-quar ters of a percentage \npoint in increases by the end of  2018, is inconsistent with the assessment – mine and that of \nmany forecasters – of continued moderate growth in the U.S. economy.  \n Thank you again for inviting me to be with you today  at Central Connecticut State \nUniversity. \n \n                                                            \n \n1 Another explanation is that the level of r* – the equilibrium  real interest rate – is deemed to be extremely low by \nparticipants in the federal funds future markets.  Histor ically, r* has been around 2.5%, which is consistent with \ninflation of 2% and a nominal interest rate of 4.5%.  Even with an r* of 0, the current fed funds rate implies a \nsignificant amount of policy accommodati on at this stage in the business cycl e.  As economic headwinds fade over \ntime, r* should increase gradually and be around 1.25% to 1.5% in 2018.  The 75 basis points through 2018 in the \nfutures markets would require a value for r* well into negative territory over th e forecast horizon.  Most estimates, \ninstead, already place the curr ent value of r*at or s lightly above zero.    \n \n2 Since September of 2015, we have seen an increase in labo r force participation – with a significant flow of people \nfrom outside of the labor force becoming employed.  While it is difficult to predict with  certainty how many people \nare likely to return to the labor force as the ec onomy improves, this is certainly a positive sign.  ",

It is a pleasure to be able  to welcome so many representatives of \nfinancial institutions to the Federal Reserve t oday, for what is an important program.  An \nimportant role for leaders of financial institutions  and their boards, of course, is monitoring and \nmitigating potential risks to their institution.  Toda y I would like to briefly discuss, and offer my \nown views on, two areas of risk that I often hear about when I talk with bankers.   \nAt the outset, let me note as I always do th at the views I express today are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my  colleagues at the Federal Reserv e’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n2 \n The first area of risk that I will commen t on involves the economy.  Early this year, \nconcerns reemerged about the economic health of  China and Europe, which led to significant \nvolatility in both foreign and domestic financial mark ets.  In reaction to th at volatility, federal \nfunds rate futures fell significantly, reflecti ng market expectations for only a very gradual \nincrease in short-term interest rates.   \nTo preview my main point, my own sense is that financial markets may have reacted too \nstrongly.  My assessment is that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve despite the \nheadwinds from abroad.  If my forecast is righ t, it may imply more increases in short-term \ninterest rates than are currently priced into futures markets – but, let me emphasize that my \noutlook still calls for a gradual  pace of increases and, as always, the path should depend on \nincoming economic data.  \n The second risk that I am going to touch on to day is cyber risk, the primary focus of this \ngathering.1  It is a risk that institutions of all si zes are well aware of, and have been taking \nsignificant steps to mitigate.  However, the eve r-changing nature of the risk is why continued \nattention is so important.  This is the topic th at the speakers today are going to cover in some \ndetail, I am pleased to say.   \nFor context, the risk of bank r obbery or fraud had, in the pa st, been primarily a localized \nproblem, with relatively few individuals able to pose a significant threat.  With appropriate \ncontrols, the risks of large losse s were quite low.  However, w ith banking increasingly done via \nthe internet and mobile devices, an attack can be conducted from anywhere in the world.  Cyber \ncriminals are looking for the targ ets of opportunity without rega rd to geographic location, and \nthe existence of a global populat ion of potential attackers look ing for softer targets means \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n3 \n increased risks.  Without appr opriate controls and defenses, the banking system could be at \ngreater risk of a large loss – but fortunately, institutions of all sizes have been expending \nsignificant resources very st rategically in this area,2 and bank supervisory examiners have been \nverifying that controls are in place.    \nNonetheless, as with the threat of terrorism – which has been so r ecently and tragically \nhighlighted – cyber defense is an area where continued vigilance and continuous improvement \nare required.  This has been a focus at the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, and the discussions \ntoday will touch on programs we ar e pursuing to support financial inst itutions as they continue to \nmitigate this risk. \n \nEconomic risks    \n Turning back to the economy, I would note that  at the beginning of the year, problems in \nthe domestic economies of many of the United St ates’ major trading partners began receiving \nsignificant attention.  Several foreign central banks eased th eir monetary policy, and some \nfinancial markets became volatile.  These global developments had an impact on U.S. financial \nmarkets, and many market partic ipants began anticipating that U.S. monetary policy would be \nless likely to continue normalizing.   \nIndeed, as of the end of last week, as shown in Figure 1 , the federal funds futures market \nimplied the belief that there would be roughly one more quarter-point increase by the end of \n2016, and an additional quarter-point  increase by the end of 2017.  This extremely gradual path \nfor reducing monetary policy accommodation w ould imply either a weak outlook for the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n4 \n economy or significant concerns that even if the expected outlook was benign, there were \nsignificant “tail” risks.  My own view is that the outlook is not as  weak, and the tail risks not as \nelevated, as would be implie d by this very gradual path.3,4 \n Figure 2  shows that futures markets atta ch a 41 percent probability to just one increase by \nthe end of the year, and a 38 percent probability to no change at all this year. In other words, the \nfutures markets assign a very high probability of one  or zero increases in rates by the end of this \nyear.  \n It is important to remember that these mark et probabilities can change significantly, and \nrapidly.  When weaker economic data are release d, the probability of tightening built into futures \nmarkets falls; conversely, when stronger data are rel eased, the probability of tightening is seen as \nincreasing.  Figure 3 shows that over the past two months , the probabilities have shifted \nsignificantly.  The probability assi gned to seeing no change in the federal funds rate this year \nwas less than 30 percent two months ago, rose  to over 50 percent one month ago, and most \nrecently has returned to 38 percent. \n One reason for these changing probabili ties has been the weak economic data, \nparticularly from abroad.  Figure 4  shows that European and Japanese stock markets weakened \nsignificantly in the middle of Febr uary, and still remained well below their levels in the middle \nof December.  Figure 5  shows that the declines in U.S. stock markets were more modest, and \nhave now rebounded to levels prevailing in mid-December of last year. \n Not only have the levels of stock indices im proved, but so has volatility – as shown in \nFigure 6 .  The VIX – a measure of stock market volat ility – rose significantly in February and \nthen fell thereafter.  Currently the VIX is so mewhat below the level of mid-December.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n5 \n  The exchange rate has also been volatile, as seen in Figure 7 .  The dollar was stronger on \na trade-weighted basis earlier in the year.  Howe ver, currently the trade-weighted data are below \nthe level of mid-December.  This is si milar to the pattern of bond spreads in Figure 8 .  While the \nspread was elevated in February, it is now belo w the levels seen in the middle of December. \n With financial market volatility subsiding since earlier this year, it is to me surprising that \nthe expected path of monetary policy embedded in futures markets is so low.  A weak forecast \ndoesn’t seem to explain the path expected for the funds rate (see Figures , 9, 10, and 11 for \ncontext).5  As I see it, the risks seem to be abatin g that problems from abroad would be severe \nenough to disrupt the U.S. recovery.  Financial- market volatility has fallen, and most economic \nforecasts do not reflect expected  large spillovers from continued headwinds from abroad.   \nSo, while problems could still arise, I woul d expect that the ve ry slow removal of \naccommodation reflected in futures market pricing could prove too pessimistic.  While it has been appropriate to pause while waiting for inform ation that clarified the response of the U.S. \neconomy to foreign turmoil, it increasingly appear s that the U.S. has weathered foreign shocks \nquite well.  As a consequence, if the incoming data  continue to show a m oderate recovery – as I \nexpect they will – I beli eve it will likely be appropriate to resume the path of gradual tightening \nsooner than is implied by financial-market futures.  \n \nCyber risk \n Turning to the second risk I will address today, I would say that while economic risks \nhave arguably abated somewhat, the same cannot be  said for cyber risk.  News stories on cyber \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n6 \n attacks and cyber fraud have become more prev alent.  No CEO, in any industry, can feel \ncomfortable with the ba rrage of stories relate d to cyber intrusions. \n The ability to conduct financial transactions  over the Internet and through mobile devices \nhas resulted in major innovations in financial serv ices.  Banks and other financial institutions \nhave invested heavily in technology, and in keeping that technology safe.    \nOf course, it is notable that banks’ business lines are also increasingly challenged by new \norganizations that are primarily electronic.  To  the extent that so-called “fintech” entities \ncompete directly with banks with similar pr oducts, they are not burdened by large brick and \nmortar operations or the regulator y oversight that comes with bei ng a bank.  It is important to \nexamine whether these new innovators have fully  captured the risks of economic downturns and \nthe implications for their lending model.  Whethe r or not customers fully appreciate that deposit-\nlike accounts do not carry deposit in surance, remains to be seen. \nCustomers are looking for convenience; so no t surprisingly, new app lications and devices \ncontinue to evolve in new and une xpected ways.  However, this ra pid evolution generates risks.  \nA proliferation of apps increasingly focused on customer c onvenience may not always focus as \nintensely on security.  In addition, the consumer, ra ther than the financial institution, can often be \nthe entry point that cyber criminals seek to exploit. \nI mention fintech because clearly banks must co ntinue to evolve with  and invest in these \nfinancial services innovations, and therefore should be attuned to the cyber risks that come with \nonline and mobile delivery.6  The cyber criminal can be anywhere there are computer links.  \nThey may very well be hard to find, submerged in the large volume of transactions and data \nhandled by financial institutions.  But they also have the potential to la unch massive attacks, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n7 \n quickly ballooning from complete anonymity to a large-scale threat.  These challenges make it \nimportant that CEOs, management, and boards of directors understand the risks that are posed. \nIdeally, cyber thefts can be significantly m itigated.  Maintaining good cyber security and \nkeeping personnel and software up to  date is critical.  However, it is important to be able to \nquickly understand what is happening to other or ganizations and even across industries.  As you \nwill hear later today, the Boston Fed tries to be quite active in this regard, to make sure that news of threats gleaned by the central bank or other financial institutions quickly becomes known, and \nthat appropriate act ions are taken.   \nI would also highlight the importance of ha ving protocols ready, should a breach occur.  \nResiliency is important, as is recovering critical operations in a timely fashion.  Finally, having a \ncommunication plan to address concerns of cust omers, vendors, and regulators – with a clear \nunderstanding of where decision rights are held – can mitigate problems in the event of a breach. \n Of course, bank regulators and supervisors from  the Fed and other agencies are attuned to \ncyber risks, and work with financial institutions  on an ongoing basis to ensure defenses are \nrobust and opportunities for the spread of pr oblems are constrained.  Cyber risks make it \nimperative that we all work together to ensu re that resiliency, m onitoring, detection, and \nrecovery capabilities are opera tional in the financial system. \n \nConcluding Observations \n In summary and conclusion, I would observe that some of the economic concerns from \nearlier this year seem to be receding.  As the economic risks abate, financ ial market expectations \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY * \n \n \n \n8 \n of a very slow removal of monetary policy accommodation could, it seems to me, prove unduly \npessimistic.  I personally expect that a stronger economy, at essent ially full employment and with \ngradually rising inflation, will lead to more tight ening than is currently priced into the futures \nmarket expectations for the next two years. \n The risks in the cyber realm are, unfortuna tely, not abating.  Banki ng organizations need \nto continue to evolve as these risks mor ph, and as new innovations and expectations of \nconvenience introduce new challenges to security.  I hope the discussion over the course of today \nwill help prepare you for those challenges.   \nThank you. \n \n                                                            \n \n1 For additional perspective on cybersecurity as a financ ial stability issue, see January 2015 remarks by Eric S. \nRosengren at: http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/ rosengren/2015/013015/013015text.pdf  \n \n2 Of course, cyber risk also encompasses third-party service providers to financial institutions, so there is a need for \nvigilance in managing these relationships and entry points. \n \n3 Note that the Federal Reserve Board of Governor’s Advance release of table 1 of the Summary of Economic \nProjections has a steeper path particularly in 2017.  However, this reflects modal forecasts and may not capture the \ntail risks that may be priced into the futures market.  See the table at: http://www.federalreserve.gov/moneta rypolicy/fomcprojtabl20160316.htm  \n \n4 The higher SEP forecasts were revise d down about one-half percentage poi nt from the December forecasts, as \nCommittee members responded to international developments and the implications for the U.S. economy.  However, \neven after this adjustment, the path is steeper th an captured in the federal funds futures rates.  \n \n5 As previously suggested, one possible explanation could be a very weak private sect or forecast for the economy.  \nHowever, the policymaker forecasts in the March SEP expect a declining unempl oyment rate, a rising core inflation \nrate, and a real GDP forecast quite similar to the curren t economic forecasts from most of the private sector \nforecasters – and not much different than we have experi enced over this economic recovery.  So, a weak forecast \ndoesn’t seem to explain the low path expected for the funds rate. The path could suggest that the market is weighing \nthe risks from abroad more heavily than I am.  \n6 Obviously, the traditional model of knowing customers at the branch provides little protection when business takes \nplace over network connected devices.    ",

It is a pleasure to  have  been invited to participate in this panel discussion \non defining the objectives and goals of supervision.  I want to compliment the New York \nReserve Bank for convening this important conference on supervising large, complex financial \ninstitutions.  \n\n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n2 \n At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I will express are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).   \nThe discussion today of lar ge-bank supervision is particularly germane , as we continue to \nanalyze and learn from the last financial crisis, where problems at large financial institutions  had \nan important impact on the severity and duration of the recession  that followed .   \nIt is als o important that we have an international perspective  on prudential regulation on \nthis panel , provided by Andrew Bailey  of the Bank of England .  Large -bank problems  were  \nmajor  contributors to the crisis  globally .  Actions taken during and in response to periods of bank \nstress in banking crises have varied across the world .  This reflects , in part , differ ing attitudes \nabout what represents the greatest risk posed by large banks and their potential problems . \n \nPerspective on the  Goals of Bank Supervision  \n In the United States, the most significant  change to bank supervision in the past decade \nwas the adoption of the Dodd -Frank Act.  The preamble of the Act  makes it quite clear that a \ncentral  focus of the legislation  was prevent ing the need for any future taxpayer bailouts  of \ninstitutions  whose demise could worsen a crisis .1  The legislation, a s well as the set of \nregulations that implement it, strong ly emphasi ze avoiding taxpayer bailouts by increas ing loss-\nabsorbing capital , and liquidity , through regulation – all to reduce the probability of a large bank \nfailure . 2  The legislation also emphasize s reducing the loss es that would be borne by taxpayers  in \nthe event of an ins titution’s default .3,4 \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n3 \n  However, bailout risk to the taxpayers  – while critical  – is not the only risk that motivates \ncareful regulation and supervision of financial intermediaries.  The broader goal  for supervision \nand regulation reflects  the highest intention of all economic policy making: simply to maximize \nthe well-being of t he public.  Bank failures – and financial instability in general  – reduce the \npublic welfare , because w ell-functioning financial intermediaries are essentially the lubricant for \nthe real  economy.  A car engine without oil will seize  up; similarly, countries  with faile d \nfinancial intermediaries can  find their economies seiz ing up.  It is no coincidence that the two \nworst economic cycles in the U.S. over the past one hundred years have coincided with the \nwidespread failure of financial insti tutions.   \nThe Great Depression and the Great Recession, of course, brought large  losses to many  \nfinancial intermediaries .  But the largest  costs were associat ed with lost employment, production , \nand wealth .  Both the Dodd -Frank legislation and recent supervisory letters emphasize making \nfinancial institutions resilient, maintaining financial stability, and  preventing problems at \nfinancial intermediaries from damaging  the real economy .5  So a central  focus of regulation and \nsupervision should be to help improve public  welfare by  maintain ing the efficient and effective \nconduct of intermediary services  despite  economic cycle s.   \nFinancial intermediaries play a critical  role in efficient ly channeling funds from savers to \nborrowers , whose investment in a business idea or household propels the real economy . \nFinancial intermediaries  are also the major conduit through which  monetary policy  affects the \nreal economy , making them key to  transmitting policies that foster  economic recoveries .6,7   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n4 \n Supervision aims to ensure  that financial institutions are resilient to even severe shocks .  \nWith sufficiently high capital regulation and effective use of stress tests, supervision should  help \nprevent systemic failures.  Stress testing – a proactive supervisory approach introduced after the \ncrisis – should, if properly implemented, make systematic failures quite unlikely. In fact, stress \ntests should lead to restrictions on  dividends or share buybacks unless the supervisor  is confident \nthat systemic institutions are resilient to even severe stress.  Financial institutions should be able \nto effectively intermediate throughout the cycle, including under severely stressed economic \nconditions , if supervisors successfully utilize stress tests.   \nBut we must also be focusing on what will happen if  a severe economic shock  does \nfundamentally impair intermediaries .  In that case , mitigating more severe economic dislocations \nin the broader economy should be a primary  concern,  not a secondary  one.8 \n \nTrade -offs in Supervisory and Regulatory Policymaking  \n Supervisory policymaking  involve s a balancing o f macroeconomic trade -offs.   When \naddressing the financial condition of an institution , policymakers must be attuned to the broader \nimpacts that can occur with the disruption of the vital intermediation services that lubricate \neconomic activity.  \nCapital regulation  provides a relatively simple but very important example of the trade -\noffs inherent in supervisory and regulatory policymaking .  Maintaining standards for loss -\nabsorbing capital has long been central to bank regulation.  However , the specifics of how that \nregulation is implemented can have very different implications for the broader economy.   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n5 \n For example, a  bank that falls below its  regulatory capital -to-assets ratio can take one of \ntwo paths – raise new capital (by raising new equity or retaini ng earnings),  or shrink assets (by \nselling assets or reducing lending , because loans are assets for financial institutions ).  These \nalternatives can differ in important ways, of course – for example, in the speed with which each \noption accomplishes  recapitalization .  But they also differ crucially  in the  impact they may have \non the availability  of credit to individuals and companies – essentially, in the institutions’ ability \nto continue to effectively and efficiently provide credit , and function as a financial intermediary .   \nChoosing to increase capital  by suspending dividends or not repurchasing  share s has the \nadvantage of having  less of an  impact on borrowers  seeking credit , but it is likely to increase \ncapital only very gradual ly – particularly if the operating environment is one in which net \nincome is low.9   \nAlternatively, issuing new equity to bolster loss -absorbing capital can be done relatively \nquickly .  While it dilutes existing shareholders, if done proactively it can stave off severe \nfinancial stres s on the institution .10 \nTurning to the assets in the capital -to-assets ratio – the denominator  – we should note that \nthe approach involving reducing  lending can take time , since  it works primarily through  new \nloans , not existing  ones.  Moreover, a bank is limited in its ability to immediately curtail lending, \ngiven that it has previously committed to lines of credit (including the unused portions) and has \nmade loan commitments to its customers .  However,  the reduction in lending is likel y to result in \na dearth of needed credit for individuals and companies, and thus a weaker economy .11   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n6 \n Moreover , tighter loan terms change the calculations inherent in business plans, and  may \nlead firms and entrepreneurs to reduce their borrowing.  The reduction  in credit extension by \nintermediaries may also partially offset the stimulative effects of accommodative monetary \npolicy that the central bank is  usually implement ing in economic downturns.   \nIn contrast, selling off assets can be accomplished  relatively quickly .  But depending on \nthe asset and the prevailing economic conditions, the sales may have to occur  at deeply \ndiscounted or  even  “fire sale” prices .  However, an important nuance to recognize is that asset \nsales at much -reduced prices can affect  the institution’s capital too ,12 with the losses on the asset \nsales feeding through to reduced net worth (capital) .13   \n The speed of the recapitalization is important for several reasons.  Certainly, q uickly \nrecapitalizing makes the financial system more resilient to  continuing or  future adverse shocks , \nand thus m ay help insulate the economy from  future disruptions in the intermediation process.  \nHowever, a more rapid  recapitalization , if accomplished through shrinking assets , can also harm \nthe broader economy  if it entails a significant tightening of lending standards , and thus credit \navailability .14  Again, a s is often the case with economic policy making, the supervisory process \nis a balancing  of macroeconomic trade -offs.  \n Certainly , history shows a number of examples of supervisors taking  different  approaches \nto these  trade -offs.  In the United States, the reces sion in the early 1990s was exa cerbated by \nbinding capital requirements .  Many  banks addressed their binding capital ratios by reducing \nlending and  tightening credit  standards , and bank supervisors did not emphasize the need to \nrecapitalize in ways that were less disruptive to the broader economy .  This supervisory response  \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n7 \n spawned an academic  literature on credit crunches , highlighting how supervisory p ractice  could \nadversely impact the real economy .  Ultimately , the credit crunch  was cited as a headwind to the \nrecovery , at a time requiring more stimulative monetary policy .15   \nAs Figure 1  shows, after the 1990 recession , the level of real lending  to businesses \ndeclined significantly , and in a way that had not occurred in the previous or subsequent \nrecession .16  Arguably, in the early 1990s , not enough consideration  was given to avoiding a \nsituation where supervisory capital rat ios were  primarily achieved by tightening lending  \n(shrinking assets) .  Less collateral damage to borrowers may have occurred if supervision had \ntaken  the tack of m ore forcefully  requiring retention of earnings or the raising of new equity \ncapital.  \nA very different supervisory approach occurred in 2009.  The first supervisory “stress \ntest” exercise  – which followed the Troubled Asset Relief Program’s (TARP)  funding  that \nboosted institutions’ capital with  investment of  public funds  – required that rec apitalization not \nbe accomplished  by shrinking assets.  Given th at demand for loans declined during the recession , \nthere was still a significant drop in business lending, but it would likely have been much more \nsevere if bank supervisors  had not  discourag ed banks from meeting capital requirements \nprimarily by reducing lending.17  In part, the supervisory approach looked to recapitalize banks \nquickly, but to do it in a way that would have less severe “collateral  damage”  to the economy.    \nImportantly, we can examine the experience in other countries.  Countries experien cing \nsevere shocks have tended to see extremely slow progress in recapitalizing their banking system . \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n8 \n And some countries  where the government did recapitalize the banks , such  as Japan,  did so only \nafter a long delay.  \nIndeed , following the Japanese banking problems of the 1990s , the authorities  counted on \nbank earnings to recapitalize  the banking sector  – but this was handicapped by continued \ndeclines in stock and real estate prices in Japan ’s economy.   Studies have observed  that the long \ndelays in recapitalizing the banks  and reducing problem loans  generated a misallocation of loans , \nwhich  had a broader adverse impact on the country’s  economy .18   \nIt is my strongly held view that supervisors can effectively help prevent systemic events \nif sufficiently high capital standards are required and rigorous stress tests are regularly \nconducted.  Ideally, bank regulation and supervision will help make financial intermediaries \nsufficiently resilient so that even severe economic shocks would not badly impair financial \nintermediaries over the entire business cycle.  This is the logic behind using stress tests to ensure \nthat b anks are resilient before they are approved to pay out earnings, which of course depletes \ncapital.   Before the introduction of the post -crisis stress tests, banks were allowed to continue to \npay dividends in 2007 and 2008, which resulted in a much greater  need to recapitalize.  \nThankfully, the stress tests now provide a much more proactive way to address the potential of \nsevere shocks before they occur.  \nHowever,  if a shock or event  occurs , and banks prove  to be  not sufficiently resilient, it is \ncritically important to proactively recapitali ze the banking sector as quickly as possible while  at \nthe same time avoiding  collateral damage from tighter credit standards .  Put another way , with \nrespect to the capita l-to-assets ratio , it is vital to increase the capital  (the numerator of the ratio ) \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n9 \n rather than allowing the adjustment to occur primarily through a reduction in assets, i.e. loans \n(the denominator ).  \nCurrent ly, there continue to be varying responses to the question .  The Basel III accord \nmade clear the existence of  a broad international consensus to better capitalize banks.19  \nHowever, countries have taken different approaches to interpreting how low the acceptable \nminimum level of capital can be – and different approaches to reachi ng the higher capital \nstandards .  Countries that only slowly build  up their banking sector’s resilience  do risk, in my \nview,  more severe repercussions  should their economies encounter additional significant  adverse \nshocks.  \n \nThe Largest Institutions  \nFigure 2  provides the minimum Basel III leverage ratio s applied to the largest  and most \nsystemic ally important  institutions in several developed countries  – the so -called Global \nSystemically Important Banking organizations, or GSIBs.  You see that c ountries have c hosen \ndifferent minimum leverage ratios to apply to the largest institutions.  In the United States, the \nGSIB s are required , by 201 8, to have 5 percent leverage ratios for the holding company.20  \nSwitzerland has set similarly high leverage ratios.  In contrast, the Eurozone and Japan have yet \nto require a higher minimum leverage ratio for the largest institutions – above the  3 percent \nleverage ratio  – although additional requirements for GSIBs are under discussion by the Basel \nCommittee’s Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) .21   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n10 \n These variations  reflect different trade -offs made across jurisdictions  – trade -offs \nconcerning  the size of GSIB s relative to the GDP of the country, the willingness of governments \nto risk large  bank failures, and concern over how higher capital standards will impact the largest \nbanks in the coun try as well as the broader economy.   \n Figure 3  shows,  for different coun tries or regions , the recent leverage ratio s for GSIBs \nand the fully -phased -in Basel III leverage ratio requirement .  While the transition rules do not \nrequire fully meeting the regulatory requirements until 201 8, the average GSIB  Basel III \nleverage ratio in the U .S. already exceed s the fully -phased -in requirement .22  How quickly \nfinancial institutions have boost ed capital ratios, and the size of the loss-absorbing buffer, \npresumably reflects different market pressures – but also different supervisory  pressure to raise \ncapital ratios.   \nIn the U .S., an important supervisory tool has been the use of stress tests.  Here t he \nrigorous application of stress tests, and the desire of institutions to have comfortable buffers \nagainst future stress tests, ha ve encouraged GSIBs to quick ly improve their capital ratios.  \n The different supervisory and regulatory goals across jurisdictions reflect different trade -\noffs, but also make the country or region’s financial sector more or less susceptible  to additional \nadve rse shocks.  Figure 4  shows global stock indices since December 1, 2015.  The global \nfinancial market turmoil that occurred at the beginning of 2016 has resulted in declines in stock \nmarket indices around the world .  This chart shows , however, that  there a re differences across \ncountries and regions.  For example, the United States and the United Kingdom are currently \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n11 \n only modestly below December 1 levels , reflecting the relatively strong U.S. and U.K. \neconomies , while Japan and the Eurozone show a more nega tive impact.  \n Figure 5  shows differences in credit default swap (CDS) spreads  of GSIB institutions \nacross countries, scaled relative to December 1.  GSIB CDS have been sensitive to global \nturmoil , and rose quite significantly  in February.  More recently , although volatility has \ncontinued, there has been substantial improvement  among countries that saw the most dramatic \nincreases in CDS spreads .  While these differences likely reflect macroeconomic risks by \ncountry, they also likely reflect investors ’ views  of potential  financial concerns related to  GSIBs \nin that country.    \nFigure 6  shows the differences in stock prices of GSIBs by countr y.  Again the U .S. \nGSIBs have fared  better, experiencing a lesser decline than counterparts in the Eurozone, \nSwitzerland, and Japan, likely reflecting a better macroeconomic outlook  – as well as a relatively \nstronger financial position even as global markets have become more volatile.   A more proact ive \nsupervisory push  to make U .S. GSIB s more resilient has been  appropriate and , as this figure \nsuggests,  beneficial  – as evidenced by market react ion to recent global  volatility.    \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n In summary and conclusion , I would observe that t he extensive regulation and \nsupervision of financial institutions reflect s the important role that they, as financial \nintermediaries , play in the economy.  In particular, higher capital and rigorous stress tests should \nmake GSIBs mor e resilient over time .  But, as I have discussed today, there are trade -offs to \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n12 \n carefully consider.  Policymakers need to balance the resilience that higher capital ratios bring \nagainst the possibility of pullback in  the provision of credit , and downstream  impacts on  the \nability of firms  and households  to borrow and invest . \nWhile the distribution of losses when  financial institutions fail is very important, the \nprimary goal of supervision should be to create effective intermediaries that can support the \nbroader economy  throughout the business cycle  including  periods of stress .  I am in favor of \nusing bank supervision to more quickly insulate the largest financial institution s from adverse \neconomic shocks  that may emerge .  But i deally , this would be done i n ways that also encourage \nfinancial intermediaries to continue lending .  I am happy to observe that in the United States , \nbanks have been able to significantly improve capital ratios while  still expanding their lending.   \n Thank you.  \n  \n                                                           \n1 The Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act begins with: “To promote the financial stability \nof the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail,’ to \nprotect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, \nand for other purposes…”  \n \n2 See the speech by Federal Reserve Governor Jerome H. Powell, “ Ending ‘Too Big to Fail ,’” March 4, 2013. This \nspeech highlights the too big to fail phenomenon.  \n \n3 For more discussion of how the probability of failure and cost of failure ha ve been reduced in the United S tates, \nsee “Progress on Addressing 'Too Big To Fail' ,” Eric S. Rosengren , BCBS-FSI High -level Meeting for Africa  \nfocused on Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision and Current Regulatory Priorities , held in Cape Town, South \nAfrica , Feb. 4, 2016 .  \n \n4 In particular, the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity proposal, or TLAC, would force large banks’ bondholders to \ndirectly suffer losses in the event of failure.  \n \n5 Supervision  and Regulation Letters , such as SR 12 -17, provide detailed discussions of the consolidated supervision \nframework for large financial institutions.  Two primary objectives for bank supervision are provided :  see \n“Enhancing resiliency of a firm to lower the probability of its failure or inability to serve as a financial \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL March  18, 201 6 at 11 A.M.

Stein, June, 1997. American Economic Revie w, 90, 407 –28. \n \n7 In the event of an institution’s dissolution, the arrangements for how its losses are allocated among equity holders, \nbondholders, and taxpayers, are – of course – highly important after the fact.  But how the rules for this allocation \nare set before the f act are also extremely important – they can affect financial incentives in critical ways, and thus \nthe behavior of both the financial intermediaries and those who fund them.   \n \n8 Stress tests are ideally suited to ensure that banks are resilient during dif ficult economic circumstances.  \n \n9 This leaves the institution vulnerable during the slow recapitalization process to any additional adverse economic \nshocks, which would require an even greater accumulation of capital.    \n \n10 In addition, proactively issuing new equity to bolster loss -absorbing capital can also allow future capital actions  to \nrecalibrate once markets stabilize . \n \n11 Of course, how much a reduction in bank lending affects the nonfinancial economy depends, in part, on whether \nborrowers have access  to alternative credit suppliers, and on what terms.  During the financial crisis, larger firms \nsubstituted bond finance for bank finance, but that option was not available to all firms.   \n \n12 Can affect the numerator as well as the denominator of the capita l-to-assets ratio.  \n \n13 Such sales may also affect the health of other financial institutions by reducing the market value of their assets, \nand thus their capital.  \n \n14 I would underline the trade -offs between addressing the financial condition of the institution expeditiously, and \nthe broader impacts that can occur with the disruption of vital intermediation services that lubricate economic \nactivity.  \n \n15 For a discussion of this period , see “ The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower Nor a Lender Be ,” Joe Peek and Eric \nRosengren, 1991. Also see, “Bank Regulation and the Credit Crunch ,” Joe Peek and Eric Rosengren, 1993.  \n  \n16 The chart shows the decline in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans  outstanding .   \n \n17 The emphasis on capital adjustment rather than shrinking assets stemmed further deterioration, and probably \nmitigated problems of credit access – although credit was certainly impaired, regardless, given the severity of the \ncrisis.    \n \n18 See \" Zombie Lending and Depressed Restructuring in Japan ,\" Ricardo J. Caballe ro, Takeo Hoshi, and Anil K. \nKashyap, 2008 . See also  \"Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of Credit in Japan ,” Joe \nPeek and Eric S.

It is a pleasure to be in Maine , and to be speaking here at my alma mater.   \nAt the outset , let me note as I always do that the views I will express are my own, n ot \nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee ( the FOMC).  \nBefore commenting on the national economy, allow me to say that I have been very \nimpressed by the actions of Colby  College  and President Green in contributing to economic \nresurgence here in Waterville , Maine.  So-called “anchor ” institutions are critically important to \n\n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M.

The collaborative \nwork of state and local government, local business leaders, and anchor institutions (like a Colby  \nCollege ) represent s one of the key ingredient s that Boston Fed research  by Kodrzycki and \nMuñoz has indicated can lead to rejuvenated  cities .2  And progress in small and mid -sized “post \nmanufacturing” cities is  vital to the economic success  of so many Americans , given the large \nshare of the population that lives in and around them .  \nTurning to the national economy, i n December the FOMC raised short -term rates for the \nfirst time since the financial crisis , by a quarter of a point .  That decision reflected  further \nimprovement in a  range of re cent labor market indicators , confirming  that underutilization of \nlabor resourc es has diminished  – and the Committee’s expectation  that inflation w ill return to 2 \npercent, the inflation target set by the Federal Reserve , over the medium term .3   \nWhile labor markets have continued to improve gradually, headwinds generated from \nabroad have created more volatile financial markets and concerns that U .S. domestic growth may \nbe impeded by these headwinds and inflation may not move as quickly to the inflation target.    \nThe FOMC has made clear in the statement s released after its meetings  that future \nincreases in interest rates will depend, in part, on “actual and expected progress toward” our \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n3 \n inflation goal.   My focus t oday will be the recent inflation data  and the prospects of a return to \nthe 2 percent target level  for inflation .   \nWhile most observers expect that the appreciation of the dollar and the fall in oil prices \nwill eventually stabilize , recent global events may make it less likely that  the 2 percent inflation \ntarget will be achieve d as quickly as had been projected in recent for ecasts by private economists \nor by Federal Reserve policymakers.  In my own view, if inflation is slower to return to target, \nmonetary policy normalization should be unhurried.   A more gradual approach is an appropriate \nresponse to headwinds from abroad th at slow exports , and financial volatility that raises the cost \nof funds to many firms.4  Of course, my view could change if we were to experience a more \nrapid abatement of headwinds, or mu ch stronger domestic economic growth than I am currently \nanticipating.  \nRather than expecting some sort of precise forward guidance, it is better for observers to \nrecognize  that monetary policy will be responsive to incoming economic data.  Monetary policy \nwill adjust w hen the accumulated data alter  policymakers’  combined outlook.  For example, data \ncoming in much stronger than forecast would result in interest rate s going up more quickly  than \nprojections and, i n contrast, data much weaker than forecast would result in interest rates go ing \nup more slowly than proj ections .  It is important to view  the interest rate projections of Fed \npolicymakers found in the Summary of Economic Projections (or SEP) not as a promise, but \nrather  as a projection of the path of rates if the economy evolves as expected.  As incoming data \nalter those expectations, those projections can, and should, change.  \n \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n4 \n Recent Data  \n Figure 1  shows  the movement of stock prices since the beginning of this year.  Clearly, \nstock markets around the globe have  had a very disappointing start to the new year.  Stock \nmarket prices in major developed countr ies have fallen, with European and Japanese stock \nmarkets declining by more than 10 percent.  Particularly notable is the decline in Japan, despite \nthe fact that monetary policy there has become more accommodative .  Moreover, the country is  \nan oil importer and , as such , should  enjoy a net  benefi t from  significantly lower energy prices.  \n With energy prices having declined quite significantly of late , measures of total inflation \nin most developed economies are quite low, with many hovering around zero.  However, even \nwithout food and energy prices, core inflation rates remain well below 2 perce nt in many \nindust rial economies , as Figure 2  shows .  While core PCE i nflation in the United States is 1.4 \npercent , well below the inflation target of 2 percent, it is nonetheless higher than in Japan, \nEurope, or the U .K. \n Figure 3  shows how far oil prices have fallen .  The current price of oil is near the lows \nthat occurred during the Great Recession.  While the core inflation  measure  removes the direct \nimpact of lower food and energy prices, there are still indirect effects  because  energy prices are \nan important input to many final goods.  The decline s to date  in energy costs  are likely to bring \nabout continued temporary downward pressure on core inflation , at least through the spring of \nthis year .   \n My assessment is that the  energy price decline likely reflects a combination of supply and \ndemand factors.  The introduction of improved technology in oil extraction has greatly increased \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n5 \n supply.  In addition, the slowdown in global demand has likely contributed additional downwar d \npressure on energy prices.  However, other commodity prices have also experienced significant \ndeclines.  Figure 4  provides a broad non -energy commodity index and Figure 5  provides an \nagricultural commodity index.5  The decline in many commodities outside  of energy is one \nreason that some analysts have been concerned with a possible broader decline in the global \neconomy.6 \n Figure 6  illustrates another temporary restraint on U .S. inflation.  The  dollar has \nappreciated sharply over the past 18 months, as ref lected in the  trade -weighted currency \nexchange index .7  Of course, the  appreciation of the U .S. dollar  poses a challenge to export -\ndependent businesses .  The appreciation of the dollar makes U .S. exports more expens ive to our \ntrading partners and their exported goods cheaper for us.  But the dollar appreciation also  arises \nbecause global trading partners are experiencing weak er economic growth , requiring further \nmonetary accommodation , at the same time that the United States has experienced relatively \nstrong growth and has just begun to raise short -term rates.  The higher -valued  dollar makes \nimported goods cheaper, reducing U.S. inflation , as it  raises the cost of U .S.-produced  goods to \nforeign buyers.  Exchange rate movements, much like energy price shocks, are likely to only \ntemporarily depress c ore inflation ; but still, these temporary factors make it  unlikely that we will \nexperience significant  increase s in total or core inflation in the near term.  \n Furthermore, t here is one way t hat these temporary downward pressures on reported \ninflation could pose more permanent impediments to reaching the 2 percent  inflation  goal – if \ninflation expectations  were to change a s households and firms viewed the prospects for  future \ninflation  differently .  Figure 7  provides a relatively new measure from the Federal Reserve Bank  \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n6 \n of New York  of consumers ’ expected inflation  rate one and three years ahead.   The survey does \nshow a gradual but clear downward trend in inflation expectations over th e past several years.  \nThis suggests  we cannot take for granted that regular, persistent , but seemingly temporary shocks \nto inflation  will not have  a larger  and more lasting  impact .   \n \nInflation Forecasts  \n Figure 8  provides the SEP forecast s for core inflation each December for the past four \nyears.  The  forecasts all follow a similar pattern.  At the time the forecast  is made,  core inflation \nis well below the 2 percent target.  Over the course of the three -year forecast, inflation is \nprojected  to gradually increase and to generally fall just a bit short of the 2 percent target.  \nHowever, Figure 9  shows that the forecasts for a persistent drift up in core inflation have  not \nbeen realized in actual inflation outcomes.  \n One interpretation of this pattern is that  FOMC participants have been persistently \nsurprised by transitory shocks  to oil prices and the dollar , both of which  have tended to depress \ninflation in recent years.  However, a more troubling  alternative would be  that consistent ly \nmissing on the inflation target reflects a change in  the inflation process  – for example , if inflation \nexpectations were becoming less well  anchored.  Declines in surveys and market measures of \ninflation expectations would then imply a m ore serious impediment to achieving the 2 percent \ninflation target.  \n Figure 10 shows that inflation across spending components  has varied quite a bit .  For \nexample, the housing  component of the PCE index  has risen  more than 2 percent over the past \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n7 \n year, while durable  and non -durable  goods prices have fallen .  While this reflects relative supply \nand demand factors  – as well as sensitivity to exchange rates  – one might expect that a \nstabi lization of the  exchange rate would relieve some downward pressures in industries facing \nsignificant price competition from import s. \n Another factor that would raise confidence that inflation will pick up as transitory factors \nabate , would be  the continuing tightening of  labor markets.  The unemployment rate is currently \nat 4.9 percent.  If U.S. econom ic growth induce d additional tightening of labor markets, one \nmight expect to see wages and salaries picking up in industries where demand is particularly \nstrong.  Figure 11 shows that average hourly earnings and wages and salaries for private workers \nhave been slowly increasing.8  While the increases are more modest than those  seen in previous \nrecoveries , the gradual upward trend, were it to continue, would make me more  confiden t of \nreaching the  2 percent  inflation target . \n Figure 12 provides wages and salaries by occupational grouping.  No occupational group \nyet shows evidence of sufficient tightness in labor markets to require significantly higher wages \nand salaries.  In sum , there is not much evidence of significant bottlenecks by occupational \ngrouping , but overall there is some drifting up of wages and salaries more generally.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n At the  December meeting of the FOMC when rates were raised by a quarter of a \npercentage point, the  Committee released its projections, which generally expected that the \neconomy wo uld grow a little faster than 2 percent , as shown in Figure 13.  However, actual \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n8 \n growth  in 2015 (measured from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2015) was  1.8 \npercent and  fell just below the SEP forecast range shown in Figure 13 , as fourth quarter growth \nwas only 0.7 percent .  The slowdown among some global trading partners, the decline in global \nstock prices, and the strong U .S. dollar could result in slower growth going forward than was \nexpected at the time of that December meeting.   While it is likely that much of the fourth -\nquarter weakness is due to temporary factors – for example, a modest inventory adjustment  – if \nmore pronounced global weakness were to materialize  and be transmitted to the U.S., I \npersonally believe there would be little need to raise rates until the economy was growing closer \nto its potential rate . \n However, even with growth at or above potential , the outlook for actual and expected \ninflation remains uncertain.  Figure 14 shows the  most recent  SEP median forecast for the \nfederal funds rate.  The median forecast was for the federal funds rate to increase by a percentage \npoint over the course of 2016 .  However, the SEP forecasts are made based on information \navailable at that time.   If the economy comes in  significantly weaker  (or stronger ) than was \nexpected  at the time of the SEP forecast , or if we see noticeably  less (or more)  progress on \ninflation than  was expected, that precise  interest rate path would no  longer be appropriate , in my \nview .   \nSince the December  publication of the Summary of Economic Projections,  we have seen \noil prices decline  and global stock indices become m ore volatile  – and more generally  a lack of \ninflationary pressures and the  presence of  global headwinds that make future economic growth \nsomewhat more uncertain.   Should these conditions persist, and slow progress on attaining the \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16 , 201 6 at 7:40 P.M.

But the path of interest rates \ncould be steeper or more gradual, depending on the incoming data.   \n \n5 As a broad index, the S&P GSCI Non -Energy Commodity Price Index does include agricultural commodities, so \nthere is some overlap between the  indices.  \n \n6 While Figure 4  shows a decline in the Non -Energy Commodities Price Index on a monthly basis through January, \ndaily figures show a rise in the index beginning on January 12th.   Alt hough the increase has leveled off in early \nFebruary, on a daily basis the index is now above its monthly average for December.  The Agricultural Commodities \nPrice Index pictured in Figure 5  drifted up slightly in mid -January on a daily basis, but has sinc e continued its \ndownward trend and in early February is below the monthly average for January.  \n \n7 While Figure 6  shows the dollar’s sharp appreciation, daily figures for the index show that the dollar has \ndepreciated slightly since January 21st but remains  above the monthly average for December shown in Figure 6 . \n \n8 The sharp uptick in the first quarter of 2015 (2.8 percent) may at least in part be attributable to incentive pay. \nWhen incentive paid occupations are excluded the increase is a smaller 2.1 perc ent.  (This attribution should be \nviewed with caution, however, as the BLS notes that the indices excluding incentive paid occupations are not strictly \ncomparable with the other series.)",

I would like to thank Josef Tosovsky and the Financial Stability Institute  \nof the Bank for International Settlements  for the invitation  to discuss progress  in the United \nStates  on eliminating the “too big to fail” phenomenon .1   This is an important topic,  and one that \nhas received extensive attention by bank regulators  and supervisors  in the United States.    \nOf course, the views I will express today are my own, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Fed eral Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n2 \n In the wake of the financial crisis , the primary legislative response in the U.S. was \nenactment of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  The Act begins \nwith the following  phrases : \n“To promote the  financial stability of the United States by improving \naccountability  and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail ,’ to \nprotect  the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from \nabusive  financial services practices, a nd for other purposes …” \n \nThis language suggests little ambiguity about the intent of Congress , stressing that the \nlegislative response to the crisis was intended to end “too big to fail ” (which I’ll refer to today as \nTBTF)  and end financial -sector  bailouts.  The regulations necessary to carry out this intent are \nquite extensive , and despite the legislation being enacted in 2010, some of the regulations are \nstill being finalized by the regulatory agencies or are being phased in over a number of years . \nBoth the Dodd -Frank legislation and the regulations implementing it involve  a wide \nvariety of topics  relevant to , and designed to address,  TBTF .  Today , I will focus my remarks on \ntwo areas where there has been substantial progress :   \n The f irst area involves increased capital buffers  aimed at reducing the  probability  \nof failures .  The largest financial institutions – which  had been thinly capitalized \ngoing into the financial crisis – have significantly increased their capital , as a \nresult of a variety of supervisory and regulatory ini tiatives designed to reduce the \nprobability of failure.  Today I will highlight two tools in particular  – \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) stress testing , and the U.S. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n3 \n Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Compan y (GSIB) capital surcharge  \n– which  have contributed to higher capital ratios.   \n \n The s econd  area involves  steps to reduce spill -over from one troubled institution \nto others  – essentially, reducing the cost of failures .  A variety of actions , most of \nwhich  are in the process of being implemented , would reduce the likelihood that a \nlarge financial institution ’s failure would end up being a systemic ally \ndestabilizing  event.  These actions include  requiring banks to issue enou gh debt \nso that taxpayer funds w ould not be necessary in the event of a resolution , and  \nrequiring  firms to provide resolution plans  to regulators  with the goal  that a  \nfailure would not have a broad impact on the overall economy .   \n \nBefore launching into th ese two topic s, let me just briefly mention some other areas that \nare important an d relevant to TBTF , but which our time constraints will not allow me  to address \nin any depth today.   \nThe first such issue is the shift in  the clearing of some derivat ives to  central \ncounterparties ( discussed last November by Bill Dudley of the New York Fed , and Governor \nJerome  Powell of the Fed eral Reserve ’s Board of Governors ).2  During the  financial crisis that \nbegan in the fall of 2008 , the vast number of firm -to-firm derivatives transactions made it \ndifficult to assess the extent of counterparty risk , as there was no central conduit through which \nthese transactions flowed and were recorded.  Now, because many more derivative contracts are \nbeing centrally clear ed, transparency about derivative exposures has been improved .  In addition, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n4 \n recent regulations will increase  margin requirements on those derivative contracts  that are  not \ncentrally cleared .   \nA second important issue we will not have as much time to cover today is the  application \nof regulations to non-bank , systemically important financial institutions.  During the crisis, a \nlarge insuran ce company, AIG, had extensive  derivatives exposure that generated s ignificant  risk \nto counterpart ies.  In addition, some non-bank  financial institutions were poorly supervised at the  \nholding company level; others were significantly impaired by their dependence on short -term \nwholesale funding  when such funding virtually di sappeared in the fall of 2008  (as discussed by \nFed Governor Dan Tarullo  in speeches last fall ).3  To address these problems, the Financial \nStability Oversight Counsel (FSOC) – the federal agency charged with, among other things, \nidentifying and addressing threats to U.S. financial stability – can designate  non-bank  financial \ninstitutions as systemically important , thus  subject ing them to supervision by the Federal \nReserve  and enhanced prudential standards .4 \nA third  matter involve s the extensive use of Federal Reserve liquidity facilities during the \nfinancial crisis by U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations.  Specifically, m any of these \norganizations turned to Fed faci lities because they were highly dependent on short -term \nwholesale funding , which  dried up  during the financial crisis .  As a consequence, l arge foreign \nbanking organizations are now required to form intermediate holding companies covering most \nof their activities in the United Stat es.  This is an effort to  increase the resiliency of their \noperations  by, among other things, subjecting them to the same capital standards as their U.S. \ncounterparts, and stress testing requirements .5   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n5 \n A fourth area is a set of major change s establishing  new liquidity requirements.   Events in \nthe financial crisis exposed the fact that many financial institutions had become reliant on funds \nthat could quickly “run” should the firm experience financial str ess (or be perceived as \nexperiencing such stress) .  The regulatory tools  – known as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) , \nthe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NS FR), and the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and  Review  \n(CLAR)  – are all intended to make financial firms more resilient to liquid ity shocks .6  \nThis is far from a comprehensive list of the major changes that have either been made or \nare underway to address  the issue of TBTF  institutions .  But my goal is to highlight the reality \nthat truly addressing TBTF  involves much more than prudential regulation of individual large \nbanks .  Given the complexity involved and the limited time  we have today, I  will focus on \nGSIBs  and the two issues I mentioned at the outset – increase d capital and steps to reduce the \nspillover of problems from one institution to others and the financial system .   \n \nBackground on U .S. GSIB s \n Figure 1  shows  the total assets of the eight U .S. GSIB s for the third quarter of 2010 and \nthe third quarter of 2015.  The four largest GSIB s all have assets well over $1 trillion and include \nBank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup , and Wells Fargo.  The next two largest GSIB s, \nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stan ley, have assets well over $500 billion  and notably  have  very \nlarge broker -dealer businesses.  The two smallest GSIB s, Bank of New York Mellon and State \nStreet , have assets well below $500 billion but are processing banks that are responsible for \nsignificant ba ck-office activities for financial market  participant s, and as such have external \nassets under management and under custody .7   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n6 \n  While two of the  largest banks have reduced their size over the past five years ,8 they still \nhave assets that exceed $1.5 trillion  and both had some of the most significant , well -documented  \nproblems during the financial crisis .  In sum, d espite the regulations designed to reduce TBTF, a \nnumber of the largest U.S. GSIBs have grown significantly over the past five y ears. \n Figure 2  shows U.S. GSIB banking assets and their share of U.S. bank ing industry  \nassets.  U.S. GSIB banking assets have grown for most of the past five years and now exceed \n$7.5 trillion, although there has been some decline more recently.  As a group, t otal GSIB assets \nare a little greater than 40 percent of U.S. GDP.  Moreover, G SIB assets represent a sizeable 50 \npercent  of bank ing industry  assets , down slightly from the post-crisis level.   \n Given that GSIBs are still a significant presence, how can it be argued that the problem of \nTBTF is seeing  significant progress?  It is important to remember that many of the new \nregulations that are designed to provide incentives for banks to shrink are fairly recent, and many \nhave full implementation dates several years in the future.  So it may be premature to judge what \nsize GSIBs are likely to be once the full set of TBTF regulations is implemented.  But I do \nbelieve  the most important progress on  TBTF  to date  involves  reducing the probability that these \ninstitutions will fail  – and should they fail, reducing the  risks they would pose to the entire \neconomy.  I will now share some perspectives on progress made and underway in that regard.  \n \nReducing the Probability of U.S. GSIB failure  \n There have been a variety of changes made to the supervision of GSIBs as a result of the \nfinancial crisis.  Perhaps the most crucial change has been the introduction of the CCAR ,9 which \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n7 \n examines the ability  of large bank holding companies to withstand  stressful economic and \nfinancial conditions  (as discussed by Governor Dan Tarullo ).10  Should the Federal Reserve find \na bank’s capital inadequate under the stresse s modeled  in the CCAR exercise, the Fed  can object \nto capital distributions , such as the payment of dividends or stock repurchases.  In addition to the \nCCAR’s quantitative stress analysis, bank holding companies are assessed qualitatively on their \ncapital planning process, which can also result  in limitations on capital distributions.  \n Figure 3  provides the U.S. GSIBs ’ actual Tier 1 leverage ratio in the third quarter of \n2014 and the minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio that was estimated to arise in the CCAR’s severely \nadverse scenario  conducted at th at time .11  The scenarios model  significant adverse shocks to the \nbanks  – most of the GSIBs under the severely adverse scenario experience declines in the ir Tier \n1 leverage ratio of more than 2 percent age points , but all remain above 4 percent .  The size of  the \ndecline can vary significantly across GSIBs , which is unsurprising  given their very different \nbusiness models which can be more or less impacted by a particular set of stress assumption s. \n The CCAR is a flexible supervisory tool, in that supervisors c an alter the stress scenario \nto reflect those financial and economic s ituations  that they deem to pose, currently,  the biggest \nconcerns.  Since the scenarios change from year to year, the GSIBs need to maintain a capital \ncushion sufficient to exceed minimu m capital standards under a variety of potential stress \nsituations.    \nIn sum, t he utilization of stress tests has been a major change in the supervisory process , \nand has caused GSIBs to reduce risks in areas that might lose significant capital under stressful \nconditions  – or alternatively  has caused GSIBs  to plan on holding significantly more capital \nagainst  those risks.     \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n8 \n  In addition to the stress testing required by the Dodd -Frank Act, a  number of regulatory \nchange s have  also significantly altered the capital regulation of GSIBs.  While I will address  \ntoday  the surcharge most directly focused on the GSIBs, it is important to remember that there \nhave been o ther substantial changes to capital regulation  since the financial crisis .12  The GSIB \ncapital surcharge I am highlighting is a surcharge imposed on GSIBs to reflect the systemic risk \nposed by these organizations because of the size  and complexity of their operations.   \n As Fed Chair Janet Yellen has noted, “A key purpose of the capital surcharge is to \nrequire the firms themselves to bear the costs that their failure would impose on others.  In \npractice, this final rule will confront these firms with a choice: they must either hold substantially \nmore capital, reducing the likelihood that they will fail, or else they must shrink their systemic \nfootprint, reducing the harm that their failure would do to our financial system.  Either outc ome \nwould enhance financial stability. ”13 \nThe GSIB surcharge is imposed in addition to the minimum 4.5 percent common equity \nTier 1 risk -based capital ratio and the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer.  Based on data \navailable at the time of adoption, estimates suggest the surcharge would range from 1.0 to 4.5 \npercent and would be phased in over time, with the full effect of the regulation occurring in \nJanuary 2019 .14 \n The GSIB surcharge is calibrated to reduce the GSIBs ’ probability of default, with an eye \nto the impact of a failure on the broader financial system.15  The surcharge is calculated in two \nways, and the higher of the two surcharge s is used .  The first method considers the size, \ninterconnectedness, cross -jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity of the \norganization  – similar to international standards.  The second method considers similar inputs  but \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n9 \n replaces substitutability wi th a measure of reliance on short -term wholesale funding.16  The size \nof the surcharge will depend on how banks respond by adjusting their inputs to minimize their \ncapital charge.   \n The effect  of both the CCAR stress test and the GSIB surcharge is to signi ficantly reduce \nthe probability that a GSIB fails.  The combination of these and other capital regulations (as \nphased in) should  result in a significant improvement in capital ratios for GSIBs.  Figure 4  \nshows the  increases in the common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio for this group over the \npast five years , even as new capital rules have, on net, increased risk -weightings .17  The common \nequity Tier 1 capital ratio for GSIBs now surpasses th e ratio  for non -GSIB institutions over $50 \nbillion , as well as for non -GSIB institutions under $50 billion.  \n Figure 5  shows that the Tier 1 leverage ratio for GSIB institutions has also steadily \nincreased.  While the GSIB leverage ratio  is still below that of non -GSIB insti tutions, this partly  \nreflects a higher  proportion of low -risk-weighted assets at GSIB s that get favorable capital \ntreatment under the risk -based capital ratio but not under the leverage ratio.  \n I should n ote that all the capital regulations are not fully phased in, and the counter -\ncyclical cap ital buffer is currently zero, and the actual GSIB surcharge is dependent on actions \nthe banks may take to reduce the surcharge.   In addition, it has not yet been decided by the Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve whether GSIB institutions will be required to include all or \npart of the surcharge in the capital required by the  CCAR .  If they were  required to , or if the \npost-stress CCAR minimums were increased by other means , the stress tests would be even more \nbinding on GSIB institutions.  I would b e in favor of such changes.  My own personal view is \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n10 \n that GSIB institutions should be required to  increase post -stress minimums , through one means \nor another . \n \nReducing the Cost of U.S. GSIB failures  \n If, despite the stress tests and enhanced  capital regulations , a GSIB were still to fail, \nactions have been taken to try to reduce the impact of that failure.  Quite recently the Board of \nGovernors  of the Federal Reserve  proposed a rule for total loss -absorbing capacity or “TLAC. ”  \nThe purpose of  TLAC is to i nsure that if a GSIB were to fail, sufficient debt  financing would \nhave been employed so that taxpayer resources would not be needed  in order  to resolve the \ninstitution.   \n The proposal requires U .S. GSIBs to issue enough long -term debt so that if a GSIB fails \nand need s to be resolved, the debt c ould be converted to equity and negate the need for support \nfrom taxpayers .   Figure 6  provides a depiction of the TLAC rule, assuming the fully phased -in \ncapital requirement.18 \n In addition to TLAC , the GSIBs are required to develop resolution plans or so -called \n“living wills ,” covering how they could be resolved.   Both the FDIC and the Federal Reserve \nmust agree to the resolution plan.  Evaluation of the resolution plans is continuing, but when \naccepted by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve these plans should provide additional protection \nfor taxpayer resources should a GSIB fail.  \n The combination of the TLAC proposal and resolution plans ha s caused ratings agency \nStandard & Poor’s  to downgrade ratings on the non -operating holding companies of all the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time  and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa  OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n11 \n domestic GSIBs, reflecting the enhanced possibility that there will not be government support \nshould the largest banks experience financial difficulty.  It is noteworthy that Standard & Poor’s \ndid not downgrade the operating subsidiaries  of these holding companies , since the creditors of \nthe holding company would be a source of funds for the operating subsidiaries.   It is encouraging \nto see that rating agencies are viewing the actions t aken as significantly reducing the TBTF  \nproblem . \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n Significant progress has been made in eliminating TBTF and the possibility that \ntaxpayers in the United States would need to bail out the domestic GSIBs  to preserve the \nfinancial system’s functioning .  But i t is important to remember that significant work still \nremain s.  Some of the proposals need to be finalized, some of the regulations are only in the \nprocess of being phased in, and more work needs to b e done on resolution plans to insure that \nGSIBs can be resolved in an orderly fashion.  \n Nonetheless, capital ratios at the GSIBs have been steadily increasing, with the goal of \nreducing the chances that a GSIB will fail.  In the event that o ne does  fail, t he new TLAC \nproposal and resolution plans  inten d to reduce the  potential  costs to taxpayers of such a failure \nand make it less likely that  there would be a need for  any financial support  from taxpayers to \npreserve financial system functioning .   \nThank you.  \n   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4 , 2016 at 2:15 A.M.

Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. As we begin 2016, \nwe should acknowledge the significant improvement we saw in the U.S. economy  over the past  \nyear, which enabled policymakers to raise short -term rates in December .  That good news \ncontinued with last Friday’s  release of the latest  employment report ; the economy produced \n292,000 jobs in December , and we saw an average of  284,000 jobs added per  month over the \npast quarter .  Since  the unemployment rate remain ed at 5 percent, it suggests  that people \npreviously not in the labor force are entering the labor force and finding jobs.  In addition, tighter \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n2 \n labor markets have  helped reduce unemployment in  some  segments  of the labor market that still \nhave elevated unemployment rates.1 \nWhile the last employment report was quite strong, other news around  the start of the \nNew Year has been less positive.  Stock markets in much of the world began the year on a \ndecidedly  weak note , with declines in the Chinese stock market generating particular attention.  \nThese declines have been accompanied by weak oil and commodity prices, furthering the \nconcern  that global growth has slowed significantly .  In addition, estimates of growth for f ourth \nquarter real GDP in the United States have been falling, raising the possibility  that domestic \ngrowth could be slowing.  While monetary policy should not overreact to short -term, temporary \nfluctuations in financial markets, policy makers should  take seriously the potential downside \nrisks to their economic forecasts and manage those risks as we think about the appropriate path \nfor monetary policy.   \n Also, since I will be covering a lot of ground and some key charts, data, and nuances of \nthe financial system, I would like to preview  my “punch line ,” so to speak:  \n The economy has reached an important milestone:  the central bank  raised short -term \nrates last month, reflecting the significant progress the U.S. economy has made  over \nthe course of the last year.   \n In terms of the monetary policy actions taken  by the Federal Reserve  in mid-\nDecember , the initial monetary policy tightening  was rather uneventful.  The effective \nfederal funds rate has  largely traded within the  new target range.  Other short -term \nrates in the marketplace have moved up as expected, and long -term rates  were little \nchanged .   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n3 \n  The future path of the federal funds rate will depend on incoming economic data , \nmost importantly on how that incoming data affects policymakers’ outlook for the  \neconomy for the next year or two .  I hope the economy continues to improve, so that \nfurther normalization is appropriate .  It is important , however,  to carefully manage \nrisks to the economy, including those emanating from abroad .   \n Further increases in rates are in my view likely to be gradual.  \n \nLet me note that the views I will express are my own, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \n \nThe Beginning of Policy N ormalization  \nThe national unemployment rate started 2015  at 5.7 percent , and, over the course of the \nyear, fell to 5.0 percent .  Much of this decline result ed from  new job creation, with 2.65 million \njobs created from January 2015 through December.    This is clearly good news for the economy , \nand it provided the conditions  necessary  for the Federal Reserve to finally begin remov ing some \nof the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation  that was the ne cessary , appropriate, and \neffective response to t he financial crisis, recession , and painfully slow recovery . \n With continued improvements in the economy, it is now appropriate for the U.S. central \nbank to gradually return to a more normalized monetary policy.  The first step in that gradual \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n4 \n process was December’s  increase in the federal funds rate  target  – the first rate increase  since the \nGreat Recession.   \nMy own assessment is that th e first increase went quite smoothly .  At the December \nmeeting, t he FOMC  set a target  range  for the federal funds rate o f 0.25 to 0.50 percent, up a \nquarter of a percent (25 basis points) from the prior range of zero to 0.25 percent .  Since then , the \nfederal funds rate has tended to trade in the market around 0.36 percent , about the middle  of the \nnew target range .  In addition, financial markets  did not suffer any extreme swings around the \nrate increase, as some  observers  had predict ed.  Short -term rates moved  roughly in line with the \nfederal funds rate, and long-term rates such as the 10 -year Treasury rate remained nea r their \nlevels as of the middle of December , presumably because the Fed’s action was so widely \nanticipated .  All in all , the response  to the increase  was quite uneventful and not much different \nthan expected.    \nDespite th is solid  start, the extraordinarily high level of reserves in the banking system \nimpact s the monetary policy  normalization process , and will likely cause this tightening cycle to \nbe somewhat different than previous tightening cycles.  These reserves, I would point out, are the \nconsequence of the accommodative monetary policy that was  necessary after our policy rate \ndropped to essentially zero (or hit the zero lower bound) .  \nToday I plan to discuss some of the key features  of the current  gradual normalization \nprocess , and highlight how th ese differ from previous practice.  I think it is important to take \nsome time to describe them today  – since some of the elements are new and different ; and since \nthe mechanics of monetary policy are not especially well understood, but are deployed in the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n5 \n public interest and to achieve  the Fed’s dual mandate from Congress  (maximum employment \nand stable prices ).  \nI will also discuss the outlook for the economy, particularly the lack of significant \ninflationary pressures  in the United States  and the weakness in many other parts of the world.  \nUsually the tightening cycle is , at least in part, a reflection that inflationary pressures have \nalready begun to build.  In contrast, today , core inflation has  yet to show a clear movement \ntowards the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent  target , and real GDP is projected to grow only \nsomewhat faster than potential.  All this should result in a monetary policy that moves more \ngradually than in past tightening cycles.  \n \nChang es in Monetary Policy Implementation  \n Monetary policy affects everyone, and for about eight years now monetary policymaking \nhas been in quite an extraordinary period of change and innovation  – of necessity , given  \nconditions in the U.S. economy  and aro und the world .  Today I would like  to walk you through \nsome of the recent and ongoing changes in monetary policy implementation  in the U.S., where , I \nwould suggest , aggressive action led to  results  that have actually been more favorable than in \nmany other industrialized countries.  \nFigure 1  reflect s the dramatic increase in the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet that was a \nconsequence of the central bank  purchasing Treasury and mortgage -backed  securities, with the \naim of lowering long -term interest rates and offsetting some of the weakness brought on by  the \nfinancial crisis  and Great Recession .  In the mechanics of central banking,  we paid for these \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n6 \n asset s by crediting banks with newly created reserves, which is how all those reserves got into \nthe banking system.    \nPrior to the financial crisis, monetary policy operated by setting the target for the federal \nfunds rate, a short -term interest rate on overnight loans between banks .  It did so by ad justing the \namount of money in the banking system  – by adding or removing  reserves  through open market \noperations  – and thus lowering or raising the rate at which banks were willing to lend and borrow \nin this overnight market.2   For example, t he Federal Reserve could increase the supply of \nreserves by buying private ly held Treasury  securities , paying for the securities with reserves  and \nthus injecting more reserves into the banking system .  Because the amount of reserves in the \nsystem was relat ively modest , small purchases and sales were sufficient to alter the target (and \nactual) federal funds rate.  \n In response to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve repeatedly  lowered the federal \nfunds rate , eventually reducing it s target  to effectively zero by  the end of 2008 .  But t he economy \nremained weak . To further stimulate the economy  with the federal funds rate at the zero lower \nbound , it was necessary to employ  different  monetary policy tool s.3, 4   \nWith the intent to  lower long -term interest rates , the Federal Reserve purchased Treasury \nsecurities and mortgage -backed securities .  As shown in Figure 2 , the purchase of these assets \ndramatically changed the Fed’s balance sheet  composition – from holding  primarily  short -term \nTreasury bills to holding a  large quantity of mortgage -backed securities and long -term Treasury \nsecurities.  As desired, t his had the effect  of lowering long -term rates  in the marketplace – with \nthe most direct  impact  on Treasury and mortgage -backed securities.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n7 \n  As shown in Figure 3, prior to the financial crisis there were relatively  few excess \nreserves  in the financial system , and the federal funds rate could be adjusted with very small \nchanges in the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet  – the buying (or selling ) of securities mentioned  \nearlier .  After the financial crisis, the desire to influence  interest rates required  purchasing large \nquantities of securities .  And b ecause  the Federal Reserve paid for  these assets  with bank \nreserves, there was now a large quantity  of excess reserves  in the financial system .5  This large \nsupply  of excess reserves constitutes a tremendous surplus , which  would tend to keep the federal \nfunds rate at  or very near zero.    \nAs the economy improves, however, a federal funds rate close to zero is no longer \nappropriate.  But as I’ve described, the usual  way of raising the federal funds rate is not available  \nto policymakers .  Simply put , no modest sale of securities will remove  enough excess reserves \nfrom  the system to tighten borrowing conditions in the overnight federal funds market , because \nof the extremely large volume of excess reserves .  \nSo, to increase the federal funds rate this time, the Federal Reserve  needs to use new  \ntools.  These new tools are essentially borrowing facilities for which we control the interest rate, \nrather than relying on changing the balance of reserves in the banking system to influence \ninterest rates.  \nThese administered rates help us create  the top and bottom of the new target range for t he \nfederal funds rate.  Bear with me for a moment while I describe the mechanics.  \n Congress gave  the Federal Reserve the authorization  to pay interest on reserve s, effective \nOctober of 2008 .6  Paying interest  on reserves is an important tool as the Fed works to raise rates \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n8 \n – because banks can receive interest on reserves held overnight with the Federal Reserve, banks \nwill not want to lend at a rate below what they can get from holding funds with the Fed.   \nThere is a caveat, however , worth a short digressi on.  Non-banks do not hold funds at the \nFederal Reserve , and as  a result, some non -banks are willing to lend overnight funds slightly \nbelow the interest rate banks get on reserves.  This means that  the fede ral funds rate has trade d a \nbit below the interest rate on excess reserves ( the IOER ).7  Arbitrage plays a role, however, in \npulling rates in the market towards the IOER: Since banks can earn the IOER , if overnight rates \nfall too far below the IOER , banks can make money by buying overnight funds below the IOER \nand holding those funds at the Federal Reserve  where they  receive the IOER .8 \nTo insure that overnight rates will remain close to IOER  and maintain the bottom of the \nnew target range for the fed eral funds rate , the Federal Reserve has created another facility that \npurchases funds from non -banks at a rate slightly below IOER, currently at a rate of 0.25 \npercent , in a reverse repurchase agreement transaction .  Since the reverse repurchase  agreement \ntransaction is collateralized and transacted with the central bank, and thus essentially riskless, \nthese investors should be unwilling to lend at a rate less than the reverse repurchase rate to any \nother borrower.   \nBecause this option  is availab le not only to banks, but also to money market funds and \nother financial institutions, this more widely available  facility  insures that , normally , overnight \nrates will trade between the rate the Fed pays on the reverse repurchase facility and the interest \nrate the Fed pays on excess reserves .9  Again, th e rate on the reverse repurchase agreements  \nestablish es the bottom of the Fed’s target range for the federal funds rate.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n9 \n Figure 4  provides the interest rate paid on reserves, the overnight reverse repurchase  rate, \nand the effective federal funds rate  in the marketplace .  Prior to the December FOMC meeting , \nthe interest on reserves was set at 0.25 percent .  After the December FOMC meeting , the interest \non reserves was set at 0.50 percent  (the upper end of the target range) and the reverse rep urchase  \nrate was set at 0.25 percent  (the lower end) .  The effective federal funds rate has traded in \nbetween those two rates  – with the exception of December 3 1 – with the effective federal funds \nrate since  the December FOMC meeting  generally trading in the market at 0.36 percent .   \nThe f igure shows that the effective federal funds rate has adjusted just as desired, almost \nexactly in the middle of the target ranged established by the Federal Reserve , with the only \nexception  being  that rates fell below the floor on the last day of 2015.  This largely reflects firms \nlooking to shrink their balance sheet or make their positions look less risky for end -of-year \nreporting.  That situation aside, the policy -relevant interest rate moved as anticipated.  \nFigure 5  shows the volume of Federal Reserve overnight reverse repurchase agreements.   \nWith the federal funds rate trading well above the floor  on most days , the volume of reverse \nrepurchases has been generally in line with the experience prior to raising rates.  Granted , there \nwas elevated volume for one trading day at the end of the year,  as firms adjust ed balance sheets  \nwith end -of-year reporting in mind .  But t he end of year activity was only somewhat higher than \nthe volume experienced at recent quarter -ends.10\n \n \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n10 \n The Broader Impact of the  First Tightening  on Interest Rates  \n While the short -term interest rate targeted by the Federal Reserve did act as expected  \nsince the first increase , the goal of policymakers is of course to influence the broader economy . \nThat goal  requires that our short -term interest rate changes are transmitted to a much broader \narray of interest rates and asset prices.   It is impor tant that other short -term rates  that are \navailable to a broader set of investors also begin the process of normalization.  Figure 6  provides \nseveral one-month rates  – a commercial paper rate, the  London Interbank Offered Rate  (LIBOR ), \nand the Eurodollar deposit rate .  These rates increased during the month of December , likely \nbecause markets widely anticipated the Fed’s action .  This indicates that rates which  normally \nrespond to short -term expected changes in the federal funds rate have responded to the first \ntightening, beginning the normalization process for a broader set of short -term rates  in the \nmarketplace . \n Long -term rates are less directly impacted by the overnight federal funds rate.  While \ntighter monetary policy generally increases long rates  over time , other factors can significantly \ninfluence longer -term rates – things like prospects for inflation , the exchange rate , and the \ndemand for long -term Treasury securities .  Furthermore, the expectation of some tightening may \nalready have been built i nto longer -term rates, which are likely to be affected by the likely  path \nof rates as well as the current overnight rate.  As Figure 7  shows, longer -term rates did not \nrespond significantly to the first tightening, likely reflecting the fact that the FOMC statement \nindicated strongly that the path of tightening was expected  to be “only  gradual. ” \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n11 \n  Figure 8  shows that the Treasury curve remains well below that of 10 years ago , before \nthe financial crisis.   Thus while December’s  first increase was the beginning of normalization, \nrates remain well below their pre -crisis level s. \n \nThe Recent Policy Statement  \n While long -term Treasury rates reflect a variety of influences, the Federal Reserve ’s \nearlier decision  to purchase significant quantities of long -term Treasury securities is, in my view , \none reason for the low long -term rates  we now see .  It is important to point out that in  the \nstatement announcing the first rate increase, the FOMC said that it would continue  to reinvest \nprincipal payments until normalization of the federal funds rate was well underway.   \nThe logic  is to try to move short -term interest rates first, because  we have greater \nconfidence in the likely effects of such a move on the  economy, and also, because we  will then \nhave the flexibility to respond if necessary to a large unexpected negative shock  by reducing \nshort -term rates.11\n  Reduc ing the size of our balance sheet  would also be  a form of tightening, with more \nimpact on longer -term rates .  If we were to tighten in that way , we would presumably not need to \nraise short -term rates as much.  I am fully supportive of the strategy of focusing on short -term \nrates first , before allowing the balance sheet to shrink.  \n The F OMC  statement also s aid that “ The Committee expects that economic conditions \nwill evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”  \n This gradual notion reflects our best understanding of the current economic landscape: \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n12 \n that the economy is growing relatively slowly for a tightening cycle, that the unemployment rate \nis expected to gradually hit full employment , and that inflation remains well below our 2 percent \ntarget  – and will gradually approach it as labor markets improve f urther and other factors that are \ntemporarily depressing inflation recede . \n \nUnemployment, Inflation, and Rates: Policymakers’ Forecasts  \n Figure 9  provides the unemployment rate projections through 2018 from Federal Reserve \npolicymakers.  These projections are provided in the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic \nProjections (SEP) on a quarterly basis.   The median forecast of Fed policymakers is fo r the \nunemployment rate to gradually drop to 4.7 percent and then remain there through 2018.  The 4.7 \npercent unemployment rate is consistent with my own estimate of full employment.  \nThe unemployment rate forecast carries some risks.   Figure 10 shows the p ath of the \nunemployment rate relative to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) estimate of full \nemployment  (the “natural rate” of long -term unemployment) .  You can see that i t is relatively \nunusual to have long periods of unchanged unemployment.  Rather,  the unemployment rate tends \nto fall well below the CBO estimate of full employment during most recoveries.  Similarly, once \nthe unemployment rate begins to rise, it tends to increase well above the estimate of full \nemployment.    \n An unemployment rate fall ing more rapidly than in the forecast could potentially call for \na faster increase in the policy rate. However, such a risk should be managed within a context in \nwhich inflation has been typically lower than expected.12  Indeed, one reason for moving quite \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n13 \n gradually on rate increases is that low rates may be necessary to achieve our inflation target over \nthe next several years.  \nFigure 11  compares the core PCE rate of inflation with the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent \ninflation target.  The core PCE inflation rate is currently 1.3 percent , and has remained below the \n2 percent inflation target for most of the recovery.   \n The projections in Figure 12  suggest that Fed policymakers  expect to reach our inflation \ntarget  by 2018.  However, this path reflec ts only a gradual move ment  to the target, likely \ninformed by the “misses ” we have experienced (see Figure 11 ). \n Figure 13  shows the federal funds rate projections provided by Fed policymakers in the \nSEP.  The median interest rate observation for each year is designated by a black  diamond .  \nFigure 13  suggests  that the median forecast is for increases in the federal funds rate that sum to \nroughly 1 percent age point  (100 basis point s) in each of the next two years.  However, there are a \nnumber of participants that expect the rate to be below or above the median projection.   I should \nnote that if rates did rise at the rate of the median projection, they would rise much more \ngradually t han during the previous recovery.   \nWhile the median forecast provides a reasonable estimate of the likely path of the federal \nfunds rate, my own view is that such a forecast does have downside risks.  These downside risks \nreflect continued headwinds from weakness within countries that represent many of our major \ntrading partners , and only limited data to support the projected path of inflation to target seen in \nthe SEP, at least to date .  Further tightening will require data continuing to be strong enough that \ngrowth will be at or above potential , so that Federal Reserve policymakers  can be confident that \ninflation will reach our 2 percent target.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n14 \n Conclu ding Observations  \n In summary and  conclusion, t he economy has reached an important milestone.  The \nFederal Reserve raised short -term rates last month , reflecting the significant progress made by  \nthe U.S. economy .  Labor markets have tightened , and there is an expectation that we will begin \nto see the inflation rate move towards the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target over the course of \n2016.  \nThe initial  increase in short -term rates was rather uneventful.  The Federal Reserve’s  \ntarget rate moved as expected , and the effective federal funds rate has largely traded within our \nband with the exception of a single day at year -end.  Other short -term rates have moved as \nexpected, and there was little change in long -term rates.  \nThe future path of the fede ral funds rate  will be highly dependent on our evolving \noutlook, which will, of course, respond to the incoming economic data.  My hope is that the \neconomy continues to improve, so that further normalization is appropriate.  Further increases in \nrates are  in my view  likely to be gradual .  Importantly, I will remain highly attentive to foreign \neconomic conditions , any weakening of the domestic economic situation , and the path of  U.S. \ninflation.  \nThank you , and best wishes for a successful 2016 . \n    \n                                                           \n \n1 For example, those having less than a high school diploma.  \n \n2 Banks are required to hold bank reserves on transactions accounts, and banks with excess reserves would sell \nreserves to banks that were falling short of the reserves needed to meet their reser ve requirement.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January  13, 201 6 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n3 At first, in response to the events in the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve created liquidity programs that facilitated \ntransactions in markets where there were no buyers, in order to unfreeze financial markets that had become \nessentially paralyzed.   \n \n4 And although the federal funds rate target was essentially zero, other l onger -term rates remained notic eably above \nzero.  \n \n5 The Federal Reserve determines the total volume  of reserves.  Thus when the Federal Reserve expands its balance \nsheet , the banking system must hold these reserves.   \n \n6 The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 originally authorized the Federal Reserve to begin paying \ninterest on balances held by or on behalf of depository institutions beginning October 1, 2011. The recently \nEmergency Economic Stabilization Ac t of 2008 accelerated the effective date to October 1, 2008.  See \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/20081006a.htm  and \nhttp://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor -econ/2013/march/federal -reserve -interest -balances -reserves . \n \n7 This can be explained, in part, because a number of key entities wit h excess funds to lend cannot by law receive \ninterest on reserves. But there is likely a limit to how far below the IOER the federal funds rate can fall, as the \nincentive to park money in reserves rather than lend at the funds rate becomes large as the IOE R rises significantly \nabove the funds rate.  \n \n8 Banks will not want to hold assets that don’t pay at least the interest rate on reserves, but other institutions that do \nnot hold reserves at the Federal Reserve (for example , money market funds ) or do not rec eive interest on their \nreserves  (for example, Fannie Mae) may lend funds at a rate somewhat below the Fed’s rate of interest on reserves. \nThus , the federal funds rate has traded below the rate of interest paid on reserves, because these non -bank firms are \nlending overnight funds at a rate slightly below the interest on reserves available to banks. If their rates fall too low, \nbanks could always arbitrage the market by providing funds to those market participants and holding the funds as \nexcess reserves, whi ch would earn them the Fed’s rate of interest on reserves.  However, because of regulatory \nrequirements, including capital requirements, banks will only do this arbitrage at a rate somewhat below the rate of \ninterest on reserves.  In the absence of regulat ion, with costless arbitrage, everyone would receive the interest on \nreserves as the floor at which they were willing to lend.  \n \n9 The reverse repurchase agreement is, in effect, a loan to the Federal Reserve collateralized by Treasury securities, \nin which the Federal Reserve sells Treasury securities and agrees to buy them back the next day at a slightly higher \nprice.  The difference between the sale price and repurchase price of the securities is essentially the interest earned \non the reverse repurchase ag reement.  It, in effect, provides a risk -free rate at which counterparties, including non -\nbanks, can invest their funds.   \n \n10 The jump at year -end looks less unusual relative to the previous quarter -end (September 30, 2015) when term \nreverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) are also included.  Aggregate overnight and term RRP s outstanding at the end \nof September totaled  approximately $450 billion, only somewhat less than at year -end. Because overnight RRPs had \nno limits on usage, t here was no demand for term reverse repurchase agreements at year -end.   \n \n11 Moving short -term rates represents the tool we have had the most experience with , and as a result there can be \nmore confidence in how it influences the ec onomy.  \n \n12 The tendency for core inflation to be lower tha n forecast  could reflect the fact that the equilibrium unemployment \nrate is lower than my current estimate.",
