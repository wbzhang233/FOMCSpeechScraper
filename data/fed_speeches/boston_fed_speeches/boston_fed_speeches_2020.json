U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n1 \n Good morning, i t is a pleasure to be with you today.  Participating in the CBIA ’s outlook \nevent is always a great way to start the new year.   \nWe end  2019 and begin 2020 with an economy that is doing  quite well.  The labor market \nis strong , with the national  unemployment rate  at 50 -year lows .  Inflation is somewhat below 2 \npercent , the Fed eral Reserve ’s target , but is projected to graduall y return to 2 percent .  \nIn addition, most professional forecasters are expecting the good news to continue in \n2020 .  The consensus forecast has real GDP growing roughly at potential ; the unemployment \nrate remaining near its  historically low  range of last year ; and inflation approaching  the Fed’s 2 \npercent  target .  Financial markets , too, appear optimistic about the economy’s prospects, with \nstock market indices ending the year close to all -time highs.      \n These elements of the forecast for 2020 have not changed much over the past year.  Yet \nthe current outlook for 2020  is conditioned  on a much more accommodative stance for  monetary \npolicy .  At this  time last year , the members of the Fed’s monetary policy commi ttee – the Federal \nOpen Market Committee, or FOMC – were anticipating interest rate increases , given the tight \nlabor markets and the expectation that inf lationary pressures would  build  as a result .  With the \noutbreak of trade -related  concerns  and worries over a potential global slowdown , the FOMC  \nvoted to  reduc e the federal funds rate three times during 2019 to insure against the risk of an \neconomic downturn.  As we close d out the year , it was clear that labor markets remained strong \nand the econom y continue d to grow faster than its estimated potential . \n In the December Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP), FOMC  members provided \ntheir outlook s for economic conditions in 2020 , the consensus  of which was quite similar to that \nof private forecast ers.  The SEP forecast also includes a projection of expected monetary policy \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 \n rates, the  so-called dot plot, which shows the path for monetary policy consistent with FOMC \nmembers’ forecasts.   The December dot plot showed no change in the median interest rate from \n2019 to  2020 , but has rates rising very gradually next year and beyond.  Such a forecast reflects \nwhat the FOMC policymakers  think is the most likely outcome , but it goes without saying that  \nthe economy rarely evolves exactly as expected.   \n Today , I will focus on the economic outlook  for 2020 – and two potential risks  to the \noutlook that could arise , should the economy grow faster than expected  due to  the \naccommodative stance of monetary policy .  \nThe first  potential risk I will discuss has to do wit h the acceleration of inflation, in that \nthere is the possibility  that labor markets could  tighten to unsustainable levels , causing \ninflation ary pressures to build faster than the very gradual pace that is currently expected.  The \nsecond  potential risk I will discuss has to do with financial stability, in that persistently low \ninterest rates could lead consumers and firms to take on riskier financial investments in search of \nbetter returns , increas ing asset price s to unsustainable levels .  There are  also, of course , risks that \nthe economy could underperform, and these derive primarily from geopolitical and trade risks.   I \nhave focused some on these risks in previous talks.1  But to preview my conclusion : If these risks \nremain contained, my view is we will likely have another year of good economic outcomes . \n  \nOverview of the Economic Outlook  \n Over the most recent two  quarters , real GDP has grown close to 2 percent , somewhat \nabove what economists believe is the economy’s potential  growth rate.  My own estimate of that \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n rate is about  1.75 percent .  By that calculus , the economy has recently been growing somewhat \nfaster than its potential  rate, and correspondingly unemployment declined a bit , over 2019 .    \nFigure 1  shows actual GDP growth as a solid li ne, and then provides the forecast of \nFOMC participants (the median of their projections in the SEP) through 2022 , shown as squares .  \nIt show s that the median forecast of Fed policymakers is for future real GDP growth to be 2 \npercent in 2020 , then 1.9 percent in 2021,  and then 1.8 percent in 2022 .2  The SEP also includes \nthe median of estimate s for growth in the longer run  (potential growth) , which  is 1.9 percent  – \nslightly higher than my own estimate .  But in sum , the median of these forecasts anticipates  \nannual GDP growth to be around the level  we have seen recently , and close to Committee \nmembers’  estimates of potential . \nTurning from growth to labor markets, o ver the past nine month s the unemployment rate \nhas remained in a relatively tight ban d, ranging from  3.5 to 3.7 percent.  As is c onsistent with a \ngrowth estimate close to the economy’s potential, the median forecast of Fed policymakers  is for \nthe unemployment rate to remain in this narrow band , as Figure 2  show s.   \nFOMC members ’ current median estimate of the unemployment rate in the longer run is \n4.1 percent.  This estimate has declined noticeably  over the past two years , as the actual \nunemployment rate f ell below 4 percent  and even so, inflation  remained somewhat below the \nFed’s 2 percent  target .  My own estimate s are for the unemployment rate to be somewhat below \nthe SEP median projection s for 2020 through 2022 , and for long er-run unemployment to be \nsomewhat higher than the Committee ’s median  projection of 4.1 percent . \nTurning to p rices, the inflation rate has continued to be somewhat lower than the Fed’s 2 \npercent inflation target.  The SEP median forecast has core inflation ending 2020  at 1.9 percent \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n and hitting the  2 percent  target in the following two years , as shown in Figure 3 .  By the way, it \nis worth noting that w hile the current core inflation rate is only 1.6 percent, there were very low \nreadings last spring which will fall out of the annual average this spring .  And more recent \nannualized quarterly readings have been much closer to 2 percent.   So while there remains \nuncertainty about the trajectory for inflation,  I personally do expect readings at or around the 2 \npercent target in the future.  \nIn addition, t he current federal funds rate  is well below the 2.5 percent  rate the \nCommittee expects in the longer run , so monetary policy is currently accommodative.  Given the \nstability of the forecast s for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation, it is not surprising that \nthe median forecast for interest rates  (shown in Figure 4 ) is for no change this year and gradual \nincreases over the next two years.  Certainly , the lack of inflationary pressure to date has \nprovided one justification for accommodative monetary policy despite the duration of the \nrecovery and a current historically  low unemployment rate.  However, m aintaining interest rates \nbelow the  consensus longer-run “equilibrium ” interest rate is predicated on both inflationary \npressures  not building up and financial stability concerns being contained.  \nOverall , the SEP median s project a very benign outlook , with what can be considered an \nalmost ideal economic outcome : Inflation returning to target, labor markets remaining quite \nstrong,  and economic growth close to potential .  However, as I mentioned in my introduction, the \nworld rarely  unfolds exactly as forecast .  So it is important to consider some of the risks that \ncould cause significant deviations from this rather  positive  forecast.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n Risk s to the Forecast : Acceleration of Inflation  \n Since the financial crisis  of 2008,  the inflation rate has fairly persistently undershot the \nFed’s  target of 2 percent , which we use in pursuing our assigned mandate of price stability.  \nUndershooting the target for most of th e period  since the crisis  was not especially surprising , \ngiven the slack in resource  utilization  caused by the severe recession .  However,  the more recent \nabsence of significant inflationary pressures  – despite very low unemployment rates  – has been \nmore surprising.  In fact, given  historically  low unemployment rates, most forecasters have \nsystematically expected more inflation than has actually occurred.   \nThe inverse  relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate  – high \nunemployment  is associated with lower inflation, other things equal, and vice versa  – is often  \nreferred to as  the “Phillips Curve, ” named after New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, who first \nobserved the regularity  of the pattern .  This relationship was more apparent up until the mid -\n1990s, but it has become n oticeably weaker over the past 25 years.  There are many potential \nexplanations for th e smaller effect of unemployment on inflation , including  the somewhat \ndiminished  size and influence of  labor unions and more effective inflation targeting by central \nbanks .  Whatever the reasons, the relationship has undeniably weakened, with  inflation \nremaining be low 2 percent despite the unemployment rate reaching 50 -year lows.  \nOne implication of low inf lation and low nominal interest rates is that there is very little \nroom for monetary policy to react to an economic downturn by reducing rates.  Currently, with \nnominal interest rates and inflation below two percent, Fed policymakers have much less room to  \nreduce short -term interest rates before hitting the effective lower  bound than they did in recent \nrecessions.  In addition, prevailing long-term rates are lower , because of lower expected inflation \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n and lower inflation risk premia.  This leaves policymaker s with less room to use large -scale asset \npurchases to push down  long-term rates, should they hit the effective lower bound with the short -\nterm rates they influence.3 \nWhile private forecasts and the  Fed’s  SEP expect low inflation and low interest rates, I \nwould note that this is predicated on inflation continuing to be tame.  However, we should \nacknowledge that there are relatively few cases  where the unemployment rate and the Fed’s \npolicy interest rate both remain ed well below  their estimated long-run valu es for an extended \ntime.  \nAs a result, one risk that could alter the outlook is if inflationary pressures buil d up more \nquickly than currently expected.  Admittedly, with little room currently to lower rates in a \ndownturn, inflation somewhat exceeding projections could be a good thing.  But e conomists do \nnot have a very precise understanding of how inflation expectations form, and of course an \neconomy  eventually  running too hot could increase inflationary pressures.    \n Figure 5 shows that average hourly  earnings have been trending  up over the past five \nyears , although in the most recent report released last Friday, the preliminary figures indicate a \npause , which will be followed closely in terms of the trend .  While some of this increase is \nconsistent with wages that reflect  inflation a bit below 2 percent , and productivity growth of \nabout 1 percent, w e see some evidence that a strong  labor market is placing additional upward \npressure on wages , as the  wages of nonsupervisory workers have risen more quickly.  Let me be \nclear – sustainable wage growth is a good thing.  But w ith higher minimum wages, and more \nwage pressures for low -wage workers , wage inflation that noticeably exceeds the sum of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n productivi ty growth and inflation may result in price pressures, particularly in sectors that do not \nface import competition , such as services . \n Again, to some degree , wage increases need not be  inflationary  if they are offset by \nincreased productivity.  However, the growth in productivity has been modest in recent years , as \nshown in Figure 6.   \nAlso, r eal wage gains  in excess of productivity growth  tend to  be reflected in a \nweakening of corporate profits  relative to GDP .  As shown in Figure 7,  corporate profits relative \nto GDP have been tailing off in recent years .  While l ower corporate profit margins are one way \nto absorb wage pressures without rai sing prices , relatively  lower corporate earnings  of late may \nmake absorbing increased wage costs less likely . \n To the extent that firms are unable or unwilling to absorb  the rising costs as wages \nrespond to low unemployment, we may observe the associated inflation risk materializ ing.  \nAdmittedly,  most forecasters do not expect this in their modal  (most likely outcome)  forecast .  \nBut more rapid than expected inflation remains a risk of running the economy with \naccommodative monetary policy and tight labor markets.  \n \nRisks to the Forecast: Financial Stability  \n As a practical matter, central bankers do not have much histo rical experience with \nextended periods where interest rates  are running  below the estimated equilibrium level while  \nunemployment  rates  are, simultaneously, historically low .  So we want to be alert to any \npotential risks emerging.  In my view, another potential risk is that low interest rates and a \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n booming economy will encourage  investors  to increasingly “ reach for yield ” – that is, they will \ntake on more risk  in order  to raise the nominal returns they are receiving  (since  the associated \nrisk premiums embedded in the returns to riskier assets  compensate for that added risk ).4   \nReal estate is an area of the economy that is  historically susceptible to this risk -taking .  \nBoth residential and commercial real estate are sensiti ve to the level of interest rates , and are \nwidely held as collateral by leveraged financial institutions.5  Some of the more severe \nrecessions, both in the U.S.  and ab road, have occurred when real estate prices collapsed and the \nfinancial positions of highly  leveraged institutions and households became precarious . That is, \nthe debt they held came to greatly exceed the value of the assets they had borrowed against.  \n Figure 8  shows the change in house prices relative to per capita personal income since \n2015 , for the United States and several European nations.   An increase in the index indicates \npurchasing a home is less affordable, as income is not increasing as rapidly as hou se prices.   The \nindex has risen almost 10 percent in the U.S. since 2015, as housing prices have been rising \nfaster than per capita personal income.   In some countries – like Portugal, the Netherlands , and \nGermany, the index and house prices have risen muc h more sharply since 2015.    Low interest \nrates – in some cases negative – may be spurring house price increases.    \nSimilarly, there continue to be  decreases  in the capitalization rate s of commercial real \nestate  properties.  A low cap italization  rate – the ratio of net operating income to the price of the \nproperty, at the time of the transaction , shown in Figure 9  – implies relatively high valuations \ncompared to the income the property is expected to generate, which is a sign of inflated asset \nprices.  Fortunately, s ome sectors have seen capitalization rates decreasing  less rapidly of late.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n In sum, i t is important to see and understand the risk that  sustained low interest rates \ncould place more pressure on real estate asset prices  through reach -for-yield behavior – a \nscenario that preceded the 1990 and 2007 recessions .  In certain scenarios,  financial stability \nrisks could potentially emerge as  a problem for the otherwise  benign outlook . \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n To summ arize and conclude, p rivate forecasters and FOMC participants anticipate  a good \noutcome for the economy  in 2020 and beyond , with low inflation and strong labor markets.  \nHowever, as with any forecast, there are risk  scenarios  that are not captured in the most likely \noutcome fo r the economy.   I have highlighted two  potential risks  that I will be monitoring  this \nyear – inflation picking up more than currently expected ; and asset prices, particularly real estate \nprices, showing evidence of more acute financial stability risks .  To be fair, there are also \ndownside risks to the economic outlook, as well  – primarily centered on the potential for trade \ndisruptions  and slowing growth among our trading partners.  But I see the potential risks to \ninflation and financial stability as som ewhat more concerning, overall.  \n Thank you again for inviting me to participate in today’s forum.  Best wishes to all in \nConnecticut, New England, and the nation for a positive and prosperous 2020.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday,  January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 \n 1 For example , see additional discussion in my talk,  “Exploring Economic Conditions and the Implications for Monetary Policy ,” Oct. 11, 2019.    \n \n2 Measured on a fou rth quarter to fourth quarter basis.  \n \n3 Currently, with nominal interest rates below 2 percent, Fed policymakers have less than 2 percentage points to lower r ates in the event of a \ndownturn – less than one -half the amount by which they typically lowered r ates to fight past recessions.  In addition, prevailing long-term rates \nare lower now than in the past because of lower expected inflation, lower inflation risk premia, and the lower term premia th at our large -scale \nasset purchases engendered.  This leaves  policymakers with correspondingly less room to lower long -term rates through such purchases, a policy \nthat proved effective in spurring the economy following the last recession once the Fed had pushed short -term interest rates to their effective \nlower bou nd. The lack of room to cut rates if needed certainly amplifies any downside risk to the forecast.   \n \n4 See, for example, Lina  Lu, Matthew Pritsker, Andrei Zlate, Kenechukwu Anadu, and Jim Bohn, “ Reach for Yield by U.S. Public Pension \nFunds ,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Supervisory Research and Analysis Working Paper s 2019,  Series 19 -2.

U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n2 \n   Good afternoon.   I would like to thank the organizers of this conference for inviting me to \nparticipate on this panel – and more broadly fo r organizing a conference examining many of the \nchallenges policymakers have faced over the past  20 years.  As many of you know, these were \nchallenges that Marvin Goodfriend anticipat ed, well before the Great Recession forced \npolicymakers to confront them.  Specifically, our panel topic – monetary policy and the zero \nlower bound – is one that Marvin devoted a good d eal of thought to.  A nd as I’ll touch on today, \nhis emphasis on this topi c proved prescient.   \nI will focus my remarks on his paper, “Ove rcoming the Zero Bound on Interest Rate \nPolicy,” that appeared in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking  roughly 20 years ago.  The \narticle was originally written for a Federal Rese rve conference held in Woodstock, Vermont, in \nOctober 1999 – before most economists were thinking of this as a significant problem.1\n  Indeed, in October 1999, the federal funds rate was 5.2 percent and the Federal Reserve \nwas increasing interest rates.  In fact, the funds rate had not been below 2 percent since the early \n1960s, despite several severe recessions.  The “j ob-loss” expansion in the mid-2000s had not yet \noccurred, nor had the Financial Cr isis.  And despite th e developments in Ja pan, where short-term \nnominal rates hit zero in 1999, most economists cons idered it unlikely that  the U.S. policy rate \nwould fall to zero.  Moreover, the thinking was that in the highly unlikely event it did fall that \nfar, it would be there for only a quarter or two. \nFor several reasons, Marvin had the foresight to take seriously the possibility of zero \ninterest rates in the U.S.  The zero interest rate s prevailing in Japan at the time, together with a \nlow-inflation environment in many developed count ries, prompted Marvin to revisit and expand \non an issue that had been examined previously, in  the context of the Great  Depression.  In fact, I \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n3 \n had numerous discussions with Marvin about Ja pan’s “Lost Decade” of the 1990s, and what its \nrelevance could be for future monetary policymaking.    \nIn our conversations and in his 1999 paper, Marvin emphasized two policies that were \nactually implemented, later, in response to the Fi nancial Crisis – negative  interest rates, which \nwere adopted in Europe and Japan; and open market purchas es of long bonds, which were \nimplemented in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.   \nOn the first, Marvin highlighted that negative nominal interest rates might be helpful in a \nsignificant economic downturn when the policy rate had already reached zero.  Although many \ndismissed this suggestion, given the higher (zero) return to ho lding currency, Marvin focused on \nthe technical issues regarding the central bank’s ability to charge negati ve nominal rates on bank \nreserves.  Yet Marvin realized that even if  policymakers could succeed in charging negative \ninterest rates, and possibly help the overall ec onomy recover, he correct ly noted that such a \npolicy could “create stress for lenders and pe ople heavily dependent on interest income.” \nOn the second policy, the open-market purch ases of long-term bonds that Marvin \ndiscussed were ultimately employed during the Fi nancial Crisis in almost every developed \ncountry.  He viewed these asset purchases as an important part  of the monetary policy toolbox, \nparticularly when short-term rates approached their lower bound.  Howeve r, he advocated that \nthe U.S. Treasury Department should agree to inde mnify the central bank ag ainst capital losses.  \nIndeed, he understood the potential political pi tfalls a central bank w ould face in such an \nenvironment.  I would point out th at this type of indemnification was done in the U.K., but not in \nthe United States.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n4 \n Overall, Marvin showed a great deal of inte llectual dexterity at a time when the United \nStates was far from seeing short-term rates approach the zero bound.  In many respects, his paper provided a prescient preview of many of the actions ultimately taken by global central banks during the Financial Crisis.   \nOf course, some of the operational sugges tions, such as implementing a carry-tax on \ncurrency, were unlikely to get much political trac tion, despite their potential ability to make his \npolicy suggestions more effective.  But the clar ity in Marvin’s thinki ng and the boldness of his \nsuggestions highlight the creative intellect  that characterized much of his work. \nNow that we have the experience of the Financial Crisis and the resulting Great \nRecession, we should ask ourselves some importa nt questions.  What further issues should \npolicymakers consider as we confront the curr ent low-interest-rate environment, given the \npotential for adverse shocks?  And, with more th an 20 years of experience since Marvin wrote \nhis paper, what additional concerns should we have? \nI’ll offer three observations on those questions. \nFirst, Marvin foresaw another element of the current situation that few anticipated – that \nthe equilibrium real rate of interest might fall to a very low level.  In fact, in the time since he \nwrote his paper in the late 1990s , the amount of “space” for monetary policy to operate before \nhitting the effective lower bound ha s diminished significantly.  Ind eed, we are in a low-interest-\nrate environment for reasons that go beyond th e low-inflation environment emphasized in \nMarvin’s paper, and this  may have implications for the effec tiveness of the policy solutions at \nthe zero lower bound.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n5 \n Specifically, in June 2007 – prior to the Financ ial Crisis – the effective federal funds rate \nand the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate were above 5 pe rcent.  While the federa l funds rate ultimately \nfell to zero in 2008, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate  did not, as Marvin anti cipated.  Long rates at \nthe time remained above zero.  Now, however, for a variety of reasons, the federal funds rate is \nat only 1.1 percent (the target ra nge being 1 to 1.25 percent), and the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate \nfell below 1 percent this week.  As investors are more aware of the likelihood of short-term rates \nhitting the zero lower bound, they have been mo re willing to use U.S. Treasury bonds as hedges \nagainst recession risk.   \nOn January 21, around the time of the first U.S. coronavirus cases, the 10-year U.S. \nTreasury rate was 1.8 percent.  With on-going con cerns about the coronavirus, the 10-year rate \ndeclined by roughly 80 basis points.  If the econo mic reaction to the coronavirus does result in \nthe funds rate falling to its effective lower bound, th is heightened sensitivity of the 10-year U.S. \nTreasury rate to adverse news raises the possibi lity that the 10-year U. S. Treasury rate could \nfollow close behind.  In fact, this “co-movement ” has been the case for some time in many \ncountries.  As a result, there w ould be little room for the Federa l Reserve to lower rates through \nlarge purchases of long-term Treasury securi ties – like it did to make conditions more \naccommodative in and after the Great Recession – if a recession occurred in this rate \nenvironment.     \nSuch a situation would raise challenges policymakers did no t face even during the Great \nRecession.  In such a case, as Marvin highlighted in his 1999 article, we should allow the central \nbank to purchase a broader range of securities or assets.  Such a policy, however, would require a \nchange in the Federal Reserve Ac t.  And I agree with Marvin’s analysis that if the Federal \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n6 \n Reserve pursued such a policy, it should possess an explicit agr eement with the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment to indemnify the Fed against losse s.  Alternatively, the Federal Reserve could \nconsider a facility that  could buy a broader set of assets, pr ovided the Treasury agreed to provide \nindemnification.   \nSecond, while Marvin felt that negative interest rates might be effective and could be \nmade operational, I will say that I remain skeptical.  Marvin recogni zed potential side effects, but \nI personally view the adverse side  effects as likely quite large.  Marvin noted negative rates \nwould pose a significant challenge for banks, and I mo re than agree with him.  We need banks to \nbe healthy enough to provide credit and li quidity in challenging economic times.  \nCompared with banks in the United States, ba nks in Europe and Japan – where rates have \nbeen negative for some time – have lower price- to-book ratios, lower return on assets, and lower \nleverage ratios.  While there are many factors influencing these comparatively lackluster metrics, \nI would suggest that negative interest rates have been part of the problem.2\n  In my view, negative interest rates p oorly position an economy to recover from a \ndownturn.  And other actions that have helped support banks in Japan and Europe might not be \npolitically feasible in the United States. \nIn addition, many developed countries have fina ncial stability authoriti es that have tools \nto potentially limit excessive leverage for households and firms.  It is important to note that the \nUnited States has no such organization with the aut hority and tools to restra in excessive leverage \nfrom developing in a low-intere st-rate environment.  And while  the U.S. Congress could, for \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n \n7 \n example, limit the tax deductibility of debt when it involves excessive leve rage, such tax reform \nseems unlikely any time soon.   \nThird, and finally, I view the recent experi ence of countries with  negative rates as \nevidence that such a policy would not be particul arly successful in stimulating economic activity.  \nIn part, concerns with retireme nt and pension arrangements in an environment of negative rates \nhave caused saving rates to rise, not fall, in so me of these countries – meaning that consumers \nare less willing to spend and fuel the economic r ecovery.  In addition, firms’ behavior does not \nseem to respond very strongly to negative rates.  Further, while the exchange rate effects from \ninterest rate changes can be im portant for firms, they become virtually nonexistent if every \ncountry moves their rates into  negative territory.     \nIn a low-interest-rate environment, the obvi ous alternative to monetary policy in a \ndownturn is to depend on fiscal policy shoulde ring a greater share of the burden for providing \nneeded stimulus to the economy.  Somewhat surp risingly, there seems to  be little movement \ntoward making automatic stabilizers more prominent, or preparing to invest significantly more in \nthe sorts of public investment projects that yield positive returns. \nIn 1999, Marvin Goodfriend was able to consid er what had not occurred in the recent \npast, and contemplate bold alternatives.  Over the next few years, th at type of vision and \nboldness will be needed by all policymakers if we have to consider how policy should react to \nany large, adverse shock to the economy. \nThank you. \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M.

        "content": "Addressing the Economic Effects of the COVID- 19 Pandemic  \nA perspective from Eric Rosengren , president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nJust 20 days ago , Dr. Paul Biddinger and I urged  employers  to prepare for the gather ing storm  by taking tangible step s, \nlike implement ing work -from -home and restricting business travel,  to prevent more devastating health  and economic  \noutcomes  from the pandemic . \nToday , we’re witnessing  the pandemic’s  stark effects on public health. Meanwhile, t he necessary response – social \ndistancing – has stilled our strong economy , disrupt ing countless  lives  and livelihoods . It’s also  been  distorting  the credit \nand liquidity flows that underpin our economy , threatening the greater pain of a full-blown  financial crisis . \nBut e verybo dy can help mitigate the  pandemic’s impact. Public health officials and heroic front -line medical p ersonnel \nplay the most important part . Governments, civic organizations, scientific and educational institutions, and citizens also \nhave  key roles to play.  And f iscal policy is crucial.  \nAt the  central bank we’re  focused on addressing, and blunt ing, the economic effects of the pandemic. T he Federal \nReserve  has acted quickly to address  spillovers from the economic disruption. I’d like to explain some of what the Fed \ndid, and suggest other steps that a range of parties could pursue.  \nThe Federal Reserve  is working to limit the financial and economic distres s – to take actions  that help avoid  even  higher \nlevels of unemployment or a slower recovery. To that end, t he Fed’s interest -rate -setting committee cut the short -term \nrates the Fed controls to close to zero to help ease market interest rates in an economy  suddenly facing challenges  (see \nFig. 1).   \nFurther , both the Treasury and mortgage-securities  markets had too many people and institutions seeking to sell assets  \nto raise cash  (rushing to more liquid assets as a crisis response) , resulting  in an inability to trade,  and unusual volatility. \nTo remedy distortions in these important markets , the Fed h as been buying Treasuries and mortgage- backed securities  \nto stabilize markets and make it easier for financial institutions to pass through lower interest rates to consumers and \nbusinesses.  \nIn addition , many firms and individuals keep liquid assets in money market funds , and there was a danger of seeing \nfunds gated or closed as investors rushed to pull cash from them  (see Fig. 2) . Similarly, the municipal money market \nfunds that buy short -term, highly -rated municipal securities  and help meet the short -term funding needs of \nmunicipalities  were seeing few trades.  In sum,  given the rush for cash in financi al market s, it was proving a challenge for \nthe funds to sell high -quality debt of even the strongest companies and states.  The Boston Fed  open ed a facility  that \nlends money to banks, so they can buy these highly -rated assets from money market funds . This ensures money market \nfunds can meet the demands of individuals and firms seeking to redeem cash , restores  a market for short -term high -\nquality asse ts, and addresses the liquidity problem impacting individuals, companies, and local governments .  \nAlso,  the New York Reserve Bank is running a facility to buy short -term high -quality assets of firms – helping trading to \nresume and s upport ing firms’ ability to issue short -term debt . It is important for economic fun ctioning that firms have \naccess to funding . The New York  Fed is establishing facilities for firms to issue debt and for secondary trading of debt . \n(see Figs. 3 & 4)  \nMeanwhile , problems threatened to ripple through banking markets  as business  closures and layoffs spiked.  To meet \nthe increased demand for liq uidity, the Federal Reserve is providing collateralized loans to banks so their customers –  \nfirms and individuals  – have access to liquid funds . Regulatory  changes will allow bank s to restructure loans to help \n\nindividuals and businesses with a temporary loss of revenue  avoid bankruptcy and layoffs by, for instance, defer ring \npayment of principal and interest for up to six months.  \nFiscal policy makers have  acted strongly with the recently passed CARES Act. We must continue to adapt as the crisis \nproceeds , with  constant attention to the plight of workers who have been or will be laid off. Unfortunately, we expect \nthe unemplo yment rate to rise dramatically.  \nSocial distancing is needed  to avoid overwhelm ed medical facilities and unnecessa ry deaths, but it also poses great \nchallenges  for low-income workers, who are  more likely to lose jobs and have few other resources . Meanwhile, \nfurloughs have been occurring,  particularly in the hotel, retail, travel and restaurant industries . We’ve already seen an \nunprecedented  rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance .   \nTraditional e conomic  models are challenged by  this unique situation. To me,  the mo st important factors are how well \nwe avoid financial spillovers , and how effective the fiscal stimulus is, as well as the progression of COVID -19 infections . \nThese will all impact the speed of the economic recovery . That is  not a fatalistic assessment. O n the contrary,  it should \ngalvanize us.  In that spirit, I offer three concluding observations : \n1. This is a time for public -spiritedness  \nOur mantra a t the Boston Fed is “public service that makes a difference.” Central banks can and must do a lot in crises, \nto alleviate str esses in the financial system we all count on, which  can hurt all citizens. But e veryone – in small or big \nways – can do their part to make a difference. T he public interest is more important than ever ; social distancing is one \nexample. What we all do now in the public interest can help recover y, once the worst is over.  \n2. This is no time to leave anyone behind  \nWe are all being challenged right now , but our legacy can be that we rose to the challenge and kept a focus on the \nvulnerable, those with low and moderate income, and those whose livelihoods operate on the thinnest of margins. T he \nlong-term prosperity of our region and the people who are our nei ghbors (and our customers)  will shape the recovery. \nAmong other things, we need to support the workers who keep our organizations and those we rely on (like grocery \nstores , shipping networks , and of course health care) up and running. And we must tide over  workers and businesses \nthat see demand dry up for a while.  \n3. This is a time for our best , together   \nThe brainpower of our region and nation is needed more than ever , and i t is important to continue being nimble, \ncreative, proactive, and, perhaps most import antly, collaborative  – because the tactics and approaches that will help are \nlikely to be multifaceted and involve the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.   \nThis is  a time of challenge , but it’s also a time to  bring out our very best . \n \nThis perspective summarizes remarks delivered at a  forum  hosted by the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, held on \nApril 1, 2020.  \n\n \n \n \nNote:  All charts are daily, from February 18, 2020 through March 30, 2020.  \nSources:  (1) Federal Reserve Board, (2) iMoneyNet, (3) Bloomberg Finance L.P., Federal Reserve \nBoard, (4) ICE/BAML, Federal Reserve Board, (1,3,4) Haver Analytics  0.000.250.500.751.001.251.501.75\n18-Feb-20 03-Mar-20 17-Mar-20Figure 1:  Federal Funds Rate\nPercent\nEmergency \nFOMC \nMeetings\n600700800900\n2,4002,8003,2003,600\n18-Feb-20 03-Mar-20 17-Mar-20Government (Left Scale)\nPrime (Right Scale)Billions of Dollars Billions of DollarsFigure 2:  Prime and Government Money Market Fund \nAssets Under Management\n-0.10.40.91.41.9\n18-Feb-20 03-Mar-20 17-Mar-20PercentFigure 3:  Spread Between Highly -Rated Asset -Backed \nCommercial Paper Rate and the Federal Funds Rate\n01234\n18-Feb-20 03-Mar-20 17-Mar-20PercentFigure 4:  Spread Between AA Corporate Bond Yield and \n5-Year Treasury Yield",

U.S. Eastern Time on Tues day, May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n“The Main Street Lending Program and  \nOther Federal Reserve  Actions” \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nRemarks to t he New England Council  \n \n \nBoston, Massachusetts   \nMay 1 9, 2020  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to offer some remarks and information  \nduring this incredibly challenging time for New Englanders  and all Americans .  People in \nhouseholds across the country are coping with illness, working on front lines, and adjusting to \nnew realities and uncertainties.  Most Americans are concerned about the impact of the public \nhealth crisis on their family and friends ; and worry about their financial he alth too, given the \nsevere economic consequences of the pandemic.   \nUnfortunately,  the pandemic and the absolutely necessary response, aimed at protecting \nlives and health , involve  a high cost to the economy  – which was so recently doing very well .  \nThe economic shock is an unprecedented challenge for economic policymakers including the \nFederal Reserve , where we will do whatever we can  to support a return to  full employment a nd \nstable prices  – our mandate from Congress – and our commitment to financial st ability , which is \nimportant to the well -being of all Americans . \nPublic health concerns  are driving the economic challenges we face, so as an economic \npolicymaker I have to analyze a range of medical and public health issues.  Unfortunately , in the \nUnited States we have so far not been able to fully halt community spread of the virus, and many \nstates are now relaxing restrictions even while infections and deaths remain a major concern.  \nWhile allowing employers to reopen will enable  some peop le to return to work,  it is not a \npanacea for our economic challenges, which again are rooted in public health  concerns .  It is \npossible that many  households will remain reluctant to spend , and employees may be reluctant to \nreturn  to the workplace – either because of their own health concerns, the lack of open daycare  \nfacilities or schools  for their children, or to protect or take care of other family members .  Some \nfirms may be  reluctant to invest , until community spread of the virus has been signifi cantly \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n reduced .  The optimal mix of public health and economic policies is complex , making economic \nforecasts at this juncture unusually uncertain.   \n To be sure, the economic pain ushered in by the pandemic is extraordinary.   The recent \nemployment report1 underscores  the unprecedented speed and ferocity with which jobs have \nbeen affected by this public health crisis.  Social distancing and quarantine are essential health \npolicy measures, but costly.   It is important that the  sacrifices and  progress  made so far not be \nundone.  This requires that health policy measures limit the risk of second waves  of the \npandemic,  to the extent  possible .  \nFrom an economic policy standpoint, my view is that measures should be taken to limit  \nthe potential for medium - and longer -term “scarring ” from the crisis.  This means, among other \nthings, minimizing the length of unemployment spells , and ensuring that solvent firms have the \nliquidity necessary to weather the crisis.  As a result, it is very important that we maintain \nresolve to do whatever is necessary to restore the public health and economic health of the \nUnited States as quickly as possible.  \n Central banks can play a powerful role in crises.  S ome of the more significant  financial \nspillovers recently  have been mitigated by the actions of the Federal Reserve.2  For example, t he \npanic selling that hit financial markets in March was largely offset by  the Fed – by reducing \nshort -term interest rates to near zero , and setting u p emergency lending facilities  and purchasing \nsecurities to support the credit needs of U.S. households and businesses .  Preventing bouts of \nfinancial instability from having significant spillovers to the flow of credit to consumers and \nbusinesses is a vital crisis role for central banks, and the Fed has aggressively played that role \nduring this  very challenging period . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n In my remarks today,  I will provide a brief overview of the economy and its future \nprospects .  I will discuss  two of the  Federal Reserve  System ’s lending programs – which are \nbeing operated by the Boston Fed  for the System  – in an effort to help explain and illuminate \nrecent policy actions  and to inform  businesses and lending institutions about how they can \nparticipate . \nThe first emergency lending facility  I will discuss is the Money Market  Mutual Fund \nLending  Facility,3 which  was established in late March  and operate s out of the Boston Fed  to \nhelp alleviate disruptions in short -term credit  markets  and money market  mutual  funds .   \nThe second program I will discuss is the Main Street Lending Program, which, when it \nbegins operating in the coming weeks , is intended to help provide loans to businesses affected  by \nthe COVID -19 pandemic.4  The program will operate through three facilities: the New, Priority , \nand Expanded  loan facilit ies.  I will say more about the program in a moment.  \n \nRecent Economic Developments  \n I’d like to give an overview of recent economic developments.  As I noted in my \nintroduction, t he April employment report encapsulated the scale and severity of this public -\nhealth -driven economic crisis .  Job loss  for so many Americans  is spurring the Federal Reserve \nto do all we can to help, as I  will describe shortly .   \nWhile the economy had a very low unemployment rate in February  – 3.5 percent  – by \nApril the unemployment rate had soared  to 14.7 percent , as shown in Figure  1.  In addition, \npayroll employment declin ed by 20.5 million jobs in the month of April.  This unprecedented \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n shock to the labor markets has two components : employees who temporarily  are not working \nbecause of the mandated shutdowns intended to contain the pandemic, and those workers \ncurrently , or likely to soon be, more permanently  unemployed becaus e firms are closing or \nbecause the weakened demand for goods does not require as many workers.  Unlike the past \nthree recessions, t he April data are  consistent with m ost of these workers being temporarily la id \noff.  Yet the following  is a key point: how we all address the pandemic will greatly influence \nhow many of  these temporary  job losses  become permanent.  \n Figure  2 shows the percent decline in payroll jobs for select industries, with the decline \nmeasured from February , before the pandemic widely affected  labor markets.  The largest \ndeclines occurred in industries where social distancing is most challenging  – such as  recreation, \nentertainment, the arts , and food services .  These activities have been severely  curtailed  by \nclosure requirements , and may continue to be hurt  by the discomfort individuals  may have in \nattending large events or eating out while community spread of the disease  remains a concern . \n Figure  3 illustrates the declines in employment in terms of  the total number s of jobs lost  \nby industry .  The two largest drops were in accommodation and food services, and retail trade.  \nThese two industries employ a large share of U.S. workers, and again are industries that may \nhave trouble returning to full capacity as long as consumers are c oncerned about their safety.  \n Figure  4 shows the share of total employment for industries that may be significantly \nimpacted by the pandemic for some time.   With accommodation and food services , and retail \ntrade , together  accounting for such a large share of total employment  (nearly 20%) , a full \nrecovery in the economy is going to hinge on  how well society gets the pandemic under control.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n If consumers are afraid to eat out , shop,  or travel , a relaxation in laws requiring business closures \nmay do little to bring back customers, and thus jobs.  \n Figure  5 provides another reason why firms may face significant challenge s as long as \nthe public health concerns have not been sufficiently mitigated.  Americans that are between 50 \nand 79 years of age account for 45 to 55 percent of purchases in spending categories  that are  \nimportantly affected by social distancing .  Because people in this age cohort are more likely to \nsuffer severe consequences if infected  by the virus , they may be particularly reluctant to venture \nout until the public health situation improve s significantly . \n In sum, simply allowing business es to reopen is not a panacea.   Until community spread \nof the virus has been significantly reduced , many of the industries with the sharpest job cuts will \nlikely face reduced demand as long as social distancing is necessary.  Public health solutions are \nparamount – without them, it will be virtually impossible to return to full employment.  I t is vital \nthat the design and timing of  reductions in business res trictions not result in worse health \noutcomes and higher unemployment over a longer period of time . \n \nThe Federal Reserve ’s Response to the Pandemic  \n If they do the right things, central banks can help address crises  and prevent , or at least \nsubstantially mitigate,  the spillover of problems from the financial realm to the real economy \ncomposed of household and business  activity .  Although the unemployment rates may look \nsimilar to those in the Great Depression, both fiscal policy from the federal government  and \nFederal Reserve  actions  have now  – in contrast to the Great Depression era – taken \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n unprecedented actions to mitigate the economic downturn .  The Fed  quickly reduced s hort-term \ninterest rates to close to zero ; stabilized the foundational markets for Treasury and mortgage \nsecurities , through purchases ; and established lending facilities to make sure that credit is \navailable  and not seizing up .  And Congress has passed  and the President has signed  several \naggressive spending and aid packages to assist l aid-off workers and to support businesses during \nthe shutdown .  \nToday, in the interest of time, I would like to focus on two  of the emergency  Federal \nReserve facilities , as they are  being administered  by the Federal Reserve  Bank  of Boston .  It is \nimportant to note that the powers granted to the Fed  for emergency and exigent actions involve \nlending , not spending .5  All of the Fed’s  programs involve loans that are to be repaid ; they are \nnot grants  by the Fed .  But lending can play a crucial role in a crisis and in bridging to more \nnormal conditions.  \n The M oney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility , or MMLF,  set up in March and \noperat ing through the Boston Fed, was  designed to address two problems.  First, short -term debt \ninstruments , such as commercial paper , were not trading  efficiently due to a lack of liquidity,  and \nthe interest -rate spreads had become unusually wide  (meaning rates were jumping higher as asset \nprices fell  in “fire sale” mode ).  Second, prime money market funds that  buy these short -term \ndebt instruments were facing redemptions by investors, and at the same time were having \ndifficulty selling financial instruments that normally are highly liquid, with rates  close to the \nfederal funds rate.  \nMore specifically , money mar ket funds that invest substantially in corporate short -term \ndebt, including commercial paper, experienced large redemptions as conditions deteriorated in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n March.  The concern was that such large redemptions would reduce the supply of credit to \nbusinesses.  Moreover, these large outflows risked further disrupting the short -term credit \nmarket s, including if money market mutual funds  resorted to disposing of assets at “fire sale” \nprices, or imposed fees or gates on redeeming investors – which would mean further  loss of \npublic confidence and impacts on households and businesses that invest in these funds.   \n Figure  6 shows that in February, commercial paper was trading relatively close to the \nfederal funds rate.  As the pandemic worse ned, the federal funds rate was cut to near ly zero, but \neven so,  rates on commercial paper rose significantly.  In response to these developments, the \nMMLF  was established to  provide non -recourse loans , generally  at an interest rate of 1.25 \npercent , that were  collateralized by  short -term debt instruments owned by money market funds.  \nAs the MMLF made loans, the rates began to fall on short -term debt instruments , and by the \nmiddle of April, short -term rates were well below the 1.25 percent charged on those loans, \nmeaning the market had stabilized and the emergency facility worked . \n Figure  7 shows  another dimension of this brief crisis.  While government money market \nfunds, which invest in securities with little default risk, were experiencing large inflows, by the \nmiddle of March  as crisis conditions flared  up, the riskier prime money market funds were \nexperiencing significant outflows.  To meet these outflows , the prime funds were selling short -\nterm debt instruments a mid an illiquid market for such assets .  Wit h the availability  of the \nMMLF , the pressure on prime funds receded and investor confidence improved so that  the \noutflows quickly slowed down  – and since the middle of April both types of funds have been  \ngenerally experiencing inflows.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n Figure  8 shows tha t assets under management of the government money market funds \nhave continued to rise, and are well above pre-pandemic levels.  Prime funds have stabilized and \nare gradually seeing mo dest inflow s, although they  remain well below pre-pandemic levels.  \nSince  the middle of April , there has been little activity at the MMLF .  This is by design : the \nfacility’s terms become less attractive as the crisis in a particular market fades and normal credit \nflows resume .  The facility has advanced more than $50 billion in  loans, which are already in the \nprocess of being paid off , with total loans outstanding now under $40 billion.  Currently , both \nshort -term credit markets and money market funds are operating with more normal pricing  and \ninterest -rate spreads.   This is important , as these markets underpin the financing flows on which \nmany businesses depend.  \n \nMain Street L ending  Program  \nThe other Federal Reserve program  being administered by the Boston Fed is  the Main \nStreet L ending Program .  The MSLP is  a loan program designed to help  credit flow to  small - and \nmedium -sized businesses  that were in good financial condition  prior to the crisis , but now need  \nloans that can help them until they have recovered from , or adapted to , the impact of the \npandemic.   \nIts structure is designed to reach those borrowers in a way that supports their operations \nand employment , supporting economic activity but also managing risk and safeguard ing the \ntaxpayer  backstop .  There are various loan sizes to meet a range of needs of small and midsize \nborrowers, and a ttractive terms ( for example, no payments or interest f or a year, a 4-year term, \nand a modera te interest rate ). \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n Let me begin by discussing some of the ways this pr ogram is unique, even among the \nFed’s other crisis actions , both now and in the past .  By the way, some of these unique aspects \naccount for the time it is taking to set up the program . While many of the Fed’s facilities focus \non securities that are relatively  homogenous financial instruments, this program seeks to support \nbank lendi ng.  Bank loans  are not  very standardized  – for example , the terms and conditions of \nthe loan are negotiated between borrower and lender.  Smaller  companies  likely  also have less \npublic information available for making a credit risk evaluation.  \n The program differs from other  program s for businesses  made possible by the CARES \nAct.  Unlike t he Paycheck  Protection Program  (PPP) , where many loans could  turn to grants \nfunded by the CARES Act,  the Main Street  Lending Program  involves  loans  that must be repaid .  \nThe MSLP  has no loan guarantee like the S mall Business Administration  provided for the PPP,  \nand requires both the borrower and lender to be eligible  to participate in the program.6 \nFigure 9 shows a stylized version of the Main Street program .  As previously mentioned, \nthe program is designed to serve businesses that were  doing well before the pandemic began, are \nexperiencing pandemic -related disruption, and are expect ing to do well once the pandemic is \ncontained .  The program is aimed at lending to mid -sized and small entities that are too big for \nthe PPP and too small for other emergency credit facilities.7  Enterprises of this sort accounted \nfor a major share of U.S employment, and this program intends to make loans that support their \nability to continue  until the  pandemic is contained and the  recovery ensues.  \nBusinesses will not come directly to the Federal Reserve for a loan .  Instead, p otential \nbusiness borrowers need to work with an eligible lender to determine if they meet the minimum \nrequirements for the program, as defined in the term sheet s as well as the lender’s own \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n underwriting standards.  An eligible lender will ultimately determine whether a borrower is \napproved for a loan, considering  credit risk .  Banks will underwrite the loan and the Federal \nReserve will participate with the bank in the lending  by purchasing 85 or 95 percent of the loan, \ndepending on the  program  facility .  Hence , the lenders continue to have “skin in the game ” to \nensure that  they will be motivated to certify  the quality of the loan.   \n Some of the high -level terms of the loan s are shown in Figure 10.  The new, priority, \nand expanded  facilities’  loans all share some common characteristics.  The maturity of the loans \nis four years, the loans have no interest or principal  payments due  in the first year, the loans can \nbe prepaid, and the loans have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3 percent.   \nHowever, there are differences among the facilities , including with respect to how the \nloan types interact with the borrower’s existing outstanding debt .  The new and priority lending \nfacilities , which  are likely to serve  somewhat smaller companies , provide new loans for which \nthe eligible lender  seeks the participation of the Federal Reserve.  Both facilities would be \navailable to the participating lender’s existing customers as well as new customers.  The loan \nsize range is $500,000 to $25 million.  The two facilities have different features to allow a \nbroader range of potential eligible borrowers.  In the new facility,  the MSNLF,  the lender retain s \na 5 percent stake , but the debt level of the borrower must remain low .8  In the priority  facility , \nthe MSPLF,  the borrowing business can carry somewhat more debt but the lender must take a \nlarger share of the loan – 15 percent  – and the loan must not be junior to9 other  debt (other than \nmortgage debt) .10   \nFor larger businesses, it is likely that they may already have a loan agreement with \nmultiple banks, with these loans being secured or unsecured.  The Main Street program ’s \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n expanded  loan facility (MSELF) provides an opportunity for eligible lenders to increase (or \n“upsize”) an existing term loan or revolving credit facility, with the Federal Reserve becom ing a \nnew participant.  This expanded loan facility for larger borrowers has a much higher  minimum \nloan size, $10 million, and a maximum loan size of $200 million .  The bank must maintain a 5 \npercent stake in the expanded loan, with the Federal Reserve taking  the remainder.   \n As shown in Figure 1 1, there are several  ways the Federal Reserve will manage thi s \nprogram to address inherent  risks.  First, the lenders  will need to underwrite the loan and retain \ntheir own stake in it, at 5 or 15 percent depending on the facility .  Second, the borrower’s credit \nneeded to be in good standing prior to the pandemic – loans to these borrowers  must have been \nrated “pass” at the end of 2019.11  Third, the borrower is limited in how levered the loan can be , \nas noted a moment ago .  One implication i s that firms that were already very highly levered \ngoing into the pandemic wi ll not qualify for a loan from the se facilit ies.  Fourth, and more \nbroadly, the U.S. Treasury Department will make a $75 billion equity investment in the facilities  \nto cover potential losses,  using funds appropriated under the CARES Act.  \n This is only a high-level discussion of the program.  Interested borrowers or lenders \nshould refer to the information we have posted on the web, for more program details.  Additional \ndetails about the program will be forthcoming as we approach launch, including webi nars \navailable to potential borrowers and  to lenders.   \nAlso, I would mention that while nonprofit organizations are not currently eligible under \nthe program , the Federal Reserve acknowledges the unique needs of nonprofit organizations, \nmany of which are on the  front lines providing critical services and research to fight the \npandemic.  The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department will be evaluating the feasibility \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 12  \n of adjusting the borrower eligibility criteria and loan eligibility metrics of the program for such \norganizations.   Such an evaluation will also likely take place with respect to asset -based \nborrowers.  \n The maximum amount of loan participation agreements the Fed will purchase  in the Main \nStreet  program  is $600 billion, with the U.S. Treasury providi ng $75 billion in equity to cover \npotential losses.  Since these are loans  with repayment expected (not forgivable  loans or grants) , \nwe are anticipating that th e Treasury backstop will  ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet \nall eligible loans.  T he Federal Reserve Bank  of Boston  is in the process of hiring  several \ncompanies to help  support this  large and complex  program .  Information on the se supporting \nfirms  – selected in a competitive process focused on both capacity to perform and price  – will be \nposted on the Boston Fed’s website  in the coming weeks .    \n This is an important program, and we’ve worked very hard to get it right.  We listened \ncarefully to initial feedback and expanded the program in a number of ways to serve a wider \nrange of borrowers.  It will not be able to assist everyone, but we expect that it will provide an \nimportant bridge for many businesses that employ much  of the American workforce.  We will \nalso have the ability to adjust the program , if needed.  \nAs Figure 12  shows,  businesses and  lenders interested in participating can find more \ninformation at www.bostonfed.org/mslp  -- including frequently asked questions, term sheets, a \nmailbox for submitting questions , and a way to subscribe to future email notifications that will \ngo out when updates are available .  I would also mention  the webinars that we pl an to host over \nthe coming weeks.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday , May 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 13  \n Concluding Observations  \n The economy has suffered a truly severe  shock from the COVID -19 publi c health crisis .  \nThe unemployment rate has risen very significantly in response to necessary shutdowns  \nintending  to limit the health impact of the pandem ic.  However, even when businesses are free to \nopen, many may face diminished demand  until customers once again feel secure leaving their \nhomes, which underlines that public health is at the root of this crisis and its solutions .   \nI expect that the unemployment rate will likely peak at close to 20 percent .  \nUnfortunately, even by the end of the year , I expect the unemployment rate to remain at double -\ndigit level s.  This outlook  is both sobering  and a call to action .  Now is the time for both \nmonetary and fiscal policy to  act boldly to minimize the economic pain from the pandemic.  \n The Federal Reserve has taken strong actions to mitigate the economic consequences of \nthis crisis .  Policymakers  have dropped interest r ates to near zero, bought Treasury and \nmortgage -backed securities , and initiated a range of  lending facilities.  I have provided some \ndetail on the Main Street  Lending Program , one of the more innovative and economically \nimportant program s which we expect  to open in the coming weeks .  As Fed policymakers, w e \nwill continue to vigilantly pursue  ways  to help the economy return  to full employment.  \n Thank you for having me  today .  I wish you continued health  during these challenging \ntimes . \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n2 P.M.

U.S. Eastern Time on Fri day, June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON \nDELIVERY  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n“An Update on the Economy and the  \nMain Street Lending Program ” \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nRemarks to the Greater Providence Chamber  of Commerce  \n \n \nProvidence, Rhode Island  \nJune 19, 2020  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good morning . Thank you for the opportunity to address the  Greater  Providence \nChamber .  I look forward to the time when these events can  once again  occur  in person.   \nFor all of us, the  effects of COVID -19 have been uniquely challenging.  C ities like \nBoston and N ew Y ork ended up with a high number of COVID -19 cases , given their population \ndensity along with their mix of transportation, touris m, international business travel, and \neducation . Rhode Island, too, is one of  several northeast  states that has faced  significant \nchallenges  from the virus .  Fortunately, many of the states  in our area  are following a data-\nfocused strategy for relaxing quaran tine arrangements .  This conservative approach to re opening \nis likely to pay dividends for the health of vulnerable populations and for the  medium - and \nlonger -term health of the economy.  \nToday I would like to speak with you about the pandemic, its effects on the economy, the \nimplications for Federal Reserve policymaking, and some of the steps that the Fed is taking to \naddress the cris is and mitigate its financial impact on American households and businesses .  This \nincludes the establishment of the Main Street Lending Program, which is being  administered by \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  for the Federal Reserve System .  I’ll say more about the \nprogram in a few moments, but let me note up front how pleased I am that the program opened for lender registrations on Monday.  Building the program and its operational background has \nbeen a complicated undertaking.  I am confident that this innovative program can help lenders \nacross the country support the credit needs of local businesses during these very challenging economic times, with the Fed standing ready to purchase 95 percent of eligible program loans  – \nloans with terms to bridge businesses to better days, like a 5- year term and no principal payments \nfor the first two years . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n The program is needed because of the unique economic and public health emergency we \nall face.  Restrictions on movement and commerce that were enacted  in late winter to combat the \nvirus came with great economic costs, but were necessary to avoid much worse health outcomes \ndue, in part, to an overwhelmed healthcare system . These restrictions also  allow ed the  time  \nneeded  to implement safety protocols throughout society.    \nWith states beginning to relax mandated restrictions —some earlier than others —we are \nseeing more individuals returning to work.  Indeed, the employment report for May was  more \npositive than expected.1  Any improvement in employment is wonderful news, given the \nimmense impact on individuals and households from job loss es and unemployment .   \nHowever, we currently face an unusually  complex employment situation, given the \nongoing public health concerns .  More  people returning to work is  good news in the longer  run \nonly if it can be done safely  and on a sustained basis .  If workplaces r eopen without the \nnecessary health precautions, t he recent increases in payroll  employment could be offset by \npossible business closures and serious health outcomes later .  The prospect of such an outcome \ncould also sap investor, consumer, and firm confidence.  If reopening can be done in ways that protect public health, then better outcomes now will also translate to better outcomes in the future. \nEven as many individuals are able to return to work , we must be mindful of the  deep pain \nstill occurring in many segments of the economy.  Jobs related to personal services  – such as \nrestaurants, hotels, retail stores,  and tourism  – have been disproportionately impacted by the \nhealth crisis.   These sectors  employ large numbers of workers, many of whom have little savings \nto cushion against a disruption in wages that lasts for many  months.  Frequently , these workers \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n are people of color , young workers, and workers  with less educational attainment, and not \nsurprisingly, the unemployment rate has risen the most for these groups.  In addition, m any of \nthese workers are employed in small businesses, which are heavily represented in these service \nindustries  and typically have very limited  financial cushions to carry them through a disruption.  \nSimply put, business models have been disrupted and some business owners have had their life’s \nwork endangered.  \nFortunately , policy makers have acted  quickl y.  The federal government has expanded its \nusual  programs to help individuals  during a downturn, such as mak ing unemployment benefits \nmore available and paying higher benefits , as well as providing direct payments to lower -income \nindividuals .   \nIn addition, t he Federal Reserve has  taken a number of unprecedented actions to prevent \nbouts of financial instability from having significant spillovers to the flow of credit to consumers and businesses.  Among these actions, the Fed has reduced  short -term interest rates to essentially \nzero in order to lower  household and firms’ borrowing  costs.  The Fed has also stabilized \nfinancial market s with purchases of both Treasury and mortgage -backed  securities , which lower s \ncosts for businesses to borrow and individuals to buy or refinance mortgages .  Lastly, the Fed  has \nalso initiated  a range  of emergency lending facilities  to provide liquidity directly to borrowers \nand investors in key credit markets .   \nIn my remarks today, I will discuss  the progress of our  Main Street Lending Program , \nwhich is designed to help credit flow to small and medium- sized businesses that were in sound \nfinancial condition before the onset of the COVID -19 crisis, but now need loans to help maintain \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n their operations and payroll until they have recovered from, or adapted to, the impacts of the \npandemic.2   \nDespite these important policy actions  to date , I believe more support is likely to be \nneeded from both monetary and fiscal policy .  Unemployment remains very high, and because of \nthe continued community spread of the disease, and the acceleration of new cases in many states, \nI expect the economic rebound in the second half of the year to be less than was hoped for at the \noutset of t he pandemic.  My own forecast is that the unemployment rate will remain in double \ndigits through the end of the year, which is somewhat higher than the median view of participants at the Federal Reserve policy -making body, the Federal Open Market Committee , or \nFOMC.  At the same time, the inflation rate is very likely to remain well below the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target.  With low  inflation and high  unemployment through this year and \nnext,  I believe additional  policy  stimulus is necessary . \n \nThe Economic Outl ook \nThe employment report for May was stronger than most forecasters expected . One \npossible reason is that states began opening up earlier than epidemiologists were recommending  \nand workers returned to their previous jobs or found new jobs fas ter than anticipated .\n3  Still, even \nwith the employment gains,  the unemployment rate remains  quite  elevated, as shown in Figure \n1.  At 13.3 percent, t he U.S. unemployment rate for May was up dramatically from February.   \nHowever , even this very high unemployment rate understates the disruption in labor \nmarkets.  The second set of bars show s the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ estimate of how \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n many respondents to the employment survey classified themselves as being  employed but not  at \nwork —individuals who should have been counted as unemployed on temporary layoff .  As you \ncan see from the estimates,  these respondents , if correctly classified , would have increased the \nunemployment rate by almost five percentage points in April and just over three percentage \npoints in May .  So yes, the unemployment rate did improve from April, but the picture is not as \nbright as the headline unemployment rate  measure suggest s.  In addition, the number of \nindividuals want ing a job now but not currentl y looking for work, the third set of bars, also rose \nonce the pandemic hit.  Taken together, these three set s of bars indicate a badly disrupted labor \nmarket.  \nFigure 2  shows that the unemployment rate rose for all age cohorts.  However, \nindividuals between the ages of 16 to 24 have  a particularly elevated unemployment rate.  This \nindicates the presence of significant challenges  for those individuals who are newly entering the \nlabor market and are frequently looking for entry -level positions.  This should be  particularly \nconcerning, given prior evidence that the earnings paths  of those individuals entering the labor \nmarket during a downturn are adversely affected for many years.  \nFigure 3  illustrates that Hispanic and African American  workers have been  \ndisproportionately impacted  by recent job losses , with Hispanic workers showing the largest \nincrease in unemployment .  In all , while prior to the pandemic  unemployment for people of color \nhad fallen to quite low levels by historical standards , these groups  have been disproportionately \nimpacted since the onset of COVID -19. \nFigure 4  shows that the pandemic caused increases in unemployment across all \neducational attainment categories.  However, the increase in unemployment is particularly \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n pronounced for those w ith low er levels of  educational attainment.  Many of the jobs that are \noften filled by people with lower educational attainment are service jobs  that have been \nparticularly impacted by the pandemic, such as positions at hotel s, restaurant s, and tourism -\nrelated firms . \nFigure 5  provides the median forecast for several economic variables submitted by \nparticipants at  the June  FOMC meeting.  The se median forecast s reflect the  significant economic \ntoll from the pandemic.  Real GDP is forecast to decline by 6.5 percent this year , core inflation is  \nexpected  to end the year at only 1 percent, and the unemployment rate is forecast to be  9.3 \npercent  by year end .  Unfortunately, I believe e ven this dire outlook may be too optimistic.  My \nown forecast is  somewhat more pessimistic, as I expect the unemployment rate to still be at \ndouble -digit levels at the end of the year , given what are likely to be persistent  economic  \nheadwinds from the pandemic over the second half  of the year .  And my own more pessimistic \nforecast does not fully incorporate the challenges of a second wave  of the virus  that is more \nsevere than the first  – an outcome that occurred with the 1918 Spanish Flu, the 1957- 1958 Asian \nFlu, and the 2009- 2010 H1N1 Flu.  \nAs Fi gure 6  highlights, the economic toll of the virus is closely tied  to how successful ly \nwe can get the public health pandemic under control.  So far, in t he United States efforts to \ncontain the virus have not been particularly successful, with more  cases per thousand than the \nother countries shown on the chart.  This  lack of containment could ultimately lead to  a need for \nmore prolonged shut -downs, which result in reduced consumption and investment, and higher \nunemployment  – as shown on the chart .  Countries with much more successful pandemic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n containment efforts , like Japan and South Korea, have also had much less disruption to their \nlabor markets.   \nAs a result, I believe that a more rapid and complete economic recovery requires better \nability to  contain  the pandemic.  O r medical solutions that make infections much less likely , such \nas with an introduction of a successful vaccine  – or much less severe, such as with the \ndevelopment of more effective treatments . \nFigure 7  shows differences  in social distancing across states , measured in terms of \nmobility from cell phone -based foot  traffic data to over 5 million points of interest.  The figure \nsuggests that social distancing behavior is strikingly different  across states .  In Massachusetts \nand Rhode Island, where the economy is now only slowly reopening, non- essential retail and \nrestaurant visits are down dramatically and do not look much different now than in the middle of \nMarch.  In contrast, a state like South Carolina, and to some degree Florida, have seen visits to \nnon-essential retail establishments and restaurants rise following their initial decline in March, \nand especially since the early reopening of these states’  econom ies.  Especially in South \nCarolina , visits to these locations are only a little  lower now relative to  their pre -shutdown level s.  \nRapidly available (h igher  frequency ) expenditure data show a pattern similar to the mobility \nnumbers  – with spending in many southern states that reopened earli er rebounding more than in \nstates in the Northeast and West.   \nWhether states with mobility patterns like Massachusetts and Rhode Island – or South \nCarolina and F lorida  – fare better going forward will depend importantly on how changes in \nsocial distancing  affect the progress of the pandemic; in fact, evidence is already emerging that \nnew cases in South Carolina and Florida are rising ( Figure 8 ).  If there are significant flare -ups \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n in states that have aggressively reopened, the reduction in social distancing that contributes to \nstronger  economic performance in such states now  may translate to more depressed economic \nactivity and increased public health issues in those states in the f uture. And given the U .S. \npopulation’s ability to travel, any region that does not socially distance effectively and suffers increased rates of infection will likely export their public health problems to other regions of the country that are tourist sites , transportation hubs, or educational centers.  \nIn sum, g iven the death toll of the virus even with the economic lockdown, I see a \nsubstantial risk in reopening too fast and relaxing social distancing too much.  And e ven if it \nturns out that the response t o the pandemic has been calibrated appropriately, the forecast from \nFOMC participants highlights the need for a dditional highly stimulative monetary policy, \nincluding the use of  Federal Reserve emergency lending facilities.  \n \nUpdate on t he Main Street L ending Program  \nI will now turn to a discussion of the Main Street Lending Program, expanding on some \nof my earlier comments .  Since the Federal Reserve first announced the program ,\n4 the Boston \nFed ha s been very focused on taking all the necessary steps to operationalize th is innovative \nemergency lending  initiative , which aims to  help  facilitate credit flows that can  bridge  small and \nmedium -sized businesses  until better economic times.  I’m very happy to  provide an update on \nthose efforts today , and would like to say a bit about the ways this program can make a \ndifference.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n First, some context.  In contrast to many of the Federal Reserve’s emergency facilities, \nwhich focus on buying relatively standardized market securities, the Main Street Lending \nProgram  focuses on bank  loans to business es.  Since every business , and every business loan, is \nsomewhat unique, the program is inherently complex.  I am very proud of the team that is \nwork ing tirelessly to stand up the program to serve the public interest at this terribly challenging \ntime in our economy.  \nIn particular, the program  addresses a problem that is evident in Figure 9 .  In each of the \npast three recessions, business lending decreased significantly.  While some of the se declines \nresult ed from  reduced demand for loans  from businesses , in two of the past three recessions  \nlending conditions clearly  tighten ed significantly , restricting credit supply .  In general, credit \nsupply is restricted  when uncertainty is high and some banks experience elevated loan losses.   \nThis dynamic is particularly relevant  if bankers fear worse ning economic conditions, or \ntheir bank’s own financial condition make s them more reluctant  to lend on the same  terms as \nprior to  the economic downturn.  In severe downturns, such as the 2008- 2009 f inancial c risis, \npoorly capitalized banks reduced their balance sheet s by becoming much more restrictive with \ntheir lending.  (Loans are assets for banks, so lending less  preserves  capital -to-assets ratios when \ncapital is under stress).   While banks are currently well capitalized, the economic outlook is  \nhighly  uncertain , with substantial downside risks, and bank balance sheets may become more \npressured over time.   Whi le some pre vious rec essions  have involved c redit crunches , the kind of \nshock we’ve seen since the pandemic  arrived is unprecedented in post -war history.  \nTo facilitate the flow of  credit for businesses, particularly those that are dependent on \nbank financing, the Federal Reserve created the Main Street Lending P rogram  to participate in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n lending with banks.  While I covered some of the details of this program in an earlier talk, recent \nchanges  to the program ma de it even more widely available for borrowers , allow ing more small \nand medium -sized businesses to be able to receive loans .5  The revised term sheet include d \nsignificant adjustments .  I would highlight that the minimum loan size was reduced to $250,000, \nmaking it more attractive to smaller businesses and community banks.  In addition, the terms \nwere made more attractive.  The maturity was extended to five years (from four ), and the \namortization schedule was eased .  No principal is due in the first two years , with interest deferred \nin the first year.  \nThe program is designed to assist lenders in meeting the credit needs of the businesses in \ntheir communities , even amidst the pandemic’s economic disruptions . The Fed will participate in \nthe lending by purchasing a 95 percent intere st in the loan , provided it meets the terms and \nconditions of the program .  By purchasing this percentage  of the loans, the Federal Reserve will \ntake on most of the risk that would otherw ise need to be absorbed solely by lenders, and will \ncreate additional balance sheet capacity for lenders to extend more loans  at this challenging time \nfor our country’s economy . \nInterested businesses will work with an eligible lender to determine if they meet the \nprogram requirements, which are available online, as well as the lender’s own underwriting standards.  The lender will determine whether a business is approved for a loan.\n6  \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve just announced it is seeking feedback on a proposal to \nexpand the program  to support nonprofit  entitie s.7  While the loan underwriting conditions have \nbeen tailored to nonprofits, other aspects of the loan, such as maturity and amortization are the same as for small and medium -sized businesses  (Figure 10 ).  The Federal Reserve and Treasury \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n are seeking comment on this term sheet before revising it and preparing to operationalize the \nprogram.  \nOn Monday of this week,  we opened the registration and verification process for financial \ninstitutions  that wish to participate as lenders in the Main Street P rogram.   These are still early \ndays in the program, and we are seeing a steady stream of interest  – with over 200 financial \ninstitutions , large and small , initiating registration  as of yesterday .  The institutions that have \nregistered so far are geographically dispersed , representative of all 12 Federal Reserve districts .  \nI am encouraged , too, by the interest of many smaller financial institutions like community \nbanks. \nMany more lenders have inquired about the program and attended our outreach sessions.  \nWe encourage lenders  who have not yet registered to explore the program , learn about the ways \nit can help them help their business borrowers, register to participate, an d in fact to begin to \nimmediately make the loans that qualify  using the program terms .  Lenders need not wait to \nmake qualified loans , which they will be able to  sell 95 percent of to the Fed when the program’s \ntransactional phase begins .8   \nI anticipate that  many more institutions will register for the program, given its benefits to \nthem, their customers, and the areas where they operate.  We continue to do widespread outreach \nand field significant numbers of inquiries.  Lenders have a vested interest in the resilience of the \nbusinesses in their market, and this program gives them a way to help bridge those businesses that were sound before the pandemic to better days. \nOf course there is a learning curve, but we are seeing tremendous interest in the loans \nfrom businesses .  Lenders  are determining how they’ll participate  in and communicate about the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 12  \n program.  Borrowers will need to persist during this ramp- up phase.  But I am very positive \nabout t he promise of the program in helping local businesses and lenders maintain vital business \ncredit during the se very challenging  economic  time s. \n \nConcluding Observations  \nI’d like to conclude with a few big -picture comments.  The global  pandemic has already \nmade existing societal divisions starker – and recent tragic events have left us all wresting with \nthe complex reality of societal inequities.  Here at the Boston Fed, we know that now , more than \never, it is important to continue our work to make socio- economic outcomes inclusive of every \nAmerican.   The recovery aft er the Great Recession, with low levels of unemployment enjoyed \nacross disparate demographic groups before the COVID -19 outbreak, illustrates that the Federal \nReserve’s fulfillment of the full employment mandate can help to support an inclusive economy .  \nThe U .S. economy is currently suffering from high unemployment and low inflation, \nfully justifying additional monetary and fiscal policy  action s to return the economy as quickly as \npossible to where we were prior to the COVI D-19 pandemic.  While these policies can help \nmitigate the economic impact of the crisis , much of the path of the economy will be determined \nby the virus and how successful ly it can be contain ed, either through public health or medical \ninnovations. \nAs well as m ore traditional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve is operating \nseveral significant emergency credit facilities .  The Main Street Lending Program has recently \nexpanded in scope  to become  more attractive for borrowers and lenders .  Our hope is that this \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:15 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday , June 19 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 13  \n program will , over time , provide an important source of liquidity for small and medium- sized \nbusinesses that might otherwise not receive credit on the same terms.  In addition, it provides an \nimportant backstop should the pandemic be more severe  than anticipated  this fall.  \nThank you, and I wish you all continued health during these challenging times .  \n \n \n \n \n1 See May 8, 2020 Employment Situation Summary  by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  \n \n2 For more discussion of the Main Street Lending Program, see my remarks delivered to the New England Council \non May 19, 2020:  https://www.bostonfed.org/news -and-events/speeches/2020/main- street -lending -program -and-\nother -federal -reserve- actions.aspx .  \n \n3 Forecasters likely knew states were reopening sooner than anticipated when writing down their employment \noutlooks so i t is more workers finding jobs faster than they were anticipating given the reopening or the broader \ndisconnect between the claims data and household survey data.  \n \n4 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm  \n \n5 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200608a.htm   \n \n6 The Main Street program aims to assist businesses that employ a major share of the American workforce.

        "content": "1 \n Eric S. Rosengren , President  and CEO , Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  \nPrepared Testimony for the Congressional Oversight Commission  \nAugust 7, 2020  \n \nMembers of the Commission – Representative Hill, Mr. Ramamurti, Representative \nShalala, and Senator Toomey  – thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about  the \noperationalization of the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, a facility authorized \nby the Board of Govern ors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board of Governors”) under section \n13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the Secretary  of the Treasury .  As you know, \nthe Department of the Treasury  (“Treasury”)  has committed to make  an equity investment of  $75 \nbillion in the Program  – and th e funds available for invest ment  by the Treasury were \nappropriated to the Exchange Stabilization Fund under section 4027 of the Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security Act ( the “CARES Act ”). \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which I lead, administers the operations of the \nMain Street Lending Program  (“Main Street” or “Program”)  for the Federal Reserve System.   As \nsuch, I am very pleased to be here today to provide information that I hope will be useful to you \nin you r important oversight work . \n \nBackground to the Program  \nIn addition to  the tragic loss of life, all of us know that the COVID -19 pandemic poses a \nshock to the U .S. economy  that is unprecedented in our lifetimes .  With real GDP in the second \nquarter falling by more than 30 percent, it is clear that businesses , nonprofits, and individuals  \nacross the country  are being challenged  by the fallout from  the virus .  We have seen a \n\n \n2 \n disproportionate impact  on entities  whose operating model s require significant social interaction , \nstemming from consumers’ concern with their own health and safety  as well as  more  formal \nrestrictions on movement and commerce.  For example,  hotels, airlines , retail  stores , \nentertainment  venues , restaurants, and tourism -related enterprises  have al l suffered significant \ndisruptions to their business es and cash flow, with more  difficultie s possible if the public health \nconcern s persist.   Nonprofit entities like medical service providers and educational institutions \nalso are challenged.  \nBoth fiscal and monetary policy makers  have acted swiftly  to address the economic \nimpacts of the pandemic and cushion  the blow.  The Federal Reserve , for example, has taken a \nnumber of aggressive policy actions since late winter , aimed at blunting the economic effects of \nthe crisis.  Seeing  unusual volatility and troubled financial markets, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee  reduced short -term interest rates to near zero and purchased significant amounts of \nsecurities , and the Board of Governors established a variety of emergency facilities under section \n13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act  in order to restore market functioning and facilitate lending .   \nThese actions helped to restore financial stability and significantly reduced spreads on \nshort - and long -term corporate and municipal securities  – spreads  which had increased due to \nuncertainty , and challenged the flows of credit that underpin our economy .  And the facilities \nhelped to unlock a great deal of private credit , as well . \nMany of the emergency lending facilities are similar to facilities rolled out during the \n2008 -2009 financial crisis.  However, many of the businesses  most impacted by the pandemic \nare smaller firms that rely on banks for loans , rather than access ing public credit markets  (i.e., \nissuing bonds) .  The Main Street Lending Program is designed to facilitate lending to small and \nmedium -sized businesses that have suffered disruptions from th e pandemic, and were in sound \n\n \n3 \n condition prior to the pandemic.  The program, like all emergency lending facilities, was \nauthorized by the Board and Treasury, and in this case is being implemented and administered by \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.   \nThe terms of the Main Street Program were enhanced  and expanded by the Board and \nTreasury prior to the Program’s opening , and more recently a term sheet has been released that \nmakes the Program available to non -profit organizations  as well as for -profit businesses .  I would \nnote that in addition to providing loans for borrowers in current need of funds, the Program  \noffers a credit backstop for firms that do not currently need financing, but may if the pandemic \ncontinues to erode the  financial condition of these firms over late summer and fall . \n Importantly, the Main Street Lending Program differs from other programs for businesses \nmade possible by the CARES Act, reflecting the parameters of what the Federal Reserve is \nauthorized by Congress to do.  Unlike the Paycheck Protection Program, where many loans \ncould turn into grants  funded by the CARES Act, the Main Street program involves loans that \nmust be repaid.  The Program has no loan guarantee like the Small Business Administration \nprovided for the Paycheck Protection Program, and requires both the borrower a nd lender to be \neligible to participate in the Program.  \nWe engaged in a g reat deal of  consultation with  potential  borrowers and lenders as we set \nup th e Program.   In addition to soliciting public comment, s taff at the Board of Governors, \nTreasury, and the Federal Reserve Bank  of Boston  conducted outreach to potential borrowers \nand lenders of all sizes – ranging from community banks to the largest lenders in the country – in \nan effort to gather information to inform  policy judgments and  operational decisions related to \nthe Program.   In addition to the variety of outreach calls, we have h osted  a series of 14 (so far) \nwebinars  that have been tailored  to borrowers and lenders , and in which presenters review  the \n\n \n4 \n terms, conditions , and operat ional details of the Program.  All of the sessions have been well \nattended with many having more than 1,500 participants .   \nTo ensure the Program is widely known, in conducting these webinars and otherwise \nsharing information we have made an intentional effort to reach nonprofits, minority and \nwomen -owned businesses, minority depository institutions , and tribal businesses .  In addition, \nrobust Frequently Asked Questions  document s provide detail on many  aspects of the for-profit \nand non -profit program  facilities , and are updated with some frequency .   \n \nParameters of the Program  \nThe Main Street Lending Program was designed to provide credit support for business or \nnonprofit borrower s that ha ve temporary cash-flow problem s due to the pandemic  – and given \nthe uncertain outlook might otherwise have difficulty in obtaining credit  from  a lender that \nwould have to hold 100 percent of the loan .  Main Street can provide a loan to bridge the \nborrower  over this current challenge .  Main Street  loans have no interest or princip al payments in \nthe first year, and indeed no princip al payments until year three , making the cash -flow aspects of \nthe loan attractive to borrowers experiencing a pandemic -related, temporary disruption of their \nbusiness  model . \n The Program includes three lending component s for for-profit businesses .  They have  \nsimilar interest rates, maturit ies, and terms, but have somewhat different collateral  arrangements , \nloan-size limitations, and underwriting.  For mid -sized businesses with existing term or revolving \nlines of credit, the Main Street Expanded  Loan Facility (MSELF) allows businesses to upsize \ntheir current loans , with additional lending of  $10 million  to $300 mi llion.  For smaller \nbusinesses , the Main Street Priority  Loan Facility (MSPLF) allows businesses to borrow from \n\n \n5 \n $250,000 to $50 million.  Under each  of these facilities the Main Street loans must be senior or \npari passu  (of equivalent status ) with the borrower ’s other loans and debt instruments  (excluding \nmortgage debt) .   \nFor smaller business loans without collateral , there is the Main Street New Loan Facility \n(MSNLF) that provides loans from $250,000 to $35 million dollars, which  cannot be \ncontractually subordinated to other debt.  Because these loans do not have security or collateral \nrequirements,  they are only available for firms whose debt including the Main Street loan do es \nnot exceed four times  the borrower’s  EBITDA  – a more restrictive underwriting criterion than \nthe other two loan types, which  set maximum loan size based on six times the borrower’s \nEBITDA .   \n The two nonprofit  lending  components of Main Street are announced but not yet live .  \nThey will have broadly similar terms as the for -profit Main Street facilities , for example in  \nmaturity  and interest rate.  The Nonprofit Organization Expanded  Loan F acility (NOELF) and \nthe Non profit Organization New Loan Facility (NONLF) have similar priority a nd size \nrequirements to the ir for -profit counterparts .  They differ in that the underwriting is tailored to \nthe special characteristics of nonprofits.   \n \nLending, and Lenders  \n We have take n great  care to operationalize the Main Street program to ensure i t functions \nsmoothly and securely.  Of course, s etting up a program to serve many different borrowers and \nlenders  is inherently  complex , but I believe the Commission in its oversight role can feel \nconfident that th is challenge is being met in strong fashion, in the public interest .   \n\n \n6 \n Unlike the corporate credit and muni facilities, which purchase largely  standardized \ncredit instruments, Main Street purchases interests in loans that are , by nature,  bespoke \nagreements between borrowers and lenders.  Loan agreements and loan terms can be quite \ndifferent across banks, and even within a bank the agreements are the result of negotiation \nbetween borrower and lender that often result in complex, bor rower -specific terms and \nconditions .  For example, banks differ on whether  they require personal guarantees  or collateral \nin excess of Program requirements ; and those policies may vary based on the financial condition \nor business model of the  borrower.   \nConstructing a Program that handles this complexity is something we have been intensely \nengaged with these last few months at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  We are pleased to \nhave the opportunity to do this important work , in the spirit of public service that runs through \nour work and our staff . \n Shifting to how the program works, t o become an eligible lender for the Program the \nfinancial institution must  first register  via our Main Street lender portal.  As part of the \nenrollment  process,  the institution must verify that it meets our eligibility requirements , and \nmake attestations regarding CARES Act provisions which require the signature of the principal \nexecutive officer and principal financial officer.   Furthermore, the institution  must  set up and \nverify arrangements to transfer funds effectively and safely , to ensure security and resilience.    \nSince our portal opened for lender registration on June 15 , 509 financial institutions have \nregistered with the Program, and their assets represent  $14.25 trillion , which is approximately 58 \npercent of total bank ing assets  in the U nited States .  The attached  Figure  1 shows the size \ndistribution of registered MSLP lenders.  It includes the largest universal banks and region al \n\n \n7 \n banks, and a sizable number of banks in the $1-10 billion  asset range as well as in the under $1 \nbillion asset categor y.  Participation is of course strictly voluntary for financial institutions.  \n During the extensive outreach that we did prior to launching Main Street , we heard \nconcerns from some businesses that their current lender would not be participating in the \nProgram or that they might find it difficult to locate a participating financial institution that \nwould work with new customers.  In aiming to address these concerns, we ask lenders during the \nregistration process if they plan to accept loan applications from new customers.   We contact \neach lender that sa ys they would consider  loan applications from new customers, and ask \nwhether they w ill join a public list of such lenders .  Figure 2  shows the interactive map  we \ncreated  that allows borrowers to identify  which lenders in their state are registered with Main \nStreet,  are prepared to consider new customers , and are willing to be listed as such .  The \ninteractive map is available on the program website, www.bostonfed.org/mslp , and w e update \nthe list daily as new lenders register.   Currently it contains 153 lenders.   Figure 2 shows, for an \nexample, the financial institutions on the map for my home state of Massachusetts.  \nIt is important to note that Main Street relies on lenders to underwrit e the  loans, and \nindeed the lenders  have  “skin in the game” by retaining 5 percent of the loan participation.  \nBorrowers need to meet the underwriting standards of the financial institution , and the terms and \nconditions of the Main Street Lending Program, whether they have an existing relationsh ip with \nthe lender or are a new customer.  \n Borrowers also must meet the  eligibility criteria set out in the Program  term sheet, and \nmust be able to make the certifications and commitments required by the Program, including \nthose  required under the CARES Ac t.  Also, w hile the loan interest rate of 300 basis points over \nLIBOR is likely attractive to somewhat higher -risk borrowers, those businesses that have strong \n\n \n8 \n balance sheets and have not been significantly impacted by the pandemic may very well find \ntheir lender can give them more attractive terms than the Main Street Program.  Because the \nloans are not forgivable by the Federal Reserve and lenders retain a 5 percent interest in the loan, \nborrowers must have the ability to pay back the loan.  For borrowers  with severe problems, \nadditional debt may not be helpful, and neither the lender nor the borrower will find taking \nadditional debt attractive.  But for many others, the program can serve as a vital bridge to address \ncash flow interruption ushered in by th e pandemic.  \n \nEarly Results  \nFigure  3 shows the flow of potential loan participation purchases  through the Program’s \nportal  as of the end of the day on Tuesday (August 4) .  As you see on the summary bottom line, \ncurrently over $530 million  in loans  are active  in the portal , representing 54 loans.  Of that total, \n18 loans with a combined value of $109 million have commitments for purchase or have been \nsettled .  In addition, over $421 million in loans  are in various stage s of review in the portal.   As a \nreminder, the program opened for loan purchases on July 6 .  The numbers I share with you today \nare consistent with what I would characterize as a  gradual pace of initial activity, which is more \nrecently expanding . \nThe 54 loans submitted in the portal currently represent 29 distinct lenders.  Almost all \nthe loans currently in the portal have been initiated by financial institutions with under $50 \nbillion  in assets . Additionally, there are 36 lenders with draft  entries in progress in the system.  I \nmenti on these draft entries because they reinforce that additional lenders are active in the portal \nand getting familiar with Program operations.   \n\n \n9 \n  Figure  4 breaks out the total of potential loans in the portal by the particular branch or \nfacility of the Program.   The largest number of loans – 29 – are in the New Loan Facility.   \nThe Priority Loan Facility currently has 24 loans valued at $328 million in the portal.  And \ncurrently there is only one loan utilizing t he Expanded Loan Facility in the portal.  Th e \nExpanded loan facility will generally encompass  larger loans and require current participating \nbanks to alter existing loan agreements to upsize existing credit facilities.   \nFigure 5  provides the size distribution of potential loans currently in the portal .  While \nthe largest number of loans are in the size cohort between $1 million and $2.5 million dollars, \nthere are loans under $1 million and greater than $30 million.  The industries represen ted include \nconstruction and design firms, dental offices, retailers, and entertainment -related firms like \nmovie theaters.  Thus , the loans we have seen to date have reflected what one might broadly \nexpect of small and mid -sized firms whose businesses have  been disrupted by the current efforts \nat social distanc ing. \nFigure 6 shows the potential loan distribution by the asset size of the lender  registered in \nthe Program .  The largest number of loans are by financial institutions in the $10-50 billion size \nrange.  However, there has been participation by relatively small community banks  as well .  To \ndate, there has been only limited activity by banks with more than $50 billion in assets.  \n As I alluded to a moment ago, t he Program ’s relatively modest initial numbers  seem to be \ngiving way to more uptake  as participants become familiar with the program’s parameters .  I \nbelieve the gradual uptake is a function of participants adjusting to a few unavoidable factors.  \nFirst and foremost, loans are bespoke,  and the Program needs  to accommodate lending across a \nwide  range of industries, jurisdictions, and business profiles , which makes for operational \nchallenges.  Also, the Program’s complexity reflects  the underlying loan agreements, the terms \n\n \n10 \n and conditions in the Program , and requirements related to  the CARES Act.  As a result, it can \ntake some time for borrowers and lenders to gather the required documents  for submission to the \nProgram .  Loan d ocument s not in compli ance with terms and conditions have slowed some of the \nintake .  We are working to help participants understand and avoid common errors that can slow \nthe process down.  \n \nSummary Observations  \n Designing and operationalizing a program of this breadth and nuance, delivered through \nhighly secure technology, is a significant achievement in a few months’ time .  Everyone \ninvolved is focused on helping to provide important credit support to businesses and nonprofits \nat this critical and challenging time.  \nAs we speak today , in early August, I can say that  we have worked through many \nchallenges.  A mong the emergency lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve since \nlate winter  – and indeed in co mparison to the emergency programs of the 2008 financial crisis – \nthe Main Street Lending Program  is operationally complex .  Quickly scaling up a program that \npurchases participations in bespoke loans – from a very diverse group of borrowers in a \ndecentral ized market that lacks standardization – is inherently difficult.  There are also tradeoffs \nbetween limiting credit risk, targeting support, reaching scale, and achieving operational \nefficiency.  Considerations such as these have made the M ain Street Lending Program  one o f the \nmost challenging emergency lending programs the Federal Reserve has ever put in place.  The \nCommission can be assured that t he Federal Reserve  and Treasury have sought to design a \nprogram that is  well managed with respect t o risks, efficiency, and resilience, while being \nresponsive to the needs of borrowers experiencing difficult times.   \n\n \n11 \n The eventual size of the Program will be determined by the path of the pandemic and the \neconomy, generally.  Should the pandemic and the e conomy worsen, or financial institutions  \nexperience larger than expected loan losses and depletion of capital – all things we hope do not \nhappen – then I would expect interest in using this Program to expand more rapidly . \nIn conclusion, the pandemic’s shock to our economy is unprecedented, and the pain for \nbusinesses, organizations, and workers has been unparalleled in our lifetimes.  It is important that \nthe Federal Reserve stands ready  at this time of distress , in the public interest and  in pursuit of \nour Congressional mandates, to support lending to for-profit businesses and nonprofit \norganizations  of many sizes  at reasonable  rates.  From many decades of research and \npolicymaking, I can attest that c redit interruptions  prolong recessions and ultimately harm \nindividuals on Main Streets across America.  I pledge to you that in administering th e Program, \nthe Boston Fed and the Federal Reserve as a whole will do all that is in our power and purview  to \neffectively support th e firms, nonprofits, and individuals that make up our nation’s economy.    \nThank you for the opportunity to provide  this high-level  overview of the Program .  I \nwould now be happy to address any questions.",

While it is unfortunate that we cannot be together for this event, I am grateful that \ntechnology allows us to gather virtually .  \n \nPublic Health and Econom ic Effects  \nThis continues to be a challenging time, with the high rate of positive COVID -19 cases  \nand resulting deaths  across the country highli ghting the unfolding human tragedy of the \npandemic.  In addition to a tragic loss of life, the pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented \nshock to the U.S. economy.  \nThe i nability , thus far,  to control the virus in the United States is resulting in renewed \nrestrictions on individuals and businesses in many parts of the count ry.  While vital  and \nnecessary  for the good of the economy in the longer run , the ongoing  social distancing in \nresponse to the virus’s spread will continue to comp licate policy makers’ task of supporting  the \neconomy in the short run with fiscal and monetary policy.  As the Federal Reserve’s July F ederal \nOpen Market Committee  statement highlighted, “The path of the economy will depend \nsignificantly on the course of the virus.” 1   \nEven as official  restrictions relax , many people may prefer to continue avoid ing activities \nthat require social interaction in order to protect their own health . With s uch a pattern of  \nbehavior  taking hold, momentum in the economy toward  return ing quickly to full employment  \nwould likely fade.  Being c autious during a pandemic is  absolutely the right thing to do, and all \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n of this highlights that we must get the virus under control  in order for a  sustainable  economic \nrecovery to take hold . \nThe New England region  currently has COVID -19 infection rates below those prevailing \nin many parts of  the country, including  the South and the West.  Recent ly, however, New \nEngland  infection numbers  have been gradually increasing.  Certainly , common sense \nprecautions – such as wearing masks  when around other people , maintaining safe social distance , \nand avoiding crowded indoor settings  – are much less costly than having to shut down whole \nsectors of the economy again.   It is, therefore,  important that everyone continue to take steps to \nprotect public health in order to avoid more tragic outcomes along with further economic pain.  \nThis is especially true at a time when  some colleges and universities are resuming in-person \nclasses, and some K -12 school districts  are planning to bring students back together this fall  – \nwhen there will be less ability to congregate outdoors .     \nToday I would like to begin my remarks by reviewing the current state of the U.S. \neconomy , and I will then discuss some of the steps that the Fed is taking to address the crisis and \nmitigate its  impacts on both  financial  markets  and the real economic activity of  American \nhouseholds and businesses .   \nIn this crisis , which finds little precedent  in our lifetimes,  both monetary and fiscal \npolicy makers  have moved aggressively to offset some of the economic impact of the  pandemic .  \nPolicy actions this year have been l arge and timely, reflecting the urgency of the risks that the \ncontinuing public health crisis  poses.   Specifically, t he federal government has expanded its \nusual programs to help individuals during a downturn, such as making unemployment benefits \nmore wide ly available and increasing the payouts , as well as providing direct payments to lower -\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n income individuals.  Keeping this segment of the economy afloat , by providing a financial bridge \nuntil economic conditions normalize,  will play an important role in  the recovery.2   \n  In addition, o ne of the segment s of the economy heavily  impacted by the pandemic  has \nbeen small  and medium -sized businesses , which together empl oy a very sizable share of the \nworkforce.   Many small and medium -sized businesses had  to close  down operations  when  \nquarantine restriction s were put in place in the  spring  and simply  cannot fully recover until the \npandemic has abated.    \nAs one measure t o address this concern, i n early July t he Federal Reserve Bank of \nBoston , on behalf of the Federal Reserve System,  opened the Main Street Lending Program,  or \nMSLP, which aims to help facilitate credit flows that can  provide a  bridge  for small and \nmedium -sized businesses until better economic times  arrive .  Because activity in the facility will \ndepend , to a significant degree,  on the path of the economy and the virus, I expect utilization to \nincrease as we get into the fall.  I will say more about this later in my remarks.  \nDespite the sizeable interventions by monetary and fiscal policymakers , high -frequency \neconomic data indicate that the recovery may be losing steam , as activities in many states are \nonce again restricted  (officially or voluntarily) to slow the virus’s spread .  Particularly in some \nparts of the South and the West, where some hospitals are reaching their ICU capacity, changes \nin behavior a re showing up in high frequency data on individuals’ mobility and spending.  \nClearly , continued stimulative monetary and fiscal policy are critical, a nd most importantly \nslowing down the COVID -19 infection rate.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n The Outlook for the Economy  \nA notable  feature of this recession is how aggressively policy makers  have responded.  \nFigure 1 shows the path of real disposable personal income since January 2000.  Generally, the \ndata fall on a relatively consistent line, and you see  relatively small changes around  the periods \nof recession shading.  However , in this recession, there has been  a substantial increase in real \ndisposable income .  This reflects the extraordinary amount of fiscal action  taken  to offset the \nimpact of the virus .  Fiscal policy has provided many individuals  with substantial financial \nsupport , as befits an unprecedented crisis . \nThe extraordinary fiscal relief provided to households, however, has translated only \nmodestly into spending .  Figure 2  shows a striking rise in the personal saving rate  – a far bigger \njump than we have seen at any time  since World War II .  Several factors account for this  surge in \nsaving .  First, with  both required and voluntary social distancing, and less willingness or ability \nof many people to pursue  certain  activities  – such as  travel ling, attend ing entertainment  events  \nwith crowds, or eat ing indoors at restaurants  – spending will likely be lower relative to the past , \nuntil activities involving social interaction entail  substantially less  public health risks.  Second, \nsaving may have risen for some because of the concern  about  the prospects for worse economic \ncircumstances and less fiscal support going forward.   In all, the increase in saving is a reminder \nof the importance of containing the pandemic in order to achieve a more robust recovery.  \nAlong with fiscal polic y, monetary policy reacted quickly and decisively.  Short -term \ninterest rates were quickly dropped to close to zero in March and , as Figure 3 shows,  the 10 -year \nTreasury yield is well below the level reached  during the financial crisis  of 2008 -9 and Great \nRecession .  In addition , the Fed has deployed a variety of emergency credit facilities designed to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n maintain  the availability  of credit to firms and individuals.   Based on  many decades of research \nand policym aking, I can attest that credit interruptions prolong recessions and ultimately harm \nindividuals  and firms  on “main streets ” across America.3  So these credit facilities implemented \nby the central bank are very important, and welcome.  \nWith such substantial  deployment of fiscal and monetary policies , one might expect a \nrobust recovery.  Unfortunately, as long as the virus poses significant threat s to public health, a \nfull economic recovery will be  very difficult  as individuals , often voluntarily, avoid activities \nthat place their health at risk .  The increased saving rate , reflecting a falloff in consumption  \ndespite substantial fiscal transfers to individuals , illustrate s the challenges the recovery faces .  \nIndeed, the trajectory of  the economic recovery will be determined more by the path of the virus \nthan by the path of policy making , although monetary and fiscal policy can mitigate , and have \nmitigated,  some of the most significant adverse  impact s to the economy.  \n \nRecent Data, and the Pandemic ’s Effect on  the Economy  \nFigure 4  illustrates  one of the challenges in achieving a full , and timely,  economic \nrecovery  by comparing new COVID -19 cases per million in the European Union with those  in \nthe United States .  While both the EU, which I’ll refer to here as Europe , and the United States \nhad significant increases in infection rates during the spring, Europe enacted more stringent  \neconomic  shutdowns and limits on individuals’ mobility that were  maintained over a  longer  \nperiod .  As a result, the ir infection rates fell  faster and  further , and have remained  relatively low.  \nIn contrast, in the United States, infection rates remain elevated , as states lifted protective \nmeasures  too soon and in a manner  not calibrated for the true risks posed by the virus.  For the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n country as a whole, the infection  rate is much higher than in the spring , and stands in sharp \ncontrast to the level of infections in Europe.  \nFigure 5  compares new COVID -19 death rates  in the U nited States  and the E uropean \nUnion.    The chart  shows that deaths per million in population have been rising and are \nconsiderably  higher  in the U.S.  than in Europe.  The U.S. death rate from the virus remains \nbelow its peak in the spring  – in part, many suspect, because younge r patients have accounted for \nmore of the infections, and also because  hospital treatments have improved.  Nonetheless, the \nrising death rate could become more severe if infections that start with younger people spread to  \nmore vulnerable  individuals  over time.  \nFigure 6  shows  cumulative death s per million people from the virus in Europe and the \nUnited States.  While Europe had more cumulative deaths  than the U.S. through  March and \nApril , cumulative deaths in the  United States have  now far surpassed those in Europe.  The \nreason , I would argue,  is highlighted  in Figure 7 , which shows  the change in visits to retail and \nrecreation al locations  in the U .S. and select  countries in Europe .  The pattern of the visits \nillustrates how Europe shut down more forcefully , maintained  restrictions  longer, and did not re-\nopen until the virus had reached low levels.  As a result  of this more successful virus \ncontainment policy , visits by Europeans to retail  and recreation locations have now experienced  \na more robust recovery compared with American visits to such locations and are close to their \npre-pandemic levels .  \nAdditional e vidence of the costs of early re-opening  of the U.S. economy  – in economic \nand public health terms – can be  seen in data on infections, mobility and consumer spending \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n across states , as highlighted in my next four charts .  They demonstrate various facets of the \ninteractions between the virus and the economy.  \nFigure 8 plots the states based on two factors – first, the level of mobility  within each \nstate (as measured by cellphones coming in close proximity to one another)  at the end of May  \nand beginning of June , relative to February ( pre-pandemic ); and second by the chan ge in the \ntypes of spending that are sensitive to social  distancing , in May versus April .  Spending  that is \nsensitive to social distancing  involves  sectors  such as travel, hotels, restaurants , and certain \npersonal care services like beauty salons and barber shops .  What we see is evidence of the initial  \neconomic benefit in states that became less restrictive  earlier .  The regression line shows the \ncorrelation – spending in May was stronger , relative to pre -pandemic levels , in those states that \nhad more mobility  (contacts)  and less restrictions on economic activity .   \nBut, unfortunately , that benefit was short -lived.  \nFigure 9  compares the same mobility measure for each state to the percentage change in \ninfections in July.  The regression  line highlights  the overall relationship – more mobility in a \nstate through June is generally correlated with  larger recent increases in infection rates  in July .  \nIn particular, states in the Northeas t typically  experienced much less mobility through June, but \nalso much lower growth in infections in July than many states in the South and West.   \nThe lower recent growth in infections in some states is in turn associated with greater \nrecent  mobility.  Figure 10  compares  the percent change in COVID -19 infections in July with \nthe change in mobility  (contacts)  in the same period .  The Northeastern states now have smaller \nincreases in infections  and higher mobility, as low er infecti on rate s support more mobility .  In \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n contrast , Southern  and Western states now have more infections and less mobility , as people \nreduce contacts  both voluntarily and because of increased restrictions on economic activity .   \nFinally,  Figure 11  shows that the monthly growth rate in July spending was ultimately  \nmuch better in the previously more restrictive and slower to reopen states in the Northeast \nrelative to many Southern and Wes tern states.   Specifically, the figure plots the c hange in \nCOVID -19 cases in July versus the change  in social -distancing -sensitive spending in July.   \nTaken together, these data show that s tates that re-opened early and quickly lifted \nrestrictions saw a short -term increase in activity, but it was at a cost – rising rates of infections , \nwhich resulted in less spending more recently.  In short, lifting restrictions too early and too \nquickly hurt both the economy and public health  down the road .  In the Northeast, where \nrestrictions were more substantial  and lasted longer , states are now experiencing both better \npublic health outcomes and more spending in sectors of the economy that are  sensitive to social \ndistancing.  These results are somewhat parallel  to the differences in outcomes  between Europe \nand the U .S.  \nDespite s ome states achieving a recent reprieve from COVID -19 infections , it is of course \nimportant to remain vigilant, given the ease of spread  of the virus due to the ease of travel across \nstate borders .  Recent slight upticks in states like Massachusetts and cou ntries like Germany – \nwhich have taken the pandemic seriously – bear watching.   Going forward, s tates should be \ncarefully calibrating their actions to data , especially  as we reach the fall with schools opening \nand more activities  moving  inside  as the seasons change .  Failure to take quick actions to \nsuppress the virus could result in more severe economic outcome s as well as the unnecessary \nloss of life.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n An Update on t he Main Street Lending Program  \nAs I noted earlier, the path of the economy depends heavily on the path of the virus.   No \neconomic policy action can fully offset the public health crisis , but it can help limit its  impact on \nthe economy.   \nAn important economic policy action designed to mitigat e current and potential economic \neffects of the pandemic is the  Main Street Lending Program , which seeks to facilitate  the \ncontinue d flow of credit to small and medium -sized businesses that were in sou nd financial \ncondition prior to the pandemic, but have been adversely impacted  by it.  The program is \nattractive ly structured for many businesses facing cash -flow interruptions due to the pandemic  by \nfacilitat ing 5-year loans with no payment of interest in the first year and no payment of principal  \nuntil the third year.  It is attractive for lenders because they can meet the credit needs of credit -\nworthy companies and nonprofit organizations in their markets while retaining only 5 percent of \nthe loan on their books , with the Federal Reserve taking a 95 percent participation interest in the \nloan.   \nWith the program , the Fed is aiming to help creditworthy businesses and nonprofits that \nhave suffered temporary cash -flow problems due to the pandemic,  and, given the uncertain \noutlook, might otherwise have difficulty in obtaining credit from a lender that would have to \nhold 100 percent of the loan.   The Main Street program  can provide essential financing to help \nthese entities  avoid  shutting their doors and permanently laying off their  employees.  \nFigure 1 2 shows that there are currently 522 lenders registered in the program.  Banks of \nall sizes have enrolled , with the greatest  number of banks in the $1-10 billion range, although \nsmall er community banks and large r universal banks have also signed up .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n One concern raised by  potential  borrowers  about the program  was that their bank might \nnot be participating in the program and , if that were the case , how could they find a bank willing \nto take  on a new customer and work with them on  a Main Street loan.  In response, we have \nmade available a n interactive  map on our  website, www.bostonfed.org/mslp , which provides a \nlist of all participating banks in each state that are currently accepting loan applications from new \ncustomers  and that have agreed to be announced to the public .  There are currently 160 banks on \nthis list; Figure 1 3 provides a view of the banks in Massachusetts tha t are part of this subset of \nregistered  lenders .   \nBy the way, while participation on any level in the MSLP is voluntary – registering, \nworking with existing customers, or taking on new customers – I strongly encourage additional \nbanks to consider  joining those  already registered and th ose on our  list accepting new customers.  \nWe have seen tremendous interest from potential borrowers experiencing a  pandemic -related, \ntemporary disruption of  their businesses.  Financial institutions have a vested interest in the \ncontinued viability of local business es and organizations, and the vibrancy of their local \neconomy.  The Fed is eager to work with lenders and help them as they provide credit to  their \nborrowers.  Given the unprecedented crisis brought on by the pandemic, it is important that the \nFederal Rese rve take extraordinary measures  to help “main street ” businesses.    \nImportantly, additional debt may not be right for every business and organization at this \nchallenging time, but I would encoura ge business es that ha ve been disrupted by the pandemic \nand are in need of financing to explore the program.  On the Boston Fed ’s website , at \nwww.bostonfed.org/mslp , you can  learn more about the terms and conditions of the program , \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n inquire with bank s in your network  to see if they are participating , and if not consult the \ninteractive map for lenders in  your state  accepting applications for new customers .   \nFor many, the program can serve as a vital bridge to address cash flow interruption \nushered in by the pandemic.   Of course, b ank loans are contrac ts between borrowers and banks, \nand the negotiations for loans can take some time  and effort .  As a result, when the program was \nlaunched in early July , there were relatively few Main Street program loans submitted for \nparticipation purchase .  As borrowers and banks have become  more familiar wit h the program , \nwe have seen a steady increase in banks submitt ing loans to our portal.   \nFigure 14  shows that there are currently  more than  $856 million in loans active in the \nportal, with  more than  $250 million in loans committed or settled.   Much of the increase has \noccurred recently , and I expect we will continue to see more activity as more firms are impacted \nby the pandemic.  Unfortunately, should the fall bring a resurgence of the virus as many \nepidemiological models predict , this program may beco me even more essential.  \nSome seem eager to suggest that the Main Street program’s modest initial activity is \nevidence of failure.  I completely disagree , and allow me to explain why .   \nThe Program differs from other programs for businesses made possible by  the CARES \nAct, reflecting the parameters of what the Federal Reserve is authorized by Congress to do.  \nUnlike the Paycheck Protection Program, where many loans could turn into grants  funded by the \nCARES Act, the Main Street program  involves loans that must be repaid. These loans are \nnegotiated between the borrower and lender, designed to meet the special needs  or circumstances  \nof a particular borrower, and must be underwritten by the lender .   A grant program, or a lending \nprogram w ith even more generous terms, would of course have faster uptake.  But MSLP’s  \ndesign, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, in conjunction with the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 12  \n Treasury, can indeed support the flow of vital credit to many firms and nonprofit organi zations.  \nThe Federal Reserve and Treasury have sought to design a program that is well managed with \nrespect to risks, efficiency, and resilience, while being responsive to the needs of borrowers \nexperiencing difficult times.   \n Indeed, d esigning and operat ionalizing a program of this breadth and nuance, delivered \nthrough secure technology, is a significant achievement in a few months’ time.  Everyone \ninvolved is focused on  the public service goal of  helping to provide important credit support to \nbusinesses and nonprofits at this critical and challenging period.  Quickly scaling up a program \nthat purchases a large portion of existing loans – from a very diverse group of borrowers in a \ndecentralized ma rket that lacks standardization – is inherently difficult.  There are also tradeoffs \nbetween limiting credit risk, ensuring that operations are safe and secure, reaching scale, and \nachieving operational efficiency.   \nAs a reminder, the program opened for l oan purchases on July 6.  The numbers to date \nseem to me  consistent with what I would characterize as a gradual pace of initial activity  that is \nmore recently expanding  as participants become familiar with the program’s parameters.   \nIt is important that t he Federal Reserve stands ready at this time of distress, in the public \ninterest and in pursuit of our Congressional mandates, to facili tate lending to for -profit \nbusinesses and nonprofit organizations of many sizes at reasonable rates.  As I mentioned at the \noutset, credit interruptions prolong recessions and ultimately harm individuals and businesses on \nmain streets across America.  The Boston Fed and the Federal Reserve as a whole see the M ain \nStreet Lending Program  as one way to do all we can  to support the businesse s, nonprofits, and \nindividuals that make up our nation’s economy.   \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , August 12 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 13  \n Concluding Observations  \nUnfortunately, the economic outlook is being driven by the course of the pandemic , and \nmuch depends on how successfully it can be contained, either through public health or medical \ninnovations.   The forecast  for the U.S. economy this fall is quite uncertain, but my view is that \nthe recent slowdown in economic activity that  we have seen in high  frequency data is likely to \ncontinue.  Currently , we have an unemployment rate above 10 percent, and because of the \ncontinue d community spread  of the virus , I am concerned that the pandemic will limit the ability \nof the economy to recover  quickly . As a result, an increasing number of those  who are currently \ntemporarily unemployed may ultimately have to face permanent layoffs and the difficult task of \nfinding a new job in a changed economic environment.    \nAt the Fed , we are focused on doing all in our power and purview to support the \neconomy , including through efforts we are very proud of, like the Main Street program  that again \nI recommend lenders, businesses, and nonprofits explore  participating in .   \nWhile the fiscal and monetary stimulus has been significant, it cannot fully offset the \neconomic drain caused by the public health crisis .  Limited or inconsistent efforts by s tates to \ncontrol the virus based on public health  guidance  are not only placing citizens at unnecessary \nrisk of severe illness and possible death  – but are also likely to prolong the economic downturn .  \nThank you  for having me today.  I wish you all continued good health during these \nchallenging times.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 10:10 A. M.

U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good afternoon and t hank you for the  opportunity to meet with the  members of the \nBoston Economic Club , albeit  virtually.   \nAs we approach the fall, the recent data for the national econom y have been better than \nexpected .  The reason is quite clear; m any states opened up from pandemic shutdowns relatively \nquickly , and economic activity has reflect ed the benefits of increase d personal mobility .  \nUnfortunately, we are also  seeing the costs  of higher mobility on  public health  outcomes, as \ninfections and deaths from CO VID-19 remain elevated.    \nIn Massachusetts , until recently, we ha d the highest state unemployment rate in the \ncountry , at 16.2 percent  in July .  However, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts fell to 11.3 \npercent  in August as more businesses have reopened.  Notably , over the summer  both infection \nand mortality rates have been much lower than in many other parts of the country.1  \nOur higher unemployment and lower infection rate ha ve several causes.  One is the \nlaudable focus o f Massachusetts policymakers on public health, and the ir unwillingness to trade \noff higher levels of economic activity in the short -term for higher rates  of COVID -19 infection .  \nHowever, the  type of work that is conducted in the state  also affects the employment situation .  \nA large swath of Greater Boston’s workforce  hold white -collar jobs  – many of which can be \ndone remotely – so downtown Boston has yet to see most workers return to its office towers . \nWith more workers remaining at home, activity  in the downtown area has fallen off significantly. \nThe large support system that developed around these white -collar jobs, consisting of many  \ndowntown businesses  and their employees , have suffered  greatly .   \nLooking beyond employment, t he consequent sharp reduction in revenues of these \nbusinesses has impaired their ability to make timely rent payments, producing adverse effects on \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n landlords , and eventually their mortgage lenders .  The changed working environment  and its \n“multiplier effect s,” as they emanate through other stakeholders , exemplify some of the \nheadwinds the economy still faces.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s response to the initial and ongoing effects of the pandemic has \nbeen swift and mult ifaceted.   As an example, the statement after last week’s meeting of the Fed’s \npolicymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) , included new guidance  \nregarding interest rate policy .2   \nThe statement  highlighted that the federal funds rate range is expected to remain at th e \ncurrently  low level until three conditions are met.  First , that the economy reaches maximum \nsustainable employment.  Second, that inflation has risen to 2 percent.  Third , that in flation is on \ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some time .  These three conditions come with a caveat \nthat no risks emerge that could impede the Fed achieving its  dual mandate – such as increased \nfinancial instability .  In essence , the Committee is committing to wait ing until inflation is above \nits long -run target  before normalizing the federal funds rate , unless other  important risks become \nsignificant.   The lethargy of the inflation rate below the 2 percent target  essentially  since 2008 \nhas made the FOMC willing to overshoot the 2 percent target before normalizing rates , accepting  \nthe added risk to financial stability from holding interest rates near zero  for an extended period of \ntime. \nLast week FOMC meeting participants also provided their updated  forecasts for the \neconomy , in the form of the Summary of Economic Projections  – often referred to as the  SEP.3  \nThe median forecast  of the  FOMC participants has the unemployment rate dropping to 7.6 \npercent by the end of this year, and to 5.5 percent at the end of 2021 , along with a gradual return \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n of inflation to 2 percent.  This outlook constitutes  a rapid return to full employment , considering  \nthe extent of the downturn from the pandemic  this spring .   \nUnfortunately, m y own forecast is less optimistic.   \nWhile I expect the economy to recover in time, my own  expect ation is that it will be more \ngradual  than the median forecast of FOMC  participants .  The reason for my differing outlook \nhinges on  several cha llenges that , I believe,  the economy  could  face in the coming months.  First , \nI am concerned that  a second wave of COVID -19 infections this fall and winter  is likely , which \ncould cause some states to impose new restrictions on mobility and face-to-face interactions.  \nEven without added restrictions, the added risk of infection from a second wave could  sap some \nof the willingness of consumers and businesses to spend  and invest.   Second, additional support \nfrom fiscal policy, which I believe is very much needed, seem s increasingly unlikely to \nmaterialize anytime soon.  The occurrence of a second wave could result in more fiscal actions, \nbut their impact on the economy would probabl y not be realized until early next year .  Third, I \nexpect that financial spillovers from businesses impacted by the virus will become a more \nsignificant headwind  going forward .  Finally, my forecast reflects my concern that workers \ndisplaced by the pandemi c may find it difficult to quickly transition to new jobs , with more \nfurloughs turn ing into permanent layoffs as many businesses remain troubled.  \nI certainly hope that this less optimistic outlook  turns out to be wrong .  But  the likelihood  \nthat this view is right is why I believe  additional fiscal stimulus, and continued monetary \nstimulus , remain necessary  – despite some of the encouraging economic data received over the \nsummer.  In particular , as concerns monetary policy, it continues to be very impo rtant that the \nFederal Reserve’s emergency lending  facilities  provide support to the economy.4  In my remarks \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n today, I  will briefly discuss the progress on one such facility, the Federal Reserve’s Main Street \nLending Program  – including  some recent expansions to include multi -borrower loan  structures  \n(loans made to multiple co -borrowers ) and loans to nonprofit s, and a recent announcement \nemphasizing that lenders should focus on borrow ers’ financial position s before and after the \npandemic as they make their underwriting decisions.5 \nBefore I turn to the Main Street  Lending Program , however, I’d like to begin with  a brief \nsummary of  recent economic data and the forecast  provided by the FOMC , while highlight ing \nsome of the risks and challenges I see in the economic outlook .  To preview my conclusion, my \nview s are that the economy remains fragile, that fiscal - and monetary -policy stimulus are \nessential to the recovery, and that policy makers  should con tinue to explore how to reduce \neconomic scarring from  this severe pandemic . \n \nExamining the Recent Data  \nFigure 1  shows the unemployment rate for the nation since the beginning of the year.  \nThe dark blue line shows the standard , widely reporte d “U-3” measure.  The lighter blue line \nshows the unemployment rate corrected for one of the mis classification  errors  that ha ve been \ndocumented this year .6  In particular, many respondents  — especially early on in the pandemic  \n— answered the household labor survey by saying they were employed but not at work because \nof the pandemic , when they should actually have stated that they were  unemployed on temporary \nlayoff.  Even without th is adjustment , the U -3 unemployment rate is currently at 8.4 percent, \nwhich is still consistent with  a severe recession.  Th is misclassification  has become less severe \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n with better reporting efforts and some of the workers being  recalled or , unfortunately, \ntransitioning to  being permanently unemployed.    \nIn addition, o ther indicators sugges t that the headline unemployment rate , even if \nmeasured correctly,  may understa te the amount of slack in the labor market.  Indeed, t he labor \nforce participation rate is still almost 2 percent age points  lower than it was at the beginning of \nthe year , and t he number of individuals  reporting that they are working part-time for economic \nreasons remains elevated .  While the improvement  in the unemployment rate since April is \nencouraging, I believe further progress will be more difficult to achieve until disruptions from \nthe virus become less acute.  \nFigure 2  highlights  the industries with the most pronounced employment growth since \nMay.  The se industries are the ones t hat were most disrupted by the pandemic  – such as Retail \nTrade, and Accommodation and Foo d Services  – and are sectors of the economy still impacted \nby consumers ’ reticence to engage  in activities where they are less confident of being protected \nfrom the virus.  \nDespite the recent hiring, Figure 3  shows that employment in th ese industries remain s \ndramatically below levels from the beginning of the year  – especially in Arts, Entertainment,  and \nRecreation,  which is impacted by the lack of group events ; and in Accommodation and Food \nServices ( hotels and restaurants ), which relies on  consumers  leaving home  to make expenditures .  \nAmong e ven those industries that have recovered more significantly, employment still remains \nbelow where it was earlier this year.   As a result , while labor markets have improved, the path \nfor further  reemployment  will not be easy  – particularly if a second wave of infections occurs  \nand consumers remain reluctant to participate in activities where social distancing is difficult .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n As a result , the most likely labor market outcome seems to me to be continued improvement, but \nwith slower gains in employment than we have experienced  since April . \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nAs I mentioned, following last week’s FOMC meeting , the Federal Reserve release d the \nSummary of Economic Projections  (SEP) , which involves asking each FOMC participant to \nprovide their forecast for key economic variables.  Figure 4  shows the median SEP forecast , and \nthe central tendency , for the unemployment rate .  The median of the participants ’ forecasts has \nunemployment ending the year at 7.6 percent, f alling  to 5.5 percent by the end of 2021 , and then \ndropping down to 4.6 percent by the end of 2022.   \nAlthough some of this improvement has alre ady occurred, the expected decline  would \nrepresent a rapid recovery from the pandemic ’s severe employment effects .  Despite this \nprojected pattern of a swift improvement in labor markets, Figure 5 shows that FOMC \nparticipant s forecast only a gradual return to the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation goal.  The \nmedian of the SEP projections has inflation still at 1.8 percent at the end of 2022 , despite the \naccompanying forecast of tight ening  labor markets.   \nThe rapid improvement in the  unemployment rate is facilitated by unusually low interest \nrates.  The median  of the  SEP forecast s for the interest rate through 202 3 is unchanged at its \ncurrent target range , as shown in Figure 6 .  This is consistent with the forward guidance that I \ndiscussed at the outset of my remarks , where Fed policymakers stated their  intention to  wait to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n raise rates until the economy has  reached maximum sustainable employment , and inflation is on \ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some time . \nAll told, the median SEP projection is a relatively optimistic forecast.  The \nunemployment rate falls to 4.6 percent by 2022, and inflation reaches 2 percent in 2023.   As I \nnoted earlier, my own view is less optimistic , because I believe that the path of the pandemic will \ncontinue to present challenges that represent  significant headwinds  to economic growth . \n \nChallenges  to the Economy and the Forecast  \nThe biggest challenge to the economy, and the risk to a more optimistic forecast , \ncontinues to be our inability in the United States to  achieve the public health progress  on the \nvirus seen in  many other developed countries .  Figure 7  shows new infection rates for the United \nStates in dark blue , new infections for Massachusetts in light blue , and new infections for G7  \ncountries (excluding the U.S.) in green .  Starting with Massachusetts, the infections per million \npopulation peaked in April, and then declined significantly as the state imposed strong \nrestrictions to reduce the infection rate.  To date, we have been able to avoid a large resurgence \nof the virus  in Massachusetts, with infections rising only a bit higher than the lows reached in \nJune.  In contrast, national infections were much more subdued in March and April, but \nincreased significantly as many states re -opened very quickly , with few restrictions , causing a \nsurge in infections.  Th ankfully , those infections have moderated nationally, but remain well \nabove the levels in Massachusetts.   The G7 countries , excluding the U.S. , show a dramatically \ndifferent situation, with their new cases per million population peaking in late March at a much \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n lower level than either Massachusetts or the U.S. as a whole went on to achieve – and remaining \nlow throughout the summer.   \nDespite the  overall  progress nationally  since the July peak , the virus has tended to surge \nin areas that previously had relatively low infection rates.  Figure 8  shows th ree states in the \nNorthern Midwest  that have re cently experienced a surge  – possibly triggered by less restrictions  \non, or higher aversions to,  wearing masks and social distancing, despite a number of large group \nevents.  Th ese patterns of infections emphasize the need to be vigilant, particularly as more \nactivities move inside  this fall and winter . \nFigure 9  shows the forecasted effect  of the virus over the remainder  of this year , based \non the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) model that is maintained at the \nUniversity of Washington.7  While this is only one model -based projection , it broadly reflects the \nconsensus of many experts and the experiences of past pandemics , that the fall and winter are \nlikely to result in a resurgence of the virus.  Because community spread is not contained, and \nregional fla re-ups are still occurring, one has to be  concern ed about reduction s in restrictions  on \nmobility  at a time when schools are back in session and colder weather  is returning .   \nOf course , the outlook from th e IHME model  could likely  be improved by  more careful  \npersonal behaviors , such as  social distancing and wearing masks, or by states clamping down on \nmobility in the face of rising infection rates .  Still , the model highlights that a second wave is \ncertainly possible if we do not take sufficient precautions .  Due to projections such as this one , \nmy economic forecast is predicated on individuals and firms still being constrained significantly \nby community spread of the virus  this fall and winter.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n If increased infection rates occur during the fall , as I expect , it will exacerbate other \neconomic and financial headwinds that I anticipate will  be more apparent in the last four months  \nof this year.  Figure 10  shows the  delinquency rate s associated with  different real estate asset \nclasses  so far this year , based on  data reported on collateralized mortgage -backed securities  or \nCMBS .  Moving forward, e ven conservatively underwritten properties will likely face challenges \nif consumers are afraid to shop in stores and stay in  hotels through the fall and winter.  So far, \nthese fears have more clearly manifested themselves in the data from CMBS markets; already \nover 25 percent of hotel properties are delinquent , and close to 20 percent of retail properties are \nin arrears.  Moreover, t he CMBS market data may actually be underestimating the problems in \nthese sectors , as it disproportionately accounts for large r properties.  Smaller hotels and retail \nstrip malls, which are more likely to be financed by small and medium -sized banks, are likely to \nbe even more severely impacted  – although data on delinquencies from the summer are not yet \navailable .   \nIn contrast, office and multifamily commercial real estate loans currently have low \ndelinquencies.  However, an important issue for both of these sectors is rollover risk.  Given that \nmost multifamily properties have one -year leases, the costs arising from a wave of no n-renewing \ntenants become clear only at lease renewal times.  An inability to fill the resulting vacancies \ncould lead to an increase in mortgage delinquencies for these properties.  \nFigure 1 1 shows that such stresses are already showing up in major cities , in terms of \nvacancy and rental rates.  Data from Costar, which calculates daily vacancy  rates  and rental \nprices for apartments in major cities, show rapidly rising vacancy rates and fairly sharp declines \nin rents in several major cities.  Particula rly challenged are expensive cities like Boston  and San \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n Francisco , shown in the figure,  and L os Angeles .  The decline in rents is more abrupt than we \nwould normally see in a  more traditional  (non-pandemic) economic downturn, and may be \nindicative of more s ubstantial problems on the horizon.  Similarly, office properties have longer -\nterm leases, so the stress es in that market will likely become apparent only over time.  However, \nan open question remains – whether there will be structural changes in downtown office space as \na result of a prolonged period with many employees working from home.  \nThe reason to focus so much attention on commercial real estate is because real estate \nprices were inflated by reach ing-for-yield behavior as low interest rates persisted  during the \nrecovery from the Great Recession.  A structural shock, like the pandemic, can result in a \nsignificant increase in the number of nonperforming loans, eventually impinging  the ability of \nbanks and insurance companies  to continue to make credit available to borrowers.  Hence, I am \nespecially  worried about a “second shoe dropping ” that will particularly affect  small and \nmedium -sized banks, which provide a large share of commercial real estate loans and small \nbusiness lo ans.  A curtailment of credit resulting from such problems has caused serious \nheadwinds to recoveries in the past,  and may be a serious problem going forward.  \nFigure 12  shows that , unfortunately,  challenges from the pandemic are likely to extend to \nthe lab or market.  If many hotels, restaurants, and retail firms declare bankruptcy, workers in \nthese sectors  will have to search for new employers, and possibly new industries  for \nemployment .  The industries most impacted by the pandemic tend to be large employe rs of \nwomen, minorities , and young people , as the figure illustrates.  The ability to retrain for jobs \nwith different employers or in different industries can take time, and I worry that th ese employer -\nemployee matching challenges  will result in a slower labor market recover y than what is implied \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n by the  median unemployment -rate outlook in the SEP.  However, fiscal polic y actions,  like the \ncreation of Paycheck  Protection Program  (PPP) or emergency Federal Reserve program s, like the \nMain Street Lending P rogram , could help moderate the numbers of  firms that close.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve’s Main Street  Lending Program  \nThe Main Street Lending Program , the MSLP,  was designed to provide support  to firms \nthat had been profitable before the pandemic, expect to be profitable after the pandemic  \ndisruptions abate , but have been severely impacted during  the pandemic.  This “bridging” \nconcept is entirely appropriate and beneficial given the presumably temporary disruptions in \nactivity and revenue while  the pandemic is present.  These kind s of bridge loans also tend to be \nscarce during crises, particularly for small and medium -sized firms.8  \nThe MSLP  involves the Federal Reserve purchas ing 95 percent participation s in loan s to \nfor-profit companies or nonprofit entities – loans t hat ha ve been underwritten by a bank , which \nretains 5 percent of the loan .  The program is attractive to borrowers because the interest rate is 3 \npercent age points  over LIBOR – and requires no payment of interest until year two, and no \npayment of principal until year three .  Also, principal payments are back -loaded, at 15 percent in \nyears three and four, and 70 percent in year five – allowing time for the pandemic to pass  and \nbusiness  activity and revenue streams  to revive .  The program  should be attractive to banks , both \nbecause of the fees collected and  because it reduces the risk to the bank of a borrower that was \nimpacted by the pandemic , given that  the Federal Reserve  holds 95 percent of the loan.  Hence , \nthe MSLP allow s bank s to help maintain vital credit  flows in their local market , which avoid s \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M.

The Main Street program brings a solution – a backstop to \nthat problem  – given the Federal Reserve’s ability to take on 95 percent of the loans.  I continue \nto urge the nation’s financial institutions to work wit h the Federal Reserve to help provide a \nbridge  for pandemic -affected  businesses and nonprofits to better times, avoiding more lasting \neconomic damage to communities and workers.9 \nImportantly, I would note that t here has been some confusion about the appropriate \nunderwriting standards that a bank should apply to the loan s in the program .  The Federal \nReserve  recently provided new clarifying FAQ s encouraging banks to focus on borrower status \nboth before and after the pandemic when considering whether a borrower is appropriate for the \nprogram.  We also published an FAQ that clarifies how the loan should be treated by bank \nsupervisors, with all three federal regulators agreeing on th e clarification .  Hopefully , these \ndevelopments will encourage some banks to more actively engage with borrowers impacted by \nthe pandemic , using the Main Street program . \nAs shown in Figure 13 , the Main Street Program as of Monday night has $2 billion  in \nloans that have been accepted and $2.4 billion  in loans that have been completed or are actively \nbeing considered in the portal.  We have seen an increased flow of loans as banks and borrowers \nbecome more familiar with the program.  The Main Street Lending Program has recently been \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday , September 23 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 13  \n made available to nonprofit borrowers , and the portal now accepts loans with multiple co-\nborrowers.  The program will continue to evolve as the Board of Governors and Treasury \nevaluate needs for any additional changes to the program.  \nFigure 14 shows the top states where Main  Street program loans have been completed or \nare under review.  The states are generally areas that were impacted more severely by the \npandemic over the summer , and some of the larger states by population.   \nHowever, an important component has been banks ’ willingness to participate in the \nprogram.  Figure 15 shows that relatively few banks have made more than 10 loans (shown as a \nsquare) and the banks making at least six loans in the Main Street Program have been banks with \nassets under $ 20 billion.  None of the nation’s largest banks , by this metric,  are currently active \nin the program.  \n \nConclu ding Observation s  \nRecent economic data have been encouraging, but I believe the most difficult part of the \nrecovery is still ahead of us.  A full recovery probably requires the availability of  vaccines and \nmore effective treatments for the virus because until then, many businesses and households are \nunlikely to return to  more normal spendi ng habits.  While I anticipate a slowly improving \neconomy, econom ic activity still  faces serious headwinds .  Potential  financial impediments and \nchallenges in the labor market make the recovery process more gradual than any of us would \nprefer.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n 12:05 P.M.

Until a vaccine is widely available, it is appropriate to have \nhighly accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.  Monetary policy is pursuing new and \nimaginative ways to deal with the effects of this pandemic.  However, my view is that additional \nfiscal policy is probably the mo re effective tool at this time , since it can directly  allocate money \nto firms and businesse s most  impacted  by COVID -19 without requiring them to take on \nadditional debt  that must be repaid . \nThank you for having me to speak with you today .  I hope you all stay well , and I look \nforward to our next gathering  – hopefully  – being in person.   \n \n1 Massachusetts had the highest unemployment rate in July at 16.2 percent.

The higher line includes the BLS estimate of that misclassification as \nunemployed.  There are other types of misclassification not accounted for here.  For example, some workers categorized as not inthe labor force are workers who want a job \nbut are not looking for work as a result of the pandemic. If they were looking for a job, they would be classified as unemploye d, resulting in yet a higher unemployment rate.\nSource:  BLS, Haver AnalyticsFigure 1:  Labor Market Conditions\nJanuary 2020 -August 2020\n7\n\n\nSource:  BLS, Haver AnalyticsFigure 2:  Payroll Employment Growth\nMay 2020 -August 2020\n8\n\n\nSource:  BLS, Haver AnalyticsFigure 3:  Payroll Employment Growth\nJanuary 2020 -August 2020\n9\n\n\nNote:  The SEP unemployment rate forecast is for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated, for 2020 -2023.

U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good morning, and t hank you for the opportunity to speak with you  today , albeit, \nvirtually.  I particularly regret not being able to meet with you in person, given the many years I \nenjoyed living and visiting Wisconsin  – first as a graduate student at University of Wisconsin -\nMadison, and then later, when visiting my daughter during her four years in medical school at \nthe Medical College of Wisconsin .  \nI am honored to join the ranks of economists  you have invited to  give the Marburg \nMemorial Lecture  at Marquette  University .  Perhaps appropriately, most  of the previous speakers \nhave been distinguished academics .  Today , I share with you the perspectives I ’ve gained from a \ndifferent role, which is t hat of a policymaker.   \nThe stated  goal of the Marburg Memorial Lecture is to provide a forum for the discussion \nof moral, philosophical , and social dimensions of economic issues .1  Economists discuss the \nsocial dimensions of economic issues  all too rarely .  At this time, in the grip of a worldwide \npandemic, the breadth of the effect of th e virus on society  has made COVID -19 of crucial \nconcern to many disciplines, and economics is certainly no exception.  It is an essential time for \neconomist s to be considering the social implications of  economic  policy, as the nation remains \naffected by  a virus  that has taken  more than  210,000 lives .  As we head into the colder months , \nwe continue to see a high rate of positive COVID cases across the country  (including  a \ntroubling ly high infection rate in Wisconsin and much of the  Midwest), which underscores  that \nthe human tragedy of the pandemic  continues to unfold  even as the economy has reopened and \nimproved  noticeably .   \nIt is important  to note that  both the negative public  health  effects,  and economic \nrepercussion s, of the pandemic ha ve not been felt  evenly  in society .  The virus itself has \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n disproportionately affected  minorit ies who, statistically,  tend to  live in more dense  urban area s \nand rely on public transportation to get to work, and who are more likely to be employ ed as \nfrontline and essential workers .  Such jobs cannot easily be performed  remotely, and despite \nbeing deemed essential, often involve modest pay.  In addition, these workers are often  in \nservice -related industries that have been particularly hard -hit by the crisis , and so they have been \ndisproportionally affected by job loss es.2   \nUnfortunately, the uneven effects of recessions ar e not unique to the current one.  B ut the \ncurrent situation  is severe .  As the pandemic is dragg ing on, and consumers remain wary of \nengaging in activity that requires close social contact  – restaurants, hotels, and retailers are \nbeginning to close  – with the consequen ce of permanent job losses for the typically lower -wage \nworkers in these industries.3  \nBusinesses closing , making  job losses permanent , is one example of the so -called \nrecessionary dynamics that often take hold during an economic downturn .4  Importantly, t he state \nof the economy  as it enters  a downturn  – especially the health of the financial system  – can play \nan important role in recessionary  dynamics and how the recessionary  burden is spread across the \neconomy.  \nIn my remarks t oday , I will explore  an economic issue that definitely has social and even \nmoral dimensions a nd implications, consistent with the Marburg lecture  serie s – whether the \nUnited States economy, as currently configured , is particularly vulnerable to economic \ndisruptions  and in turn those recessionary burdens .  In terms of this vulnerability to disruptions, \nit is possible that no one could have predicted  that a worldwide pandemic would occur precisely  \nin 2020  – but one could have anticipate d that having highly levered firms and excessive \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n concentrations  of commercial real estate  lending  at some institutions  would make the economy  \nmore vulnerable to a variety of  disruption s, including a pandemic or other shock .   \nYou might be wondering why I would bring up losses from financial instability in the \nsame breath as the pandemic  and its uneven economic and public health burdens .  I do so \nbecause losses due to financial shocks  affect a wide range of stakeholders  – not only  \nshareholders, but also of course  the workers in the affected industries .  A wave of unnecessary \nbankruptcies  resulting from such shocks can  cause a spike in permanent job loss and a significant \nscarring of labor market  participants  – particularly, though not exclusively, those at the lower  \nend of the income distribution.   These lower-wage workers, who tend to have little if any \nfinancial cushions, are the individuals least prepared to endure an economic downturn . \nAmerican novelist Ernest Hemingway famously – and succinctly  – capture s some of my \nconcerns in this dialogue from  his b reakout novel,  The Sun Also Rises : “’How did you go \nbankrupt? ’ Bill asked. ‘Two ways,’ Mike said.  ‘Gradually and then suddenly. ’”  Many \nbusinesses are, unfortunately , facing  the “suddenly ” part right now .  In recent years, m any of \nthese firms had gradually increased risk by taking on more leverage, which magnifies returns \nwith good outcomes – but also magnifies losses w hen bad outcomes  occur .5   \nThis increase in risk -taking is more likely to take place in a low -interest environment, \nlike the one which prevailed  in the aftermath of (and as a result of ) the financial crisis and Great \nRecession .  Low interest rates encourage households and firms to accumulate more debt by \nmaking it easier to meet the cash flow needs to service the debt associated with buying a house \nor making a business (capital) investment, or even share buybacks by firms.  But wh en a bad \neconomic shock occurs, financial buffers for households and firms alike tend to fall, and the debt \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n service and potent ial repayment of the  debt can become quite problematic.  Financed assets – be \nthey companies or shopping malls – will also lose va lue in a recession, making it much harder to \nrefinance that debt by taking out a new loan , as might be done in normal times.  \nDuring economic downturns , monetary policy accommodation helps to stimulate the \neconomy  by lowering interest rates and encouraging households and firms to take more risk  – a \ndesired effect during the depths of a recession , when many households and firms become  overly  \nrisk-averse  and limit their spending . (One might think of this as pump -priming to rein in the \ndownward spiral of the economy and initiate a recovery. )   \nHowever, there are potential adverse consequences from  low rates persist ing for an \nextended period  even after the economy has made progress in the recover y.  Abnormally low \nrates  for a long period  during times when econo mic slack is no longer a concern can result in \nexcessive risk -taking , as businesses and firms take on additional debt and accumulate more risky \nassets in search of better returns  – potentially bidding up asset prices to unsustainable levels .  \nThe financial pressures associated with such behavior build gradually, and only become clear in \nthe next economic downturn.  When the ensuing recession occurs, often suddenly , and more \nsevere recessionary dynamics take over, the impact tends to be greatest on workers and firms that \nare least able to adjust and adapt.      \nMy remarks today  focus on  some of the mechanisms that contribute to financial \ninstability and tend to amplify the effects of economic downturn s, and how these mechanisms \nare likely to impact the  economic recovery .  While these observations apply to downturns in \ngeneral, they are certainly relevant in the present particula rly challenging episode . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n • First, I will highlight  an important mechanism that plays a role in recession ary \ndynamics  – the tightening of credit terms and credit availability  during an economic \ndownturn.  In part , the importance of  this channel  is amplified by a low interest rate \nenvironment  during the pre ceding  economic expansion when households and firms \naccumulate d loans , oftentimes in real estate .  A prime example in the current \ndownturn is commercial real estate, wh ere the high leverage build -up before the crisis \nand the severe hit from the crisis have led to a noticeable tightening in credit \nconditions.  With tighter credit conditions, it becomes even more difficult to roll over \nmaturing loans, which are plentiful d ue to the increased leverage.  \n• I will then show that  low rates for a long period of time  not only compound bank \nexposures in real estate , but also increase  firms ’ reliance on debt, making cash flow \ndisruptions from the pandemic more severe.   \n• Finally, I wil l highlight that this build -up in financial risks has  implications for labor \nmarket conditions  – which , unfortunately,  likely mean s a slower  and more painful  \nrecovery than if we had more aggressively addressed  the build -up of risks in the \ncorporate and banking sectors  prior to the pandemic .   \nAll of t his has important policy implications  – for both monetary and supervisory  policy .  \nFirst, it has implications for how long monetary policy should remain highly accommodative ; \nand second, it has implications with respect to the lack of a coherent framework in the United \nStates for conducting supervisory policy that effectively address es the build -up of financial \nstability risks.   Policy improvements in this area should not be seen a s dry or abstract notions – \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n given the opportunity to make downturns less severe, hasten recoveries, and alleviate some of the \nhuman toll of job losses and economic insecurity.  \n \nTightening of Credit Conditions  \nThe t ightening of credit conditions frequently occur s in economic downturns , as lenders \nbecome more concerned about the ability of borrowers to pay  off their loans , and the value of \ncollateral  – and become more uncertain  about the evolution of the economy  more generally.  \nFigure 1  shows the results of the bank lending survey for commercial and industrial loans \nconducted by the Federal Reserve.  For both large and small borrowers,  lending standards have \ntightened appreciably , relative to the time prior to the pandemic, and are currently approa ching \nthe peaks we saw in the financial crisis and Great Recession .   \nIn Figure 2 , it is clear that one major difference  between  the current pandemic -driven \nrecession  and the last recession , at least to date, is the better financial condition of U.S. banks.  \nDuring the financial crisis  that began in 2007 , a large number of bank failures occurred, as banks \nheld too little capital for the shock generated from the fall in real estate prices, pa rticularly as it \ninvolved  highly leveraged households.   \nEven though bank failures are currently low  (Figure 2) , and many banks are better \ncapitalized, why are financial conditions tight  (Figure 1)  at least for commercial and industrial \nlending ?  One possi bility is that as the pandemic drags on, the likelihood of more severe \noutcomes for borrowers, and their lenders, has risen .  As uncertainty increases, banks tend to be \nless willing to take on risk , at any price.  Also, a significant depletion  of capital, even if  it does \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n not cause a bank to fail, can lead to banks tightening the ir lending standards applied to potential  \nborrowers.    \nIn particular, falling commercial and residential real estate prices were a major reason for \nlosses on loans during th e last financial crisis.  Figure 3  shows  that of l ate, nonperforming real \nestate loans have turned up, but have yet to rise dramatically.  The most recent data come with a  \ncouple of caveats .  First, the data tend to lag fairly significantly; the peak in th e previous \nrecession was well after the recession ended.  Second, and relatedly,  many banks reportedly \nprovided their customers forbearance in the spring  and summer – including , but not limited to , \nforbearance  for real estate loans backed by retail stores or hotels, which  have been particularly \nimpacted by the pandemic , and also for residential borrowers through regulatory mandates .6  \nBecause of the forbearance, borrowers  are meeting current contractual arrangemen ts, but are \nlikely  to struggle  once the forbearance ends if econom ic activity  remains suppressed by the \npandemic.7  \nThis concern  with future loan defaults, along with low net interest margins in a low -\ninterest -rate environment , likely helps explain why  bank stock prices  have remained so  \ndepressed , despite a significant rebound in broader stock indices , as shown in Figure 4 .  U.S. \nbank stocks are at only 60 percent of their value from the beginning of the year, while the \nbroader S&P 500 stock index is now above levels seen in January .   \nIn part , these concerns also focus on the commercial real estate loans made by  many \nbanks.  As Figure 5  illustrates, t he largest banks hold only a little over 5 percent of their assets in \ncommercial real estate loans, while small and mid -sized banks have approximately 25 percent of \ntheir assets in commercial real estate.  One reason for this divergence is that large banks with \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n more investment opportunities – and in part, with their CRE portfolio subject to annual stress \ntests that feature advers e scenarios for real estate – have chosen a smaller CRE portfolio relative \nto small er banks, where CRE lending is often the most straightforward collateralized lending for \nmany small and medium -sized businesses .  Over time more commercial real estate loans have \nmigrated to small and medium -sized banks.8 \nWhile banking data do not yet reflect significant problems in commercial real estate, \ngiven the forbearance  I mentioned  and the lagging nature of indicators , we can obtain  an \napproximation of likely problems from the  recent  equity performance of real estate investment \ntrusts.  These are companies that seek exposure to specific sectors of the commercial real estate \nmarket.  As Figure 6  shows, equity indices focused on two commercial real estate sectors – retail \nreal estate and hotel real estate are particularly depressed  since the pandemic hit .  For example,  \nthe hotels and resort s REIT ind ex is at about  50 percent of its pre-pandemic level.  I would add  \nthat many of the loans in bank portfolios are more likely to be smaller hotels and  retail strip \nmalls, which might have been even more adversely  impacted  by the pandemic  than their larger \npeers , given their lack of direct access to bond and equity markets .9   \nNote that travel and hotel firms  have been hurt by a variety of events  over the past 20 \nyears .  They were depressed after the September 11 , 2001  terrorist attacks, during the financial \ncrisis  of 2007 and 2008 , and now.  This is an industry where tail events should not be all that \nunexpected.  A highly levered hotel can be quite profitable during good times, but during a \nsevere economic downturn may face a significant  challenge to survive.   \nIt is worth noting that t he early 1990 s credit crunch, the financial crisis and Great \nRecession , and likely this pandemic -driven  recession  all provide  examples of the prominent  role \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n real estate has played  as a headwind to recovery due to the losses incurred from real estate assets \nheld inside and outside  the banking sector.  Howe ver, when sectors regularly contribute to the \nseverity of downturns, one wonders whether  it is time to note that  reaching -for-yield behavior \nduring a low interest rate period may exacerbate a subsequent  economic downturn, to the \ndetriment of many people beyond the sector.   \n \nBuild -up in Leverage  \nFigure 7 shows  the build -up in nonfinancial corporate business debt relative to GDP.  \nBut for cyclical fluctuations when GDP fell in recessions, the extended low interest rate \nenvironment after the Great Recession help s explain why the leverage ratio rose over the past 10 \nyears.  Corporations increased their  leverage as the prevailing low interest rate environment \nprovide d more capac ity to take on debt.   \nHowever , in an economic downturn, greater leverage  – with its principal and interest \nrepayment demands – may prove problematic for firms, or by extension the economy.  This can \nresult in firms being forced into bankruptcy, which hurt s a wide range of stakeholders in addition \nto lenders and investors , including  customers, suppliers, and employees.  \nFigure 8 provides an example  involving  retailers.10  During normal times, retailers can \nhave a relatively predictable revenue stream.  This makes it attractive to increase debt, either by \nmanagement  decision  or as part of a  private equity acquisition.  However, when the unexpected \noccur s, as the pandemic  has shown , it can  interrupt firms ’ revenue stream s, forcing them  to slash \nemployment to continue meeting debt service requirements and survive.   The f igure shows the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M.

As shown, most of these firm s have a debt  to EBITDA ratio \nthat would disqualify them from participation in the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending \nProgram  (where ratios of four  times adjusted EBITDA for loans with less security , and six times \nadjusted EBITDA  for loans with more security , represent the maximum allowed debt load) .   \nLeverage not permissible for a troubled borrower lending program, but standard for many \nretailers prior to the crisis, highlights that the significant build -up of leverage is a contributing \nfactor to the bankruptcies we have already seen  – unfortunately with more quite likely in the \ncoming months.  \n \nImplications  for Labor Markets  \nThe firm closures and layoffs associated with recessionary dynamics mean that debates \nabout corporate leverage involve  more than issues of  finance ; they involve the welfare of \nworkers .  The build -up in risks in commercial real estate , and leverage in the corporate sector , \nprior to the COVID -19 pandemic  are likely to result  in more bankruptcies and higher \nunemployment during this crisis than if less risk had been taken.   \nIf the costs for taking on the extra risk were borne only by investors knowingly taking \nthat risk, it might not be so problematic.  While less levered busi nesses still face disruptions in \nthe current environment, they will hopefully recover and rehire workers and re -engage with \nsuppliers and customers.  A leveraged business is more likely to declare bankruptcy, \npermanently severing its many formal and inform al contracts with customers, suppliers, and \nemployees.  The human toll can be immense.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n Of course , large declines in employment in particular sectors of the economy can be \ncostly , and slow to recover from , because work ers need to not only find new work but also \npotentially must develop skills for working in a new occupation or  industry.   While this can \noccur with or without leverage contributing, clearly excessive leverage can exacerbate job losses \nfrom temporary demand sh ocks, and make the recovery process slower and more painful than it \nwould have been without the leverage.  \nFigure 9 shows that since the beginning of the year, the number of employees \npermanently unemployed has risen.  Figure 10 shows that long -duration une mployment is on the \nrise.  As the pandemic drags on much longer than originally hoped , the likelihood increases that \nmany job  losse s that firms and employees hoped would be temporary , become permanent.  This \nmakes it much more difficult , of course, for the economy  to return  to full employment . \nNot only does it take time for workers to get retrained and find jobs in new areas, but \nmany workers lose the will to continue looking for work.  Such discouragement effects could be  \nparticularly prevalent among second earners in a household , and people nearing retirement. We \ncan see this effect with a nother measure of slack in the labor force , the labor  force  participation \nrate, shown in Figure 11.  As people become discouraged with their prospects for employment, \nthey stop looking for work.  As more people are not employed and not looking for work , the \nlabor force participation rate declines.  The roughly 2 percent age-point  decline in the labor force \nparticipation rate indicates that  the labor market recovery may prove  challenging.   It is also \nnoteworthy that loss of jobs have been concentrated in industries that employ a significant \nnumber of wom en, and as schools continue to impacted by the pandemic, more women are \nleaving the labor force – possibly in part to address inadequate support for school -age children.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M. Central Time)  on Thursday , October 8 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 12  \n As a reminder of the root cause of all these challenges, Figure 12 shows the  COVID -19 \ninfection rate in the United States and in Wisconsin.  As the figure shows, there ar e rising \ninfections in many parts of the country , including Wisconsin.   \nAddressing the public health crisis is the prerequisite for resolving the economic crisis .11  \nThe increases in infections  since March , which has already resulted in hundreds of thousands of \ndeaths  in the U.S. , also has dire economic consequences.  Firms and households are unlikely to \nresume pre -pandemic economic activity  and spending until the public health situation improves , \nand activities that require close social contact are less of a concern.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \nClearly a  deadly pandemic was bound to badly impact the economy.  However, I am \nsorry to say that the slow build -up of risk in the low-interest -rate environment that preceded the \ncurrent recession likely will make the economic recovery from the pandemic more difficult.   \nThe increased risk  build -up, such as the reach ing-for-yield  behavior  in commercial real \nestate or increased corporate leverage, make economic dow nturns including  this one more \nsevere.   These are issues that I and others spoke about quite extensively in the years before the \npandemic hit, in particular with respect to questions about the need for  accommodati ve interest  \nrates when the economy was doin g well , and the potential for a build -up of financial stability  \nrisks .12 \nIn the United States , we do not have a cohesive set of regulat ory and supervisory tools to  \nmoderate risk  build -ups.  And while we do have the Financial Stability Oversight Council, we do \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time  (11:10 A.M.

The urgency of these topics is underlined by the fact that  the economic \nimpact of these downturns is disproporti onately borne by those who can least afford it.   \nThank you for inviting me to deliver the Marburg Memorial Lecture  today.   I wish you \ncontinued health during these challenging times , and look forward to the next time I can visit the \ngreat state of Wisconsin.  \n \n1 For more about the Marburg Memorial Lecture, see: https://www.marquette.edu/business/center -for-\napplied -economics/marburg -lecture.php  \n \n2 Workers in these sectors who have remained employed, or who have been r ecalled to previous jobs, also \nface a higher risk of job losses going forward, to the extent that the recovery in industries such as \nhospitality and entertainment proves sluggish as we head into the colder months.   \n \n3 Another troubling factor this time is the dropout rate of women from the labor force being greater than \nthe typical recession, likely because of the unequal burden sharing between husbands and wives of taking \ncare of children who are schooling at home.  \n \n4 Recessionary dynamics refers to when aggregate demand falls below production so that inventories rise. \nFirms start cutting back production, and laying off employees. In addition, since production exceeds \naggregate demand, inventories keep building for a while and firms have no incentive to invest, so \naggregate demand continues to fall as consumption (due to the increase in unemployment and the fall in \nincomes) and investment fall further.  \n \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n12:10 P.M.

See, for example, LinaLu, Matthew Pritsker, Andrei \nZlate, Kenechukwu Anadu, and Jim Bohn, “Reach for Yield by U.S. Public Pension Funds,” Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston, Supervisory Research and Analysis Working Papers 2019,Series 19 -2.Other \npapers have found reach -for-yield behavior in other investor type s, including insurance companies  \n \n6 By regulatory mandates I am referring to the requirements for GSE -insured mortgages that lenders allow \nhomeowners to defer mortgage payments . \n \n7 It is also the case that small businesses received significant short -term help from fiscal policy; aid that \nhas not been extended or increased as of yet.  \n \n8 It is worth noting, however, that smaller banks have less ability to diversify in some sectors.  \n \n9 For context, larger properties tend to be debt/equity financed rather than bank financed  – as is often the \ncase for smaller hotels and retail strip malls.  \n \n10 It is worth noting that the traditional retail sector writ large has been challenged  for a period of time, \ndue in part to the rise of online retail and the likes of Amazon.com .  \n \n11 For more discussion, see: Sept. 23, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The Economy’s Outlook, \nChallenges, and Way Forward  and also August 12, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The COVID -19 \nPandemic, the Economic Outlook, and the Main Street Lending Program .  \n \n12 For more discussion, see: Jan. 13, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The Economic Outlook – and \nTwo Risks to the Forecast that are Worth Watching.

M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 1  \n Good morning – or good afternoon, depend ing on where you are tuning in today – and \nthank you for inviting me to join you  for the UBS European Virtual Conference .  I am happy to \nbe speaking during  a most interesting , and , unfortunately , challenging,  time for the world \neconomy.   \nBoth the United States and many European countries are currently at a place we had \nhoped we could avoid  – in the midst of a second wave of a deadly pandemic .  In Europe, many \ncountries have gone from modest restrictions to a “shutdown -light” model , to try to bend the \ncurve of COVID -19 cases , with the possibility that more severe shutdowns may be needed .  In \nthe U .S., the rise  in infections  is more recent, and the lack of central coordination has led to \ndivergent response s among states.  Some states have done  little, if anything , to restrict activity, \nwhile other states have taken a much more proactive public health stance.   \nOf course, offi cial policies and personal behavior can differ.  For example, some \nlocalities  chose to institute requirements for masks , but found enforcement too difficult .  Other \nplaces  opted for  a less conservative  public health response, yet people chose to limit their activity  \nand focus on self -preservation , staying at home even without being subject to government \nmandates.   \nLike many observers, I firmly believe that the path to righting the economy hinges on \nfirst getting the virus under con trol.  Without effective public health  policy, the virus will remain \nthe major source of economic  problems – despite fiscal and monetary authorities acting early on \nto try to moderate the  economic impact of the virus.  \nCOVID -19 is what economists would call a “tail event ,” meaning something in the \nlower-probability “tails” of a distribution of possible outcomes.   (Of course, some had predicted \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 2  \n that viral pandemics would occur at some point, so it may be wrong to see it as an esp ecially \nsurprising tail event, or one especially unlikely to occur again).  The severity of a tail event can \nbe impacted  – positively or negatively – by many factors, not just the immediate fiscal and \nmonetary response s.  How well a country is positioned t o weather a tail event depends , \nimportantly , on the financial positioning of households, financial institutions, and firms  when \nthat tail event strikes .  So, while a worldwide pandemic happening precisely when it did could \nnot have been predicted,  it was c ertainly possible that  some  tail event  might occur that would  \ndisrupt the economy .   \nMy view is that t he possibility of such tail event s justifies , as pruden t, financial \npositioning to lessen the severity  of adverse economic shocks  – whether th ose positioning steps  \nare personal decisions, such as precautionary savings , or regulatory ones , such as bank capital \ncushions .  Those economies that go into a recession in more fragile financial condition are likely \nto experience amplified economic problems that could have been ameliorated with more \nproactive financial stability steps , taken in advance .  Of course, protection from adverse tail \nevents is not fre e, so to speak .  The behavior of economic agents is largely based on cost-benefit \ndecisions, often driven  by incentives and disincentives provided by policymakers.1   \nThe most recent  statement by the Federal Open Market Committee , or FOMC  – the \nFederal Reserve’s monetary policy -making body – indicates the committee’s intention to keep \ninterest rates at the current low level until the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target has been achieved.2  \nThis reflects concerns about  the below -target inflat ion rate experienced over the previous decade.  \nA potential cost of this policy , from my perspective, would be the incentives that low interest \nrates create for households and firms to take on more leverage and more risk.  In the United \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 3  \n States, the corpora te sector was more leveraged in early 2020, at least by some measures, than at \nthe beginning of previous recessions.  Today , I will discuss the ramifications of low interest rate \npolicies, the impact on leverage, and the potential  consequences for a subseq uent economic \ndownturn – based on the U.S. experience in the current recession.  \nThis is an important time to focus on preventing the buildup of financial imbalances, \nbecause many central banks are considering modifying their reaction functions to prioritize \nachieving  certain elements of their mandates.  In the U nited States, that implies being more \nreluctan t than in previous recoveries to raise interest rates until we have achieved full \nemployment and 2 percent inflation.3   \nWhile I support achieving these two goals , I believe  it requires , in addition,  a more \nproactive supervisory and financial stability focus to prevent financial imbalances from \nratcheting up the  sever ity of  economic downturns.  In the United States , this is particularly \nproblematic , because legislation  formulated after the financial crisis  has not mandated a financial \nstability focus , but rather a too -big-to-fail focus , and the  regulatory tools  available to  the Fed  are \nmuch more limited than in many European and Asian countries.   \nI will also highlight in my remarks today that those segments of the labor market most \naffected  by amplified business cycles – when financial stability “guardrails ” are limited  – can be \npopulated by those  workers  who are most vulnerable and least able to adapt to the changed \neconomic environment .  That imbalanced human toll  is a bad outcome for democracy as well as \nthe economy.   \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 4  \n The Current Situation  \nA healthy economy requires a healthy populace.  In both Europe and the United States , a \nfull recovery is not possible until the public health crisis has been addressed.  Figure 1  shows the \ndramatic differences across countries  in their experience with the virus .  On the horizontal axis is \na countr y’s share of the global population, and on the vertical axis is a countr y’s share of world \ndeaths from C OVID -19.  Countries above the dotted line are , given their population,  \noverrepresented in deaths caused by the virus, and those below the dotted line are \nunderrepresented  in virus deaths, given t heir population .4   \nWorth noting is that t wo panels are needed in the figure . On the left chart, the U .S. is so \ndisproportionately accounting for world C OVID -19 deaths  that it required  a separate scale  from \nthe right chart .  Unfortunately, several European countries also have a disproportionate ly high  \nnumber of deaths, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain , and Italy  – and have recently \nimposed new restrictions.   \nOn the other hand , Figure 1 shows there are countries that have done well  in managing \nthe virus , including New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea.  Even a  developing countr y, \nVietnam, is showing a disproportionately low share of COVID deaths given its share of the \nworld population, implying it s success  in controlling the virus.  \nObviously , the virus has  had severe  economic consequences, as shown in Figure 2 .  It is \nuseful to think about the virus’s effects in economies that disproportionately involve  services, \nwhich  tend to require more personal interaction than the production and sale of goods .  And, in \nfact, service  activities proved to be  more affected  by the need to social  distance than were  goods -\nproduc ing activities .  In the United States, consumption of goods now exceeds what was \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 5  \n consumed at the beginning of the year, while services consumption remains depressed.  \nAmericans have continued remodeling houses  and buying durable goods , but things like \ntraveling and recreational activities outside of the home are taking place at a lower rate.  Thus , \nthe virus is a disproportionate shock for those countries  that are  more services dependent, such as \nthe U.S. , and most developed countries.  \n \nImpact of Economic Shocks  \nWhile the economic impact of C OVID -19 may fall disproportionately on service -oriented \neconomies  where the services require a lot of social interaction , other factors also are important \nin determining the severity of the pandemic’s  economic consequences .  As Figure 3  shows, the \nUnited States economy goes through cycles , with ups and downs of the unemployment rate  \nreflecting episodes of recessions and expansions .   \nThe f igure highlights two important points .  First, t he amplitude of the unemployment \nrate is currently quite high, as it was during the financial crisis of 2007 -2008 .  The second  point  \nworth noting is that the area on the chart where unemployment is above  the so -called full \nemployment  level  has been much la rger than the area involving unemployment below  the \nestimate of full employment.5  Part of the reason for this asymmetry is that much of the history \nof this sample reflected a disinflation ary trend  – inflation fell consistently from 1980 to 2004.  \nSeveral of th e instances  where the unemployment  rate bounced back up sharply were  recessions , \nresult ing from  attempts to control inflation.  But policymakers also cannot control the dynamics \nof the economy  all that precisely.  Thus, imbalances in one direction , say exceeding full \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 6  \n employment to the point of excessively tight labor markets, tend to  result in a bounce back in \nunemployment above the natural rate.   \nIf policymakers  want to achieve  maximum sustainable employment, in my view the focus \nshould be less on pushing the economy well below full employment – which  helps produce  \nimbalances in the economy  that could also  affect  the severity of  the next recession .   \nSome imbalances are worse th an others.  Note  that in the recovery from the Financial \nCrisis and Great Recession , the U.S.  saw just over nine years  with the unemployment  rate above \nthe full employment  level , but just over three  years  of an unemployment rate  below its natural \nrate.  Instead  of pushing the unemployment rate below its natural rate , the focus should be  on \navoid ing the subsequent large spikes of unemployment and slow recovery that occur when the \ndownturn is  made worse by a lead -up that involv es excessive risk -taking  and the associated \nimbalances, both real and financial .6   \nAn additional  important factor in the severity of a downturn is the policy response.  \nFortunately, in the United States the initial policy response  to COVID -19 by monetary and fiscal \npolicymakers  was prompt and substantial.7  Unlike the beginning s of some  recession s when it  is \ninitially unclear whether the economy is in a downturn at the outset , the rapid increase in the  \nCOVID -19 virus, the economic shutdowns, and the sharp decline in asset prices made it \nimmediately clear to policymakers that swift action  was needed .   \nFiscal policy makers  moved quite quickly by historical standards in the U .S., with support \nfocused on small busin esses and low - and moderate -income workers.  Monetary policy was also \nimplemented  promptly .  In March,  the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to between \n0 and 25 basis points ( Figure 4 ) and began asset purchases ( Figure 5 ).  And a series of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 7  \n emergency lending facilities were announced that were designed  to stabilize financial markets \nand provide support for businesses.  This swift  action by policymakers has been critical to the \nimprovements in the economy  so far.  Now, with a se cond wave of infections  underway , my \nsense is that  more fiscal and monetary accommodation is appropriate.  \n \nFinancial Fragility  \nAnother  factor shaping the severity of this recession  – in other words, the severity of the \nconsequences of the pandemic shock – is how fragile , or susceptible to financial instability , the \neconomy was prior to the shock.  How well prepared were firms, households, and financial \ninstitutions for a so-called  tail event?  In the interest of time, t oday I will look  specifically  at the \npreparedness of firms.   \nAn examination of  payroll employment  by industry shows firms whose business  requir es \nsocial interaction continue to be  badly disrupted by the pandemic.  Figure 6  shows that retail, \narts and entertainment, restaurants, and hotels have all been severely  impacted.  While payroll \nemployment declined in these industries during the past recession, payroll employment declined \nmuch more substantially with the pandemic and remains well below levels from the previous \nyear.  \nThe large and enduring weakness in these sectors has other costs besides the loss of jobs \nin the short run.  Figure 7  shows a list of publicly traded firms in the  consumer discretionary \nspace that have defaulted on debt  (and/or filed for bankruptcy) in 2020 .8  Two observations stand \nout.  First, most of these firms had elevated leverage , as evidenced  by their most recently \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 8  \n reported , pre-pandemic , debt to earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization  \n(EBITDA ) ratios being quite elevated.  In fact, most of the firms had debt  to EBITDA  too high to \nqualify for support through the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending  Program , a lending \nfacility designed to aid troubled firm s impacted by COVID -19, which requires a debt-to-\nEBITDA  ratio under six for collateralized loans.9  The s econd  observation is that these firms are \n“labor  intensive. ”  The consumer discretionary  sector accounts for significant employment, much \nof it relatively low -wage workers.   And, of course , bankruptcies tend to make temporarily \nunemployed workers into longer-term unemployed workers.  \nIt is important to note when  the high level of debt was incu rred.  If it was incurred right \nbefore the shock, the appropriate financial stability approach may be different than if it was \nincurred much earlier in the recovery.  Put another way, h ow has leverage in the corporate sector \nevolved over the years amid the  low interest rate environment, and what are the potential \nramifications of this trend?  This is an important question, which I will discuss next with some \npreliminary observations .   \nFigure 8  shows the median debt -to-EBITDA  ratio for (mostly publicly traded ) firms in \nthe consumer discretionary sector that defaulted (and/or filed for bankruptcy) in 2020 and those \nthat did not.  Interestingly, through 201 3 the median debt  to EBITDA  was around or below two \ntimes for the defaulted and the non -defaulted firms.  However, during the recovery period the \nmedian debt leverage of defaulted firms rose quite sharply, reaching  more than  eight  times  right \nbefore the recession  – while the non -defaulted firms had only a mild increased reliance on debt.  \nThe debt -to-EBITDA  measure can be affected  by firms with very low profitability.  \nFigure 9  shows the capacity to service debt had become impaired at defaulted firms, and Figure \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 9  \n 10 shows that the debt -to-assets ratio, another measure of leverage,  began rising sharp ly in 2011.  \nAs a result, when the recovery had started , but interest rates were low, the firms that eventually \ndefaulted issued much more debt, and this increased leverage appears to have affected  their \nability to survive the pandemic  downturn .10 \n \nThe Impact of Excessive Risk-Taking  \nAs I discussed in a recent speech, t he financial pressures associated with excessive risk -\ntaking  behavior build gradually, and  usually  only become clear in the next economic downturn.  \nWhen the ensuing recession occurs  – often suddenly  – and more severe recessionary dynamics \ntake over, sadly the impact tends to be greatest on workers and firms that are least able to adjust \nand adapt.11      \nIndeed, for t he aforementioned defaulted firms , again, focused on the consumer \ndiscretionary sector, the debt began to rise about eight  years before the shock.  If the results  \nharmed  only shareholders, one could argue that they should be free to take that risk.  However, \nthe fact is that customers, supp liers, and employees are also hurt by risk -taking behavior .  Today, \nI will focus on the impact on employees.   \nFigure  11 shows the demographics of firms in the service sector.  A ratio above one \nindicates that the demographic group is overrepresented in that industry relative to its share in \nthe workforce.  Looking at the first row, women are overrepresented in the service s ector, \nrelative to their share in the work force .  Women are overrepresented in retail as well as in \nleisure and hospitality.  Note that Black  or African American workers , Hispanic or Latino  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 10  \n worker s, and  those workers between the ages 16 -24 years are over-represented in leisure and \nhospitality as well.   \nIn a bankruptcy situation, there normally is a reduction in workforce, and if it becomes a \nfirm closure , the employee ’s connection to the employer is severed.  As a result, a significant \nnumber of workers i n defaulted firms are likely to lose their job s, and when many firms in the \nindustry are simultaneously filing for bankruptcy, their ability to find work in the same industry  \nwill be  difficult.  \nDuring the pandemic, w omen and minorit ies may not only be disproportionately \nimpacted by excessive risk -taking by these firms, but they are more likely to leave the workforce \naltogether.  Figure 1 2 shows that the labor force participation rate for prime working -age women \nhad fallen sharply again in recent  months  and is well below the level at the beginning of the year.  \nOctober saw a slight  uptick in participation rates for both working -age men and women.  Figure \n13 shows that minorities also have  seen a large decline in labor force participation , relative to the \nbeginning of the year and relative to white  workers .  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn summary and conclusion, I would reiterate that shocks happen , but certain factors \nmake them worse .  While the m onetary and fiscal policy response  in the United States  has been \nan important economic mitigant to problems generated by the pandemic  since the onset this \nspring , excessive risk -taking during the previous recovery period is , unfortunately,  likely to \nprolong the country’s economic distress  – especially for those most disproportionately affected .    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A. M. U.S. Eastern Time  (3:10 P.M. GMT ) on Tuesday , November 10 , 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n 11  \n Financial factors , including excessive leverage,  can influence how severe the \nconsequences of a shock will be, and how painful a recession become s.  Imbalances in the real \neconomy and financial factors accelerating  recession dynamics can make the effects of a shock \nand the severity of a recession  much worse .  Today , I have focused on the excessive risk -taking \nof some firms in the consumer discretio nary sector.  However, imbalances in the household and \nfinancial sector have often been problematic, as well – particularly in the Financial Crisis and \nGreat Recession . \nThese observations have policy implications.  In Europe  and Asia , many countries have a \ngovernance structure able to focus on the financial stability imbalances that are occurring in their \neconom ies, and those countries have tools to try to prevent the bui ldup of excessive risk.  No \nsuch structure or tools are available in the U .S.  This is a problem , both now and for future \neconomic downturns.  \nWith many central banks focused on keeping interest  rates low for an extended period to \nachieve their mandates  – for example in the last recovery – it is particularly important to watch  \nfor reach ing-for-yield behavior and excessive risk -taking.  Easy monetary policy requires more \nguardrails  protecting against rising financial stability  risks .  Without financial stability \ngovernance and tools, recessions have the potential to be more severe and  fall disproportionately \non those that can least afford it.   And t he recessions are likely to be deeper and longer , requir ing \nmore fiscal and monetary stimulus than would otherwise be necessary .   \nIn sum: We need to place more attention on the severity  of outcomes in recessions, which \nare made worse if we cannot or will not take action against emerging imbalances.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL  \n10:10 A.

Rosengren, entitled: The Main Street Lending Program \nand Other Federal Reserve Actions .  \n \n8 It is worth noting, as I have in prior talks, that the traditional retail sector writ large has been challenged prior to \nCOVID -19, due in part to the rise of online retail and firms like Amazon.com.  \n \n9 For mor e on the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, see https://www.bostonfed.org/mslp .  \n \n10 These analysis are descriptive and, therefore, do not suggest causality, nor control for firm -specific characteri stics.  \nAs previously noted, the analysis is preliminary and based on work being conducted by FRB Boston staff.  \n \n11 And if workers and firms are less able to adjust and adapt, that makes the recession more severe.
