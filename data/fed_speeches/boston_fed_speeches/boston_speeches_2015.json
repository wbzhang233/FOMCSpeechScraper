Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today.   It is a great \npleasure to be in Newport  County  to talk about the economic outlook.  In September, Rhode \nIsland had an unemployme nt rate of 5.4 percent , only a bit above the national average.  This \nrepresent s a really  remarkable improvement,  given that the  state was among the hardest hit \nduring the Great Recession  – unemployment peaked at 11.3 percent in Rhode Island in mid-\n2009.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among the states, Rhode Island had the \nlargest decline in the unemployment rate from September 2014, at 1.8 percentage points.1\n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 \n Looking regionally , in September two New England states – New Hampshire and \nVermont – had unemployment rates below 4 percent , and two other New England states – \nMassachusetts and Maine – had unemployment rates below 4.8 percent, which is my current \nestimate for the “ full employment ” level  for the nation  as a wh ole.   \nThe employment report for  October , released last Friday , held very good news.  \nNation ally, the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent.  In addition, payroll employment grew by \n271,000 jobs in October , and over the past three months payroll employment growth has \naveraged 187,000 jobs per month.  Clearly, we are seeing continued improvement in labor \nmarkets and a further reduction in the remaining labor market slack.   \n Given the positive labor -market new s – in Rhode Island, in New England, and nationally  \n– it is reasonable  to ask whether t he degree of monetary stimulus being provided by the Federal \nReserve is still necessary .  The question is especially relevant  as many parts of the country return \nto pre -recession unemployment rates.    \n As I explore that question with you today, I would note as I always do that the views I \nwill express are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board \nof Governors or on the Federal Open Mark et Committee (FOMC).  \nAt the September monetary policy meeting of the FOMC, the Committee  chose not to \nraise short -term rates.  In my view, that was a prudent decision , based on manag ing risks and  \nconcerns.  In the second half of August, problems in some emerging -market  countrie s were \nunsett ling global financial markets  – and it was unclear what the duration of those difficulties  \nwould be , and the likely extent of the spillover to more developed economies .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n Fortunately, the worst of those c oncerns have not materialized. Many stock markets have \nimproved from August, and more importantly, domestic spending  in the U.S.  does not seem  to \nhave slowed significantly as a result of those earlier concerns ; and firms are continuing to hire \nadditional w orkers . \n After the October monetary policy meeting, the FOMC statement2 noted  that we are , of \ncourse,  still monitoring global economic and financial developments .  It went on to say that “it \nwill be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when [the Committee ] has \nseen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will \nmove back to its 2 percent objective over the medi um term.”  In more  colloquial  terms , I would \nsay if we see  continued gradual improvement in the U .S. economy , it will be appropriate to \ngradually increase short -term rates .  \nOctober’s  statement explicitly mentioned the possibility that the first move could  occur as \nsoon as the next meeting , in December , by saying : “In determining whether it will be appropriate \nto raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress  – both realized \nand expected  – toward its objectives of maximum emp loyment and 2 percent inflation. ”  I would \nhighlight that the data received recently have been positive, reflecting real improvement for the \neconomy.  \nToday , I would like to review some of th e current economic data and in doing so, \ndescribe why I am quite s upportive of the position taken by the FOMC at the last meeting.  \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n Recent Economic Data  \n Many headlines have focused on real GDP growing at only 1.5 percent  in the third \nquarter .  However,  I would like to share with you a measure that focuses on domestic demand  – \nreal final sales to domestic purchasers , which is shown in Figure  1.  This statistic is similar to \nGDP , but excludes  fluctuations in  inventories  and net exports .  This leaves consumption, \ninvestment , and government spending  – in sum,  a measure that tries to capture the underlying \nstrength in domestic demand.  In the third quarter  of this year,  real final sales to domestic \npurchasers grew by 2.9 percent , follow ing its second -quarter growth of 3.7 percent . \n In part, this indicator of mo re robust growth reflects the strength of consumer spending , \nshown in Figure 2.   Consumer spending has been boosted by the continued gradual \nimprovement in labor markets, lower gasoline prices , and  the relative strength in housing prices \nand stock prices , which  have improved household net worth.   \nImportantly, the strength in the third quarter in this measure of domestic demand suggests \nthat the U.S. was  little affected by the problems in emerging markets , or by the resulting \nfinancial -market turbulence.   With little collateral damage evident from external sources, I \nexpect domestic demand to continue to support  the economy .  This should  help to offset any \npotential weakness of some  of our trading partners and the strength of the dollar , which  of course  \nmakes it more difficult for U .S. exporters to compete internationally.       \n As long as domestic growth can offset any weak ness in  net exports, the economy should \ncontinue to grow somewhat above the level one would consider its “ potential ,” a growth rate that \nI estimate to be somewhat below 2  percent  today.  Growth above that rate should place downward \npressure on unemployment rates.  Recent evidence confirms this assessment: d espite real GDP \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n grow th averaging only 2.1 percent since the beginn ing of the recovery, both the widely reported  \nU-3 measure of unemployment and the broader U -6 measure of unemployment have fallen quite \nquickly , as shown in Figure 3  (the U -6 measure of unemployment adds persons marginally \nattached to the labor force, plus those part time for economic reasons) .   \nHow much further  the unemployment rate can fall  without risking a significant rise in \ninflation above  the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target depends on one’s  estimate of the \nunemployment rate that is consistent with full employment.  Figure 4  shows the Federal Reserve \npolicymakers’ Summary of Economic Projections – the “ SEP” – forecast for the unemployment \nrate through 2018 .3  The median among all policymakers’ projections is shown a s the solid line, \nstarting at 5  percent  and falling to 4.8  percent .  In addition , the chart provides the estimates by \nFOMC participants o f where longer-run unemployment is likely to be  – which is a good proxy \nfor their estimates of the unemployment rate consistent with full employment .   \nThe area between the  dashed  lines contains  the range of estimates, which is fairly wide – \nfrom a low of 4.7 percent to a high of 5.8 percent.  The central tendency  (which excludes the \nhighest and lowest three estimates of longer -run unemployment)  ranges from 4 .9 to 5.2 percent , \nand is shaded .  Given those numbers, the 5.0 percent unemployment rate for the U -3 measure is \nalready squarely within the Fed policymakers’ central tendency for longer-run unemployment.  \nAt the Boston Fed, our estimate of unemployment in the long run is 4.8  percent .  While that is  \njust below the SEP central tendency, it is only 0. 2 percent below the current rate.   \n Once we have reached the 2 percent inflation  target  and the natural rate of \nunemployment , we should have normalized interest rates.  So one way the unemployment rate  \nstops declining and  levels off is if the Federal Reserve begins normaliz ing interest rates during \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n the recovery , as the current extent of monetary accommodation becomes no longer necessary to \nreach the long-term goals.  \n Figure 5  provides the real federal funds rate, measured  as the federal funds rate minus \nthe inflation rate (with inflation  measured by core PCE ).4  The real rate is important for spending \nand investment decisions.  The past three recessions are shaded.  \nNot surprisingly, the Federal Reserve generally reduces short -term interest rates during a \nrecession and the early stages of a recovery.  While the real federal funds rate did not become \nnegative during the 1990 recession, it did become negative just after the close of the 200 1 \nrecession. What is more unusual is how long the real federal funds rate has remained negative  in \nthe aftermath of t he most recent recession .  After more than six years of recovery, the real federal \nfunds rate still remains negative , to a greater extent  than in either of the previous two recessions . \n Figure 6  plots the real federal funds rate relative to the U -3 unemployment rate.  The red \ndot highlights the October  unemployment rate of 5. 0 percent , and a n October  real federal funds \nrate of negative 1.2 percent.  In addition, the chart separates – by color – observations from \nbefore monetary policy reached the zero lower bound (in December of 2008) , and after.  The \nbulk of negative real interest rate observations occur when the unemployment rate is quite high.   \nMore generally, when the unemployment rate is as low as it is now , you normally see positive \nrather than negative real federal funds rates.   \nFigure 7  shows  the real federal funds rate relative to core PCE inflation .  Again, the chart \nuses color to separate the observations from before and after monetary  policy reached the zero \nlower bound.  As the chart shows, t he cluster of negative real interest rates reflects the period \nwhen monetary policy  hit the zero lower bound.   Since the nominal federal funds effective rate is \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n near zero, the movement of the real interest rate once the zero lower bound was hit only reflects \nvariation in the core PCE inflation rate.  While there are limited observations of the core PCE \ninflation rate being this low, there are observations of a higher real federal funds rate  when \ninflation is approximately as low as it is currently.  This highlights that monetary policy remains \nquite accommodative  by historical standards , even while the PCE inflation rate remains low , \nrelative to our target.  \n To that end, Figure 8  shows several possible paths for short -term interest rates .  One path \nillustrates  what might occur  if we were to increase the funds rate by  25 basis point s at each \nFOMC meeting (as we did in the recovery from the 200 1 recession ) until the rate reaches the \nSEP longer -run projection .  Another path depicts the Fed policymakers’  September SEP, and a \nthird path represents market expectations, implied by federal funds rate futures .  The latter two \nboth would suggest  that this is likely to be a much more gradual normalization process than th e \none that  followed the 2001 recession .  Given persistently low wage and price pressures , and the \nrelatively slow real GDP growth forecast in the SEP shown in Figure  9, a more gradual path of \nnormalization may be necessary to ensure reaching the 2 percent inflation target.    \nThere are other potential advantages to a gradual removal of accommodation.  First, a \nslower path will provide more time to analyze the effectivene ss of monetary policy tightening \ntools.  Were the Committee  to wait longer  to begin , and then need to potentially move rates more \nrapidly , we might have less flexibility to assess the effectiveness of some of our new tools . \nA second benefit of a gradual removal of accommodation is that it would provide more \ntime to analyze how the tightening is affecting the real economy.  Given that there is significant \nuncertainty about the level of interest rates that would stabilize  inflation or unemployment  – and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n also uncertainty about the federal funds rate that would reflect fully normalized policy  – a slower \npace reduces the risk that the Committee  takes more or less aggressive action than needed or \nintended.    \nGiven the uncertainties  surrounding the degree of accommodation that is necessary to \nachieve 2 percent  inflation and full employment, I prefer a path that involves only gradual \nincreases in interest rates and that essentially probes how tight labor markets can be , consistent \nwith our  2 percent  inflation target.  \n \nFinancial Stability Considerations  \nWhen the U.S. economy was  significantly missing on the Federal Reserve’s  employment \nand inflation  goals , monetary policy was appropriately calibrated to provide considerable \nstimulus,  so as to  return the economy to  its desired, normal state.   However, as the economy \nattains a more desirable balance of full employment with 2 percent inflation , financial stability \nissues  that imply  risks to future economic balance should receive increased  weight.   \nOne potential cost of maintaining the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound  for a long \ntime is that it may incent behavior that would be discouraged in a  more normalized interest rate \nenvironment.  Looking forward, a  potential risk  of a low -interest rate environment is that \ninvestors seeking a higher return may take on too much  risk in order to improve returns, perhaps \nnot fully taking into account the higher risk that normally accompanies higher yields.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n Early signs of this “ search for yield ” may be showing up in  the commercial real estate  \nmarket .  Figure 10  shows the path of commercial real estate prices , which  have grown quite \nrapidly, despite the only modest growth in real GDP over the recovery.   \nWhile Figure 10  reflects b road regional trends, in some more localized markets \ncommercial real estate activity has been even more robust.  A qualitative indicator in a major city \nis a simple crane count .  When the number of cranes observed on a short walk in a city  such as \nBoston  reaches double digits, as is the case today, it is worth reflecting on the sustainability of \nsuch growth.   Particularly given the role that commercial real estate played in the economic \ndownturn in New England during the late 1980s, th e trend in commercial real estate prices \nshould be thoughtfully monitored.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion , I would note that l abor markets have improved over the past \nyear, and we are at  – or fast approaching  – rates of unemployment  that many economists \nestimate to be consistent with full employment.  As long as the economy is growing somewhat \nabove potential, I am reasonably confident we will return to our 2 percent inflation target and to \nmy estimate of full employment.  \nAs the October FOMC statement indicated, all future Committee  meetings  – including \nDecember ’s – could be an appropriate time for raising rates , as long as the economy continues to \nimprove as expected.  However, with inflation still below the target , I believe the path of  \nincreases should be gradual , once we do move off the zero lower bound .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M.

Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. It is a great time to \nbe speaking at  the Forecasters Club of N ew York, as the path of monetary policy is importantly \ntied to policymakers’  forecast s for the economy and our confidence in those forecast s.   \nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my own, \nnot necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  \n\n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n2 \n The July FOMC statementi provided two conditions  related to  when raising  the target \nrange for the federal funds rate will be appropriate.  First, the statement indicated the committee  \nneed ed to see “some further improvement in the labor market. ”  In my own view, this condition \nhas largely been met by the continued growth in payroll employment – averaging in excess of \n200,000 jobs per month , year-to-date through July , and a U -3 unemployment rate – the typical, \nwidely reported measure of unemployment – that is currently at 5.3 percent.  \nThe second condition noted in the statement was that policymakers  must be “reasonab ly \nconfiden t that [PCE] inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over t he medium term .”  \nFor this condition , the data have not been as clear -cut.  Core PCE inflation for the past year has \nonly been 1. 2 percent, and recently there have been substantial declines in oil prices and other \ncommodity prices.  These  will likely feed into core (and headline) measures of inflation for some \nmonths to come, temporarily lowering inflation  readings.  Adding to this , recent reports on \nwages and salaries still show few signs that the tightening labor market s are translating to \nincreases in  wages and salaries consistent with reaching 2 percent inflation.  \nAs a result, current data have yet to indicate that this second condition will be met in the \ncoming months ; instead , policymakers  will need to rely on forecasts of inflation.  Unfortunately, \nover t he past several years most forecast s have , incorrectly , predicted  that inflation will r eturn to \n2 percent  – you might say the incoming data have not cooperated  with the forecasts .  A \ncombi nation of positive supply shocks, the presence of more labor market slack than is captured \nby U -3 unemployment  readings , and weaker global conditions have no doubt contributed to these \nforecast errors.  Nonetheless, one might still be somewhat confident that we will reach 2 percent \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n3 \n PCE inflation if one sees  the U .S. economy  as likely to continue  grow ing above its potential , \nwhich would further  improv e labor market conditions .   \nIn effect, then, my view of the forecast for higher inflation rests largely on whether I \nthink the economy will continue to experience growth  above potential , and whether the \nsubsequent declining labor market slack will be  sufficient to raise my confidence  that inflation  \nwill return to 2 percent in a reasonable time frame.   \nSuch a forecast needs to be mindful of recent developments, including data that suggest  \nthe slowing of foreign economies , coupled with volatile  stock prices and falling commodity \nprices  – both of which  are consistent with a weaker global economy.  In my view, t hese \ndevelopments might suggest a downward revision  in the forecast  that is large enough  to raise \nconcerns about whether further tightening of labor markets is likely.  And without an expectation \nof growth above potential and further tightening of labor markets , I would lose my primary \nrationale for a forecast of rising inflation, diminishing my confiden ce that inflation will reach the \n2 percent target within a reasonable time frame.  Indications of a  much weaker global economy \nwould at least increase the uncertainty surrounding  policymakers’  economic growth and  inflation \nforecast s. \nThe focus of my talk today will be less about  the precise timing of an FOMC  move  on \ninterest rates , and more about the likely trajectory of monetary policy.  W hile market attention \nhas focused on the exact timing of potential rate rises , macroeconomic models of the economy \noverwhelmingly suggest  little impact on the broader economic landscape from moving the \ntiming of initial interest rate  hikes forward  or back ward  by a couple of month s.  However, the  \nfuture trajectory  of interest rate  increase s – that is , whether increases to more normaliz ed levels  \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n4 \n occur quickly or more gradually  – is, by cont rast, likely to have a meaningful impact  on \nemployment and inflation . \nToday I will argue that there are very good reasons to expect a much more gradual \nnormalization process than occurred in the previous two tightening cycles.  Importantly, t his is \nnot just my view ; the Summary of Economic Projections – the “SEP” – released  after the June \nFOMC  meeting , which incorporates the federal funds rate expectations for all the FOMC \nparticipants assuming appropriate monetary policy, indicates that Federal Reserve policymakers  \nexpect a gradual  tightening cycle.ii  My presentation  today  will, I believe,  illustrate  why this \nmore modest tightening path is both necessary and appropriate . \n \nRecent Tightening Cycles  \n Figure 1  shows the effective federal funds rate over time, highlighting the six months \nbefore and after the initial commencement of a tightening cycle .  In the past two cycles of \ntightening , the effective federal funds rate increased rapidly.  Just prior to tightening , in January \n1994 , for example,  the federal funds rate was about  3 percent but one year later was 5.5 percent, \nan increase of almost 250 basis points in that time .  In the most recent tightening cycle that began \nin June 2004, th e FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of the next eight \nmeeting s, thus totaling 200 basis points in th e first year following the commencement of the \ntightening cycle.  The figure also shows three dots  to illustrate the expected path as indicated  in \nthe June SEP.    \n This implied path of the SEP, illustrated more closely in Figure 2 , is much slower  than \nthe path taken in 2004 , with the federal funds rate increasing at roughly half the pace of th at \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n5 \n tightening episode .  This significantly slower pace reflects that linger ing headwinds resonating \nfrom the financial crisis, an d continued low inflation rates  both here and abroad, likely require a \ndifferent path of tightening.   \n  \nThis Time is Different  \n Figure 3  shows the inflation rate as measured by the core PCE index.  At the beginning  \nof the 1994 tightening cycle , core inflation was somewhat above 2 percent.  At the initiation of \nthe 2004 tightening cycle , core PCE inflation was almost at 2 percent ; shortly a fter the \ntightening , it averaged slightly  above 2 percent.  In contrast, we are currently well below the 2 \npercent target, with the core PCE index having risen  only 1.2 percent  over the past year . While \nthe SEP indicates that core PCE inflation is expected to gradually rise to 2 percent, it is only \nslowly converging to this point , and similar forecasts made over the past two year s have not been \nborne out by incoming data .  Such a modest path to  achieving  the 2 percent inflation target in my \nview provides  Fed policymakers  the latitude to more gradually raise rates as we become more \nconfident that the trajectory of  our inflation forecast is likely to be realized.  \n Figure 4  shows the growth in real GDP , with shading around the commencement of \ntightening cycles .  In the first quarter of 1994 , when the tightening cycle was beginning, real \nGDP over the previous year averaged 3.4 percent.  At the start of the 2004 tightening cycle , real \nGDP growth over the p revious year was 4.2 percent .  In contrast, over the p ast four quarters, real \nGDP has averaged only 2.7  percent.  While  it is true that potential growth has slowed recently, \nhow large and enduring this slowdown will prove to be  is still unknown.   Furthermore, real GDP \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n6 \n growth as forecast in the SEP is likely to remain below 3 percent – slower than what was \nencountered in previous tightening cycles.   \n Figure 5  highlights  the unemployment rate , with shading around  the beginning  of the \ntightening cycl es.  In January 1994  (as well as in the first quarter of 1994 as a whole) , the \nunemployment rate was 6.6 percent.  In the second quarter of  2004 the unemployment rate was \n5.6 percent.  Today, however, at 5.3 percent unemployment in July , we are well below the rate \nthat preceded  the past two tightening cycles, although  the SEP expects only a gradual \nconvergence in unem ployment to  5 percent.   \n So, b y the U -3 measure of unemployment , the commencement of tightening might on the \nsurface seem to be a bit late.  However, as shown in Figure 6 , using  a broader definition of \nunemployment  – known as  the U-6 – which includes workers who are working part time for \neconomic reasons and workers who are marginally attached to the workforce , a somewhat \ndifferent picture emerges.  In the first quarter of 1994, the U -6 rate was 11.5 percent; in the \nsecond quarter of 2004 it was only 9.6 percent.  With the current U -6 unemployment rate of 10.7 \npercent in the second quarter of 2015, and more rec ently 10.4 percent in July, we are between the \ntwo U -6 rates from the last two tightening  episode s.   \nOne interpretation of the data could be that the lack of inflation we are seeing to date may \nreflect that the degree of slack in the labor market is only imperfectly measured by U -3, which \nwould help account for the weak inflation and relatively modest increases we have seen in \nwages.  If one believes the broader measure of unemployment better captures slack in the \neconomy, then labor markets would not be viewed as unusually tight for commencing the \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M.

This potential additional slack would also be a reason for policymakers to \nfollow a more modest interest rate path a t the begin ning of a  tightening cycle.  \n \nAnticipation of this Tightening C ycle \n Figure  7 shows the two -year Treasury rate , with the commencement of tightening  \nhighlighted .  Since most of the increase  in the federal funds rate usually  occurs in the first two \nyears  of earlier  tightening cycles , as the figure shows, then movement in the two-year rate should \ncapture the market ’s anticipation of how quickly interest rates are likely to rise.  In both 1994 \nand 2004 , for example,  there was some modest increase in the two-year rate prior to the \ntightening , but substantially higher rates en sued once the first tightening had occurred.  \nToday, w ith the periodic publication of the SEP and a greater emphasis on \ncommunication  by the Federal Reserve , there has been significant marketplace discussion of the \nlikelihood of rates rising by the end of 2015.   Not surprisingly, the two -year rate has increased \ngradually as the prospect of a tightening cycle has become more likely .  A complicating factor is \nthe flight to quality that occurs with disturbances abroad ; problems in Greece and China have \nprobably encouraged some movement into Treasury securities.  However , the modest \nmovements to date seem consistent with investors expecting a gradual pace to the tightening.  \n In my own view, given current and forecast  condition s, not only is the pace likely to be \ngradual, but the federal funds rate in the longer run may be lower than in previous tightening \ncycles.  Figure 8  compares the federal funds rate three years after the first tightening in previous \ncycles to the fed eral funds rate in the long er run, according to the June SEP .iii  The median SEP \nestimate of the federal funds rate in the long er run is 3.75  percent , well below the rates seen three \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n \n \n8 \n years after the commencement of tightening in earlier tightening cycles.  A much lower endpoint \nand a gradual tightening path are , in fact,  consistent with the only modest increase in the two-\nyear rate to date.   \n The results of July’ s Survey of Primary Dealersiv offer a nother indication that many \nmarket participants believe  this will be a more gradual tightening cycle .  Figure 9  shows the  \nmidpoint  estimates of the primary dealer survey for the federal funds range compared  with the \nestimates provided by FOMC participants in the SEP.  The primary dealer response s show that \ntheir forecast for the path of the federal funds rate is not significantly different than what was \nprovided by FOMC participants in the June SEP  – both expect that the tightening path this time \nwill be gradual and is likely to stop at a lower rate than in pre vious cycles.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, t his period of tightening is likely to differ from the two \nprevious tightening cycles  in that inflation is low and real GDP growth is slower than in 1994 \nand 2004, respectively.  While U-3 unemployment is lower  now than at the outset of the se earlier  \ntightening cycle s, the broader measure – U-6 unemployment  – is not particularly low compared \nto the start of the prior  two c ycles.   \nThe results of  the primary dealer survey and the most recent SEP provide  further \nevidence that this cycle of tightening is expected  to be more gradual and stop at a lower federal \nfunds rate.   \n\n \n* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1: 10 P.M.

The very low inflation rates here and \nabroad make it a particularly good time to not be too tied to imprecise measures of full \nemployment.    \nOf course, g iven the low wage and price inflation  data seen to date, and increased \nuncertainty about global growth, it will be particularly important for monetary policy makers  to \nclosely monitor and depend on incoming data . \nThank you.  \n                                                           \n \ni See the statement at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150729a.htm . \n \nii See the June SEP material at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150617.pdf  \n \niii For historical context, the longer -run federal funds rate could be measured by the average over a long time period, \nsuch as from the first quarter of 1992 to the third quarter of 2008  – 4 percent  – or from the first quarter of 1985 to \nthe third quarter of 2008  – 5 percent .  \n \niv The New York Fed’s Markets Group surveys primary dealers on their  expectations for the economy, monetary \npolicy, and financial market developments prior to Federal Open Market Committee meetings.

Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today.  I look \nforward to the exchange of views and analysis that are hallmarks of these gatherings.  \nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors \nor on t he Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC ). \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 2 As the U.S. economy approaches conditions that are consistent with beginning the \nprocess of normalizing monetary policy, it is not surprising that financial market \nparticipants would prefer simple and unqualified statements about the future path of \nmonetar y policy.  However, appropriate policy necessarily depends on our forecast of the \neconomy’s path in coming months, and that path is always somewhat uncertain.  Events \nthat are unfolding  of late  exemplify the difficulties often face d in making economic \nforecasts.  These events and uncertainties also reinforce the prudence of adhering to the \nnotion of “data dependence” in making monetary policy decisions.  \nOne significant area of uncertainty in the current forecast centers on inflation: \nwhy have we not yet see n inflation clearly returning to the 2 percent target?1  The Federal \nReserve policymakers’ forecasts in the June Summary of Economic Projections2 – the \n“SEP” – predict that core inflation will return to 2 percent, but that has been the case for \nearlier SEP forecasts as well and, as yet, the data on core inflation have remained \nsurprisingly weak, even as labor markets have improved.  In addition, recent international \nevents highlight that the future path of energy prices and the dollar remain quite \nuncertain.   \nA second area of uncertainty stems from events – often difficult to predict – \nwhich domestic monetary policy cannot influence.  The unfolding events in Greece \nprovide an obvious current example .  The emergence in recent weeks of questions abou t \nwhether Greece and its creditors can reach a viable a greement complicate s projections \nabout how economic conditions are likely to unfold over the course of the summer and \nbeyond.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 3 To be clear, while these negative developments have been intensely painfu l for \nthe Greek people, to date it is not obvious that these events will significantly alter the \nexpected path of the U.S. economy.  But they have surely added to the uncertainty  \naround  that forecast.   I will offer my own perspective on that situation in a  few moments.  \nWere the U.S. economy to unfold as I and other policymakers expect ed in our \nJune SEP forecasts, beginning the policy normalization process later this year might be \nappropriate.  However, the assumption that our current forecasts for labor mar kets and for \ninflation will unfold as expected is still subject to considerable uncertainty, a topic to \nwhich I will now turn.  \n \nDomestic Uncertainty  \nThe evolution of the domestic economy remains somewhat concern ing.  Perhaps \nmost troubling is th e fact th at inflation persists in remain ing well below the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent target.  Inflation rates that are too low limit monetary policy’s ability \nto offset the disturbances that often  buffet an economy.  Hence, one of the conditions that \nthe FOMC sti pulated for beginning to raise short -term rates is that the Committee should \nbe reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the \nmedium term.3  Notably,  the undershooting  of inflation targets has been a problem in \nmany  developed countries, with Japan and Europe significantly undershooting their \ntargets as well.  \nFigure 1  shows how the forecasts of inflation by FOMC participants have fallen \nover the last three years.  The figure provides prediction s, made at various times , of core \nPCE inflation for the fourth quarter of 2015.  What you see is the so -called central \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 4 tendency of those forecasts, which excludes the three highest and the three lowest \nforecasts.  In late 2012 and early  2013, the forecasts for inflation in 2015 w ere closely \nbunched around our 2 percent inflation target.  However , as time has progressed, the SEP \nforecasts have reflected increasing pessimism that we will reach the 2 percent inflation \ngoal in 2015.  Over the last year, core PCE inflation has been onl y 1.2 percent, and the \nJune SEP forecasts for inflation in the fourth quarter of this year had a central tendency of \njust 1.3 to 1.4 percent.   \nOne reason the inflation rate may be so subdued is that significant slack – that is, \nexcess supply – may remain in the labor market despite the simplest and most widely -\nreported unemployment rate having fallen to 5.3 percent.  An example of potential slack \nin the labor market appears in Figure 2 , which shows a steep drop in the percent of the \npopulation in the U.S. that is employed.  This employment -to-population ratio declined \nsignificantly during the last recession and has only marginally improved during the \nrecovery.  \nHowever, some of this decline is the result of a significant demographic change \noccurring in the w orkforce.  Failure to take this demographic change into account would \nresult in an overestimation of the potential slack in the labor market.  A close \nexamination of Figure 3  shows just how dramatic the age -related demographic shift has \nbeen in the populat ion over the last two decades.  By 2014, the percentage of the \npopulation in the three younger age groups had fallen relative to 1994, while the \npercentage of the population in the three older age groups had risen.  This demographic \nshift is slightly offse t by the fact that more older Americans are participating in the labor \nforce than has historically been t he case .   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 5 An interesting implication of this demographic shift is that the unemployment rate \nshould perhaps be lower at so -called “full employment.”  Younger workers tend to have \nhigher unemployment rates, since they are only beginning to acquire the skills needed by \nemployers.  Older workers tend to have very low unemployment rates if they remain in \nthe workforce.  As a result, the estimates of the une mployment rate at full employment \nneed to consider whether changes in the demographic composition of the workforce have \nan impact.   \nThis is one reason why I personally have lowered my estimate of the natural rate \nof unemployment to 5 percent, and I believ e it may need to be adjusted even lower if \ninflation continues to undershoot our forecasts.  \nFigure 4  shows the employment -to-population ratio for three of the prime -age \nworking cohorts.4  Since it is looking at narrow fixed -age groupings, its movement will  \nnot be as affected by demographic changes as would the overall employment -to-\npopulation ratio.  All three age cohorts declined significantly during the recession, and \nhave partially recovered over the past several years.  However, they also highlight that  in \neach of the age cohorts, the employment -to-population ratio remains well below levels \nseen in the decade prior to the recession.  Even if we do not fully return to the \nemployment -to-population ratios seen in the decade before the recession, we could st ill \nhave significant labor market slack to address.   \n \nUncertainty Related to Possible International Shocks  \nI would also like to provide some perspectives this morning on international \nshocks.  Given the many pressure points around the world –  Greece’s de bt crisis, China’s \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 6 slowing economy, Japan’s long -running economic challenges , and areas of geopolitical \ninstability and conflict  – we all recognize that a number of international disruptions to the \ndomestic economy are at least possible.  \nLet me say that I am currently making the assumption  that international matters  \nwill be resolved in a way that does not meaningfully alter the course of the U.S. domestic \neconomy.  However, I will also highlight the situation in Greece as an example of how \ndifficult -to-predict international events can make forecasting the future course of the \neconomy challenging .  The situation also calls for some sober reflecting on how best to \npreserve financial stability  in all parties’ interests – and to that end I will provid e a few of \nmy own perspectives in a moment.  \nRecent events in Greece have underlined the fact that the Greek people are \nenduring a very difficult era.  Figure 5  shows that the unemployment rate in Greece has \nrisen dramatically over the past several years, a nd  was over 25 percent  this spring, prior \nto the turmoil of the last few weeks.  And unfortunately  the modest d ecline in  the Greek \nunemployment rate is  not really  a particularly positive  development,  since it partly \nreflect s reductions in labor force part icipation as Greek workers have given up on looking \nfor work in th eir highly depressed labor market.  \nSome analysts and observers suggest that any problems in Greece are unlikely to \nhave a broader impact simply because of Greece’s relatively small size.   To that end,  \nFigure 6  provides some summary statistics.  Greece is indeed a small country.  With a \npopulation of 11 million people, it is small relative to the 334 million people in the Euro \nArea or the 507 million people in the European Union.  Because per capita GDP  in \nGreece is lower than in many European countries, Greek GDP is less than 2 percent of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 7 the GDP of the Euro Area or the European Union.  For an American frame of reference, \nGreece has about the same population as Ohio , and the GDP of Connecticut .   \nAs a general principal I would say that such measures can be a bit misleading \nwhen one is calibrating financial stability risks.5  The absolute size of an exposure may be \nless important than whether that exposure is diffusely held or is concentrated with \nparticular investors.  Generally speaking, disruption can be amplified  when investors are \nhighly leveraged, and when they play a c ritical role in financial market s functioning \nsmoothly . \nAt this point , much of the exposure to Greek assets has already been transferred \nfrom European banks to the  European  public sector.  In 2011, a key risk was that \ncommercial banks that were important f or the stability and functioning of the financial \nsystem  held highly leveraged exposures to Greece.  Factually speaking, t hat particular \nfinancial stability risk is diminished today, as the earlier restructuring of Greek debt \nmeans that many of the losses would be borne diffusely by European taxpayers.  And as \nyou can see in Figure 7 , the spread of peripheral countries’ 10 -year bonds over German \nbonds has been significantly less volatile recently , compared with 2011  – perhaps \nreflecting the diminution of th at risk.  \nFigure 8  shows the movement of stock prices in various countries following the \nannouncement of the Greek referendum after the close of stock markets on Friday, June \n26.  On Monday, June 29 there was a sizable impact (even though the referendum, as  \nannounced, would not decide the matter of Greece’s future participation in the Euro \nArea).  The decline in stock prices of about 2 percent in the United States, and more than \nthat in other countries, suggests the importance that market participants place on events in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 8 Greece even given its small size .  Of course, we do have the caveat that the declines \nreflect  other “news” events that may have occurred during that same time period .  \nTo date, the impact of the situation in Greece has been modest outside of G reece \nitself.  However, the financial market movements that I have highlighted suggest that, in \na world with integrated financial markets, even modest disruptions  that seem small \nrelative to the global economy  have the potential to be enhanced .  This argue s for \nthoughtful, proactive work to try to prevent  or manage  such disruptions .   \n \nPotential for Unintended Consequences  \nEvents in Europe are obviously  very fluid, but as a longtime observer of financial \nstability issues and their impact on economic participants, I will offer  my perspective.  I \nwould underline the desirability of  Greece and its creditors find ing a reasonable \ncompromise, which would not only help Greece but would avoid  some unintended  \nconsequences  for all p arties  in the Euro Area .  \nThe Euro Area had been assumed to be a permanent currency union with no \nprospect of or procedure for countries leaving to reinstat e their previous national \ncurrencies.  If that assumption eroded and  it were to becom e understood , instead,  that \ncountries could  leave the Euro Area, some of the advantages of the common currency for \nall the members would be  diminished.  Allow me to give some examples.  \n One advantage of a common currency is that it eliminates exchange -rate risk.  As \na result, transactions anywhere in the common currency area can be conducted without \nconcern that the relative currency valuation will change, eliminating the need for firms t o \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 9 hedge their exchange  rate risk.  However, if a country  were to exit the euro, firms w ould \nnot be hedged for counterparties in that country.6   \nIn essence, the common currency makes it difficult to completely hedge the “tail” \nrisk (meaning a small likelih ood, large impact  event ) of a country  leaving the euro, and \nthis applies not just to Greece.  Th e emergence of this new  dynamic  might  encourage  \nfirms and financial institutions to reduce their exposure to counterparties in some  \ncountries, or to match their  assets and liabilities by country.  All this  would  mean that \nsome of the advantages of a common currency would be  lost for all parties in the \ncurrency union . \n A second advantage of a common currency relates to inflation discipline.  Several \nof the countri es in the Euro Area did not have success controlling inflation prior to \njoining  the euro .  However, exit ing the union  would imply a risk of a sharp reduction in \nthe value of currency – essentially a large inflationary effect.  So any country with a risk \nof exit may have the potential tail risk of much higher inflation (upon exit ), and this  \nmight  discourage some firms from locating in  such countries , despite the other \nadvantages . \n A third advantage of a common currency is that capital can flow to the highest  \nreturn projects, regardless of national borders.  However, if exit becomes  perceived as \npossible, the prospect of capital controls in countries with exit potential could discourage \ninvestment.  Similarly, capital flows would be  unlikely to move as freely if there is a tail \nrisk of a large currency devaluation.  \n These are just three examples underlining the fact that exit could  have  some  \nlonger -term implications not only for Greece, but also potentially for other countries in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 10 the Euro Area.  Obviously the situation remains fluid and the next few weeks will be \nimportant.  I raise these issues in the spirit of encouraging a prudent , proactive  \nunderstanding and management of risks , and a s clear  an eye as possible  to potential \nunintended consequen ces.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn summary and conclusion, I will first state the obvious: economic forecasting is \nimportant for setting appropriate monetary policy.  Today, I have emphasized two areas \nof significant uncertainty in such forecasting.   \nDespite persistent improvement, the U.S. economy continues to undershoot the \nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target.  As the economy continues to improve, I \nexpect that inflation will begin to move closer to that target, making it appropriate to \nconsider starting to normalize monetary policy later this year.  However, as we near our \ndual mandate goals, monetary policymaking needs to be particularly data dependent.  As \nI have emphasized today, data  dependence at this point means , in my view,  that we wa it \nfor data that gives us greater confidence in our forecast, especially our forecast for \ninflation. And it also means w e wait to get a better handle on how the crisis in Greece \ngets resolved, so that we can better gauge its  potential to  impact finan cial markets and the \ndomestic economy.  \nObviously, m y hope is that both of these key risks will resolve in a way that \nsupports the Committee’s normalization criteria.   Fortunately, to date , geopolitical issues \nand concerns around the world have not signifi cantly altered the outlook for an \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 11 improving U.S. economy.   Thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.  I \nlook forward to the rest of today’s program.  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy states: “ The inflation rate \nover the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to \nspecify a longer -run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 \npercent, as measured  by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is \nmost consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate. ” \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf  \n \n2 See the June  SEP at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150617.pdf  \n \n3 See the statement at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150617a.htm  \n \n4 While looking at the employment -to-population ratio for narrow age groups significantly reduces the \neffects of demographic changes, another way to remove  the effects of demographics changes on the \nemployment -to-population ratio and to better assess its recovery from the most recent recession is to hold \nthe age mix of the population constant.   This exercise – holding the age mix of the population constant as \nof 2004 – shows that some of the lack of recovery in the employment -to-population ratio can be attributed \nto the aging of the population.  With a constant age mix, the employment -to-population ratio falls by almost \nan equal amount but recovers more rapi dly and would be roughly two percentage points higher as of June, \nbut still well below its previous peak.   \n \n5 For example, many analysts cited the small size of sub -prime mortgages relative to the size of the U .S. \neconomy in making the argument that their  loss in value would have a minimal impact.  This perspective \nwas certainly not borne out by events in the United States in 2007 and 2008 . \n \n6 In the case of Greece,  no financial exchange would be immediately available to completely hedge the \npotential new -drachma exchange -rate risk.",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 2 With the wonderful New England summer weather now upon us, it may seem \nunnecessary – and perhaps a bit cruel – to dredge up memories of the brutal winter we \nexperienced here in the Northeast.  However, economics has been called the dismal \nscience.   \nBut I have a substantive reason for pondering the winter we just endured.  \nBecause economic data emerge  with lags, recent disappointing numbers  have generated a \nspirited debate about whether the weak performance  can be explained by temporary \nfactors, such as the brutal weather  we experienced during the first quarter .  In many parts \nof New England , record snowfall prevented pe ople from getting to work, shoppers from \ngetting to stores, and customers from going out to eat.  So clearly, bad weather did deter \nsome economic activity.  \nHowever, the data w ere not just weak during the worst of winter ; they were  also \nweak before the stor ms and have  been weaker than expected ever since.  So economic \ngrowth for the first half of this year looks to be well below what was expected, even \ncorrecting for some temporary disruptions.  \nOf course, t his weaker growth has implications for monetary poli cy.  In the last \ntwo monetary policy statements issued by the FOMC, the Committee’s criteria for raising \nshort -term rates w ere twofold – first, further improvement in the labor market , and \nsecond, being reasonably confident that inflation will move back to  our 2 percent target .  \nSuch conditions are  likely to be met  in the near term only  if the economy grow s above \nthe rate economists refer to as its “ potential. ” Given the data that we have seen so far, \neconomic growth above potential seems unlikely  for the f irst half of this year . \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 3 Despite a disappointing first half , most forecasters expect a stronger second half \nof the year.  Among the factors supporting t his optimism are growth in personal income, \nthe positive impact of lower gas prices, and household net worth  that continues to grow .  \nHowever, so far  this improvement is only in the forecast , and not in the data.  The d ata \nhave disappointed before, and a n appropriately  data-dependent monetary policy requires \nconfirmation in the numbers , not just in forecast s of better times.       \nToday I w ould like to  provide  an overview of recent data, which  in my view  \ndemonstrate why the conditions for beginning the tightening of monetary policy have not \nyet been met.    \nThis view is heightened, I would argue, by global pol itical, security, and financial \nconditions that suggest the risks of a negative shock from abroad remain elevated, as has \nbeen the case over the last several years.  With short -term interest rates near zero , \nmonetary policy would have limited ability to of fset such a shock.  If we were fortunate \nenough to see the economy grow much more quickly, we would have the ability to raise \nrates more quickly.  But the near -term constraint on offsetting a shock amounts to an \n“asymmetric” situation that, in my view, nee ds to be taken into account in formulating an \nappropriate policy stance.  \n \nRecent Economic Growth  \nFigure 1  shows the private -sector forecasts for real GDP growth as of last \nNovember.  It provides the median forecast of quarterly real GDP growth in the Surve y \nof Professional Forecasters conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, and the \naverage forecast of quarterly real GDP growth from the Blue Chip survey.  While there is \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 4 some overlap among the participants in the two surveys, both surveys forecast  relatively \nstrong real GDP growth from the fourth quarter of 2014 through 2015.   \nHowever, the figure shows that actual growth has been well below forecasted \ngrowth.  Real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2014 grew at 2.2 percent, and declined 0.7 \npercent in the first quarter of  2015.  My expectation is that second quarter growth is \nlikely to be only 2 percent.  Taken together , this means that over the past three qua rters, \nreal GDP growth has been disappointing. If such a pace of growth persists, it is unlikely \nto be associated with further significant declines in the unemployment rate.   \nFigure 2  shows the probability assessments for different real GDP growth rates \nfor 2015 submitted by forecasters participating in the Survey of Professional Forecasters \nin February and in May.  The distributions show forecasters were more confident about \nthe probability of stronger 2015 real GDP growth in 2015 in February than in May . Thus, \nbased on the weaker incoming economic data, a noticeable leftward shift in the \nprobability distribution occurred between February and May.   \nTogether, Figures 1 and 2 show that forecasts have tended to be too optimistic \nabout growth in 2015, and tha t their assessment of the likelihood of strong growth over \nthe year has declined significantly as the year has progressed.   \nFigure 3 shows that there was indeed unusual weather in many parts of the \ncountry in the first quarter.  In the East, the weather w as unusually cold.  This would \npresumably discourage shopping, housing starts, and other types of economic activity \nwhere adverse weather could deter outdoor activity.  However, the chart also shows that \nwhile the East had record cold, the West had record warmth.  Warmer than normal \nwinters in the West might not be much of a deterrent to economic activity in the short \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 5 term1 unless you were hoping to ski (although New England provided ample \nopportunities for that).   \nEven though most of the unusual weather o ccurred in February, the higher -\nfrequency economic data suggest slowness both before and after February.  While it is \ndifficult to assess the exact effect of weather on first -quarter data, if there was a \ntemporary deferral of economic activity due to bad w eather, one should expect a \nsnapback as the weather improves.  But there has not been much evidence of such a \nsnapback in the numbers.  \nFigure 4  provides the quarterly pattern of real GDP growth over the previous five \nyears.  The dotted lines pinpoint the g rowth rate that occurred in the first quarter of each \nof these years.  Some economists have questioned whether the normal seasonal \nadjustments are appropriately capturing seasonal variations in economic activity, since \nfirst-quarter growth has tended to be  lower than other quarters recently.  If inappropriate \nseasonal adjustment accounts for a significant portion of weak measured growth in the \nfirst quarter, this too would suggest a snapback in the subsequent quarter (and reasonable \ngrowth on average across  the two quarters).  But the data for the second quarter do not \nyet indicate much of a snapback, with many current -quarter forecasts of GDP close to 2 \npercent growth.  \nFigure 5  provides the growth rate of real GDP leading up to the first tightening of \nmonetary policy in previous cycles.  The table shows that in each of the previous \ntightening cycles, real GDP growth in the two years preceding the tightening was above 3 \npercent.  It should not be surprising that the first tightening of policy occurred during \nperiods of relatively strong growth. However, today we are faced with a growth rate of \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 6 2.3 percent over the past two years, and the strong possibility that growth in the first  half \nof this year will average much less than 2 percent.  In my view, such a pace of GDP \ngrowth does not meet some of the economic preconditions we look for when we begin a \ntightening cycle, even if one takes into account that potential GDP growth is now lower \nthan in previous cycles.  \n \nThe Role of Consumption  \nMost forecasters have expected relatively robust growth in consumption.   \nBecause consumption is such a large component of GDP, stronger growth in \nconsumption can offset weaker growth in many of the s maller components of GDP.   \nFigure 6  shows that seasonally adjusted consumption at the end of last year was quite \nstrong, while in the first quarter of this year it was disappointing.  If first -quarter \nweakness was really due to temporary factors, we would  expect a rebound in the second \nquarter as these factors waned. The weak retail sales numbers for April, however, signal \nthat we need to see more data before dismissing the slower first -quarter consumption as \nonly a result of temporary factors.  \n Figure 7  provides an estimate of retail sales based on a survey that breaks out \nresults by geographic region  of the country .  Given the weather map shown in Figure 3, \none might expect sharp variations across regions of the country.  However, the regional \npatterns ar e quite similar, making the weather a less plausible explanation for most of the \nweakness in the first quarter.  \n An alternative explanation – versus temporary factors such as severe weather \nimpacting recent data – could be simply that many consumers remain  reluctant to spend \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 7 despite the time that has passed since the Great Recession.  Figure 8  shows that the \npersonal saving rate has remained well above where it was prior to the Great Recession.2    \nIf consumer behavior is still being impacted by the experie nce of the financial \ncrisis, the Great Recession, and the painfully slow recovery, then it is possible that the \neconomy will not be as robust as many economic models would suggest, because the \nmodels do not take into account this behavioral change.  As Figure 9  illustrates, many of \nthe factors that drive consumption in most economic models have been increasingly \nfavorable.  The strength of these consumption fundamentals likely explains why many \nforecasters continue to expect reasonably strong consumption an d growth in the second \nhalf of this year.  \n \nAchieving the Fed’s Mandate  \n The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from Congress that is focused on stable \nprices and maximum sustainable employment.  Let me now turn to inflation and \nemployment in more detail.  \nFigure 10 illustrates that neither the “total” nor the “core” measures of PCE \ninflation are yet showing much evidence of returning to the 2 percent inflation target that \nthe Fed considers ideal.  If the economy were growing quickly, there might be greater \nconfidence that the resulting tightening of labor markets would boost wages, and \nultimately prices, such that the 2 percent target level of inflation would be reached over \nthe next two years.  However, if growth remains slow, confidence in the likelihood of  \nachieving the 2 percent inflation target in the next two years would be diminished.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 8  Figure 11  shows longer -run forecasts of the unemployment rate from the \nSummary of Economic Projections made by Federal Reserve policymakers over the past \nyear, including the most recent as of the March FOMC meeting.3  At 5.4 percent, \nunemployment is currently below some FOMC participants’ estimate of “full” \nemployment.  However, in the absence of inflationary pressures, estimates of full \nemployment among many FOMC particip ants have been trending down.  At this point, \nthe median estimate of full employment among FOMC participants – as reflected in their \nlonger -run unemployment rate projections – is 5.05 percent.4  Still, a declining \nunemployment rate coupled with weak GDP gr owth could signal that the level of the \nunemployment rate consistent with full employment is drifting even lower.  \n Figure 12  provides the range and median of inflation forecasts for the next three \nyears as of the March FOMC meeting.  Many FOMC participants  forecast that inflation \nwill only gradually reach the 2 percent inflation target.  \nFigure 13 shows that at the March FOMC meeting, many participants viewed the \nmost likely path of the federal funds rate to be a tightening that is gradual by historical \nstandards.5   Obviously, the data coming in since that meeting may result in revisions to \nthat path after the June FOMC meeting.  \nAs the federal funds rate target is raised, it is likely to also be reflected in longer -\nterm rates, such as the 10 -year rate.  But  as Figure 14  shows, the historical relationship \nbetween the 10 -year Treasury rate and the effective federal funds rate has been quite \nvariable.  On average, the spread has been roughly 150 basis points.  But the figure \nhighlights that it is certainly poss ible that the spread between the funds rate and longer -\nterm rates could be much larger than it has been of late.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL  June 1 , 201 5 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY  * \n 9  \n \n \nConcluding Observations  \nIn summary and conclusion, the economy has been softer in the first half of this \nyear than many forecasters expected .  It is too soon to know whether this is driven \nprimarily by temporary factors like the severe winter, or is a reflection of broader \nchanges in the economy.   \nFor monetary policy to begin the normalization process, I believe we need to be  \nconfident that we will return to full employment and 2 percent inflation over the next \ncouple of years.   If the economy continues to grow at the same pace as we witnessed on \naverage in the current and the past two quarters, I do not expect to see timely \nimprovements in the unemployment rate and sufficient progress towards the 2 percent \ninflation target.   T his, in my view, makes a compelling argument for continued patience \nin monetary policy.  \n Thank you.     \n \n                                                 \n \n1 Obviously, warmer winters can have longer -run negative  impacts on economic activity , given that they \nmay exacerbate drought conditions.  \n \n2 Prior to the financial crisis , the saving rate may have been unusually low and has now perhaps returned to \na more normal level.  \n \n3 Economic Projections of Federal Reserve Board Members and Federal Reserve Bank Presidents, March \n2015: http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150318.pdf  \n \n4 In Figure s 11 and 12 , what is referred to as the median is the midpoint of the median range reported in the \nminutes for the FOMC meeting s.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nChatham House  \n \n \nLondon, England  \nApril 16, 2015  \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is a great pleasure to be here at Chatham House to discuss the economic \noutlook.  Because of the strong  economic ties across the Atlantic, it is important to \nmaintain a  good dialogue centering on the common  challenges we all face – and what \nthose challenges  imply for our respective monetary policies.  \nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my collea gues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors \nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 2 In March, the FOMC’s  monetary policy statement1 provided two conditions for \nraising  short -term interest  rates in the United States.  First, the statement i ndicated that \nthe Committee needs to see “ further  improvement in the labor market. ”  Second,  the \nCommittee needs to be “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 \npercent objective over the medium term.”   \nTo the first condition, the recen t U.S. employment report was disappointing.  In \nMarch, the U.S. economy created only 126,000 net new jobs, and the unemployment rate \nwas unchanged at 5.5 percent.  To the second, core PCE inflation in the United States is \n1.4 percent2 with no clear indicat ion of when it will return to the Federal Reserve’s stated \ninflation target of 2 percent.   \nHence, a t this time, I do not think that either condition has been met.   Although \nthere has been noticeable improvement in the labor market over the past few years,  since \nMarch the indicators have been a bit mixed.  Furthermore , inflation remains stubbornly \nbelow our target of 2 percent.   \nWith sufficiently strong economic growth, improvements in labor markets and \nincreases in inflation would likely follow.  But first quarter real GDP growth in the U.S. \nappears to have slowed to well below the relatively disappointing fourth quarter growth \nof only 2.2 percent.  The unusually cold and snowy winter (which I can surely attest to, \nliving in the Boston area, which this year saw over 110 inches of snow) may have been a \ntemporary slowing factor.  Still, it remains difficult to separate the temporary and easy -\nto-explain from the lasting and more concerning – so in my view, incoming data would \nneed to improve to fully s atisfy the Committee’s two conditions for starting to raise rates.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 3 Along with the two conditions described in the statement, the Committee also \npublished its latest forecasts.  Each q uarter, the FOMC provides information on the \nindividual forecasts of t he Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents , \nbrought together in a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) .3  Not surprisingly, many \nobservers tend, it seems,  to focus on the interest rate  projections from  each of the FOMC \nparticipants .  Yet , I would suggest that there is important additional information  in the \nSEP that tends not to receive  the same  emphasis.  \nToday I would like to focus on two aspect s of the recent Summary of Economic \nProjections – two aspects that probably deserved to attract mo re public discussion  than it \nseems they did .  The first matter is the  recent  striking reduction  in the estimates of the \nunemployment rate that FOMC participants expect to see in the long er run.  The second \nis the reduction in the  level of the  federal funds  rate that participants expect to see in the \nlonger run.  Both variables are important , obviously, to FOMC participants as we \ndetermin e both the  timing of the  first tightening of this monetary policy  cycle,  and how \nmuch and how quickly the Committee  should  continue to tighten  after the first increase .   \nI would add that i n addition to being relevant for current monetary policy \ndecision -making,  these measures are also relevant to the discussion of how best to utilize \nsimple monetary policy rules, a topic dis cussed by members of Congress and Chair \nYellen at recent Congressional hearings.  T hese two variables  – longer -run expectations \nfor unemployment and the federal funds rate – are normally assumed  to be  constant in \nsimple rules  such as those proposed by Professor John Taylor .4  But in practice, these key \nvariables , held constant by  simple rules of thumb , can change – and, according to FOMC \nparticipants ’ SEP submissions, have  changed significantly over the past t hree years .5  The \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 4 variability of these two k ey estimates highlights just one of the many perils of using  \nsimple rules to constrain  monetary policymaking .6   \n \nThe Fed’s Dual Mandate  \nIn the United States, the central bank has a Congressionally assigned dual \nmandate to achieve maximum sustainable emplo yment and stable prices.  In practice, the \ndual mandate involves maintaining full employment and hitting the inflation target.   \nThese two goals are affirmed each year in the Statement on Longer -Run Goals \nand Monetary Policy Strategy.7  The inflation goal is quite explicit – a 2 percent \nannualized rate of inflation , as measured by the PCE price index.  Full employment, by \ncontrast, has a more ambiguous target.  As the statement on monetary goals says, “T he \nmaximum level of employment is largely determined by non-monetary factors that affect \nthe structure and dynamics of the labor market.  These factors may change over time and \nmay not be directly measurable. ”  \nIn practice, this means that the Committee has to make an assessment about the \nlevel of unemployment that would be consistent with a stable inflation rate in the longer \nrun – the level of unemployment below which competition for labor bids up wage \nincreases, leading to higher price inflation.  Views on the level of unemployment \nconsistent with full employ ment certainly differ among economists and policymakers – \nand with good reason, given the difficulties in estimating an unobservable quantity that \nnonetheless appears to have changed significantly over time.   \nFigure 1  shows how the Committee’s views on un employment in the longer run \nhave changed over the past three years.  The dark blue line provides the midpoint of the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 5 estimates of the participants at the policy meeting.  The shaded area provides the range of \nthe central tendency, which excludes the three  highest and three lowest estimates of the \nlonger -run unemployment rate.  Starting in June of 2012, the midpoint was 5.6 percent, \nwith a quite large range of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  Had participants with estimates at the top \nof the range not subsequently chan ged their estimates of unemployment in the longer run, \nthe U.S. unemployment rate would currently be one -half percentage point below their \nestimates of full employment.  \nOver the past five quarters, the upper end of the central tendency declined \nsignificant ly.  As of the March FOMC meeting, the top of the range was 5.2 percent – \nand notably, 5.2 percent was the bottom  of the central tendency until recently.  In \naddition, the spread has narrowed significantly, with the central tendency now lying \nbetween 5.0 a nd 5.2 percent.  My own estimate of the longer -run unemployment rate is \n5.0 percent, at the bottom of the central tendency.  I, too, have changed my estimate over \nthe past three years – from 5.25 percent at the beginning of the period to 5.0 percent now.   \nA number of factors may be behind the lower estimates for the unemployment \nrate in both the medium and the longer run.   \nLooking first at the medium run, one possibility is that the standard \nunemployment rate usually quoted – the “U -3” measure – may not f ully capture the \ncurrent slack in the labor market.  As Figure 2  shows, the share of workers whose status \nis “part time for economic reasons” has declined over the recovery but still remains quite \nelevated by historical standards.  These are people who wou ld prefer full -time work, and \nare likely to continue to seek and find full -time employment as the economy improves.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 6 However, since they are viewed as “employed” in the U -3 measure, they are not counted \nas part of the unemployment rate.  \nTurning to the lon ger run, a reason FOMC participants may have lowered their \nestimates of the longer -run unemployment rate is the absence of significant wage and \nprice pressures, despite the unemployment rate falling to 5.5 percent.  Figure 3  shows the \ncore PCE rate of infl ation.  The core rate of inflation has yet to return to 2 percent, and in \nfact has been below 2 percent for most of the period since the recession.  Figure 4 shows \nthat growth in wages and salaries has remained relatively subdued across occupations \nsince t he recession.  Wages and salaries are also well below the growth rate seen prior to \nthe recession.  The disaggregation by occupational groups also shows that broad \noccupational categories are not yet hitting significant bottlenecks.  The absence of wage \nand price pressure is consistent with some slack still remaining in the labor markets, even \nwith an unemployment rate that has fallen to 5.5 percent.  \nIt is also possible that demographics have been underappreciated and play some \nrole in the decline in the le vel of the unemployment rate consistent with negligible \ninflation pressure.  For example, Figure 5 shows the age distribution of the labor force at \n10-year intervals since 1994, indicating that the age distribution has shifted to somewhat \nolder workers on average.  Older workers generally experience lower unemployment \nrates than workers new to the labor force, so the unemployment rate that is consistent \nwith scant inflation pressure may have declined.  \nAlso, the skills of the labor force, as proxied  by educational attainment ( Figure \n6), have improved in the U nited States.  There are fewer workers who have not \ncompleted high school, and more workers with college or graduate degrees.  Skilled \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 7 workers tend to have lower unemployment rates than less -skilled workers.  This might \nalso be a factor that was underappreciated and may help to explain why there are yet to \nbe significant wage or price pressures.  \nIn sum, the unemployment rate that is cons istent with full employment appears to \nhave declined.  Estimates of full employment can and do change, which is one reason the \nFOMC has not provided a numerical estimate for full employment.  And simple rules that \nassume the full employment level of unempl oyment is constant  could provide misleading \nguideposts for setting monetary policy.  \n \nDeterminants of Interest Rates  \nRecent Summaries of Economic Projections have also reflected substantial \nchanges in the level of the federal funds rate that FOMC participan ts expect in the longer \nrun.  Figure 7  shows that both the midpoint of participants’ estimates of the federal funds \nrate in the longer run and the range of the central tendency have moved down over the \npast three years.  Since the FOMC has not changed its inflation target, this would imply \nthat the real federal funds rate is expected to be lower in the longer run.8 \nFigure 8  shows that the reduction in estimates of the federal funds rate in the \nlonger run come at a time when prevailing long -term rates in mos t developed countries \nhave moved to unusually low levels.  I would suggest that seeing longer -term rates (these \n10-year government bond yields) well below the stated inflation target may indicate a \nlack of faith internationally in some central banks’ abili ty to achieve those inflation \ntargets on average over the 10 -year period – coupled with the likelihood of very low real \nrates over the next 10 years.  This could be evidence of a global savings glut, as \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 8 suggested at one point by former Fed Chairman Ben Ber nanke;9 or it could reflect \ninadequate investment opportunities, as suggested by former Treasury Secretary , \nProfessor Larry Summers.10 \nAnother reason why real rates may have fallen is that households and firms may \nhave become more risk averse as a result of  the financial crisis, and increased their \nprecautionary savings.  Figure 9  shows that checkable deposits and currency for \nhouseholds are quite high by historical standards, as are holdings by nonfinancial \ncorporate businesses, shown in Figure 10.11   \nDecre ased productivity typically also leads to lower real interest rates , all other \nthings equal .  Figure 11 shows that, indeed, productivity has slowed recently to a pace \nmuch lower than experienced on average over the past two decades.  \nLower longer -run, or eq uilibrium, federal funds rates have several implications :   \n First, if the longer -run federal funds rate has declined, rates do not need to rise \nas much to return to “normalized” interest rates.  This is one reason that rate \nincreases might not need to foll ow as steep a path as in previous recoveries.   \n Second, lower longer -run federal funds rates imply that in the future , \npolicymakers will have less room to lower interest rates in the event of \neconomic weakness, and will thus be more likely to hit the zero lower bound \nfor interest rates.  The zero lower bound constraint on policy interest rates has \nbeen more than an academic concern of late, as most developed countries’ \ncentral banks have experienced difficulty in providing sufficient monetary \nstimulus to sp ur a robust recovery in their economies. This may imply that \ninflation targets have been set too low. After all, a higher inflation target \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M. Local Time  in London ) OR UPON DELIVERY  \n 9 would mean a higher longer -run policy rate, which brings with it a lower \nchance of hitting the zero lower bound.   \n Third, the longer -run federal funds rate is assumed to be constant in most \nsimple policy rules.  The fact that the real interest rate may change in both the \nintermediate and longer runs provides a further rationale for looking beyond \nsimple monetary rules.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \nFigure 12 compares the FOMC participants’ forecasts for the federal funds rate  \nexpected to prevail at the end of 2015 , from the December and the March SEPs.  The \n“dots” indicate that many participants lowered their expectations for the federal funds \nrate for the end of this year.  While this could be due to a weaker near -term outlook for \neconomic growth, it could also be consistent with participants revising their assessments \nof appropriate policy in light of declining estimates of b oth the full -employment level of \nunemployment and the longer -run federal funds rate.   \nToday I have provided two examples of variables that have changed quite \nnoticeably,  but which normally do not change in simple monetary policy rules.  This is an \nargumen t against the simple rules that several policymakers have proposed.   Simple \nmonetary rules cannot capture the full complexity involved in determining appropriate \nmonetary policy, especially during periods when economic relationships may be \nchanging.   \nAs such, rigidly following such rules would, in my view, be misguided.  Many of \nthese simple rules would have dictated a tighter policy for some time, even as \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:3 5 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:3 5 P.M.

For me, there is \nwisdom in utilizing a more flexible and comprehensive set  of variables and models when \nconsidering appropriate monetary policy.  \n I would emphasize that despite their shortcomings, funds rate equations such as \nthose advocated by John Taylor do play a role in monetary policy formulation.  In the \nU.S., they serve as useful benchmarks, because they can often capture rough  contours of  \nthe historical regularities in central bank policy ov er specific periods.  And the fact that \nsome inputs to the model are difficult to estimate does not render them useless.  We face \nsimilar uncertainties in estimating all of the economic relationships that operate in our \ncomplex economies.  But it does high light that rules are likely best used as guidelines, \nalong with a host of other inputs – the most important of which are good judgment and \nhard-won experience.  \nThank you again for inviting me to Chatham House to share these perspectives on \nthe economy and monetary policy.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n1 http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150318a.htm  \n \n2As measured by the year -over-year percent change in the c ore PCE or Personal Consumption Expenditures \nPrice Index , excluding food and energy . \n \n3 Summary of Economic Projections, March 2015: \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150318.pdf  \n \n4 See John B.

This example of a simple policy rule relates the federal funds rate to current inflation \nrelative to a 2 percent target and the unemployment rate relative to the natural rate of unemployment.  Such \nsimple monetary policy rules rely on significant assumptions, including that r* and u* are  fixed.   \n \n6 This is just one of the perils. For example these simple rules do not include a variable that captures large \nscale asset purchases, one of the major tools used by central banks in developed countries around the world \nin recent years.   Others include the rigidity of assigning fixed emphases (or weights) on inflation versus \nemployment, which may not be optimal in all circumstances. In addition, the notion that assumed or \nestimated historical response coefficients represent the best that monetary  policymakers can do in any \ncircumstances is a very strong assumption. Further, these simple rules do not capture financial stability \nissues, an area that has been receiving increasing attention since the financial crisis. There is also an issue \nwith the n onlinearity of the rules in general (ex. we do not raise rates when the unemployment rate falls \nfrom 10 to 9 percent).  In addition, using simply the modal forecast when the risks can be very asymmetric \nis questionable.  \n \n7 http://www.federalreserve.gov/mon etarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf  \n \n8 Others have noted that the real interest rate may be lower.

U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 2The expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ended with the completion \nof the tapering process last Oc tober, but we still are a l ong way from normalizing either \nshort-term interest rates or our balance sheet.   As a result, it may be some time before a \nfull assessment of the effects of our quantitat ive easing policies can be made, since a full \nevaluation will require a successful return to a normalized monetary policy.  Nonetheless, \nI think it is quite possible and appropriate at this point to consider which design features \nof the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase progr am were effective, and which were less \nsuccessful, in achieving our monetary policy goals.   \nIn addition to considering the design feat ures, I will also consider the equally \nimportant communications st rategy.  Communications, ofte n referred to as forward \nguidance, are an increasingly important com ponent of monetary policy, especially when \nshort-term interest rates are at the zero lower bound. \n An important caveat here is that in stitutional, structural, and governance \ndifferences across the world’s central banks can make comparisons of policy actions (and \ntheir efficacy) quite difficult.  Perhaps the most important difference between the Fed in \nthe United States and most central banks in de veloped countries is th at Congress assigned \nthe Federal Reserve a “dual mandate” – the tw in goals of achieving maximum sustainable \nemployment as well as stable prices – ra ther than a single mandate related only to \ninflation.   \nHowever, another important difference invol ves the restrictions on securities that \nthe Fed can purchase for its open market account.  We are limited to securities that have \nthe full backing of the U.S. government, and thus have purchased government-guaranteed \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 3mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and U.S. Treas ury securities.  Such restrictions vary \nsignificantly across the wo rld’s central banks.  \nReflecting on the financial crisis and its aftermath, I have become convinced that \nthe dual mandate is one reason why the U.S. Federal Reserve moved more aggressively \nthan many other central banks to address th e significant undershooti ng of inflation that \nwe saw in the U.S., and that many other count ries have experienced.  Given the imperfect \nunderstanding of inflation dynamics, even a string of quarters in which inflation \nsignificantly undershoots its target may be reasonably interpre ted as a temporary \nshortfall, since deviations of this magnitude  and persistence still lie well within the \naccuracy of current inflation forecasting mode ls.  However, the substantial increase in \nunemployment  throughout the developed world, in combination with the below-target \ninflation rates, indicates that significant output gaps do exist.   How aggressively a central \nbank reacts to this situation depends on whether that central bank’s mandated goals \ninvolve inflation alone, or as  in the U.S., a dual mandate that includes employment. \nHowever, I would argue that regardless of  mandate, delays by central banks in \nmoving to address the undershootin g on inflation can be costly – especially if such delays \nlead households and firms to expect  very low inflation rates.   \nIn the United States, the decline in infl ation during the recession afforded us more \nlatitude to aggressively focus on the employ ment side of our dual mandate.  Given the \npainful disruptions in labor markets that the U.S. experienced, this emphasis seemed \nappropriate, and does so with hi ndsight, and with all due cons ideration to the possibility \nof structural shifts in labor markets.  I felt it was important that the focus on weak labor \nmarkets, as well as the unde rshooting of inflation, together  provided important support \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 4for U.S. monetary policymakers to decide to move aggressively during the financial \ncrisis, and indeed it s long aftermath.   \nOf course today, after significant labor market improvement, and with the horizon \nover which inflation will return to its target being uncertain, inflati on has taken on a more \nprominent role in our deliberations.  Currently, an obvious caveat in interpreting the low inflation rate in the U.S. is the \nsupporting role played by the recent decline in en ergy prices.  Oil shocks have been \nassociated with major changes in monetary po licy before.  The failure to control inflation \nin the United States during the 1970s, in th e presence of an adverse oil supply shock, \nhighlighted a serious dilemma facing monetary policy at that time.  Importantly in that \ncase, what might have been a temporary  pass-through of oil to non- oil prices turned into \na more lasting problem with overall inflation, as wage and price dynamics at that time \nhelped turn increases in oil pr ices into fairly protracted in creases in overall inflation.   \nFormer Federal Reserve Board Chairman Volc ker is rightfully recognized for taking \nforceful action to address the situation and ultimately tame inflation in the United States. \nCurrently, a concern is that  central banks are facing  the mirror image of the \nproblem in the 1970s.  The problem of significantly under shooting inflation – a dynamic \nwhich could well keep interest rates at the zero lower bound – is likely to be a key \nchallenge to central bankers in the first two decades of the 21\nst century.  And I would say \nthat as with the oil shock in the 1970s, th e current shock has served to accentuate a \npotential monetary policy pitfall – in this case, the failure to quickly and vigorously \naddress a significant undershooting of infla tion targets, potentially leaving economies \nstagnant at the zero lower bound. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 5 There are three observations I will ma ke today.  First, that a significant \nunder shooting of the inflation target should be treated with the same policy urgency as a \nsignificant overshooting of the inflation target.  Second, that open-ended  quantitative \neasing tied to policy goals is likely to be mu ch more effective than limited quantitative-\neasing programs.  Third, that clarity on m onetary policy communications is difficult to \nachieve, but critically important for the succe ss of the program.  I would add that this \nfinal point is as cr itical to how we normalize  policy as it is to how we initiate  quantitative \neasing policies.  \nThe Design of Large-Scale Asset Purchases in the United States \n While there were three separate large- scale asset purchase programs in the United \nStates, I will only briefly focus on the first one , since it was at least partly designed to \naddress dysfunctional markets during the height  of the financial crisis.  In addition to \naddressing the shortfall in macroeconomic goa ls, this program was focused on purchases \nof mortgage securities, and sought to relieve the weak demand for mortgage-backed \nsecurities when markets became quite illiquid and risked becoming much more so.  This \nprogram has generally been view ed as a successful way to st abilize markets, but isolating \nits effects is complicated because it occurr ed in the midst of the financial crisis. \nFigure 1  provides details of the large-sc ale asset purchase programs commonly \nreferred to as “QE1,” “QE2,” and “QE 3.”  QE1 was announced on November 25, 2008, \nwith purchases beginn ing shortly thereafter.\n1  Initial purchases were of agency debt and \nagency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), “to provide support to  the mortgage and \nhousing markets.”2  Additional agency debt and MBS purchases were announced in \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 6March 2009, along with the purch ase of longer-term Treasury s ecurities, all to “provide \ngreater support to mortgage lending a nd housing markets” and “to help improve \nconditions in private credit markets.” 3  The program concluded in March 2010.  \nPurchases totaled $1.25 trillion in agency MB S, $175 billion in agency debt, and $300 \nbillion in longer-term Treasury securities. 4  \nQE2 began in November 2010, and ended in June 2011.  The program committed \nto purchase $600 billion of longer-term securities by the middle of 2011.5  Unlike QE1, it \nwas focused solely on purchasing long-term Tr easury securities, and did not include the \npurchase of mortgage securities – which had been  the focus of that first large-scale asset \npurchase program.  \nThe purchase program did not fully meet expectations in terms of achieving \nmonetary policy goals.  As a result, in Sept ember of 2011 – only th ree months after the \nend of QE2 – the Federal Reserve announ ced the Maturity Extension Program \n(commonly referred to as “Operation Twist”).   This program was designed to lengthen \nthe average maturity of the Fed’s Treasury securities portfolio, by purchasing long-term \nsecurities and selling an e qual amount of short-term securities.  The program removed \nduration from private holdings of Treasury securities, but did not increase the overall \namount of the securities portfolio held by the Federal Reserve.  The goal was to decrease \nthe longer-term rates that tend to affect the real economy; in  fact the FOMC statement at \nthe time highlighted that the program s hould “put downward pressure on longer-term \ninterest rates.” 6   \nThe initial program was a purchase of $400 billion in long-term Treasury \nsecurities, and clearly had the intended e ffect on long term rates.  The program was \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 7extended in June 2012, at which point the program was limited by the lack of short-term \nsecurities to sell, a nd ended in December 2012.7  At the time this eliminated our holdings \nof T-bills and very short term notes.  The third quantitative easing program began in September 2012.\n8  The program \nbegan as a monthly purchase of $40 billion in  agency mortgage-backed securities, in \naddition to the Treasury securities that we re being purchased (o r swapped) under the \n“Twist” program.  Unlike QE2, QE3 was an open-ended program.  The continuation of \nthe program was tied to substant ial improvement in labor markets, consistent with price \nstability.  In this way the communication empha sized the need to achieve the policy goals \nrather than a given size of the program.  Communications also emphasized that the \nprogram would “put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates” and “support \nmortgage markets.”  When the Maturity Extension Program ended in December 2012 \nbecause of a lack of short-term Treasury securities remaining in the portfolio, the \nprogram was adjusted to the outright purchas e (rather than exchange or swap) of $45 \nbillion per month in longer-term Treasury secu rities, in addition to the purchase of $40 \nbillion per month in mort gage-backed securities.9  \n Figure 2  shows the growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over this \nperiod.  QE2 expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by $600 b illion, to a little \nbelow $3 trillion.  Operation Twist did not influe nce the overall size of  the balance sheet.  \nQE3 significantly increased the balance shee t to the current size of approximately $4.5 \ntrillion.   \nFigure 3  shows the composition of the Fed’ s balance sheet.  It shows the \nprogression from QE2 – where the expansion pr imarily involved Treasury securities with \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 8a 5 to 10 year maturity – to a balance sheet  with much larger holdings of mortgage-\nbacked securities, and Treasury securities  with more than 10 years to maturity. \n \nImpact of Programs \nA number of good event studies have atte mpted to evaluate the impact of the \npurchase programs in a narrow time window around the program-announcement dates.10  \nIn general, the studies find roughly a 20 to 25 basis point reducti on in long-term rates \nassociated with a purchase of $500 billion in long-term assets, although there is a high \ndegree of imprecision involved.    \nIn particular, with numerous Federal Reserve officials publicly discussing \npossible policy options, the timing of exactly when the market came to expect  a new \nprogram is hard to pinpoint.  It is very di fficult to isolate the extent of the “news” \ncontained in any announcement – news about  either the timing or magnitude of a \nprogram. \nFigure 4  shows 10-year Treasury yields around the time of announcements \nrelated to the three quantitative easin g programs.  QE1 was announced on November 25, \n2008, with the announcement reiterated in the FOMC statement on December 16, 2008.  Additional purchases were announced in th e FOMC statement released on March 18, \n2009.  The 10-year Treasury yield fell 24 ba sis points on the day of the November \nannouncement, and an additional 12 basis points on the following day.  On the day of the March announcement of additional purchases,  the 10-year Treasury rate fell 51 basis \npoints.   \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 9Treasury yields, at much lower levels  by the November 3, 2010 announcement of \nQE2, fell by 14 basis points the day following the announcement, but drifted slightly \nupward over the next couple of weeks.   \nAs QE3 was contemplated, 10- year Treasury yields hovere d at historic lows well \nunder 2 percent.  (Because of the low levels, please note that the scale on the chart for \nQE3 is different than the scale for the QE1 and QE2 charts.)  QE3 was announced in the \nFOMC statement on September 13, 2012.  Howeve r, shortly prior to the announcement, \non August 31, 2102, Chairman Bernanke spoke at the annual Jackson Hole symposium \nhosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.11   \nOn the day of Bernanke’s speech, the 10- year Treasury yield declined by 6 basis \npoints.  However, on the day after the QE 3 announcement, the 10-year Treasury yield \nrose 13 basis points but then adopted a dow nward trend, falling ove r 20 basis points over \nthe next two weeks, easing th e initial jump.  Through the announcement of QE3, 10-year \nTreasury rates had fallen approximately 200 basis points, which was the immediate goal \nof the program.  While measuring the reduction in rates is  one way to capture the impact of the \nprogram, the real goal is to have a sign ificant impact on economic variables more \ngenerally.  QE1 was meant to stem the tid e of the deepening recession; the economy’s \nmomentum was highly contractionary and QE 1 was meant to moderate the resulting \ndecline in output.  On the other hand, the later two QEs were meant to stimulate the economy.  The FOMC statement announcing QE3 highlig hted the desire to support mortgage \nmarkets.  Figure 5  shows that there was no notable ch ange in housing starts during the \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 10period of QE2.  However, housing starts did improve over the period of Operation Twist \nand QE3.  After averaging 569,000 units during QE2, starts averaged 708,000 units from \nearly on in Operation Twist through August 2012.  During the past 6 months, starts have \nimproved to averaging over 1 million units. \nFigure 6  shows the path of housing prices.  With housing prices declining, it was \nvery hard to see or generate momentum in the housing market.  Housing prices continued \nto decline during QE2, but began to rise some what steadily – albeit modestly – in late \n2011, with Operation Twist underway for several months.  Housing prices continued their \nupward trend during  QE3.    Figure 7  shows that QE2 did not generate much momentum in auto and light-\nweight truck sales, which did pick up during Operation Twist and QE3.  During QE2, \nauto and light truck sales were averagi ng 12.4 million units.  Midway through Operation \nTwist, and as QE3 began, auto sales had rise n to an average of nearly 15 million units, \nand over the past six months auto sales have averaged nearly 17 million units.  One of the transmission mechanisms is to alter asset prices other than interest rates.  Figure 8  illustrates that while there was not much momentum in stock prices from \nQE2, there was a substantial improvement ove r the period of Operation Twist and QE3. \nFigures 9 and 10  illustrate what happened to measures of the two goals \nembedded in the Fed’s dual mandate over th is period.  The unemployment rate fell \nappreciably over the period.  Core PCE inflation reached 2 percent during Operation Twist, but has generally been persistently below the 2 percent ta rget.  In part, the \npresence of full employment in the mandate, a nd the pain being felt in U.S. labor markets \n– coupled with core inflation below 2 percen t – provided plenty of support for aggressive \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 11policy actions.  The FOMC statements noted the need for substantial improvement in \nlabor markets, and the statements relate d to QE3 eventually incorporated an \nunemployment threshold.   \nIn sum, in the absence of the dual mandate, some significant and I would say \nneeded policy actions may not have occurr ed – Operation Twist when core PCE was \nrelatively close to the 2 percen t target, and QE3 when core in flation trended at roughly 50 \nbasis points below 2 percent.  Had these polic y actions not occurred, it would in my view \nhave prevented what was ultimately important pre-emptive action against a persistent undershooting of the inflation target that could have become much worse, as in some other parts of the globe.   QE2 was limited in scope.  It had a fixed purchase amount and was not \ncommunicated in a manner tied to goals.  Mo reover, it was focused on Treasury securities \nrather than on areas with larger spreads, such  as mortgages.  And th ere is little evidence it \nhad the desired impact on rates or real variables.  In contrast, QE3 was limited only by the progress made against the goals.  The \npurchases were open-ended, and the communication was firmly tied to goals.  It included \nareas with larger spreads such as mortgage s.  And both financial variables and real \nvariables showed improvem ent with this program. \n In summary, program design, and communi cation, both matter.  A program that is \nopen-ended and focused on areas where spr eads are large – in conjunction with a \ncommunication strategy tied to goals – seems to  have made a material difference in \noutcomes.  While the transmission channels of  large-scale asset purchases are still not \ncompletely understood, it seems to me that the signaling and comm unication tied to a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 12large-scale asset purchase are an important chan nel – but one that unfortunately is hard to \naccurately quantify.  \n \nExit Strategies \n At this point no central bank has fully normalized its policy stance.  However, as \nmy discussion has highlighted, communication and actions around exit are likely to be as \nimportant as they were at initiation .  I am pleased that the United States has experienced \nmuch improved labor markets and inflation ra tes that, while below target, are higher – \nless close to dangerously low or negative rate s – than in some, if not many, developed \ncountries.  Nonetheless, policy should not be focu sed on progress from where we have been, \nbut should instead be focused on meeting the ul timate goals in a timely fashion.  At this \ntime, there is insufficient evidence that U.S. inflation is clearly trending toward the 2 \npercent goal.  While labor markets have continued to improve, the employment cost \nindex (ECI) overall, and the occupati onal breakdown of the ECI shown in Figure 11 , \nshow little evidence of trending to pre-crisis levels.   \nWhile disentangling the impact of positive energy shocks on prices will be \ndifficult, we know that the PCE core infl ation rate remains well below the Federal \nReserve’s 2 percent target.  Given how low to tal and core inflation have fallen in most \ndeveloped countries, a policy of patience in the United States continues to be appropriate.  \nThis is particularly true gi ven the inherent asymmetry that  we face at the zero lower \nbound – meaning, while we have all kinds of  room to respond to an unexpectedly \nfavorable shock, we remain quite limited in our ability to respond to negative shocks. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY * \n   \n \n \n 13Concluding Observations \n My remarks have focused on the United States experience.  Given the different \nplaces central banks in developed countries are on policy at this time, it is likely \npremature to draw hard and fast conclusi ons for the global context.  Certainly the \nJapanese experience of raising the rate of inflation with a broad open-ended program tied \nto its policy goal is encouraging.  Simila rly, we will all learn from recently announced \nprograms being initiated in Europe.   \nThe relatively recent focus among central banks around the world on addressing \nthe problem of persistently low inflation rates is in my view very encouraging.  Just as \nhigh inflation in the 1970s was a pernici ous problem for central banks, the problems \ngenerated by low inflation and interest ra tes settling at the zero lower bound were \nunderestimated by professional economists and ce ntral bankers alike.  The broad focus on \nmeeting central bank mandates is important, a nd actions being taken to achieve inflation \ntargets should result in a more robust global economy.   \n Thank you.   \n \n                                                 \n \n1 The Federal Reserve’s press release announcing the ac tion on November 25, 2008 stated “This action is \nbeing taken to reduce the cost and increase the availab ility of credit for the purchase of houses, which in \nturn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally.” \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20081125b.htm  \n \n2 See the statement from the Dece mber 16, 2008 FOMC meeting: \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20081216b.htm  \n \n3 See the statement from the March 18, 2009 FOMC meeting: \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm  \n \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M.

I would like to thank Jo sef Tosovsky, chairman of the Financial \nStability Institute of the Bank for Internationa l Settlements, for inviting me to speak at \nthis forum.  The Institute serves an importa nt role by increasing aw areness of financial \nstability issues and highlighti ng actions that can be taken to  address vulnerabilities.   \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 2Today I am pleased to speak with you about a very important topic – cyber \nsecurity for banks, payments systems, and central banks – and its implications for financial stability.  As I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express \ntoday are my own, not necessari ly those of my colleagues on  the Federal Reserve’s Board \nof Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nAs we all know, innovations in computi ng and communications technologies are \nrapidly altering the landscape of payments.  And overseeing the safety, security, and \nefficiency of payment systems is a major re sponsibility of many central banks.  Indeed, I \nwould argue that for central banks, the transmission of mone tary policy, the provision of \nservices to financial intermediaries, and the supervision of the banking system are integrally linked.   \nHowever, payment systems are becoming less bank-centric and are changing \nmuch more quickly than their regulatory fr amework.  As payment systems quickly evolve \nwith new technologies, a potenti ally serious financial stabili ty concern is inherent in \ncyber security.  So, today I am going to descri be why I view cyber se curity as one of the \nmost serious financial stability concerns facing central banks, and why we need to \nbecome more directly involved.\n1 \n By way of example, consider the many payment choices available to a consumer \nwhen simply purchasing a shirt.  The consum er can go to the store and use cash, a debit \ncard, a credit card, a prepaid card, or even a mobile phone.  Alternatively, the shirt can be \npurchased on the Internet, the consumer paying with a credit card or signature debit card, \nPayPal, direct debit from a bank account, or alternatively using a mobile app such as \nApple Pay or Google Wallet.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 3Each of these transaction options woul d involve combinations of different \npayment systems, intermediaries, and technologies.  Because these options ultimately ride on traditional banking and payment “rails,” consumers see little need to consider \nwhether the behind-the-scenes technol ogy, accounting, and bookkeeping functions are \ntruly available, safe, and secure.   Despite the advantages to consumers and businesses from rapid innovation in \npayments systems, cyber-security issues are beginning to intrude.  Cyber crime has \ndirectly affected millions of consumers.\n2  The value of stolen data has grown \nexponentially with the evolution of a very  sophisticated black market for personal \ninformation.3  All this highlights one of the ec onomic risks of moving to electronic \npayments – a wide (and growing) variety of en try points for those look ing to steal, divert, \nor disrupt payments.   \nWhen financial gain is the primary mo tivation behind the fraud, there are three \noptions for containment.  First, prevent th e intruder from enteri ng the system.  Second, \nand often more importantly, prev ent the intruder’s ability to leave  the system with \nconfidential data.  Or third, de value the data so it is meani ngless to an intruder who gains \naccess to it.   \nNews media have reported thefts involv ing consumers’ credit card information.  \nTo date, these incidents have not resulted in  systemic shocks to the economy or to \npayments networks.  Still, should breaches co ntinue, a lack of conf idence in traditional \npayments may lead people to less efficient options.  Likewise, while these events do not \nreally introduce systemic risk from a tota l-dollar-value perspectiv e, they nonetheless \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 4contribute to the erosion of confidence in payment mechanisms and ultimately increase \noverall transaction costs. \nA more serious case would be an attack  on payment systems aimed at disrupting \ntransactions, for example by a rogue state or en tity.   Prevention is difficult because the \nattacker does not need to “enter”  the system to be disruptive,  and there is no need to exit \nwith confidential data – all th e attacker needs to do is fl ood the public-facing “front door” \nof a payments processor with enough traffic to make the system unavailable.\n4  However, \nthe bad actors are moving on to much more nefarious ways of penetrating processing \nassets.   \nPreventing disruption puts an emphasis on ensuring that resiliency, monitoring, \ndetection, and recovery capabilities are de signed into, and operational in, any payment \nsystem.  An attack on payment systems that  renders consumers and businesses unable to \ntransact business could be extremely disrupt ive and could possibly cripple an economy.  \nTo that end, the adoption of a national defe nse grade security level, rather than a \ncommercial grade security leve l, would mean a much more resilient – albeit expensive – \npayment system. \n Today I will briefly discuss how complex our payment system has become, and \nconsider susceptibility to cyber-related inte rruptions.  I will then discuss the financial \nstability concerns inherent in current arrang ements.  As an example, I will discuss the \npayment disruptions that occurred after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  I will \nmention some steps that need to be take n, some specific actions being taken by the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston, and a recent report issued by the Federal Reserve. \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 5I. Payments Systems \nThere are a variety of payment systems in the U.S., and the volume and dollar-\nvalue of the transactions th at flow through them is striking.  The 12 regional Federal \nReserve Banks collectively proces s over $4 trillion in payments every day .\n5  However, \nthe U.S. payments landscape encompasses much  more than those processed by the central \nbank.  In the realm of so-called “retail” paym ents, there are a variety of payment systems \nor networks that directly support credit and debit card payments as well as Automated \nClearinghouse (ACH) payments, and that indi rectly support intermediaries such as \nPayPal, Google Wallet, or Apple Pay.  Ther e are also payment systems devoted to \n“wholesale” funds transfers, including Fe dwire Funds transfers, Fedwire Securities \ntransactions, and the Clearing House In terbank Payments System or CHIPS.6,7  Other \nsystems focus on securities transfers and paym ents related to stocks, bonds, options, and \nderivatives.   \nIt is perhaps easiest to consider cyber crime in the context of a generic retail \npayment, as shown in Figure 1.   The consumer can choose from a variety of payment \nmethods and platforms8 to initiate a transaction.  The transaction information and \npayment method then enter the merchant’s computer system.  For a credit or debit \naccount payment, the merchant (or third-part y processor or “acquirer”) transmits the \naccount information to the issuing entity for au thorization.  The issuing entity approves \n(or rejects) the authorizati on back through the processor to  the merchant.  The payment \ninvolves the issuing entity or  its bank sending funds to the merchant’s bank, with \nsettlement on the books of the Fed.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 6At each stage of the transaction, a differe nt party may have customer information \n– which, if stolen or destroyed, could impact ot her parties to the transaction.  At the point \nof initiation, the consumer could be tricke d into providing account information, or during \nprocessing any of the institutions could expos e the customer’s information to a third \nparty.\n9   \nFraudsters have typically targeted consumer payments, making them a critical \narea for focus – and one where large-scale h acking incidents have been well-publicized.  \nShould fraud become so widespread that cu stomers lose confidence in the safety of \npayment transactions, the entire payment landscape (both retail point-of-sale and e-\ncommerce) could be severely impacted and en tire transaction models could be imperiled. \nUnfortunately, the retail space is only  one area where cyber-security breaches \ncould impinge on payment systems.  Figure 2  shows the U.S. regulatory arrangements \ncovering payment, clearing and settlement systems.  As the figure illustrates, payment systems extend well beyond reta il payments to other areas also susceptible to cyber-\nsecurity problems.   \nArguably, the complicated payment structure\n10 is actually something of an \nadvantage in that the payment system is decen tralized.  Without a single point of failure, \nproblems in one area may not directly impinge on other areas – at least not immediately.\n11  But, with diffuse roles and respons ibilities in the payments landscape, \ninvolving both the private and public sectors – and with attackers looking for the weakest \nlink – a unified cyber-preven tion approach is difficult to implement.  The complex \nlandscape means a significant investment is re quired to protect the many potential points \nof failure.  Also, complexity makes it difficult  to react in a more coordinated fashion to \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 7concerns. A particular worry relates to attack s where the purpose is not financial gain, but \nrather disruption of payment sy stems and economic activity.   \n \nII. Disruptions of Payment Systems \nThe attacks on September 11, 2001 had imp acts beyond the tragic loss of life and \nmassive destruction of property – including impacts on payment systems.  Because the \nWorld Trade Center was located near Wa ll Street, numerous payment systems were \naffected.  Insufficient resiliency became clear – for example, the New York Stock \nExchange halted trading for four days.  Th e flow of funds through the banking system \nwas also impacted.\n12  Some banks did not have suffici ent back-up systems and could not \nreceive incoming funds.  This resulted in some banks having a surplus, while others \nfound themselves short of funds or reserves.    \nFigure 3  shows the dramatic increase in th e volume of federal funds (Fed Funds) \nand Discount Window loans that occurred as bank s tried to reallocate funds or reserves \naround the payment system during that period.  Work by McAndrews and Potter13 on the \nliquidity effects of the events of Septembe r 11 documents that both the value and volume \nof Fedwire activity declined by well over 20 percent, as some banks had difficulty \ncommunicating with customers and counterparties,  and some institutions lost the ability \nto track the flow of funds. \nWithin a week, most payment flows had b een restored.  Banks were able to re-\ncreate files and restor e lost infrastructure.  In addi tion, actions taken by the Federal \nReserve facilitated recovery – the Federal Reserve not only helped restore financial \ncommunications, but also waived overdraft f ees, actively encouraged  borrowing from the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 8Discount Window, and conducted open market ope rations to increase reserves in the \nbanking system.   \nIn reaction to the disruption, significant  longer-run actions were taken.  The \nInteragency White Paper on Sound Practices to  Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. \nFinancial System\n14 required fundamental changes to pr event a similar shock from having \na large impact in the future.  Payment syst ems and financial institutions made costly \nimprovements that dramatically improved the speed at which payments activities could \nbe restored.   \nWith September 11, the implications of physical damage became fully evident.  \nThe corrective activities focused on geographi c dispersion, and resi liency for a physical \nevent.  In contrast, a cyber-atta ck could have greater scale an d take an extended period of \ntime to play out prior to the full impact being known.  And adve rsaries are well funded, \nand have time to evaluate and plan.  We n eed to consider and protect against many and \nall types of attacks, whil e adversaries need just one vulnerability – and we must assume \nthey are always trying.   \nWhile the payment disruptions that follo wed the September 11 attacks were not \nrelated to cyber security, there are analogies and lessons that can be applied to a more \nproactive and coordinated approach.15  Underlying infrastructure s need to better ensure \nthat payment providers take sufficient prec autions to minimize the likelihood and impact \nof cyber attacks – whether commercially motiv ated or focused on disruption.  This will \nrequire a level of information-sharing a nd expectation-setting by national defense \nagencies, regulators, supervisors, and ope rators exceeding that of today’s very \nfragmented but dynamic payment systems.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 9In the U.S., legislation aimed at impr oving the way information is shared among \nthe public and private sector has stalled due to privacy and other liability concerns.  \nHowever, the Obama administration has noted that cyber threats ar e “one of the most \nserious economic and national securi ty challenges we face as a nation”\n16 and is \npromoting legislation to require enhanced  threat information sharing among the two \nsectors. \n \nIII.  Addressing Cyber Security \nIn addition to addressing cyber security  with a more integrated and holistic \napproach among the large payment systems opera tors, there is work that central banks \nshould be considering on the lo cal and smaller-scale levels.  Figure 4  highlights some of \nthe significant cyber-security problems that have been experienced by major business entities as a result of their suppliers or sub-contractors being compromised.  Often, it \nseems, the initially-compromised organizations  tend to be smaller and less sophisticated, \nand may not have sufficient resources to prot ect against a hacker intent on using the \nweakest link to penetrate a computer system that reaches, and could impact, other entities \nand systems. \nIn the United States we have over 6, 000 banks, and many are small institutions \nwith modest information technology teams w ho often have job re sponsibilities beyond \ncyber-security.  These smaller financial inst itutions do not have regular access to national \nsecurity briefings and often rely on outside vendors or third-party processors, many of \nwhom may also be relatively small organizatio ns with limited cyber-security capabilities.  \nDespite their best efforts, such institutions  may provide determined intruders the least \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M.

So \nbolstering the awareness and defe nses of these sorts of smaller organizations should be a \npriority.   \nSharing actionable information about cyber attacks has the potential to \nsignificantly improve a firm’s preparedness.  Some larger institutions have committed to share cyber-threat information in a mo re real-time manner, or through industry \ncollaboration forums such as the Financ ial Services-Information Sharing Analysis \nCenter\n17.  Still, many government agencies and cy ber-security firms are reticent to share \ninformation and discuss problems because of potential legal liabilit ies, or reputational \nrisk concerns. \nIn 2014, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston began a pilot program focused on \nthe sharing of cyber-threat information by, and among, small- to medium-sized banks.  \nThis pilot, for a specific segment of a single industry, was very successful.  We intend to \nexpand the program in 2015.  Importantly, the program is not part of our supervisory \noversight of banks, but instead is conducte d by Boston Fed cyber-security experts, who \ncan share information about emerging threats and mitigants.  All participants sign a non-\ndisclosure legal agreement that stipulates th at the information provided is shared for the \nsole purpose of allowing members to improve  their own cyber defenses, and cannot be \nused for any other purpose.18  While still in the early stages  of implementation, the initial \nresults are encouraging.  The experience to da te highlights that more peer sharing for \ngroups of smaller institutions has the potential to help thwa rt cyber criminals’ potential \nentry to the payment systems. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M.

A key focus is \nsharing cyber threat information.  The Bost on Fed facilitates mont hly “Cyber Tuesdays” \nto enable discussion among security practitione rs on emerging issues and the state of the \ncyber threat environment. \nAnd earlier this week, the Federal Reserve System issued a paper on Strategies \nfor Improving the U.S. Payment System .\n19    A key strategy highlighted in the paper \ninvolves working “to reduce fraud risk and adva nce the safety, securi ty and resiliency of \nthe payment system.”  The paper notes the Federal Reserve belief that security is the foundation of any payment system, and our intent to work with a wide range of stakeholders to promote an environment wh ere end-to-end payments security preserves \nprivacy and integrity, commands high public confidence, and improves continuously in \nresponse to evolving threats.  The pape r has a somewhat different focus, but \ncomplements, what I’ve talked about today.\n 20    \n \nConcluding Observations \nCyber security is a serious financial stab ility concern.  The potential for loss of \ntrust in payment systems due to incursions or disruption is a key consideration.  Beyond \nintrusions with financial motiv ation, the increased ac tivity of rogue states  or entities in \nwhat is essentially cyber warfar e or cyber terrorism changes a nd elevates the nature of the \nprotections necessary.21   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Easter n Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVE RY \n \n  \n 12In general, central banks need to focu s on how best to address this emerging \nconcern and play a proactive role in assuring the cyber resiliency of payment systems.  \nGiven privacy and secrecy concerns, open communication of threats and mitigants is often problematic.  And as I discussed t oday, the rapid technol ogical evolution of \npayment systems has resulted in a highly frag mented and diffuse regulatory framework.  \nThere are serious challenges and obstacles to comprehensive solutions.  Central banks are \nessential to this discussion and to the progr ess that needs to be made.  And given the \nimportance of a safe and available paymen t system to the functioning of a nation’s \neconomy, investment in core aspects of system s to ensure they are as secure and cyber \nresilient as possible must be a national priority.   \nOur efforts cannot focus solely on preventi ng incursions, because almost certainly \nsomeone will ultimately breach many cyber defe nses.  The focus should also be on rapid \ndetection, limiting damage, and rapid remediation of damaged resources. \nBecause the weakest link provides the grea test opportunity for intruders, focusing \nsolely on the largest players is unwise.  Wh ether a financial institution is located in \nNorthern Maine or near the tip of South Africa, cyber threats know no borders – and \nneither geography nor small size insulate inst itutions, and the payment systems that they \nare part of, from risk.  There are opportuni ties for central banks to play a more active \nleadership role in this area.   \nThank you. \n   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M.

For example, The Bank for International Settlements’ Committee \non Payments and Market Infrastruct ure has highlighted the need for more cyber readiness for financial \nmarket infrastructures, and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has a working \ngroup focused on raising regulator awareness and improving bank supervision of cyber risk – but \nactionable items are lacking and the Federal Reserve’s Financial Advisory Council has highlighted the need for more sharing of information.  \n \n2 Many consumers with credit or debit cards have experienced the downstream effects of cyber crime.  \nThese include the irritation and hassle of a card transaction being denied, or having cards frequently \nreplaced, or having one’s personal information or paym ent identity stolen, or seeing fraudulent transactions \nthat cause financial or reputational harm.    \n3 The hackers are no longer just using the information themselves, but selling it to criminal computer \nscientists and “quants” that correlate it with other stolen data to make it even more valuable. \n \n4 Many low cost or free automated tools for doing so are, unfortunately, available – even to unsophisticated \nattackers. \n \n5 A number equivalent to almost 25 percent of annual  U.S. GDP \n \n6 See http://www.newyorkfed.org/abou tthefed/fedpoint/fed36.html  \n \n7 An example of a wholesale payments problem was the system disruption of the Bank of England’s \nClearing House Automated Payments System (CHAPS) which went down for technical issues and resulted \nin the disruption of 2,450 home sales.  \n8 Such as a credit card, debit card, mobile phone, or computer. \n \n9 Javelin Strategy and Research estimates fraud lo sses from bank and credit card accounts was $16 billion \nlast year, up 45 percent from the previous year.  However, this probably underestimates the costs of \nforensic work, law enforcement activities, fraud monitoring, and additional system changes taken to avoid repetition of the problem. \n \n10 E.g., the complex operating struct ure, the multi-faceted regulatory en vironment, and diffuse governance. \n \n11 Although, as we witnessed in the financial cr isis with subprime mortgages and products like \ncollateralized debt obligations, systemic issues can deve lop across intermediaries based on indirect factors, \nsuch as a loss of confidence – as happ ened to Lehman Brothers and AIG.   \n \n12 While wholesale funding was most impacted, the in fluence on consumer confidence was important.  In \nsome areas, runs on ATMs occurred.  \n \n13 See http://www.ny.frb.org/re search/epr/02v08n2/0211mcan/0211mcan.html  \n \n14 See http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs /press/bcreg/2003/20030408/default.htm  \n \n15 i.e., not waiting until a significant intrusion has wreaked havoc for one or more payment systems. \n \n16 See http://www.whitehouse.gov /the-press-office/2015/01/13/remarks-president-national-cybersecurity-\ncommunications-integration-cent  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 1 \n \n \n \n \nRemarks at a Panel Discussion on \n“Monetary Policy Normalization: Graceful \nExit or Bumpy Ride?”  \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nNational Association for Business Economics / \nAmerican Economic As sociation Meetings  \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nJanuary 3, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \nI am happy to be participating on today’s panel, especially since the topic is \nmonetary policy normalization .  At the AEA’s annual meetings since 2008, my sense is \nthat monetary policy discussions have not had the word “normal” in the title.  It is a \npleasure to be seeing the types of economic conditions where su ch a discussion is not just \ntheoretical – where the economy has improve d enough for the discussion to move from \nwhether  normalization will occur to when  normalization will occur. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 2As I begin, I would note as I always do that  the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at  the Federal Reserve’ s Board of Governors \nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  In the year just past, the monetary po licy environment has been quite stable – \nperhaps surprisingly st able, given the number of significan t monetary policy events that \ntranspired.  Over the past year, we have s een new leadership at the Fed, in both a new \nChair and Vice Chair.  The Committee wound down and ended its bond purchase program, and provided a revise d exit strategy.  The FOMC ha s also shifted the FOMC \nstatement from providing forward gui dance tied to labor market outcomes\n1 to a “patient” \npolicy that is not time dependent.2 \nThis  all occurred in the context of a falling unemployment rate, a below-target \ninflation rate, a rising stock market, and falling long-term interest rates.  As the second \npart of the title to this session suggests – “Graceful Exit or Bumpy Ride” – such good \nfortune cannot, of course, be automatically assumed for the coming year. \n Any change in policy, monetary or othe rwise, has the potential for unanticipated \neffects.  In assessing the poten tial consequences of a patie nt monetary policy response, \nfor example, some observers worry that such a policy entails significant risks of \novershooting full employment, overheating financial markets, or even causing \nundesirably high inflation.  I would note, howev er, that the last time the FOMC raised \nrates after a recession in June of 2004, the une mployment rate was at 5.6 percent, below \nour current 5.8 percent, and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation was at \n2.8 percent, well above its current reading of 1.2 percent.  Some worry that patience will \nmean deferring the first rate increase until well past the arrival of economic conditions \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 3that historically result in tightening, but I would point out that we have some way to go \nbefore reaching those conditions, and so ha ve not been unusually patient as yet.  \n While many market participants are understandably concerned about the exact \ntiming of a rate liftoff, it is important to recall that economic forecasts are imperfect and \npredictions of turning points are particularly  imprecise. While we w ould all like to know \nwhen the liftoff will occur, it is not possible to predict the relevant economic conditions \nwith enough precision to pinpoint the point in time at which a data-driven liftoff will be \nappropriate. Furthermore, while market par ticipants worry about whether liftoff will \noccur in April, June, or August, in fact most models imply that the macroeconomic \nimplications of such differences are quite sm all.  Indeed, such circumstances remind us \nthat monetary policy can be as much art as science.   \nAs such, there are a few key questions to  consider at this juncture:  Is the \neconomy clearly on a sustainable path to fu ll employment and the 2 percent inflation \ntarget?  Will that path be sustained as policy accommodation is removed?  Can we be \nquite confident that the risks to the forecast will not materialize a nd perhaps result in a \nneed to reverse policy, particularly consider ing the policy challeng es when short-term \nrates are bounded by zero?     \nAs I consider these questions for this cycl e, I believe the continued very low core \ninflation and wage growth nu mbers provide ample justificat ion for patience.  A patient \napproach to policy is prudent until we can mo re confidently expect that inflation will \nreturn to the Fed’s 2 percent target over th e next several years.  Such patience also \nprovides support to labor ma rkets, boosting the prospect s of the many Americans who \nwere adversely impacted by the financial cr isis, severe recessi on, and slow recovery. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 4 Today I would like to discuss how I thi nk about a so-called “exit strategy” in the \ncontext of a patient monetary policy.  I w ill first compare current economic conditions to \nthe conditions prevalent at the time of the last two rate lif toffs following recessions.  I \nwill then discuss some of the differences that may make an exit from accommodative monetary policy more complicat ed this time compared with  the previous two economic \nrecoveries.  I will then disc uss the impact of previous liftoffs on economic and financial \nvariables and what that history may portend as  normalization becomes appropriate in the \nUnited States this time.   \nConsidering U.S. Economic Conditions at Tightening \nThe timing of the initial tightening of s hort-term interest ra tes after a recession \ndepends on several factors, including the posi tion of the economy relative to the Fed’s \nmandated goals of stable prices and maxi mum sustainable employment, the speed at \nwhich the economy is likely to reach these mandated goals, and the likelihood that the \nrecovery is sufficiently vigorous that removing accommodation will not undermine that progress.  Because of the complicated inter actions of these and other factors, and the \ndifficulty associated with economic forecasti ng, I would argue that previous liftoffs can \nprovide only an imperfect guide  to likely future actions – bu t do provide some indication \nof factors that shoul d be considered.   \n  Figure 1  shows the unemployment rate with vertical lines indicating February \n1994 and June 2004, the months when the first ra te increase occurred after the recessions \nof 1990-91 and 2001 respectively (shaded in gr ay).  The first rate increase in 2004 \noccurred when the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent, a lower ra te than in 1994 and a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 5little lower than the curren t 5.8 percent unemployment rate.  In both 1994 and 2004, the \nfirst interest rate increase occurred sometime after the unemployment rate had begun to \ndecline, and in both instances , the unemployment rate continued to decline after that \ninitial tightening, with the ons et of tightening having no perc eptible effect on the steady \nimprovement in labor markets. \nFigure 2  uses another indicator of  the strength of labor markets: the growth in \npayroll employment.  In 1994, the first tighten ing did not occur until payroll employment \ngrowth was reasonably sustainable, and the economy continued to create jobs as the \ntightening cycle began.  In 2004, payroll empl oyment growth was less entrenched and \nsubsequent employment growth also was le ss solid than in the 1994 tightening episode. \nFigure 3  shows the other element of the Fede ral Reserve’s dual mandate – stable \nprices – using the inflation rate as meas ured by the PCE price indices. While this \ncomparison across episodes is a bit more complicated, given the possibility that the \nFOMC implicitly used a somewhat higher infl ation target in previous years, the PCE \ninflation rate was above 2 percent at the time of  the previous two initia l rate increases.   \nOne compelling reason for patience is th e uncertainty surrounding how quickly \ninflation will return to the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target .  Developed economies around \nthe world have been experiencing inflation ra tes well below the targets set by their central \nbanks.  With current core PCE at 1.4 percent and total PCE at 1.2 percent, current \ninflation remains quite low – and recent data do not yet indicate a cl ear trend back to 2 \npercent.  Such low inflation, and the risk th at inflation expectations may decline, are \nreasons to allow labor markets to tighten fu rther, which should spur wage growth and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 6increase the likelihood that infl ation will return to the 2 perc ent target within the next \nseveral years. \nFigure 4  highlights that the first tighteni ng in the previous two recoveries \ncoincided with relatively strong real GDP growth.  With third- quarter real GDP growth of \n5 percent (2.7 percent on a year-over-year basis) and the likeli hood of above-potential \nGDP growth in the fourth quarter, the economy appears to be growing at a pace that is \nlikely to foster continued impr ovement in labor markets.   \nFigure 5  contains a measure of compensation growth: the employment cost index.  \nGiven the improving economy, this index has be en growing more slowly than one might \nexpect, and also well below the experience at  the time of the two previous tightenings.  \nGiven modest increases in productivity a nd a 2 percent inflation target, we would \nnormally expect more rapid growth in compensation in a steadily improving labor market.  \nFigure 6  shows another important distinc tion between current conditions and \nconditions around the start of the two previous  interest rate increases.  The Federal \nReserve has substantially increa sed its balance sheet to help stimulate stronger growth in \nthe economy over the past six years.  My own assessment is that this is one reason why \nour economy is stronger and our in flation rate closer to target  than is the case for many \nother developed countries.  Nonetheless, the level of short-te rm interest rates understates  \nthe degree of accommodation the Fed has provided, given the much larger balance sheet.  As the normalization process progresses, the Federal Reserve will need to carefully balance how quickly to normalize short-term  rates versus how quickly to normalize its \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 7balance sheet – a problem not faced during th e two previous periods of monetary policy \ntightening. \nIn sum, three areas stand out as complica ting current discussions  of raising short-\nterm interest rates.  First, it is unusual that  inflation is still well below the Fed’s target, \nwith favorable supply shocks (for example, dramatic decl ines in oil prices) making \noverall inflation likely to be particularly depressed in the sh ort run.  Second, it is unusual \nfor compensation to be so subdued at a tim e when raising rates is under discussion.  \nFinally, it is unusual to have conducted nontraditional monetary policy that enlarged the \nFed’s balance sheet which will need to be normalized in conjunction with normalizing \nshort term rates. \n \nGlobal Complications \nThe global economy provides a potentia l challenge to policy normalization.  \nDuring most monetary policy normalizations, one sees a reasonably high correlation of \neconomic and financial variables across countri es.  However, in the coming year, it is \nfairly likely that there will be an unusual divergence, with some countries beginning the \nnormalization process while other industriali zed countries continue  easing domestic \npolicy.  \nOne of the key differences across countri es has been the divergence in the \ninflation experience, as shown in Figure 7.   While Japan has tended to experience a \nmuch lower inflation rate than most other developed economies, Europe and the United \nStates have had relatively similar moderate -inflation experiences, until recently.  While \nmost developed economies have been modes tly undershooting their inflation targets, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 8Europe’s inflation rate has continued to decl ine, and has recently diverged significantly \nfrom its target, registering inflation below 0.5 percent.  At the same time, U.S. core \ninflation has been reasonably stable at 1.4 to 1.5 percent, and the small effects of an \nappreciating exchange rate and falling oil prices should keep overall inflation quite \nmodest over the near term.  In part, this provides the opportunity fo r a patient monetary \npolicy, at least until wage and price pressu res are sufficient to ensure reaching our \ninflation target.   \nWhile many developed economies are in a similar position with respect to \ninflation, the likely trajectorie s for inflation may result in  quite different monetary \npolicies, at least initially.  Countries worried that disinflati on could lead to deflation are \nlikely to continue stimulating their economies,  while countries more  confident that low \ninflation is temporary (and will soon return to  their inflation target) will likely follow less \naccommodative policy.  This may result in a more divergent period of global monetary \npolicy than we usually experience du ring monetary policy normalization. \n As Figure 8  shows, short-term rates most in fluenced by monetary policy have \ngenerally tended to move together among devel oped countries.  With short-term interest \nrates moving together, there is less incentive fo r short-term funds to surge across national \nborders seeking higher returns.  However, with some countries tightening while other \ncountries are continuing to ease, exchange  rate and asset price dynamics may become \nmore complicated, creating yield differenti als that might spur cross-border asset \nreallocation. \n  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 9Potential Impact of First Tightening \nFigure 9  illustrates that the reaction of the 10- year U.S. Treasury rate to the first \ntightening depends on the context of the economy, and the expectations  surrounding the \nfirst tightening.  The first tightening in 1994 was not fully anticipated at the time and \nresulted in a fairly sharp in crease in long-term rates to a level noticeably above where \nthey ended up later in the normalization proce ss.  In contrast, the first tightening in 2004 \nappears to have been anticipated and thus di d not cause much reaction relative to the rates \nimmediately prior to the tightening or relative  to rates later in the normalization process. \nA complication with the pres ent cycle is the presence of unusually low long-term \nrates.  With inflation low, global rates low,  and large central bank balance sheets, we see \nlong-term rates are below their historical  average in many developed countries.  \nAssuming inflation does return to 2 percent in  the United States, a 10-year Treasury rate \nfluctuating around 2.25 percent is lower than on e should expect – unle ss investors expect \na negative real after-tax return  on average over the next 10 year s.  This implies that there \nwill need to be some upward adjustment in long-term rates during the normalization \nprocess.   \nWhile conventional wisdom is  that a cycle of tightening monetary policy is bad \nfor the stock market, Figure 10 shows  that has not been true during the past two \ntightening cycles.  In part, this is becaus e in those cases the tightening was initiated \nbecause the Fed assessed that there was suffi cient strength in the underlying economy to \njustify tightening. As it turned out, their assessment was about right, so the tighter \nmonetary policy did not derail the economy.  However, curren tly it is worth noting that \nthere already has been a significant improvement  in stock prices, and interest rates have \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 10been unusually low as a result of the de pressed economic conditions following the \nfinancial crisis – so the pattern  of the previous tw o tightenings might not be repeated this \ntime. \nFigure 11 shows that stock market volatility di d not increase significantly in the \npast two periods of normalization.   As  measured by the Chicago Board Options \nExchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), both periods of moneta ry policy normalization \nhave been periods of relatively low volatilit y.  High volatility of st ock markets tends to \noccur during periods preceding or during re cessions rather than when the economy is \nstrengthening and monetary  policy rates are rising. \n \nConcluding Observations \nClearly, an unusual set of conditions prev ails as the Federal Reserve considers \nbeginning a move toward more normal rates.  Both short-term and long-term rates are \nunusually low, and remain below their historical  average in most count ries.  Large central \nbank balance sheets – here and in many devel oped countries –  and very low inflation \nrates in developed countries are important cont ributors to current low rates.  Also, unlike \nin some previous periods, some countries will be easing while ot hers will likely be \ntightening, causing more complicated exchange-r ate dynamics.  These are all factors that \ncomplicate the period of normalization.   \nThe low inflation rates experienced globa lly may also allow for a more gradual \nnormalization process than typically occurs. W ith so little wage and price pressure, and \nrelatively slow productivity growth, it is po ssible that rates may not normalize at the \nsame level they were prior to the financial crisis.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 11In sum, the complexity of monetary policy normalization is more pronounced \nthan in 1994 and 2004.  However, as I noted at  the outset of my rema rks, the fact that \ndiscussion of policy normalization is now appropriate is a welcome change from \ndiscussions of monetary polic y over the past six years.  \nThank you.  \n                                                 \n \n1 Note that the January 2014 FOMC statement still had the phrase, “that it likely will be appropriate to \nmaintain the current target range for the federal fund s rate well past the time that the unemployment rate \ndeclines below 6-1/2 percent” \n \n2 The statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20141217a.htm  \nnotes that “Based on its current assessment, the Comm ittee judges that it can be patient in beginning to \nnormalize the stance of monetary policy.”",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 1 \n \n \n \n \nRemarks at a Panel Discussion on \n“Monetary Policy Normalization: Graceful \nExit or Bumpy Ride?”  \n \n \nEric S. Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nNational Association for Business Economics / \nAmerican Economic As sociation Meetings  \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nJanuary 3, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \nI am happy to be participating on today’s panel, especially since the topic is \nmonetary policy normalization .  At the AEA’s annual meetings since 2008, my sense is \nthat monetary policy discussions have not had the word “normal” in the title.  It is a \npleasure to be seeing the types of economic conditions where su ch a discussion is not just \ntheoretical – where the economy has improve d enough for the discussion to move from \nwhether  normalization will occur to when  normalization will occur. \n\n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 2As I begin, I would note as I always do that  the views I will express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at  the Federal Reserve’ s Board of Governors \nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  In the year just past, the monetary po licy environment has been quite stable – \nperhaps surprisingly st able, given the number of significan t monetary policy events that \ntranspired.  Over the past year, we have s een new leadership at the Fed, in both a new \nChair and Vice Chair.  The Committee wound down and ended its bond purchase program, and provided a revise d exit strategy.  The FOMC ha s also shifted the FOMC \nstatement from providing forward gui dance tied to labor market outcomes\n1 to a “patient” \npolicy that is not time dependent.2 \nThis  all occurred in the context of a falling unemployment rate, a below-target \ninflation rate, a rising stock market, and falling long-term interest rates.  As the second \npart of the title to this session suggests – “Graceful Exit or Bumpy Ride” – such good \nfortune cannot, of course, be automatically assumed for the coming year. \n Any change in policy, monetary or othe rwise, has the potential for unanticipated \neffects.  In assessing the poten tial consequences of a patie nt monetary policy response, \nfor example, some observers worry that such a policy entails significant risks of \novershooting full employment, overheating financial markets, or even causing \nundesirably high inflation.  I would note, howev er, that the last time the FOMC raised \nrates after a recession in June of 2004, the une mployment rate was at 5.6 percent, below \nour current 5.8 percent, and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation was at \n2.8 percent, well above its current reading of 1.2 percent.  Some worry that patience will \nmean deferring the first rate increase until well past the arrival of economic conditions \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 3that historically result in tightening, but I would point out that we have some way to go \nbefore reaching those conditions, and so ha ve not been unusually patient as yet.  \n While many market participants are understandably concerned about the exact \ntiming of a rate liftoff, it is important to recall that economic forecasts are imperfect and \npredictions of turning points are particularly  imprecise. While we w ould all like to know \nwhen the liftoff will occur, it is not possible to predict the relevant economic conditions \nwith enough precision to pinpoint the point in time at which a data-driven liftoff will be \nappropriate. Furthermore, while market par ticipants worry about whether liftoff will \noccur in April, June, or August, in fact most models imply that the macroeconomic \nimplications of such differences are quite sm all.  Indeed, such circumstances remind us \nthat monetary policy can be as much art as science.   \nAs such, there are a few key questions to  consider at this juncture:  Is the \neconomy clearly on a sustainable path to fu ll employment and the 2 percent inflation \ntarget?  Will that path be sustained as policy accommodation is removed?  Can we be \nquite confident that the risks to the forecast will not materialize a nd perhaps result in a \nneed to reverse policy, particularly consider ing the policy challeng es when short-term \nrates are bounded by zero?     \nAs I consider these questions for this cycl e, I believe the continued very low core \ninflation and wage growth nu mbers provide ample justificat ion for patience.  A patient \napproach to policy is prudent until we can mo re confidently expect that inflation will \nreturn to the Fed’s 2 percent target over th e next several years.  Such patience also \nprovides support to labor ma rkets, boosting the prospect s of the many Americans who \nwere adversely impacted by the financial cr isis, severe recessi on, and slow recovery. \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 4 Today I would like to discuss how I thi nk about a so-called “exit strategy” in the \ncontext of a patient monetary policy.  I w ill first compare current economic conditions to \nthe conditions prevalent at the time of the last two rate lif toffs following recessions.  I \nwill then discuss some of the differences that may make an exit from accommodative monetary policy more complicat ed this time compared with  the previous two economic \nrecoveries.  I will then disc uss the impact of previous liftoffs on economic and financial \nvariables and what that history may portend as  normalization becomes appropriate in the \nUnited States this time.   \nConsidering U.S. Economic Conditions at Tightening \nThe timing of the initial tightening of s hort-term interest ra tes after a recession \ndepends on several factors, including the posi tion of the economy relative to the Fed’s \nmandated goals of stable prices and maxi mum sustainable employment, the speed at \nwhich the economy is likely to reach these mandated goals, and the likelihood that the \nrecovery is sufficiently vigorous that removing accommodation will not undermine that progress.  Because of the complicated inter actions of these and other factors, and the \ndifficulty associated with economic forecasti ng, I would argue that previous liftoffs can \nprovide only an imperfect guide  to likely future actions – bu t do provide some indication \nof factors that shoul d be considered.   \n  Figure 1  shows the unemployment rate with vertical lines indicating February \n1994 and June 2004, the months when the first ra te increase occurred after the recessions \nof 1990-91 and 2001 respectively (shaded in gr ay).  The first rate increase in 2004 \noccurred when the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent, a lower ra te than in 1994 and a \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 5little lower than the curren t 5.8 percent unemployment rate.  In both 1994 and 2004, the \nfirst interest rate increase occurred sometime after the unemployment rate had begun to \ndecline, and in both instances , the unemployment rate continued to decline after that \ninitial tightening, with the ons et of tightening having no perc eptible effect on the steady \nimprovement in labor markets. \nFigure 2  uses another indicator of  the strength of labor markets: the growth in \npayroll employment.  In 1994, the first tighten ing did not occur until payroll employment \ngrowth was reasonably sustainable, and the economy continued to create jobs as the \ntightening cycle began.  In 2004, payroll empl oyment growth was less entrenched and \nsubsequent employment growth also was le ss solid than in the 1994 tightening episode. \nFigure 3  shows the other element of the Fede ral Reserve’s dual mandate – stable \nprices – using the inflation rate as meas ured by the PCE price indices. While this \ncomparison across episodes is a bit more complicated, given the possibility that the \nFOMC implicitly used a somewhat higher infl ation target in previous years, the PCE \ninflation rate was above 2 percent at the time of  the previous two initia l rate increases.   \nOne compelling reason for patience is th e uncertainty surrounding how quickly \ninflation will return to the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target .  Developed economies around \nthe world have been experiencing inflation ra tes well below the targets set by their central \nbanks.  With current core PCE at 1.4 percent and total PCE at 1.2 percent, current \ninflation remains quite low – and recent data do not yet indicate a cl ear trend back to 2 \npercent.  Such low inflation, and the risk th at inflation expectations may decline, are \nreasons to allow labor markets to tighten fu rther, which should spur wage growth and \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 6increase the likelihood that infl ation will return to the 2 perc ent target within the next \nseveral years. \nFigure 4  highlights that the first tighteni ng in the previous two recoveries \ncoincided with relatively strong real GDP growth.  With third- quarter real GDP growth of \n5 percent (2.7 percent on a year-over-year basis) and the likeli hood of above-potential \nGDP growth in the fourth quarter, the economy appears to be growing at a pace that is \nlikely to foster continued impr ovement in labor markets.   \nFigure 5  contains a measure of compensation growth: the employment cost index.  \nGiven the improving economy, this index has be en growing more slowly than one might \nexpect, and also well below the experience at  the time of the two previous tightenings.  \nGiven modest increases in productivity a nd a 2 percent inflation target, we would \nnormally expect more rapid growth in compensation in a steadily improving labor market.  \nFigure 6  shows another important distinc tion between current conditions and \nconditions around the start of the two previous  interest rate increases.  The Federal \nReserve has substantially increa sed its balance sheet to help stimulate stronger growth in \nthe economy over the past six years.  My own assessment is that this is one reason why \nour economy is stronger and our in flation rate closer to target  than is the case for many \nother developed countries.  Nonetheless, the level of short-te rm interest rates understates  \nthe degree of accommodation the Fed has provided, given the much larger balance sheet.  As the normalization process progresses, the Federal Reserve will need to carefully balance how quickly to normalize short-term  rates versus how quickly to normalize its \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 7balance sheet – a problem not faced during th e two previous periods of monetary policy \ntightening. \nIn sum, three areas stand out as complica ting current discussions  of raising short-\nterm interest rates.  First, it is unusual that  inflation is still well below the Fed’s target, \nwith favorable supply shocks (for example, dramatic decl ines in oil prices) making \noverall inflation likely to be particularly depressed in the sh ort run.  Second, it is unusual \nfor compensation to be so subdued at a tim e when raising rates is under discussion.  \nFinally, it is unusual to have conducted nontraditional monetary policy that enlarged the \nFed’s balance sheet which will need to be normalized in conjunction with normalizing \nshort term rates. \n \nGlobal Complications \nThe global economy provides a potentia l challenge to policy normalization.  \nDuring most monetary policy normalizations, one sees a reasonably high correlation of \neconomic and financial variables across countri es.  However, in the coming year, it is \nfairly likely that there will be an unusual divergence, with some countries beginning the \nnormalization process while other industriali zed countries continue  easing domestic \npolicy.  \nOne of the key differences across countri es has been the divergence in the \ninflation experience, as shown in Figure 7.   While Japan has tended to experience a \nmuch lower inflation rate than most other developed economies, Europe and the United \nStates have had relatively similar moderate -inflation experiences, until recently.  While \nmost developed economies have been modes tly undershooting their inflation targets, \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 8Europe’s inflation rate has continued to decl ine, and has recently diverged significantly \nfrom its target, registering inflation below 0.5 percent.  At the same time, U.S. core \ninflation has been reasonably stable at 1.4 to 1.5 percent, and the small effects of an \nappreciating exchange rate and falling oil prices should keep overall inflation quite \nmodest over the near term.  In part, this provides the opportunity fo r a patient monetary \npolicy, at least until wage and price pressu res are sufficient to ensure reaching our \ninflation target.   \nWhile many developed economies are in a similar position with respect to \ninflation, the likely trajectorie s for inflation may result in  quite different monetary \npolicies, at least initially.  Countries worried that disinflati on could lead to deflation are \nlikely to continue stimulating their economies,  while countries more  confident that low \ninflation is temporary (and will soon return to  their inflation target) will likely follow less \naccommodative policy.  This may result in a more divergent period of global monetary \npolicy than we usually experience du ring monetary policy normalization. \n As Figure 8  shows, short-term rates most in fluenced by monetary policy have \ngenerally tended to move together among devel oped countries.  With short-term interest \nrates moving together, there is less incentive fo r short-term funds to surge across national \nborders seeking higher returns.  However, with some countries tightening while other \ncountries are continuing to ease, exchange  rate and asset price dynamics may become \nmore complicated, creating yield differenti als that might spur cross-border asset \nreallocation. \n  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 9Potential Impact of First Tightening \nFigure 9  illustrates that the reaction of the 10- year U.S. Treasury rate to the first \ntightening depends on the context of the economy, and the expectations  surrounding the \nfirst tightening.  The first tightening in 1994 was not fully anticipated at the time and \nresulted in a fairly sharp in crease in long-term rates to a level noticeably above where \nthey ended up later in the normalization proce ss.  In contrast, the first tightening in 2004 \nappears to have been anticipated and thus di d not cause much reaction relative to the rates \nimmediately prior to the tightening or relative  to rates later in the normalization process. \nA complication with the pres ent cycle is the presence of unusually low long-term \nrates.  With inflation low, global rates low,  and large central bank balance sheets, we see \nlong-term rates are below their historical  average in many developed countries.  \nAssuming inflation does return to 2 percent in  the United States, a 10-year Treasury rate \nfluctuating around 2.25 percent is lower than on e should expect – unle ss investors expect \na negative real after-tax return  on average over the next 10 year s.  This implies that there \nwill need to be some upward adjustment in long-term rates during the normalization \nprocess.   \nWhile conventional wisdom is  that a cycle of tightening monetary policy is bad \nfor the stock market, Figure 10 shows  that has not been true during the past two \ntightening cycles.  In part, this is becaus e in those cases the tightening was initiated \nbecause the Fed assessed that there was suffi cient strength in the underlying economy to \njustify tightening. As it turned out, their assessment was about right, so the tighter \nmonetary policy did not derail the economy.  However, curren tly it is worth noting that \nthere already has been a significant improvement  in stock prices, and interest rates have \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 10been unusually low as a result of the de pressed economic conditions following the \nfinancial crisis – so the pattern  of the previous tw o tightenings might not be repeated this \ntime. \nFigure 11 shows that stock market volatility di d not increase significantly in the \npast two periods of normalization.   As  measured by the Chicago Board Options \nExchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), both periods of moneta ry policy normalization \nhave been periods of relatively low volatilit y.  High volatility of st ock markets tends to \noccur during periods preceding or during re cessions rather than when the economy is \nstrengthening and monetary  policy rates are rising. \n \nConcluding Observations \nClearly, an unusual set of conditions prev ails as the Federal Reserve considers \nbeginning a move toward more normal rates.  Both short-term and long-term rates are \nunusually low, and remain below their historical  average in most count ries.  Large central \nbank balance sheets – here and in many devel oped countries –  and very low inflation \nrates in developed countries are important cont ributors to current low rates.  Also, unlike \nin some previous periods, some countries will be easing while ot hers will likely be \ntightening, causing more complicated exchange-r ate dynamics.  These are all factors that \ncomplicate the period of normalization.   \nThe low inflation rates experienced globa lly may also allow for a more gradual \nnormalization process than typically occurs. W ith so little wage and price pressure, and \nrelatively slow productivity growth, it is po ssible that rates may not normalize at the \nsame level they were prior to the financial crisis.  \n\n* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *  \n 11In sum, the complexity of monetary policy normalization is more pronounced \nthan in 1994 and 2004.  However, as I noted at  the outset of my rema rks, the fact that \ndiscussion of policy normalization is now appropriate is a welcome change from \ndiscussions of monetary polic y over the past six years.  \nThank you.  \n                                                 \n \n1 Note that the January 2014 FOMC statement still had the phrase, “that it likely will be appropriate to \nmaintain the current target range for the federal fund s rate well past the time that the unemployment rate \ndeclines below 6-1/2 percent” \n \n2 The statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev ents/press/monetary/20141217a.htm  \nnotes that “Based on its current assessment, the Comm ittee judges that it can be patient in beginning to \nnormalize the stance of monetary policy.”",
