Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \n \nThe Economic Policy Forum Fall 2017 \nDepartment of Economics, Northeastern University  \n  \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nNovember 15, 2017 \n \n \n \nGood afternoon.  I would like to thank the Department of Economics at Northeastern \nUniversity for having me here today to share my views on the economy  and monetary \npolicymaking .  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Rese rve’s Board of Governors or on \nthe Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \nEach year at the January meeting of the FOMC, the Committee  adopts what is called the \nStatement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy .1  This document  represents the \nframework that th e FOMC will use to achieve the dual mandate that  Congress  has set for the \nFed: maximum employment and  stable prices.   \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n3 \n Let’s consider those two elements of the  mandate for a moment.  For much of the \nrecovery from the Great R ecession , the unemployment rate has been too high, and the inflation \nrate too low  – consistent with an economy facing serious  difficulties.   Those outcomes clearly \njustified the highly accommodative monetary policy that the Federal Reserve deployed .  \nHowever, more recently , as economic conditions have improved, inflation has remained \nstubbornly  below the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target ,2 while the unemployment rate has declined \nso much that it is now well below the level viewed by most FOMC participants as a sustai nable \nunemployment  rate.3   \nLow inflation would, of course, justify more s timulative monetary policy, other things \nbeing equal, while quite low unemployment might suggest tighter monetary policy.  How should \nthe FOMC balance the dilemma implicit in the current  readings on the se two element s of the \nFed’s mandate?  \nFortunately, the current S tatement on Longer -Run Goals provides  some guidance.  \nSpecifically, i t states: “U nder circum stances in which the Committee judges that the objective s \nare not complementary, it fol lows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into ac count \nthe magnitude of the devi ations and the potentially different time horizons over which \nemployment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with it s mandate. ”   \n In this, the Statement provides some useful  guidance for navigating  the current \ncircumstances .  First, Committee participant s must determine the magnitude of the deviations  of \nthe dual mandate variables from their desired levels .  Simply put , how far is inflation from the  2 \npercent goal , and how far  are we from maximum sustainable employment?   Calculating the \ninflation  deviation is straightforward ; the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure of \ntotal inflation in the U.S. is currently  1.6 percent , and the Fed’s  inflation goal is 2 percent , so the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n4 \n deviation is 0.4 percentage points .  The unemployment deviation, however,  is more difficult to \nassess, as maximum sustainable  employment and the related concept of the natural rate of \nunemployment are only estimates .  Central bankers must infer the  level indirectly, using \ninformation in wages, prices, expectations, and labor market conditions.  What’s more, e stimates \nof the natural rate of unemployment in the economy vary over time , due t o demographic and \nother changes in the workforce , or changes in the efficiency with which workers find jobs.   \nAs a result, there is unavoidable uncertainty  in gauging whether the economy  is at \nmaximum sustainable employment, and how large the gap is  – unl ike the situation with the \ninflation gap.  Still, today I will show  a few indicators that suggest  to me that even with  some \ninherent uncertainty in estimating maximum sustainable employment, the economy seem s to \nhave moved beyond that point in recent quart ers, and will likely continue to move further away – \nsince most forecasters expect real GDP growth to exceed potential for the next several quarters . \nReturning to the guidance  offered in the FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals , the \nCommittee must also e stimate  how long employment and inflation will deviate from the Fed’s  \ngoals.  This is a bit more difficult.  M onetary policy works with lags, typically long and variable, \nand there are many factors – other than monetary policy  – that impact inflation and \nunemployment .  In part for these reasons, forecasts of unemployment and inflation are subject to  \nsubstantial error.  Nonetheless , forecasts are the only means policymakers have for assessing \nhow long we are likely to deviate from the Fed’s dual mandate, so we must rely on them .   \nAt the same time, policymakers must also  be alert to  systematic errors in forecast s that \nmay reflect chang es in underlying relationships.  In this regard it will be important to consider \nwhy inflation has recently been coming in  lower than projected.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n5 \n Deviations from the Federal Reserve’s  Mandate  Goals  \n Figu re 1 provides total and core PCE  inflation since 2012.  Total PCE inflation is \ncurrently 1.6 percent, which – as mentioned earlier  – is 0.4 percent age points  below  the Federal  \nReserve’s  2 percent target.   \nWhile it is not surprising that inflation was below the Fed’s target early in th e recovery  \nperiod, when there was significant labor market slack, policymakers had expect ed inflation to \ngradually return to 2 percent  as the economy reached or surpassed full employment – as long as \ninflation expectations remained  well -anchored  around the central bank’s inflation goal .  Recall \nthat while the Fed’s  inflation objective is expressed in terms of  total  PCE inflation, reading s on \ncore PCE inflation, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, are  important because they \ngenerally provide a more reliable indicator of the underlying trends in inflation.  Earlier this year , \ntotal inflation exceeded the Fed eral Reserve ’s 2 percent inflation target .  But core inflation has \nremained below that  target for the past five years.   \nFigure 2  shows the  widely reported U -3 unemployment rate , along with an estimate of \nthe natural rate of unemployment from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) .  As the \nfigure indicates, t he unemployment rate has fallen steadily over the past five years, and is now \nbelow FOMC participants’ most recent 4.6 percent median estimate of the natural rate of \nunemployment.  It should be noted that this current  estimate of the natural rate is about 0.2 \npercentage points below the estimate that was published at the time of the December 2016 \nFOMC meeting.  At 4.1 percent , we are currently 0.5 percent age points  below the FOMC ’s \nmedian estimate of the natural  unemployment rate.  My own estimate of the natural rate of \nunemployment, 4.7 percent , has not fallen over the past year , and implies an  unemployment rate \n0.6 percent age points  below what I view as the sustainable  rate.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n6 \n Hence it appears that the weak inflation number is in opposition to (rather than consistent \nwith)  the strong employment number.  However, as mentioned earlier , the natural rate of \nunemployment  is not measured , but rather is estimated; as a result it is  of course  possible t hat \nthere may be more labor market slack th an is implied by Fed policymakers’ estimates of the \nnatural rate based on the U -3 unemployment rate.  I will turn to that question now. \n \nHow M uch L abor M arket S lack Do We C urrently  Have ? \nOne way to assess  whether the unemployment rate (the widely reported U -3 rate) is \nactually below its  sustainable rate is to see if other labor market indicators also indicat e a lack of \nslack in the labor market.   To preview the punch line, the data I will walk you through seem \nconsistent with labor markets being quite tight.   \nFor example, initial claims for u nemployment insurance  (which are derived from \nindividuals filing for unemployment compensation in their state , rather than from  the household \nsurvey that serves as the basis for the unemployment rate) , provide a n indicat ion from an \nalternative  data source.  Figure 3  shows the four -week moving average of initial claims for \nunemployment insurance.4  Despite the  spikes in the weeks around hurricanes, initial claims are \ncurrently at lows last seen over 40 years ago.  T hese lows could reflect firms ’ reluctan ce to fire \nworkers given the difficulty to hire replacements, or workers ability to quickly find jobs so that \nthey never actually file for unemployment .  Either explanation is consistent with unusually tight \nlabor markets.  \nFigure 4  shows similar information from a nother source . The Bureau of Labor Statistics \n(BLS) designates all working -age persons as either employed, unemployed (not working and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n7 \n searching for employment), or outside of the labor force (not working and not looking for \nemployment) .  The BLS provides data on gross flows  among these conditions  beginning  in 1990 \n– and the figure shows that the gross flow from employment to unemployment, scaled by the size of the labor force, is at its lowest point in decades.  This fact is consistent with the message from the initial claims data: separations from employme nt to unemployment are now rare.  \nFigure 5  shows the flow  of people moving from not in the labor force to unemployed, \nscaled by the size of the labor force .  This flow  results from new entrants to the labor force and \nfrom individuals who had previously stopped working , or stopped looking for work, but who \nhave begun to search for employment  again.  The current value is  the lowest point since the start \nof the Great Recession  and close to the overall low over the more than 25 years .  Such a low \nreading may  reflect firms actively seeking and employing workers who are not currently \nsearching , or who just began their search – or individuals who search and quickly find work.   \nFigure 5 shows that the flow of workers who are outside of the labor force moving to \nunemployment  is low,  but Figure 6   shows that the flow of sidelined workers moving to \nemployment  is high  (Figure 6  shows  the flow  of people from not in the labor force moving to \nemployed, scaled by the size of the labor force ).  These patterns are good news for individuals \nwho might have left the labor market when it was weaker, or who were discouraged from looking for jobs at that time.  But the patterns also suggest that the labor market is getting quite tight.  \nFigure 7  shows average hourly earnings and the employment cost index , excluding  \nincentive -paid occupations.  Both series have c learly been trending up over the past five years.  \nThey are now at levels roughly consistent with a long -run full -employment benchmark, t he sum \nof the  inflation rate plus productivity  growth .  However, because most forecasters expect that the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n8 \n unemployment rate will continue to fall – and remain well below the natural rate for some time  – \none can reasonably expect further increases in wages and salaries.  \nOverall, the data seem quite consistent with labor markets being quite tight.  All of the \ndata we  have just surveyed – U -3 unemployment below its sustainable rate, historic lows in \ninitial claims , labor flows that avoid spells of unemployment, and gradually rising wages and \nsalaries – are consistent with tight labor markets.   \n \nHow L ong Will D eviations from the D ual M andate P ersist ? \n Turning to t he expected longevity of d eviations from the dual mandate goals , I would \nfirst acknowledge that these, like all forecasts, are  subject to uncertainty .  As suggested above, it \nis well- known that forecasts of economic variables  have been subject to sizeable errors.  Still, \nFOMC participants’ forecasts from the most rece nt SEP can provide an idea of the expected \nduration of deviations, as well as the uncertainty surrounding these forecasts.  \n Figure 8  provides the unemployment forecast from the September SEP .  The chart shows \nthat the median forecast for the unemployment rate remains below the C ommittee’s estimate of \nthe long er-run unemployment rate of 4.6, and continue s to do so through 2020.  In addition, the \nupper end of the shaded area, which represents the range (or central tendency)  of forecasts , \nexcluding  the top and bottom three forecasts , also remains below 4.6 through 2020.  Clearly , \nFOMC participants expect the unemployment rate gap to be fairly persistent.  \n Figure 9  shows similar information for total PCE  inflation .  The inflation rate closes in \non 2 percent next year, and the median forecast hits 2 percent in 2019.  In addition, some \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n9 \n members of the Committee  expect to reach 2 percent in 2018 and to  overshoot the target  in 2020.  \nFigure 10 shows similar information for core PCE  inflation,  which follows  a similar pattern.  \n In summary, the forecasts of FOMC participants imply that the current and expected  \ndeviations from the inflation target are likely to be relatively short -lived .  However, the \ndeviations of unemployment f rom its  sustainable rate are likely to be persistent .  If one assumes \nthese forecasts are reasonable, then the  “balanced approach ” outlined in the Committee’s \nframework document likely implies a continued gradual removal of accommodation to reach a \nlevel of the federal funds rate that is closer to its longer -run value .  Indeed, the se forecasts of \ninflation and unemployment deviations generally assume some further increase in interest rates , \nwhich strengthens the case for additional tightening going forward.   \n \nAre FOMC Participants  Wrong A bout t he Inflation F orecast ? \n While the forecasts of most participants imply a return to 2 percent, it is possible that \nthese forecasts are based on faulty assumptions about inflation dynamics.  If one believes  that \ninflation dynamics have changed, one might prefer to wait to learn more about how – and \nperhaps why – inflation will actually evolve .   \n One explanation for persistently low inflation is the role of more globalized markets.  \nIncreased competition from  abroad might make it difficult for domestic firms to rais e prices.  \nWhile  a significant proportion of the U nited S tates economy consists of goods and services that \nare non -tradeable, and thus less subject to such pressures, a significant increase in competition \nfrom abroad could compress margin s for those sectors most impacted by foreign competition.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n10 \n Figure 11  shows the annual imports to the U .S., measured relative to GDP.  While there \nwas a large decline in imports relative to GDP as a result of the financial crisis, imports picked \nup in the immediate aftermath of the crisis.  However, over the past four years , imports have \nbeen playing a less significant r ole relative to GDP.  The falling share of imports seem s to argue \nagainst foreign goods  significantly replaci ng U.S. demand  recently . \n Another reason sometimes cited for changed inflation dynamics is the notion that the \nenhanced competition created by emer ging technologies has left firms  with  no pricing power.  \nFigure 12  provides a measure of after-tax corporate profits, after capital consumption and \ninventory valuation adjustments , over the past 50 years .  What is striking is how profitable firms \nare now relative to the past, which seems inconsistent with increased competition and a resulting inability to raise prices to maintain profit margins.  \n An alternative view is that there have been idiosyncratic p rice changes that have had the \neffect of artificially lower ing measured inflation in a manner  which should abate over time.  \nFigure 13  shows four  Consumer Price Index ( CPI) categories  – communication, food away from  \nhome , rent of primary residence, and own ers’ equivalent rent.  The communication component of \nthe CPI dropped significantly last spring as a result of change s in wireless pricing  that are likely \nto be a one -time event  – and thus will not have a persistent effect on inflation.     \nThe other three  categories  in the figure – food away from home, owner’s equivalent rent, \nand rent of primary residence – are areas that have been growing  faster than  2 percent.  H owever, \na recent Federal Reserve Bank of Boston policy brief by Luengo -Prado , Rao and She remirov \n(2017) indicates that these three  sectors have normally grow n even faster durin g periods  of tight \nlabor markets .  Their work finds evidence of a structural break in the inflation- unemployment \nrelationship described by the Phillips curve.  Figure 14  shows their results of running a statistical \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n11 \n model (more precisely an augmented sectoral Phillips Curve)  through the third quarter of 2010 \nand then forecasting what would happen to prices if the historical relationship between \nunemployment and sectoral pr ices was unchanged in the subsequent seven years .5   \nAs shown in Figure 14, on average, inflation readings for the three categories are \nundershooting their historical relationship by about 0.5 percent age points, due to their smaller \nresponse to tight labor  markets .  It is worth noting that these are not sectors that are likely to be \nparticularly impacted by global pricing pressures or new technologies.  \nThus, my own conclusion is that temporarily lower price s in the communication  sector  –  \nalong with the more restrained , but still noticeable,  response to low unemployment in these three \nsectors  – help explain the recent misses in the Federal Reserve’s  inflation target.  These findings \nsuggest that while inflation has been low , due to temporary factors, the pattern of observed \ninflation is still consistent with SEP forecasts of a gradual rise toward the 2 percent target in \ncoming quarters.   \n \nConcluding Observations  \n Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s  target , which might suggest added patience \nin removing accommodation, given that the economy is below the equilibrium rate of interest .  \nAt the same time, the unemployment rate is currently below the level  most FOMC participants \nthink will be sustainable , which would suggest the  additional removal of accommodation.  How \nshould the FOMC balance these somewhat conflicting factors?  The Statement on Longer -Run \nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy provides guidance  for following a balanced approach.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n12 \n While the se so-called  “misses”  in the mandate are  of rela tively similar magnitudes \ncurrently, most forecasts expect th e inflation “ miss” to be temporary , but the unemployment \n“miss” to be  more persistent.  While low inflation allows  monetary policy makers  to remove \naccommodation gradually, it remains the case – in my view  – that a gradual increase in interest \nrates is the balanced approach to reachin g both of the Federal Reserve’s  mandates in the next \nseveral years.  \n While it is possible that there is still slack in the economy, most labor market indicators \nseem  quite consistent with tight labor markets.  While it is also possible that inflation dynamics \nare changing, globalization and technology changes do not seem as compelling  an explanation \nfor recent inflation misses  as temporary idiosyncratic factors , coupl ed with a somewhat flatter \nPhillips Curve.  This inference is consistent with FOMC participants expecting to see a return to \nthe 2 percent  inflation target within  the next two years .  However , the unemployment rate is \nlikely to remain below its sustainable rate for a good deal longer .   \nMy own view is that it is quite likely that unemployment will fall below 4 percent, which \nis likely to increase pressures on inflation and asset prices.  In my view, that suggests  the need to \ncontinue to gradual ly remove monetary policy accommodation, which is quite consistent with \nmarket expectations of another increase in December . \n Thank you.  \n                                                           \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement -on-longer -run-goals -monetary -policy -strategy -fomc.htm .  \n  \n2 The Federal Reserve associates a 2 percent level of inflation with price stability and a well-functioning economy.  \n \n3 For additional discussion of what the Federal Reserve considers to be full employment, see  January 2017 remarks \nby Chair Janet L. Yellen  The Goals of Monetary Policy and H ow We Pursue Them . \n  \n4 The four -week moving average is used because it can be a noisy series –  for example, if disruptions from recent \nhurricanes caused short -term spikes in filing for insurance.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November  15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M.

I am very much looking forward to the presentations and discussions over the \ncoming days.   Before I begin , let me note as I always do that the views I express  are my own, \nnot necessarily those of my colleagues at the Board of Governors or on the Federal O pen Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \nLet me also provide a bit of context for the conference.  This year, our conference focuses \non a topic currently debated in Congress but longstanding  among economists – whether \n\n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n2 \n monetary policy should follow a rules -based approach, or focus on outcome s (like maximum \nsustainable employment and stable prices) and allow  policy makers discretion in determining \nhow best to achieve them . \nThis forum continues the Boston Fed’s tradition of  examining economic issues and policy \nquestions in a nonpartisan, data -focused way – with an emphasis on actionable issues that can \nimpact the economic well -being of all citizens.  Certainly, m onetary policy impacts all \nAmericans . \nThe extraordinary measures taken to combat the financial crisis and Great Recession have \nrekindled a longstanding debate: In pursuing the objectives mandated by Congress, is it in the \npublic’s best interest to allow  policymakers discretion in setting interest rates , or – as recent  \nlegislation would suggest – is macroeconomic performance enhanced if policymakers  adhere to a \npredetermined rule, for example, a “Taylor rule, ” named after one of our distinguished \nconference presenters,  John Taylor.  \nThe resolution of the rules vs. discretion debate will have significant consequences.  A nd \na hallmark of the Boston Fed’s economic conference is an engaged consideration of impactful \npolicy topics – monetary or otherwise – encouraging frank discussion and debate.  In that spirit, \nover the next day and a half we will grapple with a range of questions central to the rules vs. \ndiscretion debate  – and the way forward .  My colleagues and I hope this  conference provides a \nconstructive forum for the vigorous and balanced consideration of these i mportant issues. \n \n \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n3 \n An Overview of Policy Rules  \nPolicy rules have long been central to discussions of monetary policy.  I will cover some \nof the positive aspects, as well as some of the drawbacks.  \nOn the positive side, r ules can capture the res ponse of monetary policy to various \nconditions over a historical period, thus providing  an important benchmark and allow ing \npolicymakers to compare potential  policies to historical norms.  What’s more, i f the rules capture \nthe central bank’s actual behavior, they c an make inherently complex policies more \nunderstandable and transparent to the public.  T his transparency can also aid in communicating  \nthe current and prospective stance of monetary policy  – a task that has become  more impo rtant as \ncommunication s operate in real time, around the clock and around the globe, with information \nconstantly processed by financial markets.   Finally, such rules can provide more consistency  \nthrough time , even as the membership of the central bank’s policymaking committee changes .   \n However, in my view, policy rules can also have drawbacks.  Let me provide one \nexample.  Th irty-five years ago, when Frank Morris was president  of the Federal Reserve Bank \nof Boston, there was a raging debate underway about  monetary policy rules  – but the y were \ndifferent policy rules  than are currently used .  At that time, many economists were arguing for \nrules tied to simple money aggregates.  Frank was one of the leading voices at that time in \narguing that financial innovation had degraded the information content of money aggregates, and \nas a consequence, simple money -based  rules w ould be  poor guides for monetary policy.   \nWith the benefit of hindsight, I think it is clear that Frank Morris was right : simple \nmoney aggregate rules did not stand the test of time.  A review of the recent transcripts of FOMC \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n4 \n meetings (released with a five -year lag) – and more recent minutes, public speeches, and \ntestimony – suggest s very little time spent discussing moneta ry aggregates at the FOMC . \n No simple policy rule has been widely adopted to direct policy at central banks around \nthe world.  One reason may be that picking the wrong rule can entail significant costs : an \nineffective or inappropriate rule could produce di stinctly sub -optimal results for the economy.  It \ncould also be  quite costly  to a central bank’s reputation and communication efforts if the rule has \nto be  abandoned as a consequence.  \n More modern policy rules , as first described by John Taylor in his 1993 and 1999 papers , \nhave significant advantages over simple money aggregate rules, as they are firmly tied to the \nultimate goals that Congress has set for the Federal Reserve (t he so -called dual mandate of \nmaximu m sustainable employment and price stability ) and to which it holds  the central bank \naccountable.  While the U.S. central bank has independence i n how best to achieve th ese goals , \nthe mandate i tself is provided by a democratically -elected government.  Thus , a policy rule that \nguide s actions  (interest rate decisions ) to reduce misses in the mandate  (deviations of inflation \nand employment from their targe ts) makes intuitive sense.   \n In my remarks today, I will highlight why I view policy rules tied to the central bank’s  \nmandate as extremely useful benchmarks.  I will show , using figures from FOMC briefings five \nyears ago that are now publicly available, that FOMC participants do indeed regularly refer to \npolicy rules .  However, the key point is that such briefings  refer to a variety of policy rules  – not \none rule alone – as different policy rules can give very different policy prescriptions .  Small \ndeviations in the rule can lead to dramatically different policy outcomes.  Of course, the same \nrecord will s how that FOMC participants  refer to a number of other non- rule benchmarks as \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n5 \n well.1  My view is that it’s not just rule diversity that’s important, but  diversity in the overall \npolicy approach that builds in robustness. \nIn sum , I will attempt to document w hy benchmarking with policy rules  is essential  – as \nwell as  why legislating the use of simple  policy rules would, in fact , be quite counterproductive.  \n \nPolicy R ules as H elpful Guides  \n  Figure 1  shows the path of inflation over nearly 50 years.   The inflation rate certainly \nappears to behave quite  different ly prior to 1990 than after, with the earlier period reflecting  \nhigher average inflation rates and  larger  cyclical moves , and  the latter period showing less \nvolatility  and rates  centered around 2 to 3 percent.   \nCertainly , this change  in inflation dynamic s in part reflects central bank s’ efforts to fulfil l \ntheir key role of  ensuring price stability, which has been interpreted by many central banks as \nhaving an inflation target ar ound 2 percent.  As  central banks have consistently  worked to attain \na 2 percent inflation target, inflation expectations ha ve become “well -anchored” a round that 2 \npercent goal.   In fact, one of the major advantages of simple policy rules is that they can \nreinforce the expectation s of firms and households that inflation is likely  to re turn to 2 percent in \nthe future . \nFigure 2  shows the unemployment rate over nearly 50 years.  Unlike the inflation chart, \nthe broad dynamics  of the unemployment rate movements are more consistent over time .  One \nregularity of note is that unemployment always falls below its natural rate as the recovery \nmatures, and shortly thereafter rises noticeably above it.  While the Federal Reserve’s dual \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n6 \n mandate involves  achiev ing a low but  sustainable unemployment rate, the chart suggests that \nmaintaining a low but sustainable unemployment rate has been quite difficult.   \n Because policy rules that encourage monetary policy makers  to move interest rates to \nachieve low sustainable unemployment and price stability are well-aligned with the Federal \nReserve’s  dual mandate, i t is, in fact , quite common for members of the FOMC to use such  \npolicy rules as benchmarks.  Figure  3 shows the set of policy rules provided during FOMC \nbriefings from 2011, the most recent  period for which  memos and transcripts are now publicly \navailable.2  Note that  there are several policy rules shown, including John Taylor’s rules from his \n1993 and 1999 paper s, as well as other variants commonly used in the literature.  T he variants of \nthe rules all have the dual mandate e mbedded in the ir specification s – that is , deviations from \npotential output (roughly equivalent to full employment ) and the inflation target generate a \nprescribed federal funds rate.  \n While the rules shar e many common attributes, the ir modest differences can g enerate \nvery different interest  rate “ solutions ,” as is shown in the table presented in Figure  4.  Note that \nthe interest rate recommended by this set of rules for the second quarter of 2012 ranged from \nnegative 2.15 to positive 0.59.  This wide dispersion in policy prescriptions highlights how \nsensitive these models can be to relatively modest  modeling differences.   A second important \nfeature to note is that all but one rule result ed in a prescription for negative interest rates, with \nthe rule based on John Taylor ’s 1999 paper implying an interest rate of - 2.15 percent  – a rate that  \nmight not be feasible in practice, given the  powerful  incentive it would create for holding cash.  \n \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n7 \n Why a L egislated R ule Would B e Problematic  \nSince the Federal Reserve regularly refers  to monetary policy rules  in its monetary policy \ndeliberations , why not require the Fed to  follow a prescribed rule or a rule that it selects ?  While \nusing rules  to capture how the Fed has historically reacted to misses in the mandate is  quite \nuseful , as a benchmark, I would argue that rigid adherence to a rule would result in  a host of \nproblems. \n First, simple interest rate  rules do not capture the full range of policy instr uments \navailable to the central bank.  While some might view this as a positive feature of rules rather \nthan a design flaw, I do not.  Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has – necessarily, and \nwith positive results – expanded its balance sheet, changed the composition of the balance sheet, \nand changed the duration of the balance sheet .  \n Figure 5  shows the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over the past 25 years.  \nWhile the balance sheet was not used as a pol icy tool until  the Great Recession  and its aftermath , \nin my view, the Fed is  very likely  to need it again  in the future ,3 a consequence of living in a \nlow-inflation and low nominal interest rate environment.   Policy rules can , and – as seen in \nFigure  4 – actually did, imply negative short -term interest rates.  While modestly  negative policy \nrates have been used by some central banks, the existence of zero -return cash still makes the use \nof significantly  negative policy rates problematic  under current insti tutional arrangements.  As a \nresult, rather than adopt negative rates , the Federal Reserve, like many other central banks , \nexpanded its  balance sheet  when additional accommodation was needed .  And – a s Figure 6  \nshows  – the Fed also changed the composition of its  balance sheet , increasing the fraction of \nlonger -maturity Treasury securities, and adding government -guaranteed mortgage -backed \nsecurities .   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n8 \n Once short -term interest rates had reached the effective lower bound, t hese actions were \nundertaken to low er longer -term interest rates so as to provide additional macroeconomic \nstimulus, consistent with the negative -rate signals being sent by many simple policy rules.  These \nactions seem to have flattened  the Treasury yield curve  and reduced interest rates  relative to the \nTreasury yield curve.  \n Unfortunately, as I have noted in the past , low productivity, low population growth, and \nlow inflation targets imply low equilibrium nominal interest rates.  As a result, it is quite likely in \nmy view that short -term interest rates may again  hit the effective lower bound in future \nrecessions  – again necessitating policy tools not currently captured in most simple policy rules.  \n A second problem I see is that parameter s often specifi ed as constants  in simple policy \nrules have proven to be quite variable .  For example, i n many formulations of simple policy \nrules , the equilibrium real interest rate is set  as a constant.  However, Figure 7  shows that the \nFOMC members ha ve been reduc ing their  estimate s of the equilibrium real federal funds rate \nquite significantly.  ( This reflects changes in policymakers’  views of the rate that would be \nconsistent with no change in inflation and unemployment.)   Instead of being  constant, their  \nestimate s have moved – and moved enough to significant ly alter the expected number of quarter -\npoint increases required to reach the “normal” or equilibrium rate.  \n Another parameter that is often viewed as a constant in simple policy rules is the estimate \nof full employment or potential output .  Figure  8 shows that FOMC participants have moved \ntheir estimates of full employment quite significantly.  While I have argued elsewhere that these \nestimates may move too much, even more modest  changes would imply significant deviations \nfrom a policy rule that assumed  the natural unemployment rate  was a constant.   \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n9 \n  Proposed legislation covering  monetary policy rule s requires explanations , which  can be \naudited , for any deviations in the proposed rule – or deviations from the prescriptions of the rule.  \nHowever, Figure  7 and Figure 8 illustrate why such explanations might be needed at many  \nFOMC meetings, given the changing view s of economic relationships as we get more \ninformation about how the economy is actually responding.  And because such explanations \nwould involve estimates of inherently unobservable concepts that are subject to significant \nuncertainty, one can imagine that  discussion around these explanations could become quite \ncomplicated.  \n Figure  9 shows how the actual interest rate prescription emanating from a particular rule \nwould change given variation in key values – specifically, if one used values for full employme nt \n(the non- accelerating inflation rate of unemployment , or NAIRU) and the equilibrium real rate of  \ninterest that reflect the variation over the past five years in FOMC  participants’ median estimates \nin the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections , or SEP .  The first line examines the past five  \nyears using John Taylor ’s 1993 rule with an estimate of a real interest rate  of 2.25 percent and a  \nNAIRU of 5 .45 percent , similar to the assumptions in the January 2012 SEP.  The second line \nuses a 1993 Taylor rule with a  0.75 percent estimate of the equilibrium real rate of interest and a \nNAIRU of 4.6 percent , similar to the estimates from the September  2017 SEP.4  The two lines  \nare quite different , using the same rule but different estimates of the real equilibrium  interest rate \nand NAIRU – reflecting the actual estimates of  FOMC participants over the past five  years.   \nNote that the differences in the two lines are material, in the context of monetary policy \ndecisions. \n \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n10 \n Do S imple Policy R ules Capture Actual Policy Reaction ? \nFigure  10 shows  errors in estimating the 1993 Taylor rule, with recession shading and \nlines tied to various periods of financial instability.  The  chart shows that the simple 1993 Taylor \nrule does not do a particularly good job of tracking how the FOMC actually moved the federal \nfunds rate, particularly during periods of financial instability.  In a paper I wrote with Joe Peek  \nand Geoff  Tootell ,5 we analyzed how policy reacts not only to inflation and unemployment, but \nto financial stability concerns , as reflected in mentions of financial stability in the FOMC \ntranscripts.6  The paper more rigorously shows that concerns about financial stability , which are \nnot modeled in the Taylor rule, are reflected in FOMC actions.  \nThis reflects differences in how FOMC participants think about variables that the rules, \nand rules legislation , treat as constants  or are not included at all .  It also  possibly  reflects the use \nof different weights on inflation and unemployment rate misses, and the use of forecasts rather \nthan outcomes .  But it  also reflects the fact that , in practice, the  Federal Reserve reacts to \nfinancial stability shocks.  \n The leading example for  this point  is the last financial crisis.  In 2007, t he actual federal \nfunds rate decreased much sooner than would have been implied by the 1993 Taylor rule.  In the \ncase of 2007, a much slower reaction to the impending fi nancial problems would have \nexacer bated what was already a very serious economic downturn.   \nThe failure to incorporate financial stability, or anything that reflects “ tail risks ” rather \nthan expected outcomes, will not fully capture how policymakers react in real time.  During \nrecessions and financial crises, this can be a significant omission.  \n \n\n EMBARGOED UNTIL 8:3 5 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n11 \n Conclu ding Observat ions \nSimple policy rules are useful for many reasons , not least  of which is in capturing how \nmonetary polic y has reacted historically.  This makes these rules very useful benchmarks, \nproviding  useful guidance on how current policymakers are acting relative to how earlier FOMC \nparticipants reacted to misses o n inflation and full employment.   \nHowever,  a legisla ted policy rule that is rigid c ould lead to large policy mistakes , as key \ninputs to policy rules  that can change over time are estimated with substantial error.  From  my \nperspective, policy effectiveness will be better served, instead, by a  more robust  formulation of \nmonetary policy  that draws on a diverse set of guidelines and benchmarks  – which is the exercise \nFed policymakers conduct every six weeks for actual FOMC meetings.  \nThank you, and again I extend a warm welcome to all of you participating in the \nconference.  \n \n                                                           \n1 Such as : a variety of optimal policy simulations, equilibrium real rate comparisons, and alternative scenarios.  \n \n2 For more information on the historical use of monetary policy rules, see: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170707_mprfullreport.pdf  .  \n \n3 For additional perspective on use of the Federal Reserve balance sheet as a mo netary policy tool, see April 2017 \nremarks by Eric S.

It is a pleasure to be with you  in Montreal .  I’d like to thank the \nInternational Atlantic Economic Society  for inviting me to share my views on the economy \ntoday.  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express  are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Res erve Board or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \nEvery economic recovery  has its own unique puzzles.  Certainly , one puzzle  in the most \nrecent  recovery  is why it has been so difficult for central banks in many developed economies to \nachieve their inflation objectives , even as employment has rebounded .  Both Japan and the \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n United States are at or beyond many estimates of full employment, and the Euro  Area  has made \nsignificant progress toward full employment  – and yet, inflation in all three areas remain s below \ntargets set by their respective central banks.  One would expect robust employment conditions to \nnudge up wages and in turn prices, leading the inflatio n rate towards its target.  \nOne possible explanation for this puzzle could be  that what economists call the “natural \nrate” of unemployment – the unemployment rate  that is  consistent with a n inflation rate  at its \ntarget value  – may have fallen.  A lower natural  rate of unemployment in the economy  might \nexplain why lower actual  levels of unemployment are not driving up wages  and prices as quickly \nas some have expected .  In fact, Federal Reserve policymakers – the participants  in the FOMC – \nhave lowered their estimates of the unemployment  rate that they expect in the long  run. \nWhile it is certainly possible that the natural rate of unemployment for the  U.S. economy \nis now lower, I believe some caution is in order in making this assessment .  Short -run e stimates \nof the natural rate have tended to follow  the actual unemployment rate fairly closely; hence, \npolicymakers’ estimates of full employment1 tend to be  lower  when the economy is doing well \nand higher  when the economy is doing less well.  But with the benefit of hindsight , estimates of \nthe natural rate are  less variable  than initial ly thought , tracking actual unemployment less \nclosely .2   \nModest and gradual movements in the natural rate are consistent with the sense that long-\nterm economic trends , such as improvement in human capital and demographic chang es, are the \nmain source of variation in the natural rate.   Such chang es are unlikely to occur quickly  or in \nunexpected ways over relatively short time periods , such as over a business cycle .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n So, since I do not believe a significant decline in the natural rate of unemployment \nexplains the subdued -inflation puzzle, it remains just that  – a puzzle.   \nA second surprise in this recovery has been the relatively slow rate of economic growth  \nwe have experienced in the U.S. , despite unusually low interest rates.  While short -term real \ninterest rates have actually been negative throughout  the recovery  – clearly , very accommodative \nmonetary conditions – the economy has still grown at a rather te pid rate of about  2 percent.  A \ncommon explanation for this  dynamic  has been  that the equilibrium interest rate  – the interest \nrate that in the long run is consistent with stable inflation and full employment  – has fallen.   \nIn this case, the movement does seem more understandable.  What policymakers call \n“potential GDP growth ” has declined.  Indeed, FOMC participants are surveyed on their views of \nwhat the long-run sustainable interest rate , and GDP growth rate , will be in th e long er term – and \nboth estimates have fallen quite substantially.   \nHowever, like the natural rate  of unemployment , the equilibrium interest rate  can only be  \ninferred , rather than known.  The rapid decline in estimates of the equilibrium interest rate \nshould also be viewed cautiously, given the imprecision in estimation – and given how much \nestimates have varied over a relatively short time period .  \nThe relatively rap id changes in these estimates of variables  like the natural rate of \nunemployment and the equilibrium interest rate may of course reflect actual changes in \neconomic relationships .  However, they also may attempt to explain developments in “high \nfrequency” information with changes in relatively “low frequency concepts ,” and stretch too far \nin attempt ing to explain developments  in economic measures.  W hile attempting to infer possible \nlong-run changes or implications from recent high  frequency data may be  reasonable , history \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n shows that policymakers  tend to place too much weight on short -term fluctuations in their real-\ntime estimates of long -run concepts.   \nThis tendency is of more than academic interest.  One can make significant policy \nmistakes if one assumes  incorrectly that significant changes in long -run variables have occurred , \nwhen in fact no change has occurred.3  Central bankers  should hesitate to change their policy \nstance based on estimated changes in long -run variables that in statistical terms are n ot large , \nrelative to the standard errors with which these quantities are estimated.    \nIn my own view, maintaining negative real short -term rates once we have achieved full \nemployment risks the potential of an eventual overheating of the economy, which could be \nreflected in higher wages and prices , or higher asset prices.  Already -tight labor markets are \nlikely to tighten further as the economy continues to grow faster than its potential.  In these \ncircumstances, p rudent risk management would argue for the continued gradual removal of \nmonetary policy accommodation  in order to minimize the risk of outcomes that might \nprematurely shorten the current economic recovery.   \n \nRecovery Puzzles  \nIt is not particularly surprisi ng that the economic recovery , in the wake of a financial \ncrisis , has been  quite slow.  Studies of earlier episodes  find that recoveries following financial \ncrises  are usually  slow  – as firms and households are understandably more risk averse, and the \ncollateral values that are essential for obtaining financing are slow to  rebound.   However, what \nhas been more surprising is how slowly wages and prices are growing a decade after the onset of \nthe Great Recession.4 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n  Figure 1  shows the unemployment rate in the U nited States, the Euro Area , and Japan.  \nBy this measure , there has been significant improvement in all three economies.  In both the U .S. \nand Japan, unemployment rates are now below levels reported  immediately prior to the Great \nRecession.  In the case of the Euro Area, the unemployment rate  is still elevated , but is on a path \nreflecting  relatively  consistent improvement.   \n In contrast, Figure 2  shows that the progress on achieving stated inflation  targets has \nbeen somewhat disappointing.   In all three regions, inflation rates are currently below  their 2 \npercent  targets .  While there have been periods during the recovery whe n measures of  total \ninflation have temporarily exceeded 2 percent, the inflation rate has remained below target for \nmuch of the recovery.  For example , the total PCE inflation  rate in the U .S. over the last year has \nmost recently averaged  only 1.4 percent.  In Japan, the inflation rate has been particularly low, \npossibly reflecting a fall in the expected inflation rate due to the very long period when actual \ninflation has been below the 2 percent target . \n \nOne Puzzle: Implications of Low Inflation  \n During periods of subs tantial slack in the economy, it  is not surprising that wage and \nprice inflation are modest.  However, as we reach or exceed many economists ’ estimate s of full \nemployment, one might expect that wage and price pressures would gradually increase.  One \nway that economists try to capture thi s relationship is through the Phillips Curve, which \ndescribes inflation as being generated by expectations of future inflation and the amount of  \nlabor -market  slack in the economy.  One challenge of this simple formulation involves  how best \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n to capture the a mount of slack in the economy.   The measurement of slack depends on obtaining \nan estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.5   \n Figure 3  provides estimates  of the natural rate  of unemployment  and forecast s of the \nunemployment rate in the long er run.  The dark blue line  is the median  of FOMC policymaker \nestimates of the unemployment rate in the long er run, from the Federal Reserve’s Summary of \nEconomic Projections (SEP) .  Since this is a survey, the estimates reflect what participants knew \nas of the time of the survey.  Participants are asked the unemployment rate they expect in the \nlonger  run, assuming an absence of shocks and assuming appropriate monetary policy.  A second \nmeasure – the green line – is the  current  Congressional Budget Office (C BO) estimate of the \nnatural rate  over the same time period .  Since the financial crisis, the median estimate of FOMC \nparticipants has moved from a high of 5. 45 percent , to the current low of 4.6 percent.  The \nshaded region provides the SEP “central tendency, ” the range of estimates provided by FOMC \nparticipants after excluding the three highest and three lowest responses.  At times , even though \nthe range is quite large , the bottom of the range lies above the CBO estimate of full employment , \nas it does  from mid-2011  through 2015.  \n How reasonable are the estimates of the natural rate?  The range of estimates highlights \nthe uncertainty entailed  in measuring this key variable.  While the natural rate will change over \ntime, most of  those changes reflect gradual but significant changes in  demographic \ncharacteristics of  the labor force.  For example, when (typically) younger workers  first enter the \nworkforce , they are more likely to be unemployed , as they may not as yet have develop ed \nmarketable ski lls, and are thus more likely to shift jobs .  In addition, they are  more likely to leave \nthe workforce  to gain additional skills through  higher education or training.  The opposite is true \nof more experienced and older workers, who have developed job -specific capital and are \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n therefore  more attached to their work and less likely to become unemployed or leave the labor \nforce.  So historicall y, when demographics have result ed in a higher share of younger workers  in \nthe labor force, the natural rate appears to have risen  – relative to times when  young workers  are \na small er share  of the labor force.   \n Figure 4  shows the share  of the labor force  between the ages of 16 and 24 and the CBO’s \nestimate of the natural rate of long -term unemployment .  The chart shows that with the aging of \nthe baby boom generation, younger workers have become  a relatively small er share  of the labor \nforce.   And, at the same time, the CBO’s estimate of the natural rate has declined.  \n Figure 5  provides the share  of the labor force – age 25 years and older – with at least a \ncollege degree, which has trended up  over time.  Better educated workers tend to have lower \nunemploym ent rates when compared with those with less educational attainment.  As a result, \none might expect this trend to be reflected in a lower natural rate of unemployment . \n While these figures  provide possible explanations for why the natural rate may change, it \nis important to realize that broad demographic trends are generally slow moving, well-known  in \nadvance , and thus straightforward to predict .  While these trends can make a difference and do \nseem consistent with the moves seen in the CBO estimate of the natural rate , it is hard to match \nthese broader demographic changes with relatively rapid and recent  changes in the estimates of \nthe natural rate  seen in the SEP  forecasts . \n An alternative  explanation of the degree of movement in the presumed natural rate may \nbe that forecasters are overly sensitive to current economic conditions when estimating the \ncurrent natural rate.  When the unemployment rate is quite high, we may associate too much of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n the higher unemployment rate to difficulties in matchin g workers to jobs.  Similarly, when l abor \nmarkets are very t ight, as is the case presently , estimates of the natural rate may fall too much.  \n Figure 6  shows the actual unemployment rate with  the median SEP estimate of the \nnatural rate , and the CBO estimate of the natural rate since mid-2014 .  The actual unemployment \nrate is now below both estimate s of the natural rate  – and estimates of the natural rate  are now \nlower than they were just three years ago.   The SEP estimates, reflecting real -time estimates of \nthe natural rate, move more closely with actual unemployment than the CBO estimate, which has \nthe benefit of hindsight. This suggests exercising cauti on in making our natural rate estimate too \nresponsive to incoming data .6 \n  \nA Second Puzzle: The Low Equilibrium Rate of Interest  \n A second foundational concept that is difficult to estimate is the “normal” level for the \nfederal funds rate  – or what policymakers call the equilibrium nominal interest rate .  As with the \nnatural unemployment rate, the equilibrium interest rate is a concept that cannot be directly \nobserved, but must be estimated.   Also similar to the natural rate, a good proxy fo r estimates by \nFOMC members of the equilibrium funds rate is their SEP estimates for the nominal federal \nfunds rate “in the longer  run.”   \n Figure 7  provides the SEP forecast s since 201 2.  While th e funds rate in the long er run \nwas estimated at  4.25 percent  early in the recovery , the estimate in the most recent SEP had \nfallen to 2.75 percent.  Like the natural rate, there is significant variation in these estimates over \ntime, as well as significant disagreement among SEP partic ipants at any poin t in time .  As the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n shaded region shows, the lowe r bound ary of the central tendency of the estimates of the \nequilibrium interest rate early in the sample are well above most estimates just a few years later.  \n As with  the natural rate, there are good reasons to  expect the equilibrium interest rate to \nchange over time .  In fact , in this case the level may actually  be more responsive to current \neconomic data .  If we think of the interest rate as determined by the balance  between savings and \ninvestment, then c hanges in the equilibrium interest rate will occur w hen the key factors \ndetermining aggregate saving and investment decisions  change.   These include demographic \nchanges, which can affect  global saving behavior  (genera lly younger workers save less, older \nworkers save more) , and changes in productivity , which affect the demand for investment goods \n(higher productivity generally spurs investment, as it implies higher returns per dollar spent on \ninvested goods) .  Increases  in the propensity to save will place downward pressure on \nequilibrium interest rates , as the higher demand for saving implies a lower required interest rate .   \n In this case, one might expect to see more significant changes as, for example, variables \nthat impact aggregate savings and investment can change.  In fact, SEP participants’ estimates of \nthe equilibrium interest rate have fallen significantly over a relatively short period of time.  \nWhile there may be more responsiveness to incoming economic data,  and changes like much \nlower current estimates of productivity should impact this calculation, one should be cautious \ngiven the inherent difficulty in inferring where the equilibrium interest rate will be in the long  \nrun. \n \n \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n Concluding Observations  \n While it is important that monetary policy be “data dependent,” it is equally important \nthat it not be too sensitive to incoming data  – especially when estimating important underlying \neconomic concepts like the natural rate of unemployment and the equilibrium in terest rate .  \nWhile underlying economic relationships can and do change, one should not be too quick to \nassume that relationships are unhinged as a result of expectation errors for “high frequency ” \ndata.  It is certainly important to adjust estimates of underlying relationshi ps when there are large \npersiste nt variations from estimated values , but too much sensitivity to incoming data can cause \nmonetary policy to be too easy in expansions and too slow to respond to recessions.  \n In the current environment, the low inflation readings have provided monetary \npolicy makers  the opportunity to take a  more patient approach to removing accommodation  than \nin recent recoveries , allowing a prolonged period of recovery in labor markets .  A gradual \napproach has many benef its, including the possibility of a long sustained recovery without \nrisking a significant over -reaction by monetary policy makers .   \nHowever, estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and the equilibrium interest rate \ncan be too low as well as too high.   In my own view, f ailing to respond to very tight labor \nmarkets with rates remaining  negative in real terms could potentially risk  unnecessarily \nshortening  the economic recovery , as rising inflation  or an episode of financial instability  \neventually cause s monetary policy makers  to have to act more forcefully.    \n Thank you.  \n \n1 That is, of the level of unemployment associated with full employment in the economy.                                                             \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M.  Eastern Time on Wednesday, Octo ber 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n2 See Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study, Changing Labor Force Composition and the Natural Rate of \nUnemployment , by Daniel Aaronson, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G. Sullivan.  \n \n3 For example, if central bankers had assumed in 2010 that the natural rate of unemployment had risen toward 9  \npercent , they would have been incorrect, as the data since then has shown.  \n \n4 For additional perspective on the economic recovery in the wake of the financial crisis, see October 2016 remarks \nby Eric S. Rosengren, After the Great Recession, a Not -So-Great Recovery . \n \n5 A common concept of slack employed in this context is the amount of labor ma rket slack, usually taken as the \ndifference between the actual unemployment rate and the rate that is consistent with full employment, called the \nnatural rate. When unemployment is at the natural rate, the labor market does not exert pressure to move the \ninflation rate away from the central bank’s goal for inflation (2 percent in the U.S.). Thus, this definition of slack \ndepends on obtaining an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, a well -defined but difficult -to-measure \nquantity.  \n \n6 Such movements in the estimates of an important underlying variable for measuring tightness in the labor market \nhighlight that estimates can be too sensitive to recent underlying data.  The CBO estimate of the natural rate tends to \nmove only gradually, consistent with sl ow moving demographic variables, while  the SEP estimates move much \nmore.  This suggests some caution in being too sensitive to incoming data relative to economic relationships that \ngenerally are believed to move only slowly.",

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nThe Money Marketeers of New York University  \n \nNew York, New York  \nSeptember 27, 2017  \n \n  \nGood evening .  It is a pleasure to be back in New York .  I’d like to thank the Money \nMarketeers for inviting me to share my perspectives  this evening .  At the outset, let me note as I \nalways do that the views I express  are my own, not necessarily those of my colleague s at the \nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \nAfter last week’s FOMC meeting , the Committee  announced that it would begin  to shrink \nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  in October .  In my view , this was a well -communicated \nannouncement designed to minimize any disruption  – which was advisable, given that there is  no \nprecedent for  the process of  shrinking the central bank’s balance sheet , at least at this magnitude .  \nThe announcement went smoothl y, and now with the balance sheet essentially  on “automatic \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n pilot,” Federal Reserve policymakers  can resume using  short -term interest rates as the primary \ntool for monetary policy.  \nAs policymakers  think about appropriate policy , it should be noted that discerning the \nunderlying trends in unemployment and inflation – looking through  transitory effects – is likely \nto be quite difficult  in coming months .  The impact of  Hurricanes Harvey , Irma , and Mari a will \nsignificantly c loud the interpretation of the economic data .  The challenge will be in trying to \ndifferentiate the temporary  — the pause and rebound in activity resulting from the storms and \nsubsequent rebuilding  — from the ongoing  trend .  Thus,  it may be difficult to be fully “data \ndependent ” in the near -term.  This difficulty is compounded by the fact that the Fed eral \nReserve ’s dual mandate  indicators – employment and inflation – are sending somewhat \nconflicting signals  of late: labor markets have continued to improve, yet inflation has slipped \ndown a notch this year .  \n For much of the period of recovery  from the financial crisis and last recession , inflation \nwas well below the Fed eral Reserve ’s 2 percent target , and the  unemployment rate was well \nabove the estimate d long-run sustainabl e rate .  Today, w hile inflation  is still undersh ooting the \nFed’s 2 percent target , the unemployment rate has  declined so much that it is  actually  below  \nwhat most FOMC participants see as the sustainable level of the unemployment rate  (and, as I \nwill note in a moment, it is likely to fall further) .   \nWhen the central bank’s dual mandate is “dueling, ” how should policymakers r esolve the \nconflicting signals?   Monetary policy must  be forward looking, so a key consideration  involve s \nthe likelihood that the mandate “misses ” will persist.   Peering into the future is always fraught  \nwith uncertainty ; but even so, it may be instructive to consider  where most  private sector \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n economists and policymakers believe that inflation and unemployment are headed  over the \nmedium -term.   Do they see recent inflation weakness as temporary, or a sign of things to come?  \n As I will discuss today, the forecasts of both Federal Reserve policymak ers (in the \nSummary of Economic Projections or SEP1) and private forecast ers agree that by the en d of next \nyear, inflation is expected to  be close to  target  while  the unemployment rate will continue to fall \n– and as a result, will  move  further  below most estimates of a sustainable  unemployment rate.   \nI share this forecast , and the assessment that  unemployment will be materially  below \nmost policymakers’  estimate s of the rate consistent with full employment . The likelihood of this \noutcome  poses  risks – specifically that an overheated economy will lead to price or asset -price \ninflation, risking the sustainability of the  recovery.  The last time we had un employment rates \ntrending toward  4 percent  (in the late 1990s) , the personal consumption expen ditures (PCE) \nmeasure of total inflation and asset pri ces had begun to rise, followed shortly thereafter by an \neconomic downturn and a significant r evaluation in many asset prices .  Thus , in my view,  \nappropriate risk mitigation would argue for continued gr adual removal of monetary \naccommodation, even though we are currently below the inflation target.  \n \nAre Recent Low Inflation  Rates Likely to be Transitory?  \nFigure 1  provides  the total and core PCE  inflation measures  over the past three years.  \nWhile the total PCE inflation rate briefly  exceed ed the Fed’s  2 percent inflation target earl y this \nyear, it has since fallen, and the total PCE inflation rate – the percent change in the index from a \nyear ago – is currently 1. 4 percent.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n In part, the decline is due to  some idiosyncratic  individual  price decreases.  Reductions in \nwireless phone plan  price s and lower prescription drug prices both resulted in declines in  the \nPCE inflation rate this spring .  And – as a matter of arithmetic  – these drops  will continue to \ndepress 12-month  inflation rates until next spring.  However , the effects of the hurricanes will \nlikely cause temporary  increase s in reported inflation over the next several months.  The \nhurricanes have disrupted refinery and distribution  facilities, temporarily elevating  gasoline \nprices , for example.   Of course, as this capacity comes back on line, gasoline prices will likely \nfall back to their pre -hurricane levels, imposing another downward imprint on inflation.   The \npoint is that additi onal “noise” in the data will make it a bit more difficult in the near term to \ndetermine the underlying trend in inflation, at a time when policymakers are eager to distinguish \nthe trend from the noise given the recent low readings.  \n Figure  2 provides the median forecast for PCE inflation at yearend 2018 from the past \nfive SEP report s.  The central tendency is defined as the range of forecasts excluding the three \nhighest and three lowest forecasts.  The median forecast , which had been quite constant at 2 \npercent , has edged down in the most recent SEP.  T he fact that the median  has dipped  below 2 \npercent and the  bottom of the shaded area  now extends a bit lower  suggest s that some FOMC \nparticipants believe we will still remain below  the target at the end of 2018.  Nonetheless, I \nwould point out that even the lower boundary of the central tendency , at 1.8 percent,  is still \nrelatively close to the 2 percent target.  \n Figure  3 provides the median forecast and the central tendency for core PCE inflation.  \nThe overall forecast for core PCE inflation is generally consistent with that of total inflation.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n  Figure  4 turns from Fed policymakers to those private forecasters taking part in the Blue \nChip consensus forecast .  It provides the consensus ( average)  forecast and the average of the 10 \nhighest and 10 lowest forecasts for PCE inflation for Blue Chip participants .2  The private \nforecasts are generally consistent with the SEP, but the chart shows that , unlike the FOMC \nparticipants,  at least some private forecast ers believe inflation will be above the Federal \nReserve’s  2 percent inflation target by the end of next year.  \n Overall, there is a broad consistency between FOMC participants ’ forecasts and private -\nsector forecasts.  The curr ent low inflation readings are viewed as transitory by both.  While such \nforecasts are still of course subject to errors  – possibly even significant ones – I believe \npolicy makers  should not overreact to low current inflation readings that are widely expect ed to \nbe temporary.  \n \nIs the Decline in the Unemploy ment  Rate Expected to be Transitory?  \n  Figure  5 provides the recent unemployment rate and a horizontal line at 4.7 percent \nunemployment, marking  my estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate  or the rate \nconsistent with full employment .  The unemployment rate fell below  my 4.7 percent  estimate  \nearlier this spring,  and is currently 4. 4 percent.  A small and temporary movement below the \nsustainable unemployment rate is unlikely to have much impact on wages and prices  – so again, \nwe need  to explore whether low and falling unemployment should be viewed as a temporary or \npersistent phenomenon.  \nFigure  6 address es this question by showing the median unemployment rate forecast for \nthe end of 2018 by FOMC participants , along with the central tendency.  The chart shows that \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n both the median and the central tendency of forecasts for the unemployment rate at the end of \n2018 have been declining .  While the bottom of the central tendency has settled at  4 percent  in \nthe two most recent  forecast s, the bottom of the full range (including  the three lowest \nsubmissions) has declined to 3.9 percent , indicating some FOMC participants now expect the \nunemployment rate to decline below 4 percent , even with the modest rise in interest rates .   \nFigure  7 shows that the Blue Chip forecast of private forecasters is quite similar.  The \nBlue Chip consensus forecast  now has the unemployment rate falling to 4.1 percent , with the \naverage of the lowest 10 forecasts now at 3.8 percent .  The number of forecasters who believe \nunemployment will stabilize at 4.4 percent or rise from there is quite small.  Thus, forecasters \ngenerally see the recent low readings for unemployment as persistent , and they envision \nadditional declines on average.   This is just the opposite of their views on inflation.  \n \nThe Potential Impact of Falling Significantly Below  the Full Employment  Level  \n Figure 8  shows the actual unemployment rate , relative to FOMC participants ’ median \nestimate  of the unemployment rate that is likely to be sustainable in the long  run.  As you can \nsee, i t is only recently that the quarterly unemployment rate has fallen belo w the estimates of the \nsustainable unemployment rate.  With the unemployment rate currently at 4. 4 percent  and the \nmedian estimate of full employment at 4.6, we are currently 0. 2 percent age points  below the \nmedian of what FOMC  participants  believe to be sustainable  – and as I have mentioned, that gap \nis expected to grow as unemployment falls further .  Notably, this has occurred despite a gradual  \ndecline in the level that  FOMC participants consider  sustainable.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n  Figure 9  shows the SEP foreca st of the unemployment rate made in  September 2014 ,3 \nalong with  the actual path of unemployment.  The forecast assumed that the unemployment rate \nwould fall more slowly than it actually did.  While undershooting the unemployment forecast is \npositive  when trying to reach  full employment, such misses are less desirable if they push the \neconomy  well beyond full employment . \n Figure 10  shows two measures of wage pressures  – average hourly earnings , and the \nwages and salaries component of the employment co st index  excluding incentive paid \noccupations .  While we have  only recently fallen below  the SEP median estimate  of sustainable \nunemployment, we can see that wages and salaries have been trending up over the past several \nyears.  Both measures were below 2 percent in 2012 and have gradually risen to approximately \n2.5 percent more recently.  An open question is how much employers and employees will alter \nwage and  salary expectations in increasingly tight labor markets.  \n Figure 11  display s the Blue Chip forecast , as of this month , for growth in average hourly \nearnings .  As mentioned earlier, the Blue Chip consensus forecast has the unemployment rate \ncontinuing to trend down.  The consensus forecast anticipate s that average hourly earnings \ngrowth will continu e to increase , and reach 3. 0 percent by the end of 2018 .  It is worth noting \nthat average hour ly earnings  growt h is currently 2. 5 percent, and the average of the bottom ten \nforecasters is 2. 7 percent for the end of 2018 .  This indicat es that almost all the Blue Chip \nforecasters are expecting acceleration from current levels.  \n One way that wage pressu res can build is if workers are  willing to leave their current job \nfor a higher -paying one.  As Figure 12  shows, very few workers were willing to leave their jobs \nin the wake of the Great Recession.  However, as labor markets have tightened, workers are \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n showing a greater willingness to leave their jobs in pursuit of  better opportunities.  With the so-\ncalled “quits rate” now close to the peak prior to the Great Recession, workers appear to be quite  \nwilling to leave their current jobs in search of higher wages.  \n \nConc luding Observations  \n The weakness in inflation readings appear s to be transitory, but some  one-time declines \nin individual prices will not fall out of annual averages until next spring .  In contrast, t he recent \nhurricanes will likely place some upward pressure on measured inflation over the next several \nmonths, a transitory shock in the other direction.  However , the declines in the unemployment \nrate below the level most  see as sustainable seem  likely t o be more long -lasting, which is one \nreason for my expectation  that tight  – and tightening further – labor markets will result in higher \nwages and prices over time.   \nTemporary fluctuations in prices may obscure the underlying trend  for a little while .  But \nmonetary policy tends to act with long lags, so it is essential that central bankers do their best to \nlook through the temporary toward the underlying trends.  Those trends, as best I can see  them at \npresent, suggest to me an economy that risks pushin g pas t what is sustainable , raising the \nprobability  of higher asset prices , or inflation  well above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target .  \nSteps l owering the probability of such an outcome  seem  advisable – in other words , seem like \ninsurance  worth taking out at this time.  As a result, it is my view that regular and gradual \nremoval of monetary accommodation seems appropriate.  \n  Thank you.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.

This is , of course , a welcome change from 2008  and the years that followed , when far \ntoo many workers experienced great difficulty finding jobs .  But my primary message today is \nabout the importan ce of achiev ing positive , but long-run sustainable , economic conditions  – full \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n2 \n employment and s table  price s (which the Federal Reserve defines as 2 percent inflation) – and, \nby extension , that monetary polic y support s such an outcome . \n Before I turn to these issues, I would highlight that economic data for the first quarter  \nhave been weak er than many  expected .  As the FOMC statement released last week1 suggested , \nand in my own view  as well,  this is  probably  a temporary lull  – and it is likely that the economy \nwill grow  at an average somewhat above  2 percent for  the rest of this  year.   \nOne reason is that much of the weakness in the first quarter was related to  consumption, \nyet personal income and wealth have continued to rise, and consumer confidence indices remain \nquite positive .  So m y expectation is that consumption  will re -emerge  in the second quarter  and \nwe will continue to have a consumption -led recovery . \n The employment report for April was also published last Friday.  Payroll employment \nbounced back from March, with 211,000  new jobs  – and the unemployment rate was reported as \n4.4 percent nationally, which is below my estimate of full employment in the longer run  (4.7 \npercent) .  In addition, the broader U-6 measure of unemployment  (which takes into account \nmarginal attach ment  to the labor force and employment that is  part time for economic reasons ), \ndeclined to 8.6  percent  – a new low for this recovery.  \n All in all , I do not regard the weakness in first quarter data as a harbinger of softness in \nthe underlying economy , and the strength of the labor market report on Fr iday provides some \nstrong confirmation of that view .  With real GDP growth in the remainder of the year likely to \nexceed 2 percent, and robust labor markets, and measures of inflation near 2 percent, I think it is \nimportant that the Federal Reserve  continu e to gradually normalize interest rates , and also to \nbegin to normalize the central bank’s  balance sheet .  Doing so, I believe, is the best way to help \nthe economy remain on a sustainable path.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n Some of the downside risks that observers have cited – such as relatively slow loan \ngrowth , and weak ness in the economies of foreign trading partners – do not seem  to me  \ncompelling reasons to slow down the gradual normalization of monetary policy .  I will return to \nthese topics in a moment, but let me share  my overall view that it is important to avoid creating \nan over -hot economy (one that could require a less gradual monetary policy  adjustment ).  And in \norder to avoid doing so , the Federal Reserve should  continue gradually normalizing monetary \npolicy .   This would imply beginning a very gradual reduction of securities held on the Federal \nReserve’s  balance sheet relatively soon, while continuing to use short -term interest rates  as the \nprimary monetary  policy  tool for maintaining sustainable growth – growth that is consistent with \nthe Fed’s  dual mandate  of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices .     \n \nGrowth Likely to Exceed Potential  \n \n With real GDP growth averaging just over 2 percent  during the recovery  – which is  \nmodest by historical standards  – labor markets  have nonetheless become tight.  For the \nunemployment rate to steadily fall even with such restrained growth  rates  implies that the so -\ncalled potential growth rate for the economy is now below  2 percent  (given  that the \nunemployment rate falls when actual economic growth exceeds potential ).2   \nFigure 1  provides a chart showing  Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates of \npotential growth , as well as population growth , by decade.  I n the 1980s and 1990s , the CBO  \nestimate d that potential growth was  over 3 percent, while their  estimate for this decade is well \nbelow 2 percent.  \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n A number of factors explain the downward trend in potential GDP , which is determined \nby the number of available workers and the amo unt of output that each worker produces .  \nSlowing p opulation growth accounts for some of the decline , as does slowing labor force growth , \nwhich has been affected by the baby boomers retiring and leaving the labor force.  Another \nfactor behind the slowdown in potential GDP growth has been productivity.  Most measures of \nproductivity growth have been declining, so that there is less growth in goods and services per \nunit of labor.  Given these developments in population growth, labor force , and productivity, m y \nown estimate of potential  growth  is 1.75 percent.  \n Figure 2  shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for real GDP through 2018 , as of May.   \nBlue Chip provides forecasts based on a survey of roughly 50 private -sector forecasters.  Their \nconsensus projection has growth more than  half a percentage point higher than my estimate of \nthe potential  rate.  As I suggested a moment ago, growth in excess of potential  would likely have \nthe effect of further tightening labor markets.  The green dotted border indicates the average of \nthe 10 highest and 10 lowest estimates  for real GDP.  Note that n early all  of the shaded region \nexceeds  the 1.75 percent  estimate of the potential growth rate . \n Figure 3  shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for the unemployment r ate.  Consistent \nwith their real GDP forecast, most Blue Chip forecasters expect the unemployment rate to \ncontinue to trend down.  It is worth noting that the average of the 10 highest forecasts  is only 4.7 \npercent unemployment, which is also my estimate o f the full employment  level , at the outset of \nthe forecast period .  For most of the forecast period, the average of the 10 highest forecasts is just \n4.6 percent. The shaded region between the 10 highest and 10 lowest forecasts l ies entirely \nbelow my estimate of full employment .  The average  of the 10 lowest forecasts for \nunemployment falls to 4 percent by the end of 201 7 and falls below 4 percent in 2018 .  Such low \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n unemployment rates would likely cause increased pressure on wages and prices , and signa l an \neconomy on a pace exceeding its sustainable level . \n In sum, m ost forecasters are expecting growth above potential and unemployment below \nthe full-employment  level .  This would represent an unsustainable , “overshooting”  pace – and \nprovides an important  rationale for continuing the process of normalization of monetary policy \nthat is currently underway.  \n \nPotential Risks to the Forecast  \n One concern that has been raised about the robustness of the recovery i nvolve s the \ngrowth rate of bank loans , shown in Figure 4 .  The growth in bank l oans has been less rapid  than \nin earlier recoveries , and o ne can look at both demand and supply issues for explanations .   One \nreason for the relatively slow growth is that , in the wake of  the Great R ecession , many firms and \nhouseholds sought to decrease their debt burden – which resulted in a depressed demand for \nloans.  In addition, many firms – if they survived the recession – found themselves with impaired \nbalance sheets that made them less able or qualified  to borrow .  Turning to issues with the supply \nof loans , I would note that historical ly, recover ies characterized by  weak initial lending also were  \nperiod s where a large number of financial institutions became troubled .  To maintain capital -to-\nassets ratios after  losse s – say in commercial real estate  – financial intermediaries have pared \nback lending (because loans are assets for banks) . \n While loan growth  has been slower  than in other recoveries, Figure 5  provides some \ncontext for the recent growth in  total and commer cial and industrial ( C&I) loans held by banks .  \nLoan growth for 2016 exceeded  5 percent, a pace  faster than the growth in nominal GDP.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n In addition, it is important to note that bank loan growth can understate overall credit \ngrowth , because many firms with access to capital markets satisfied their borrowing needs \nthrough bond issuance, ta king advantage of the historically low interest rates and lock ing in low, \nlong-term rates.   Figure 6  shows the gross issuance of investment grade nonfinancial corporat e \nbonds .  Issuance has grown and remain s robust.   I would also note that increasingly , smaller \nfirms have alternatives to banks to meet their financial needs.  Many smaller firms are turning to \nnon-bank lenders and “fintech ” companies or are able to access capital markets directly.  This \ngreater access to capital markets is very likely substituting for what otherwise might have been \nbank loans.  \n Many firms seek ing bank loans us e real estate as collateral.  Figure 7 shows the growth \nof commercial real estate loans.  Banks are rapidly expanding lending in the multifamily and \nconstruction and land -development  sectors , despite the relatively high valuations for commercial \nreal estate in many markets.  \n In sum , while bank loan growt h has not been as robust as in previous cycles, this likely \nreflects the nature of the crisis, recession, and recovery – and the continued substitution of credit \nfrom capital markets  and non -bank lenders for bank loans  – rather than particular  weakness in \nunderlying economic conditions.  In some bank loan categories  – such as commercial real estate  \n– it is actually surprising how rapidly loans are growing , given the prevalence of high valuations.  \n  \nRisks  from Overseas  \n Another source of concern  over the past several years has involved weak  economic \nperformance in  countries that are  trading partners  with the U.S .  Indeed, geopolitical concerns  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n are likely to pose some  potential risk to the U.S. forecast  for the foreseeable future .  However, on \nbalance, the risks from abroad seemed to have abated somewhat.  \n Figure 8 shows the increases in stock prices in emerging markets, Europe , and the United \nStates since the beginning of this year.  While U.S . stock prices have advanced, European stocks \nhave seen similar improvement s – and emerging markets have increased more than the U .S. or \nEuropean indices.  All this likely reflects increased investor optimism that the economic recovery \nin many countries is beginning to take hold , and the data for economic activity in the Euro Area \nand many other developed and emerging economies supports that assessment . \n Figure 9 shows the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) forecast for real GDP growth this \nyear compared to last year  – for the U .S., the Euro area , and emergi ng markets.  In the United \nStates  and in emerging markets , the IMF is expecting stronger growth over the next two years , \nwhich is consistent with the improvements in stock markets  that we see .  The  IMF outlook for \nEurope is essential ly unchanged, but given  the recent turmoil generated by elections in several \nEuropean countries, continued positive growth is better than some had been expecting.  \n While the risks of a slowdown from abroad will probably always be present in some \ndegree , this risk does seem to be  abating  of late .  Economic forecasts for growth are increasing \nand investor sentiment has improved.  \n \nThe Stance  of Monetary Policy  \n Figure 10 shows the federal funds rate  targeted by the Federal Reserve.  The Fed  began \nthe normalization process in December 2015 by raising the federal funds target range to 25 to 50 \nbasis points.  Since that initial hike, the FOMC has  increased the rates two  additional times, in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n December 2016 and March 2017.  The target range for th e federal funds rate is currently between \n75 and 100 basis points.  \n Despite the three  25-basis point increases in the federal funds rate  target  range , U.S. \nmonetary policy remains quite accommodative.  Short -term nominal interest rates are below the \ninflation rate, so the real interest rate remains negative  (the real rate is simply the nominal rate \nminus inflation) .  In addition, as mentioned earlier, most forecasters expect growth to exceed  \npotential.  With  conditions now consistent with full employment and the Fed’s  inflation  target , in \nmy view , monetary policy makers  should certainly continue on the path of gradual normalization , \nand continue to explore its pace . \n The Federal Reserve has a nother monetary policy  tool, as depicted  in Figure 11.  During \nthe financial crisis  and its aftermath , when short -term interest rates approached zero the central \nbank  needed to find other ways to return the economy to full employment and the 2 percent \ninflation  target associated with price stability .  Since short -term rates were essentially at zero, the \nFed lowered long -term interest rates by buying long -term Treasury securities and agency \nmortgage -backed  securities  (MBS) .  The result was an expanded central ban k balance sheet  that \nreach ed roughly $4.5 trillion  in assets . \n Looking ahead, t he federal funds rate would  obviously exceed 1 percent after one more \n25 basis -point increase.  In my view, that seems an appropriate point to consider beginning a \nvery gradual normalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  I believe the Fed should do \nso gradually, so that the reduction in the balance sheet is not disruptive, and so that it c an occur \nlargely in the background .  This would maintain the Federal Reserve’s focus on the federal funds \nrate as the primary instrument of monetary policy.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n  Figure 12 provides the most recent forecast for the federal funds rate  from Fed \npolicymakers , based on the most recent  Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) .  The dark \nline, the median forecast for the federal funds rate , increases gradually  over the next two and a \nhalf years, peaking at 3 percent .  The median forecast among policymakers is for  two more \nincreases for this year.  My own view remains  that along with a gradual reduction in the level of \nthe balance sheet , it would  still be reasonable to have three rate increases over the remainder  of \nthis year , assuming the economy evolves like my forec ast envisions . \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would point out that t he first quarter ’s real GDP and \ninflation numbers proved to be  somewhat weaker than many  expected, but I do view these as a \ntransitory phenomenon .  My expectation is that the economy will remain on solid footing , with \nthe unemployment rate likely to continue falling  and already likely  below its sustainable level, \nand inflation fluctuating around 2 percent.   \nMy view is that such conditions justify continuing a gradual increase in the federal funds \nrate and also beginning to reduce gradually the level of the assets on the Federal Reserve’s \nbalance sheet.   As long as the balance sheet reduction is not steep , it should have only modest \neffects on cred it markets  – in other words it  can be gradually reduced “in the background .”  That \nwill allow Fed policymakers  to focus primarily on gradual normaliz ation of  the federal funds \nrate, using it as the primary vehicle for attaining sustainable growth , full employment , and price \nstability at 2 percent inflation.   \nThank you.    \n  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 2:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wedn esday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n                                                            \n \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170503a.htm . \n \n2 An economy growing at  potential is one that keeps the degree of resource utilization stable over time. In particular, \na stable unemployment rate is an indication that the economy is growing at potential. Periods of declining \nunemployment rate signal that GDP is growing above p otential, and vice versa when the unemployment rate is \nincreasing. In the earlier stages of the recovery, it was important for the economy to grow faster than potential in \norder to raise the degree of resource utilization and bring the unemployment rate do wn. At the current stage of the \nrecovery, however, continued growth above potential runs the risk of overheating the economy. The potential \ngrowth rate of the economy needs to be inferred from the data, and it depends on the long -run growth rate of the \nlabor force and productivity. While in the short run labor force and productivity can be affected by cyclical factors, \nin the longer run labor supply is largely driven by demographic trends and productivity by technological progress. \nThere is uncertainty asso ciated with the rate of growth of potential, despite the fact that some demographic \ndevelopments are relatively easy to predict. This uncertainty notwithstanding, the average pace of GDP growth \nduring the recovery has been enough to bring the unemployment rate down. As a result, over this period the \npotential growth rate of the U.S. economy has been less than 2 percent.",

I would like to thank the S tern School of Business  for inviting me to \nshare my perspectives today.  Before I begin , let me note as I always do that the views I express \ntoday are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues  at the Federal Reserve’s Board of \nGovernors or on the Federal Open Market Committ ee (the FOMC).  \n As with almost any market where prices have risen quickly , commercial real estate \npresents  a variety of positive fundamentals .  While my remarks today focus on commercial real \nestate, other asset classes have experienced increases in valuation, including the equity markets \n\n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n2 \n and certain fixed -income markets.  I would like to begin my talk today by  highlighting some of \nthe positive f undamentals or  strong “tailwinds. ”   \nFirst, macroeconomic conditions during this economic recovery have been favorable  in \nsome respects .  Inflation has remained quite stable , fluctuating around 2 percent.  M onetary \npolicy has been quite accommodative, with the federal funds rate still quite low by historical \nstandards , and the central bank maintaining an enlarged balance sheet that has held down longer -\nterm rates.   \nA second favorable factor is the relative strength in the United States compared with the \nrest of the world.  Many f oreign economies ’ recoveries  have lagg ed behind the U .S., where we \nhave seen stabl e and solid, if unspectacular , economic growth .  These relative international \nconditions have made real estate opportunities in the United States  appear quite attractive to \nforeign investors . \nA third favorable contributor  has been a variety of demographic factors that I will only \nbriefly discuss  today .  But suffice it to say , trends toward greater urbanization and a preference \namong  the large cohort  of millennials  to seek multifamily accommodation s have provided \nsupport for multifamily housing in particular.  \nDespite these favorable conditions  for commercial real estate, it is probably useful to \nconsider what could cause a reversal in commercial real estate prices.  I will focus on just a few \npotential concerns.   \nThe first involves  potential changes to government -sponsored enterprise s or GSE s.  It is \nwell known that the GSEs play a very important role in the single -family housing market.  \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n3 \n However, it is somewhat less well known outside of the real estate industry how active the GSEs \nare in multifamily  housing.  Given that GSEs and their s ecurit ized vehicles currently hold or \nguarantee 44 percent of multifamily loans , any GSE  reform proposal that caused them to alter \ntheir participation in  this market would likely leave a significant imprint on the industry.  \nA second concern could be that an economic downturn might have  a disproportionate \nimpact on commercial real estate.  V ery significant declines in commer cial real estate values  \nwere associated with both the 1990 and 2007 recessions .  The occurrence of this type of event is \nactually part of the 2017 “stress tests”  that the largest banks are now undergoing.  \nA third potential concern  could arise  if inflation and interest rates moved much higher , \nand at a faster pace.  While that is certainly not my expectation, and is not in the projections of FOMC participants, some priva te-sector forecasters have been placing odds o n such an outcome \nso that it is worth considering.  \nWhile I do not expect that a downturn in commercial real estate prices would by itself \ncause a significant problem for the economy, in some past recessions such an occurrence  has \npropagated an initial adverse shock – and by constraining financial intermediaries, made the \nextent of the subsequent economic downturn more severe for a wide range of households and businesses that depend on intermediaries for credi t.\n1  Given the very low capitalization or “cap” \nrates2 currently seen in the commercial real estate sector , it is important for  holders of  debt or \nequity related to commercial real estate (CRE)  to carefully consider how their positions would be \nimpacted if tailwinds were to give way to headwinds.  And perhaps most importantly, in my view the regulatory community must also remain attuned to developments, understand how a \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n4 \n reversal may propagate th rough the financial system, and consider whether the system is resilient \nenough to withstand such shocks, should they occur.   \n \nDomestic Macroeconomic Factors S upporting U .S. Commercial R eal Estate  \n Figure 1  shows the strength of the rebound in commercial real estate prices following  the \nfinancial crisis.  While all four categories of commercial real estate have seen a substantial \nrebound in prices, the rebound in multifamily housing  is particularly notable .  The chart is \nindexed to the price peaks prior to the financial crisis, and it shows that multifamily commercial real estate has surpassed the peak from prior to the financial crisis.  In fact, by this measure \nmultifamily prices are now more than 25 percen t higher than the pre -crisis peak.  \n There are a number of factors that have been particularly helpful for the commercial real \nestate recovery.  Figure 2  shows  the federal funds rate  – the short -term interbank rate targeted by \ncentral bank monetary policy  – for the period since 2000.  As a result of the severity of the \nfinancial crisis , policymakers brought short -term rates down to zero.  As the economy has \nrecovered from that very severe recession , the FOMC  has raised the federal funds target to its \ncurrent  range of 75 to 100 basis points .  However, the rate remains quite low by historical \nstandards , as do other rates of both short and longer maturity .  For interest -sensitive sectors, such \nas commercial real estate, this has no doubt contributed to the recov ery. \n Figure 3  shows the assets on the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet.  Prior to 2008, the \nFed’s balance sheet  was rarely discussed , since i t increased only very gradually .  During the \nfinancial crisis  and its aftermath , the Federal Reserve provided vital liquidity programs and \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n5 \n purchased long- term Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities  in order to \ncreate appropriately accommodative conditions .  With short -term interest rates effectively at \nzero, it was difficult to further influence  long -term rates using traditional monetary  tools, so the \nFederal Reserve’s large -scale asset purchase program s were implemented  to further lower long -\nterm rates.  Again, this policy action was inherently supportive of interest -sensitive sectors  like \nreal estate.  \n Figure 4  shows the personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) measure of total  inflation , \nas well as the core PCE  measure of inflation.  Unlike the 1970s, inflation over the past two \ndecades has been quite stable, fluctuating around 2 percent.3  One reason for monetary policy to \nremain accommodative for so long has been that inflation has only gradually returned to the \nFederal Reserve’s  2 percent target.  A nd, of course, a  low and stable inflation  rate makes it much \neasier to make longer -term investments.  \n \nInternational Factors S upporting U .S. Commercial R eal E state  \n As mentioned in my opening summary , international conditions have made the  United \nStates  an attractive place to invest in commercial real  estate.   Figure 5  shows the unemployment \nrate in the U .S. compared to the Euro A rea.  While the U.S. recovery has exhibited  only modest \ngrowth compared to previous  recoveries, the unemployment rate – at 4. 4 percent – is now below \nmy own estimate (4.7 perc ent) of the so -called full employment level .  In contrast, much of the \ndeveloped world has yet to significantly recover, with Euro Area  unemployment – which was \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n6 \n about even with the U.S. in late 2009 – now approximately double that of the United States4 and \nstill well above pre -recession lows.  \nThe rather weak recover y in many developed countries and the prevalence of very low \ninflation rates ha ve caused central banks to continue to hold short -term interest rates near zero – \nand to expand  their balance s heets.  As Figure 6  shows, the se policies by central banks have \ncontributed to low longer -term yields, with 10- year Treasur y yields in the United States currently \naround 2.3 percent , while 10- year government rates in Japan, Germany , and France are much \nlower.  \n These very low short - and long -term interest rates have caused some international \ninstitutional investors to look abroad to generate higher returns.  Given the relatively strong  U.S. \neconomy, some of these investors have come to view U.S. commercial real estate investments as \nattractive ways to generate higher returns.  \n \nDemographic Trends  \n Demographic trends have also provided a  favorable tailwind for some  commercial real \nestate, particularly multifamily  projects .  The increased  movement to urbanize in the United \nStates , due to the many amenities provided by cities  for those families with rising incomes , has \nbeen supportive of commercial real estate.  Certainly , my home town of Boston has benefited \nfrom the trend  of firms and households moving  to increasingly attractive cit y environments .  \n \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n7 \n  Figure 7  shows two other favorable trends for multifamily commercial real estate.  On \nthe left is the median age of males and females when first married.  Because a first home \npurchase is often related to  marriage, a later marriage age results in more young adults living in \nmultifamily rather than single -family homes.  The figure on the right shows the number of 25-  to \n34-year-old head -of-households , over time.  The demographic  trends that have expanded this age \ngroup are a positive for multifamily real estate.  \n These charts suggest  that it should not be surprising that trends have supported rising \ncommercial real estate prices.  These  macroeconomic and demographic trends are qualitatively \nconsistent with the strong commercial real estate markets we see in many parts of the country.  \nHowever, it is harder to know if these conditions warrant the extent  of price increase we have \nseen to date.  We all know that for almost any asset category, p ositive trends can sometimes \nevolve into prices that increase more than fundamentals justify .  It is very hard to distinguish \nhow much of the price gain is  the result of the favorable fundamentals, and how much reflects an \nabundance of opt imism by investors.  S o the next section of my talk explores  the possibility that \nlow cap rates could experience a significant reversal.  \n \nGSE Reform and Multifamily  Real E state  \n One potential risk to multifamily commercial real estate  prices  could come from GSE \nreform.  While the timing and nature of such reform s are quite uncertain, the GSEs have been \nexpanding their role in the multifamily mortgage market.  Figure 8  illustrates that the GSE s, \nincluding the ir securitized  vehicles, hold or guarantee approximately 44 percent of multifamily \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n8 \n loans outstanding, and th eir role has increased notabl y over the past two decades.   GSE holdings \nof multifamily  loans outstanding now materially exceed th ose of the banking sector.  \n The multifamily segment is also a significant source of income for the GSEs.  Figure 9  \nprovides the percentage of income that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac derive from  their activities \nin the multifamily commercial real estate  mortgage market .  Clearly , both GSEs earn a \nsignificant share of income from the multifamily segment of their business .5  \nA potential concern would be that with high and rising prices  for multifamily commercial \nreal estate, policymakers  looking to reform  the GSEs  might look at the GS Es’ large and growing \nfootprint in the market  and ask whether this level of government -sponsored exposure is safe, and \nwhether that level of government support is appropriate .  Whether , or how , future reform \nproposals will impact commercial real estate is unclear  – but a potential  and significant shock to \nthis sector of the commercial real estate market could occur if proposals require the GSEs to \nreduce their holdings of multifamily loans.  \n \nExample f rom Bank Stress Tests  \nThe largest banks in the United States undergo stress tests annually to see if they have \nsufficient capital to weather a severe economic shock.  The 2017 stress test includes , among \nother things, a scenario of a significant decline in commercial real estate prices  – as shown in \nFigure 10 .  The severely adverse stress- test scenario includes more than a doubling of the \ncurrent unemployment rate , and declines in aggregate commercial real estate prices of 3 5 percent  \nthrough the first quarter of 2019.6  Consistent with my comments earlier , the stress tests also \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n9 \n suggest that in their own calculations, banks take into account that these losses could be \nconcentrated in areas that have experienced rapid price gains  – specifically noting multifamily \nproperties.7 \nWhile this is only a hypothetica l scenario, it is designed to be consistent with economic \nrelationships that have occurred historically.  Both the 1990 and the 2007 recessions exhibited  very significant declines in commercial real estate prices that aggravated significant negative shocks to the economy.  The potential  exists for  commercial real estate price declines to \nsignificantly weaken the economy  – particularly by weakening institutions  that are critical to the \ncredit extension vital to the  economy , and that have large and leveraged  exposure to CRE .  As a \nresult,  many regulators have increased their focus on commercial real estate as valuations have \nrisen substantially . \nHow likely is a  recession  as severe as in the stress test  scenario ?  And w hat are the \nconditions that might lead to  a large shock to commercial real estate?   It is indeed worth \nconsidering what type of economic conditions might lead to an eventual negative shock of the \nsort that is being modeled in the stress test.  While the  severely adverse stress- test scenario does \nnot have a probability attached to it, it is possible to look at private sector forecasts that provide probability assessments of some “ tail events ” and related conditions, as well as their most likely \noutcome.   \nFigure 1 1 provides the information from the Survey of Professional  Forecasters  – \nroughly 50 private sector forecasters  – about their assessment of the probability of core PCE \ninflation rising above 2.5 percent.  The  forecasters  assess a probability of over 10 percent for this \nyear and over 20 percent for 2018.    \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n10 \n Figure 1 2 provides one reason for this elevated risk.  The private forecasters see a \nroughly 10 percent probability of unemployment declining below 4 percent.   Such an overheated \neconomy would likely be accompanied by  higher inflation, which in turn would likely elicit  \nhigher interest rates.  \n While  the downward trend in Figure 13  of long -term Treasury yields and multifamily \ncap rates has been quite favorable, an overheated economy could risk a significant reversal.  This \nwould cause investors to demand much higher 10 -year Treasury rates to compensate for the \npotential of higher inflation.  Since multifamily rents would likely be slow to respond, significant \ndeclines in commercial real estate prices could result.8 \n \nConclu ding Observations  \nFigure 14  shows capitalization rates  by commercial real estate sectors.  A very low cap \nrate reflects a high valuation of real estate relative to net operating income.  Valuations have \nrisen substantially  by historical standards.  Certainly a number of positive factors account for \nsome of the elevated  valuations, but at such times it is worth asking  what could go wrong.  \n  While an overheated economy followed by a recession is only one  possible scenario,  and \ncertainly not my prediction, it helps to illustrate one way in which low cap rates might be of  \nconcern  in the event of such a reversal.  While al l market participan ts should consider how their \npositions would be impacted by adverse scenarios, Figure 15  shows that leveraged institutions \nand government -sponsored entities have significant exposures to commercial real estate.   In the \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on  Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n \n \n11 \n event of an advers e scenario such as a recession, these exposures could pose significant risks to \nthese institutions.    \nWhile I am certainly not expecting such a scenario to occur, central bankers are charged \nwith thinking  about adverse risks to the economy .  So current valuations in real estate are one \nsuch risk that I will continue to watch carefully.  \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                           \n \n1 See “Financial Stability: The Role of Real Estate ,” remarks by Eric Rosengren at the Asia -Pacific High Level \nMeeting on Banking Supervi sion, March 22, 2017.  \n \n2 Capitalization or “cap” rates on real estate represent the ratio of net operating income produced by a property to the \nprice paid, calculated at the time of a transaction.    \n \n3 Measured by the core Personal Consumption Expenditures  Price Index or PCE, inflation is at 1.6 percent , and \nmeasured by total PCE, inflation is 1.8 percent.    \n \n4 The unemployment rates for the U.S. and E uro Area are defined somewhat differently.  One difference is based on \nage; the U.S. civilian unemployment rate tallies the unemployed share of the labor force age 16 years and older, \nwhereas the E uro Area’s harmonized unemployment rate calculates the unemployed share of the labor force age 15 \nto 74. For both definitions, unemployed persons must be actively see king work. Other differences between the \ndefinitions have to do with the definition of “actively” seeking work and whether individuals waiting to start a new \njob or awaiting recall after a layoff are counted as unemployed.  \n \n5 GSEs earn a significant share of income from the multifamily segment of their business, d espite  the fact that the \nmultifamily lending is a much smaller piece of their business than residential real estate.  \n \n6 See page 6 of 2017 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual Street Tests Required under the Dodd -Frank Act Stress \nTesting Rules and the Capital Plan Rule .  \n \n7 See page 5 of 2017 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual Street Tests Required under the Dodd -Frank Act Stress \nTesting Rules and the Capital Plan Rule .   \n \n8 As described, the cap rates for multifamily are currently very low, having been driven by both demand for the \nproduct and rental growth rates. It is important to note, however, that in addition to the general overheated economy \nscenario, slowing or declining rental rates for mu ltifamily units will place upward pressure on cap rates.  That is, if \ninvestors are no longer able to count rental growth in their return assumptions, they will turn to demanding a higher \ncap rate on current cash flows. Additionally, increases in interest rates that provide investors with other investment \nopportunities will serve to place upward pressure on the cap rates demanded for the multifamily product.   \n\n \nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1 :05 P.M.

I would like to thank the Le vy Economics Institute of Bard College for \ninviting me to share my perspectives today.  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the \nviews I express today are my own, not necessari ly those of my colleagues at the Federal \nReserve’s Board of Governors or on the Fede ral Open Market Committee (the FOMC).  \n \nIntroduction and Overview \nThe economy has continued to improve – and with the labor market achieving measures \nassociated with full employment, and inflation now fluctuating around1 the Federal Reserve’s 2 \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n2 \n percent inflation target, some observers of th e macroeconomy and monetary policy have turned \ntheir attention to a policy tool actively deployed in the United States during the financial crisis: \nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.   \nAs short-term interest rate s approached zero in  2008, it became difficult for monetary \npolicy to further stimulate th e economy through short-term rates alone.  Policymakers were \nlargely constrained from further reductions by the zero boundary.  However, by purchasing long-\nterm Treasury securities and agency mortgage-b acked securities – and thereby increasing the size \nof the Fed’s balance sheet – l ong-term rates could be reduced.  Lower rates provided additional \nneeded stimulus, encouraging firms and individu als to incur more long-term funding and spur \neconomic activity that was desperately needed  in the Great Recessi on and the long, slow \nrecovery that followed. \nWhile asset purchases were deployed during a period of extraordinary economic distress, \nnow that the gradual normalization of moneta ry policy is underway it is a good time to re-\nevaluate the costs and benefits  of a large balance sheet.  I would note that the FOMC has \npublished a statement on its policy no rmalization principles and plans.2 \nMany observers suggest that central banks’ use of their balance shee ts should be limited \nsolely as a response to the type of severe econo mic conditions that occurred during the financial \ncrisis and in its aftermath.  Others suggest – as  I will today – that stru ctural changes in the \nmacroeconomy may necessitate more frequent use of large scale asset purchases during \nrecessions.   \nThis latter view hinges on the argument that the combination of low inflation, low rates \nof productivity growth, and sl ow population growth may imply an economy where normal or \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n3 \n equilibrium short-term interest rates remain rela tively low by historical standards, even once the \neconomy has fully normalized.  This notion of lower equilibrium rates has in fact been reflected \nby the policymakers partic ipating in the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections \n(SEP).  The median forecast of Fed policymakers in March was that in th e longer run, the federal \nfunds rate was likely to be only 3 percent, down more than a percentage point from assessments \nby Fed policymakers from a few years ago.   \nLow equilibrium rates would have noteworthy implications in a downturn.  Consider the \nfact that during most of the previous economic downturns, th e Federal Reserve has reduced \ninterest rates by substantially more than 300 basi s points.  So a 3 percent federal funds rate \nwould imply a high probability that  short-term interest rates woul d have to be lowered again to \nzero in response to future recessions.  As a resu lt, the central bank may ne ed to again deploy its \nbalance sheet to augment traditional policy, sp ur economic activity, and achieve its mandates \nfrom Congress associated with em ployment and price stability.   \nOne important implication, then, is that the exit from a large balance sheet may not prove \nto be a one-time event.  So if  done appropriately, the exit from  the current large balance sheet \ncan serve as an important “playbook” for future recovery periods should it prove necessary. \nIn contrast to balance sheet use of this sort, central banks  have significant historical \nexperience with moving short-term interest ra tes to achieve macroeconomic objectives.  As a \nconsequence, it makes sense to continue to use sh ort-term interest rates as the primary tool for \nmonetary policy.  If central bank balance sheet activity is to be a secondary tool, then the exit \nfrom a large balance sheet should be conducted in ways that mainta in the primacy of using short-\nterm interest rates to either slow  down or stimulate the economy.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n4 \n To preview my argument a bit, while the FOMC  is still carefully considering its balance \nsheet exit strategy, in my own view an ideal po licy would take a very gradual approach to \nbalance-sheet reduction.  In my view that process could begin rela tively soon and should not \nsignificantly alter the FOMC’s c ontinuing gradual normalization of short-term interest rates.  \nThat is, by initially retiring only a small percen tage of maturing securities, and then very \ngradually shrinking the volume of the securities being reinvested, the tightening of short-term \ninterest rates should not need to  be much different than it woul d be in the absence of shrinking \nthe balance sheet. \nToday, I will cover a bit of background and anal ysis on the use of th e balance sheet as a \nmonetary policy tool.  I will then discuss why I believe balance-sheet activity will likely continue \nto be deployed as a monetary po licy tool in recessions, as long  as short-term interest rates \nnormalize at relatively low levels.  Low infla tion and low growth in both the working-age \npopulation and in productivity seem likely for many developed economies in the future, so balance sheet expansions – and ex its – are likely to become more  standard monetary policy tools \naround the world.   \n \nBackground on Balance Sheet Activity \n By way of background, Figure 1  shows the overnight policy rates for the United States, \nEurope, and Japan.  During the fina ncial crisis, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest \nrates rapidly in the U.S., as the economy slowed  during the recession.  Inte rest rates were pushed \neventually to zero as the financial problems asso ciated with the Lehman failure led the central \nbank to deploy a large increase in reserves to counteract signifi cant disruptions in short-term \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n5 \n financial markets, bringing short-term rates to  the effective lower bound.  The European Central \nBank kept short-term rates somewhat higher fo r longer, but eventually also pushed their \nrefinancing rate to zero.  And the Bank of Japan, which had set ra tes very low even prior to the \nGreat Recession, has maintained their call rate close to zero  or slightly negative.   \nThe United States has been the first country  to begin the process of exiting from \nextraordinary monetary accommodation, raising short- term interest rates as a first step in the \nnormalization process.  The Federal Reserve made an initial increase in short-term interest rates in December 2015, followed by additional 25 basis point increases in December 2016 and in March 2017.  In contrast, both Europe and Japan have yet to reach the point of raising their \nhistorically low short-term interest rates. \n Figure 2 highlights the use of central bank balanc e sheet expansion in the United States, \nEurope, and Japan.  As you can see, all three cent ral banks significantly increased their balance \nsheets, as they all found loweri ng short-term interest rates in sufficient to rekindle economic \ngrowth and slow disinflation.  The Federal Reserv e’s balance sheet first began to increase as the \nfinancial crisis spread to a severe macroeconomic  crisis.  By indexing th e changes in the three \nbalance sheets to their levels in 2000, the figure shows that the balance-sheet expansion in the \nU.S. was much more aggressive than the other ce ntral banks’ in the fall of 2008.  However, when \nviewed relative to GDP, Figure 3  shows that Japan especially ne eded to do more, relative to the \nsize of its economy.   \nImportantly, perhaps because it was more aggr essive with monetary  easing initially, the \nUnited States has recovered more quickly.  The Fe d’s balance sheet expansion stopped in 2014.     \nIn contrast, both Japan and Europe have not  yet stopped expanding their balance sheets. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n6 \n  Figure 4  shows 10-year government bond yields in  the United States, France, Germany, \nand Japan since 2000.  Long-term rates have fallen, for a variety of reasons.  One factor was that \nthe balance sheets of central ba nks expanded – with purchases of  longer-term Treasury securities \nand agency mortgage-backed securities in the U.S., and with purchases of a wider set of assets in \nEurope and Japan.  In the U.S., rates on 10-year  Treasury securities ha ve generally remained \nabove 2 percent once the Federal Reserve stopp ed expanding its balance sheet, while 10-year \nrates continued to fall in  Japan, Germany and France, as Europe and Japan continued to purchase \nassets. \n \nThe Balance Sheet as a Monetary Policy Tool \n As I noted in my introduction, some obser vers consider balance-sheet use as an \nextraordinary tool, deployed as an emergency res ponse to the severity of the financial crisis.  \nHowever, other observers suggest th at if low, short-term interest rates are likely a feature of the \neconomy even when monetary policy is normali zed, it is possible that  expanding the balance \nsheets of central banks will become a tool more commonly utilized during recessions. \n Figure 5  shows how the participants  at FOMC meetings have  viewed the likely longer-\nrun value of the federal funds rate.  On a quart erly basis, FOMC par ticipants are asked to \nforecast a variety of economic variables, including  the federal funds rate they expect in the \nlonger run.  As the figure shows, policymakers’ me dian view of the longer-run federal funds rate \nas recently as 2012 was that it was expected to be over 4 percen t.  However, that view has \nevolved significantly, with the median view in Ma rch of this year being for a federal funds rate \nof only 3 percent in  the longer run. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n7 \n The shaded band on the figure represents the central tendency, which provides the range \nof views of the participants omitting the top three and bottom three estimates.  It is notable that \nin the March projections, while the median was 3 percent, many participants viewed the federal \nfunds rate as likely to be below 3 percent in th e longer run.  Assuming that  the Federal Reserve is \nsuccessful in achieving 2 percent in flation in the longer run, a nomina l rate of 3 percent implies a \nreal federal funds rate of only 1 percent. \n Figure 6  provides some perspective on a longer-run federal funds rate of 3 percent.  \nDuring recessions, it is not unusual for the federal funds rate target to be cut by more than 3 \npercentage points; in fact, in many recessions, the federal funds ra te target was reduced by more \nthan 5 percentage points.  However, going into most  recessions the federal funds rate was higher \nthan 5 percent, and as a result, despite the sh arp declines the rate did not approach zero. \n Figure 7  provides similar information in tabular form.  It emphasizes that other than \nduring the 1960 recession, all of the decreases in  nominal federal funds rates have exceeded 3 \npercentage points.  On average, from the peak to  the trough of interest rate s, the declines average \nroughly 7 percentage points. \n Figure 8  shows the real federal funds rate, which is simply calculated  by subtracting the \ncore PCE inflation rate from the nominal federal funds effective rate.  Wh ile there are periods of \nnegative real federal funds rates – particularly after severe re cessions – the most recent period \nhas featured negative real federal funds rates for an extended period of time.  If the SEP median \nforecast is correct about the possibi lity of a real federal funds rate  of only 1 percent in the long-\nrun, it will be much more common for short-term real interest rates to  become negative during \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n8 \n recessions, when the Federal Reserve normally r eacts by lowering short-term nominal interest \nrates.   \n Figure 9  provides similar information as Figure 7, but in tabular form.  Parenthetically, it \nis worth noting that one reason the real rate could become so  negative in the 1974 recession is \nbecause the inflation rate was so high.  During much of the recent recovery, with the nominal \ninterest rate lodged close to zero, the real rate was determined by the value of the inflation rate.  \nBut notably, a real short-term rate close to nega tive 2 percent was not sufficient to generate a \nrapid recovery. \n The clear implication of very low short-term in terest rates is that there will be a limited \nbuffer for monetary policy to respond to economic slowdowns.  I believe that real short-term \nfederal funds rates are likely to be negative more frequently, and the nominal  federal funds rate \nis likely to reach zero more frequently.  And if policy rates do remain as low as currently \nexpected, it is likely to be mo re common for central banks to engage in asset purchases to \nstimulate the economy by re ducing longer-term rates. \n \nReasons for Low Prevailing Rates \n Several economic factors have contributed to the widespread  expectation of lower short-\nterm rates prevailing in the foreseeable future.  The inflation rate, shown in Figure 10 , has \nfollowed a very different pattern since the mid-1990s.  For much of the 1970s and 1980s, the inflation rate was above 3 per cent.  However, since the mid-1990s, inflation has generally \nfluctuated in a band much closer  to 2 percent.  And for much of the period since the Great \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n9 \n Recession, the inflation rate has be en below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.  While this \nlow and stable inflation rate has been beneficial  in many respects, it has also provided less room \nfor interest rates to fall before hitting zero.  T hus, there may be a trade-off with a low inflation \ntarget that policymakers may be willing to make, depending on their willingness to manipulate \nthe balance sheet. \n Two other factors that lead to lower equili brium rates involve an important link between \nthe economy’s potential growth rate, and real intere st rates.  Anything that  lowers the potential \nrate of growth in the economy will both lower the incentive to invest (as real returns to investing \nwill fall on average with lower potential growth) and increase the incentive to save (as lower \nfuture returns on savings imply a greater need to save today) .  Lower investment demand and \nhigher savings both engender lower real rates of inte rest, so a fall in the potential growth rate will \ngenerally lead to a fall in equilibrium real interest rates.   \n Several other recent features have contributed to a lower ra te of potential growth in the \neconomy.  One such feature is a reduction in productivity growth, highlighted in Figure 11 .  \nWhile quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in produc tivity are quite volatile, the smoothed productivity \ngrowth over the last several ye ars has been noticeably lower than has been experienced over \nmuch of the previous 50 years.  Lower productivity growth implies lo wer real interest rates, and \nagain this would suggest less of an inte rest-rate buffer during economic downturns. \n Another factor impacting potential growth is  the change in demographics in the United \nStates.  The robust birth rates, immigration rates, and movement of women into the labor force \ncontributed to significant increases in the U.S. labor force – trends which have become much \nmore muted of late, as shown in Figure 12 .  Slower growth in th e labor force lowers the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n10 \n potential growth rate of the economy and, through the channels I just articulated, implies a lower \nreal interest rate.3  And, given the strong downward trend sh own in the figure, slower labor force \ngrowth is expected to continue.   \n These factors are not unique to the Un ited States.  Many developed countries are \nexperiencing low inflation rates and demographic trends that have  resulted in lower short-term \ninterest rates.  This implies that tools other than  movements in short-term interest rates, such as \nbalance-sheet tools, are likely to be a more co mmon and necessary feature of monetary policy in \ncombating future recessions in many economies around the world.    \n \nConcluding Observations  \n While the extensive use of central bank balance sheets has been a distinguishing feature \nof the most recent downturn and slow recovery, I see it as quite likely that this tool will be \nnecessary in future economic downturns.  Unless  productivity growth and demographic trends \nchange, or monetary policymakers set a higher infl ation target, the feasible reductions in short-\nterm rates to combat recessions will not be suffici ent.  Thus, monetary policymakers are likely to \nneed to use balance-sheet tools. \n If monetary policy is to rely primarily on s hort-term interest rates to normalize policy, as \nseems prudent given the historic al experience, in my view th e Federal Reserve should adopt \nbalance sheet exit strategies that reinforce the pr imacy of interest rate policy.  Starting to shrink \nthe balance sheet earlier – and doing so in a very  gradual fashion – implie s very little reduction \nin the degree of monetary stimulus coming from the U.S. central bank’s balance sheet.  This, in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n11 \n turn, will allow policymakers to focus on gradual in creases in the federal funds rate target as the \nprimary mechanism for normalizing moneta ry policy and calibrating the economy.   \n Thank you.  \n \n \n                                                            \n \n1 Measured by the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index or PCE, inflation is at 1.8 percent, but \nmeasured by total PCE inflation is just over 2 percent, specifically 2.1 percent.    \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm . \n \n3 With a slower growth in the labor force, capital become s relatively less scarce and therefore the return on capital \ndecreases.

Rosengren \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \n \n \nThe Boston Economic Club \n \n \nBoston, Massachusetts  \nMarch 29, 2017 \n \n \n \n \nGood morning.  I would like to thank the Bo ston Economic Club for inviting me to share \nmy views on the economy today.  At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I \nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of  my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board \nof Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). \nAs everyone is likely aware, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate targ et range by 25 \nbasis points at its March meeting.  The committee had previously increased the interest rate \ntarget range just twice in this tightening cycle – in December 2015 and in December 2016.  \nWhile the FOMC has used the term “gradual” in its official policy actions,1 I think it is important \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n2 \n to be reminded that the term gradual is not synonymous with once a year just before Christmas.  \nKidding aside, I view four increases this year as fully consistent w ith comments from FOMC \nparticipants stating that the path of normalizing rates will be gradual.  Clearly, such a pace would \nbe slower than the previous  tightening cycle, beginning in  June of 2004, when the FOMC \nincreased interest rates at each meeting for 17 meetings.2   \nBefore I walk you through the data and analys is, allow me to preview my bottom line.  \nMy own view is that an increase at every other  FOMC meeting3 over the course of this year \ncould and should be the committee’s default, unle ss economic data come in inconsistent with \nforecasts.   \nAt present, the perception seems to be that  the outcome of each FOMC meeting depends \non nuances of incoming data, with  the base case being no change  in rates.  I would like to \nsuggest a somewhat different stance for policy over  this year: an expectation to tighten at every \nother meeting unless incoming data are materially inconsistent with the forecast.  Importantly, \nthis would still be a fully data-dependent approa ch, not a preset path, as  it would hinge on the \nincoming data – but the base case would be four  tightenings, reflecting the strength of the \neconomy that I believe justifies more regul ar normalization of interest rates.   \nSuch a gradual, but more regular, tightening of  rates is consistent with both the improved \n“starting” conditions and the continued good news  about the economy.  As I will describe today, \nit seems likely that the economy will have achieve d both elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual \nmandate by the end of this year – full employment  and stable prices (which the Federal Reserve \ndefines as 2 percent inflation).  Even as the economy approaches the Fed’s dual mandate goals, \nwe still have a federal funds rate that is less than 1 percent, while in flation is approaching 2 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n3 \n percent, which implies a negative real interest ra te (simply because the inflation rate exceeds the \nnominal interest rate).  While it is not unusual to have negative  real interest rates when the \neconomy is quite weak, as I will show today, it is unusual to still have negative real interest rates \nlate in a recovery when the economy is close to fu ll employment and nearing the inflation target.   \nWith this as overview, I will walk you thr ough my analysis and describe why I believe a \ngradual but more regular move to  normalization is now appropriate. \n \nThe Real Federal Funds Rate \nFigure 1  shows the nearly 50 years of the real federal funds effective rate – which is \nsimply the effective nominal federal funds rate mi nus the core PCE inflation rate.  As the figure \nshows, it is by no means unprecedented to see a negativ e real rate.  In such cases, the real federal \nfunds rate becomes negative because the Federal Reserve lowers interest  rates to help the \neconomy recover from a recession.   \nHowever, the figure shows that the current period is unusual, both in just how negative \nshort-term real rates became and in how long real  rates have remained negative.  In truth, the \nchart understates how negative equilibrium short- term real interest rates would have become, \nbecause the federal funds rate fe ll to nearly its zero lower bound in late 2008.  At that point, \nmovements in the real rate were  determined exclusively by fluctu ations in the inflation rate \nalone.  This is one reason why the Federal Rese rve needed to expand its balance sheet – with \nshort-term nominal rates at th e zero boundary, additional monetary stimulus could be generated \nonly by lowering longer-term interest  rates using a sset purchases. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n4 \n Figure 2  shows the same chart, but adds an in dication of the unemployment rate at the \ntime the real federal funds rates turned positive,  and the current unemployment rate.  What is \nclear in this figure is th at prior to the last rece ssion, the real federal funds  rate was negative only \nwhile the unemployment rate was well above 5 percent.  Thus, the current period is quite \nunusual, in that the unemployme nt rate is now 4.7 percent (which is my estimate of full \nemployment), but the nominal federal funds eff ective rate is roughly 0.88 percent while the total \nand core PCE measures of inflation are 1.9  a nd 1.7 percent, respectivel y, yielding essentially \nabout negative 1 percen t as the real rate. \nThere are several reasons w hy the federal funds rate has remained so low.   \nFirst, Figure 3  shows real GDP growth smoothed over the previous four quarters.  The \naverage growth rate for each of the seven recoveri es within the timeframe of the chart is also \nindicated.  The figure emphasizes th at during this recovery, real gr owth has remained very close \nto 2 percent.   This is much slower than in the past, and the steady downward trend in the \nrecoveries’ growth rates is clear.  Also, typically we see very str ong growth in the initial stages \nof a recovery, before the real GDP growth ra te slows down as the economy approaches full \nemployment.  In part because of the severity of the financial crisis of 2008, the economy never \nexperienced strong growth during this recovery – but  rather a slow, al beit steady, recovery. \nSecond, we normally see inflationary pressures bu ild up in the latter stage of a recovery.  \nFigure 4  shows total PCE inflation smoothed over the pr evious four quarters.  Again, the current \nperiod has been unusual in how low the inflation rate has been th roughout this recovery.  Despite \nthe economy being at full employment, inflation remains just below the Federal Reserve’s 2 \npercent target.  Normally, we might have expe cted to see more infl ationary pressures. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n5 \n Thus, with inflation approaching target, a nd a slow but steady recovery, the monetary \npolicy tightening cycle has been  quite gradual.  However, how gradual the normalization process \nshould be depends importantly on wher e one thinks the economy is going. \n \nForecasts of the Economy \nFigure 5  shows the PCE inflation outlook for the Survey of Professional Forecasters, \nwhich surveys roughly 50 private forecasters on th eir expectations for the economy.  The median \nforecast for total PCE inflation is 2 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, before rising above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target in the fourth quarter of 2017.   \nWhat is perhaps even more striking is that the shaded region shows the 25 percent of the \nforecasts above and below the median.  Focusing  on the shaded region above the median in the \nsecond half of the forecast, one sees that many fo recasters now expect the inflation rate will rise \nabove 2.2 percent toward the end of  this year and the beginning of  next year (recall that another \n25 percent of forecasts lie at or above, and at or  below, the shaded area – which represents the \ninterquartile range or middle 50 percent).  This  highlights that a fair number of forecasters \nbelieve the focus of the Federal Reserve will sh ift from striving to move up to the 2 percent \ntarget, to worrying about overshooting it.  Moreov er, this pattern is consistent with Federal \nReserve statements that 2 pe rcent is a target, not a ceiling, for the inflation rate.  \nFigure 6  shows that the Survey of Professional Fo recasters anticipates relatively healthy \ngrowth.  While the previous f our quarters have been relativel y choppy, and the revised real GDP \ngrowth for the most recent quarter was just 1.9 percent, survey participants are expecting real GDP growth to exceed 2 percent for each quarter of this year.  The fact that the unemployment \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n6 \n rate has fallen while the economy has been gr owing by roughly 2 percent for most of this \nrecovery implies that the potential GDP growth  rate is somewhat below 2 percent; my own \nestimate is about 1.75 percent.  (Unemployment falls when growth is above the so-called \npotential rate).  So the private forecasters in th e Survey of Professional Forecasters are expecting \ngrowth that is on average nearly 60 basis points fa ster than the estimate of the potential growth \nrate. \nFigure 7  shows the unemployment rate forecast.   Growth above the potential rate \ncontinues to exert downward pressure on unemp loyment.  The median unemployment rate \nforecast falls to 4.5 percent by the end of 2017 in the Survey forecast.  The shaded region again \nshows the 25 percent of the forecasts above and be low the median.  As the forecast stretches into \n2018, there are more survey participants expe cting the unemployment rate to be below 4.4 \npercent, with one-quarter at  or below 4.3 percent.   \nIt is important to place this all in the context of the unemployment rate that is likely to be \nsustainable in the long term.  The Federal Re serve’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) \nprovides estimates of what the participants  at this month’s FOMC meeting thought the \nunemployment rate would be in 2017, 2018, 2019, and in the longer run – as shown in the table \nin Figure 8.   The policymakers’ estimates for the longer-run unemployment rate are shaded.  \nThe median estimate for the longer run is 4.7 pe rcent.  The range of estimates is 4.5 to 5.0 \npercent, and if you drop the three highest and lo west estimates, the centr al tendency is 4.7 to 5.0 \npercent.  It is important to note that no FO MC participant currently expects an unemployment \nrate below 4.5 percent to  be sustainable.   \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n7 \n Unsustainably Low Unemployment Rates \nI now turn to a discussion of the potentia l costs of an unemployment rate below the \nsustainable rate.  Figure 9  highlights the states that have unemployment rates below 4 percent – \na level well below the national rate that the FOMC participants expect will  be sustainable in the \nlong run.  There are currently 16 states with an un employment rate below 4 percent, and four of \nthem are in New England – Massachusetts, Ma ine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.  Three \nadditional states have rates at 4.0 percent.  \nOf course there are some states with low natu ral rates of unemployment.  For these states, \na rate near 4 percent would not be unusual.  At  the same time, comparing where states are now \nrelative to their 20-year averages, as shown in Figure 10 , we see that 28 states are at least one \npercentage point below their 20-year average.  In addition, 15 states ar e within 0.5 percentage \npoints of their 20-year minimum unemployment rate.4    \nOne of the issues I often hear raised by busin esspeople is the shortage of workers.  A \ncommon complaint I hear is that they would expand their business,  which is doing well, but they \ndo not feel they can find enough staff with the requi site skills to allow them to expand.   I also \nhear about firms considering moving to citie s such as Boston, because the colleges and \nuniversities in the area provide a ready workforce for firms seek ing highly skilled workers. \n The natural response of firm s facing tight labor markets is  to start raising wages.  Figure \n11 shows the average hourly earnings for the country overall, and for two industry groups –\nconstruction, and professional and business serv ices.  These industries show that as labor \nmarkets have become tighter, ea rnings have been rising.    \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n8 \n  Rising wages are likely a factor behind some private forecasters’ expe ctations of inflation \nexceeding 2 percent next year.  However, ther e are concerns beyond wage and price inflation, \nsince an overheating economy can le ad to other instabilities.    \nFigure 12  shows the price to earn ings (P/E) ratios for the S&P 500 since 1990.  The high \nP/E ratio may reflect that after-ta x earnings are likely to be much  stronger in the future; however, \nit might also be an indication of growing invest or confidence, which of course may or may not \nbe ratified over time. \nFigure 13  shows the spread betw een high-yield corporate bonds and the 10-year \nTreasury rate since 1995.  Recent academic studies have found that very tight spreads for higher-\nrisk bonds can be an indication of potential problems in the future.5  The current high-yield \nspread is now below the twenty-plus year aver age and trending lower, somewhat unusual for an \nenvironment when monetary policy has entered a tightening phase. \nFigure 14  shows the capitalization rate for multifamily housing.  The capitalization rate – \nnet operating income relative to the price paid fo r the property – is unusually low.  While there \nare secular changes in housing preferences, refl ecting both demographic tr ends and a persistent \nhangover from the housing crisis, such low cap ra tes can call into question commercial real \nestate valuations should the econom y experience a shock or slow-down. \nAll in all, a potentially overheating econom y may be reflected in movements in the \noverall price level, in asset pr ices, or both.  If the economy ru ns too hot, it could ultimately \nrequire a less gradual monetary policy adjustme nt – which could potentially place at risk the \nsignificant progress the economy and labor mark et have made since the Great Recession. \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n9 \n Concluding Observations \nRecent economic reports have been consistent  with continued steady improvement in the \neconomy.  The most recent U.S. employment repo rt featured payroll employment growing by \n235,000, the unemployment rate declining by 0.1 per centage points to 4.7 percent, and an \nincrease in average hourly earnings of 2.8 percen t.  With the economy at my estimate of full \nemployment, and with wages and pr ices rising, in my vi ew it was entirely appropriate to raise the \nfederal funds rate target range  by 25 basis points in March. \nLooking ahead over the course of this year, I be lieve it is likely to be appropriate for the \nFOMC to raise rates at a more regular  – though still gradual  – pace.  With the nominal rate still \nlow and inflation approaching 2 percent, the resu lt is a real rate below zero.  With the real \neffective federal funds rate still quite negative, I consid er it appropriate to m ove the nominal rate \n– gradually but more regularly – so th e real rate becomes less negative.   \nAs some of my colleagues on the FOMC have  emphasized, conditions do not require the \nFOMC to rush policy actions.  With real GDP growth expected to be only modestly above 2 \npercent and total inflation in the short run expect ed to just reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent \ntarget, I certainly believe the FOMC can be gradual in removing accommodation.  Nonetheless, \nit is important to avoid creating an over-hot economy that could require a more rapid tightening \nof monetary policy – which would place at ri sk the economic improvements seen to date. \nThank you. \n                                                            \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevent s/pressreleases/monetary20170315a.htm .  \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov /monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n3 FOMC meetings with a press conference give an opport unity to better explain the data and the rationale of the \ndecision; however, the Committee may decide on an interest rate change at any FOMC meeting if the data determine \nso.    \n4 The most recent 240 months were used to calculate th e 20-year average – from March 1997 through February \n2017.

In addition, 15 states ar e within 0.5 percentage points of their 20-year minimum \nunemployment rate and 1 state is below.

Given that the topic of financial stability is rather less es tablished than \nmonetary policy, it is particular ly important to have ongoing opport unities to share analysis and \nperspectives on what works, and what does not, around the world.   \nIn that spirit, I would like to share my own views on the sources of financial instability \nthat have, historically, led to widespread ec onomic disruption not only in large economies like \nthe United States, but in many parts of the world as  well.  I would like to specifically address the \nproblems that arise when the value of commerci al or residential real estate fluctuates \nsignificantly – a dynamic that often leads to episodes of financial instability. \nMy comments should be placed in some very im portant context, however.  First, I am not \nhere today to predict problems, but rather to su ggest we continue working to head them off.  \nSecondly, it is important to not e that we see much safer fina ncial systems in many countries \ntoday, as a result of regulatory e nhancements that were enacted si nce the financial crisis of 2008.  \nMany of the largest banks in the world are much better capitalized and have much more liquidity \nthan they did during the period l eading up to the financial crisis .  This has undoubtedly made the \nglobal financial system more stab le; being both less likely to be th e source of a major disruption, \nand better prepared to withstand an  external shock, should one occur.  \nDespite having a more resilient financia l system, I would suggest that other \nmacroeconomic factors may – unfortunately but pe rhaps inevitably – have some unintended side \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n4 \n effects that are less supportive of  financial stability.  For exampl e, very low interest rates in \nmany parts of the world – which were wholly ne cessary to propel the global economy out of the \nGreat Recession, and I strongly supported – may inev itably encourage a “reach for yield” in a \nworld with an increasingly global flow of i nvestment funds.  Demographically, we are seeing \naging populations whose need for reasonable yields  on retirement assets may further incent a \nreach, often in riskier assets.  So while increased regulatory sc rutiny has established important \n“fire breaks” against financial fl are-ups, other trends could actu ally mean more frequent and \npossibly more intense “fires.”  My point is just  that we should not feel overconfident, thinking \nthat strengthening the resilience of global banks is, by itsel f, sufficient.  Further thoughtful \nactions may be called for. \nCertainly, one risk to be mindful  of has been the acceleration of real estate values in some \nparts of the world, and I will use the United St ates as an example in my remarks today. \n \nReal Estate and Financial Stability \nIn the years since the financia l crisis of 2008, there has been a coordinated effort to make \nthe financial sector more stable, given the wide spread difficulties of many of the very large \nfinancial institutions in developed countries durin g the crisis.  Many regulators now require more \ncapital, greater liquidity, and detailed resoluti on plans.  The absence of these defenses \ncontributed to the severity of th e financial crisis, and the disrupti on of the availability of credit \nfrom financial intermediaries contributed to th e dramatic contraction in the broader economy, \namplifying problems.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n5 \n Make no mistake, the steps taken to increase the stability of financ ial intermediaries and \nthe financial system are vital.  While such st eps will likely mitigate the severity of future \nproblems and recessions, I would however sugge st that they may not be sufficient. \nAs helpful as steps taken to date have been, policymakers and market participants need to \nstay focused on several issues, including what I would consider the root cause of the financial \ncrisis.  I would argue that the root cause of the financial cris is was a significant decline in \ncollateral values of residential and commercial real estate.  This was not particularly unusual; in fact, financial crises of the past 70 years ha ve generally been caused by exposures across the \nbanking system that are correlated and sizeable  – primarily either exposure to foreign-\ndenominated debt that is subject to exchange rate  risk, or exposure to re al estate that becomes \nvulnerable when its value d eclines precipitously.    \nIn the former scenario, the Mexican peso cr isis (in 1994) and Asian financial crisis (in \n1997) are two examples where large exposure to debt denominated in foreign currency became \nproblematic when the home country’s currency de valued, making repayment in foreign currency \nprohibitively expensive.    \nThe other main triggering mechanism has been a rapid and sizeable decline in real estate \nvalues.\n1  Because many financial intermediaries le nd to households and businesses with real \nestate as the collateral, recessi ons that are accompanied by signif icant declines in real estate \nvaluations can lead to broader problems.  Because recessions or rapid changes in asset values \nentail a loss or reduction of income for many households and busi nesses, and a loss of equity that \ncan leave loans underwater, the li kelihood of borrower default increases, adding to problems.  \nExamples include the decline in  real estate values that oc curred during periods of banking \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n6 \n problems in Japan (in 1990) and Sweden (in 1991 ), as well as the cred it crunch and financial \ncrisis periods in the United States (for exampl e, the credit crunch of the early 1990s and the \nfinancial crisis of 2008). \nToday, I will focus on financial problems tri ggered by changes in real estate values.  I \nwould note that over the past roughly 70 years,  there have been 11 recessions in the United \nStates.  Of those recessions, two featured a significant financial stab ility component, where \nbanking problems significantly aggravated  the severity of  the recession.   \nIn the early 1990s recession in the U.S., commerci al real estate values – particularly on \nthe two coasts – declined significantly.  The large losses in commercial real estate values triggered a wave of bank failures and an ensuing credit crunch.  While a large number of banks \nfailed, as shown in Figure 1 , most of the banks involved were re latively small.  In the recession \nthat began in December of 2007, the loss in residen tial real estate values also caused a notable, \nbut not as large, jump in the number of bank fa ilures – but this time the affected banks were \namong the largest.  Figure 2  shows that the value of failed-ba nk assets in real terms was much \nmore severe as a result of the large-bank failures.   \nIn terms of the real economy, both recessions were quite severe.  The unemployment rate \npeaked at 7.8 percent in June 1992; and in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the \nunemployment rate peaked at 10 percent (in October 2009).  \n Figure 3  shows that commercial and residential r eal estate prices behaved differently \nduring these two periods.  First, commercial real estate prices have b een more volatile than \nresidential real estate prices, and actually dec lined during both the earlier credit crunch period \nand during the more recent financial crisis.  S econd, commercial real estate prices did diverge \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S.

While the credit crunch period had \nmore than 8 percent of commercial real estate  loans as delinquent, there was only a modest \nincrease in the delinquency of residential loans.  In contrast, both commerci al and residential real \nestate loan delinquencies rose sharply during the more recent financial crisis. \n \nLeveraged Banks and Real Estate \n Real estate has a significant financial stabilit y implication because real  estate tends to be \nleveraged by the owners, and those loans re present a significant exposure for financial \ninstitutions that are themselves highly leveraged.   When large losses have occurred because of \ndeclines in real estate values,3 banks have historically shrunk  their lending to meet binding \ncapital-to-assets ratios (given that loans are assets for financial institutions).   \n Such a tightening of lending has several com pounding effects.  In addition to negatively \nimpacting economic activity, tighter lending cond itions also make it more difficult to sell \nimpaired assets, given that pot ential buyers would need  bank loans at a time when banks would \nbe much less willing to lend.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n8 \n  As Figure 5  illustrates, banking institutions continue to hold a significant share of loans \nrelated to real estate.  I would note the share of commercial real  estate mortgages held by banks \nwith under $50 billion in assets.  However, even the largest banks  have a significant exposure to \nthe real estate sector.4  Importantly, even though the commer cial real estate  cycle has been \ntrending up for some time, the more-recent growth in  lending has been quite significant.  Over \nthe past year, holdings of commercial mortga ges by the banking sector have increased 8.9 \npercent, while bank holdings of multifamily mortga ges have increased 12.0 pe rcent.  This growth \nhas occurred while bank supervisors have been cautioning about the potential risks emanating \nfrom the high valuations in some s ectors of the real estate market. \n  \nRegulatory Response to Real Estate Lending Exposures \n In 2006, commercial real estate guidance was issued by U.S. bank regulators that \nencouraged institutions to improve their risk ma nagement if their exposure to commercial real \nestate became large relative to their risk-based capital.5  As of the end of 2015, as commercial \nreal estate activity and lending b ecame more buoyant in the United States, bank regulators issued \na statement on Prudent Risk Management for Co mmercial Real Estate Lending.  The statement \nreemphasized policy issued in 2006 and other existing guidance, a nd further required enhanced \nrisk management and commensurate capital levels for banks with large commercial real estate \nexposures.  The statement noted that “the ag encies have observed that many CRE asset and \nlending markets are experiencing substantial growth, and that increased competitive pressures are contributing significantly to historically lo w capitalization rates a nd rising property values.”\n6 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,  \nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY \n \n  \n9 \n  Even with the issuance of real estate gui dance, loans held by banks have increased.  \nWhile the risk management of banks with larg e commercial real estate exposures has likely \nimproved, the impact of the guidance on the trajector y of commercial real estate prices appears \nmodest, as Figure 6  shows.  In particular, apartment build ing prices have increased sharply and \nare now significantly above the peak prior to the financial crisis.  While there have been changes \nin home ownership rates and household formation th at may reflect a secula r shift to apartments, \nand large apartment buildings in major United Stat es cities have become  quite trendy (including \nin my area, Boston), the increase in prices may suggest a need for further consideration of the \npotential financial stability implicatio ns if this trend were to continue. \n Other sectors of commercial re al estate have also experienced  significant price increases.  \nThe only sector to show some moderation is reta il, a sector that has be en impacted by the very \nsizable movement from brick-and-mortar retail sales to online retail purchases – a secular trend \nthat may still be playing out.   \n Increases in prices would not be as problematic if rental income were rising \ncommensurately.  However, Figure 7  provides the capitalization or  “cap” rates – defined as net \noperating income7 divided by the price of th e property – for different property types.  All the \ncapitalization rates have fallen substantially, which means that price increases have been \noutpacing growth in net operating income.  Apartm ent capitalization rates are particularly low, \nand are at their lowest point over the past 16 years. \n  As the economy improves, higher market  interest rates would normally slow new \nconstruction as well as valuations in interest-sen sitive sectors.  However, the slow recovery and \nthe possibility that equilibrium interest rates ma y remain relatively low, reflecting demographic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U. S.

This  would require a greater empha sis on macroprudential tools if \nvaluations became a source of concern.  However, with limited macroprudential tools available \nand only a modest price response to  date to guidance, it is pr udent to keep a healthy, ongoing \nfocus on the sufficiency of these t ools and their ongoing enhancement. \n \nConcluding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would observe that  real estate has play ed an important role \nin past periods of financial instability.  Its us e as collateral by leveraged institutions has factored \ninto significant problems in countries that ha ve experienced a significan t revaluation of real \nestate asset values.  As I have noted today, in the United States the two most significant recent \nperiods of financial instability were accompanied by declines in real estate values that impacted \nfinancial institutions and intensified the business cycle. \n Currently, commercial real estate capitalizati on rates are very low by historical standards, \nmeaning that price increases have been outpaci ng growth in net operating income.  This is \noccurring despite the gradual tighten ing of short-term interest rates and the issuance of real estate \nguidance by bank regulators.   \n Because real estate holdings are widesprea d, and the monetary and macroprudential tools \nfor handling valuation concerns are somewhat li mited, I believe we must acknowledge that the \ncommercial real estate sector has the potential to amplify whatever problems may emerge when \nwe at some point face an economic downturn.

I would like to thank th e New York Association for Business \nEconomics for having me here today to share my  views on the economy.  At the outset, let me \nnote as I always do that the views I express to day are my own, not necessarily those of my \ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of  Governors or on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (the FOMC).  \nThe economy continues to grow moderately – at  about the same 2 per cent pace that it has \nfor the past several years.  This rate of expansion is slower than the historical average, but that \nappears to be largely due to dec lines in the rate of growth of  productivity and the labor force.1  \n\n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n3 Over the next year or two, I expect real GDP to grow somewhat faster than 2 percent, the \nunemployment rate to continue to  gradually decline, and inflati on to gradually return to the \nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target.   \nRecent data have been quite co nsistent with this outlook.  Re al GDP for the fourth quarter \nof 2016 grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate, with c ontinued strength in consumer spending offset \nby an export slowdown. Weak exports were, in tu rn, the result of leth argic growth among many \nof our trading partners, as well as a relatively strong dollar.  The labor market report for January \nshowed that the economy added 227,000 new jobs, a nd an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent – a \nreading that is close to most economists’ estimat e of full employment.  What’s more, total and \ncore PCE inflation measures are approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target, at \n1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.2   \n While my forecast envisions a continuation of the economic growth we have seen over \nthe past several years, it is important to note that the “starting point” is now quite different than it \nwas a few years ago.  The current 4.8 percent rate  of unemployment is the same as the median \nforecast for unemployment in the long run by Fe deral Reserve policymakers (in the Federal \nReserve’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP)3 and only 0.1 percent above my own \nestimate of full employment.  This would suggest that there is limited room for further tightening \nin labor markets before one might see more infla tionary pressures.  Also, inflation is now close \nenough to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target that it is possible that we will reach the target as \nsoon as the end of this year.  However, infla tion is not the only consequence of reaching or \nexceeding full employment: Another possibility is th at imbalances will manifest themselves in \nasset prices, such as the price of  commercial real estate.     \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n4  As I will discuss today, with the economy at or approaching both elements of the Federal \nReserve’s dual mandate (price stability and ma ximum sustainable employment), it is my view \nthat it will likely be appropriate to  raise short-term interest rates at least as quickly as suggested \nby the Fed’s current SEP median forecast, and possibly even a bit more rapidly than that forecast.   Importantly, if GDP is  growing faster than potential and we reach both elements of the \ndual mandate, the Federal Reserve risks “overs hooting,” potentially jeopardizing the very \nsignificant progress of the U.S. ec onomy since the financial crisis. \n \nRecent Trends in the Labor Market \n I would like to walk you through the data that unde rpin my perspective.  Figure 1  shows \ninitial claims for unemployment insurance.  In 2005 and 2006, the years immediately preceding \nthe financial crisis, initial cl aims for unemployment insurance were averaging a bit over 300,000.  \nThey rose sharply, more than doubling, during the wo rst of the financial crisis and recession, but \nhave declined quite consistently over the past se veral years.  The most recent weeks’ data have \nseen initial claims hovering around 250,000 – below the level seen before  the last recession. \n As job prospects increase, workers become mo re confident that they will have the ability \nto improve their employment situation.   As overa ll job prospects in the marketplace improve and \nworkers’ confidence rises, employers may well n eed to pay current employees higher wages to \nreduce the incentive for workers to quit in search of wages reflecting the rising market.  As such, \na rising “quits rate” is one gauge  of how workers feel about th e labor market’s robustness and \nmay also be a sign of emerging wage pressures.    \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n5 Figure 2 shows the quits rate. Not surprisingly, th e quits rate plunged during the financial \ncrisis, as employees were primarily concerned with keeping their jobs  in a significantly \ndeteriorating labor market.  As labor markets ha ve improved, the quits rate has risen.  The quits \nrate is still somewhat below the level prior to  the recession – likely due to the aging of the \nworkforce, and the lingering memory of recent concerns about employment security.  But it \nshows a significant improvement in how employees are viewing the labor market. \n Recent payroll employment, shown in Figure 3,  has also been consistent with continued \nstrength in the labor market.  In January, th e economy added 227,000 jobs. Over the past three \nmonths, the average has been 183,000 jobs – only sli ghtly below the average for the last year.  \nThis growth rate will likely produce further declines in the unemployment rate, since \nemployment is growing faster th an the growth in the labor forc e that we expect over time.   \n The widely reported U-3 measure of civilian unemployment, shown in Figure 4 , now \nstands at 4.8 percent, which co incides with the median long-r un unemployment rate expected by \nFOMC participants in the Fed’s SEP.  The char t also shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast \n(the green dots) for the next two years, as well as the SEP median forecast (the dark blue dot) of \nthe path of the unemployment rate.  The SEP me dian and the Blue Chip consensus forecasts \nexpect the unemployment rate to end the year at 4.5 percent.   \nWhile the SEP assumes the unemployment rate w ill level off at that rate in 2018, the Blue \nChip forecasters expect it to continue to fall somewhat below 4.5 percent.  My own forecast is \nmore consistent with the path of the Blue Chip consensus forecast, in that I expect real GDP to \ngrow faster than potential, continuing to pl ace downward pressure on the unemployment rate. \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n6  One feature of the recovery from the Great  Recession has been the decline in the labor \nforce participation rate, shown in Figure 5 .  The labor force participa tion rate is defined as the \npercentage of the working-age population (16 an d older) that is either working or actively \nseeking work.   Over most of the recovery, the labor force participation rate has declined.  At \nfirst, the cyclical respons e of the participation rate had been reinforcing the tre nd associated with \nmore people in the U.S. reaching retirement ag e.  But as the recovery progressed, the trend \ndecline due to an aging population has been offs et by a positive cyclical  response of increasing \nparticipation. Thus, the recent leve lling off of participation, as seen  in the chart, should be read \nas a sign of labor market strength. \n Another feature of the labor market has been the median duration of unemployment, \nshown in Figure 6 .  The median duration of unemploymen t peaked after the Great Recession and \nhas been steadily declining duri ng the recovery.  It is now onl y somewhat higher than it was \nprior to the last recession, a lthough there remain an elevated  number of people who have \nexperienced a long duration of unemployment.4 \n In summary, the labor market has signif icantly improved during the recovery, and my \nown assessment is that there is  very limited slack remaining.  Th e unemployment rate is now at \nthe SEP median forecast for unemployment in th e longer run, and employees are becoming more \ncomfortable switching jobs, and the duration of unemployment has normalized.  Were the \neconomy to grow much faster than potential, employers w ould likely encounter increasing \ndifficulty in finding labor with the skills they need  to grow.  This potential labor shortage will \nplace a premium on workforce development – which is consistent with comments I am \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n7 increasingly hearing from business and govern ment contacts about the need for enhanced \ntraining for potential employees. \n \nEconomic Growth \n Turning to growth, Figure 7  shows the past two quarters of real GDP growth and the \nforecast of real GDP growth over the next four quarters from the Blue Chip consensus forecast. \nWhile the 2016 fourth-quarter real GDP grow th was only 1.9 percent, it followed a very \nstrong 3.5 percent growth rate in the third quarter.  As you can see, the Blue Chip forecast \nexpects real GDP growth above  2 percent. Given my 1.75 per cent estimate of the rate of \npotential growth, the Blue Chip growth fo recast would yield a falling unemployment rate. \n One source of the strength in the outlook is robust consumer spending, which accounts \nfor roughly two-thirds of real GDP.  Consumpti on was strong in the second half of 2016, as \nshown in Figure 8 , and is likely to continue to be re latively robust, reflecting strong payroll \nemployment, continued real income growth, and significant wealth gains over the past several \nyears. \n This growth in consumption is likely to offs et areas of the economy that remain relatively \nweak.  One important source of wea kness has been exports, as shown in Figure 9 .  As monetary \npolicy in the United States has become less acco mmodative, especially relative to our key \ntrading partners, the exchange va lue of the dollar has risen.  This  appreciation, coupled with the \ngeneral weakness of the economies of many U.S. trading partners , has caused real exports to \nslow.   \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n8  Figure 10  shows the SEP median and Blue Chip consensus forecasts for real GDP \ngrowth over the next two years.  The Blue Chip forecast is more optimistic than the SEP, with \nthe median forecast of Federal Open Market Committee participants expecting only 2.1 and 2.0 \npercent real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018, respectiv ely.  My own forecast is more consistent \nwith the Blue Chip consensus forecast, whic h is one reason why I am concerned about a \npotential overshoot of a sustainable fu ll-employment outcome for the economy.   \n Figure 11  provides the SEP median forecast for th e federal funds rate from the December \nFOMC meeting.  The path of interest rates in th e SEP median forecast may well be reasonable if \nthe U.S. economy averages about 2 percent growth  over the next two years.  However, if real \nGDP grows faster than that – as I expect it ma y – it is reasonable to expect additional labor \nmarket tightening, gradual increases in inflati on and, potentially, emerging imbalances in some \nasset markets.  Should this forecast for somewh at faster growth than projected in the SEP \nmaterialize, my own view is that the U.S. economy may need somewhat less monetary policy \naccommodation. \n \nConcluding Observations \n The economy has continued to improve.  Most  forecasters are predicting above-potential \ngrowth and a gradual tightening in  labor markets.  In my view , such a path would justify a \ncontinued, gradual removal of monetary policy a ccommodation at least as quickly as suggested \nby the current SEP, and possibly even a b it more rapidly than that forecast.   \n\n \n *EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1: 10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY* \n \n \n9 However, as with any forecast, there remains great uncertainty.  Significant risks to the \nU.S. economy still exist, particularly from cond itions in overseas economies.  Also, the future \nstance of fiscal policy in the United States is still unknown.  Th ese areas of uncertainty can \nmaterially impact the forecast, and by extens ion, the path of policymaking that would be \nconsistent with those forecasts.   \nThank you. \n  \n                                                            \n \n1These have lowered my estimate of the so-called potential rate of GDP growth.  The quite modest growth rate we \nhave seen over the course of the recovery has been accompanied by a significant decline in unemployment.  This \nconfirms that even historically modest 2 percent growth has exceeded the potential growth rate, throughout the recovery.  \n \n2 The target is defined in terms of total PCE inflation. \n \n3See https://www.federalreserve.gov/moneta rypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20161214.pdf . \n \n4In January, more than 24 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for 27 weeks or longer.  While that is \ndown from a peak of 45 percen t following the recession, it is  still elevated relative to a pre-recession average of 18 \npercent.   ",

I would like to thank the Connecticut Business &  Industry Association  \nand the MetroHartford Alliance for having me here today to share my views on the economy.  At \nthe outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily \nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (the FOMC).  \n\n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n2 \n  In the  two years since I last addressed this gathering , much has changed.  For those who \nhave heard me speak here over the years , you may recall  that from 2007 to 2014 , I was a strong \nadvocate for exceptionally accommodative  monetary policy to combat the severe recession we  \nexperienced  in the wake of the financial crisis .  More recently , my comments  have moved in the \nother direction, advocating for a gradual return to a more normal monetary policy.  It is not that \nmy underlying views or economic analysis have changed ; rather, economic c ircumstances have \nevolved  and now imply the need for a different stance of monetary policy . \n Today I will discuss how my earlier p reference for “easy” monetary policy and my \ncurrent desire to gradually normalize the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance  reflect a \nsingle, consistent framework.  I would note that my views  on the stance of policy , while  evolv ing \nwith the shifting economic conditions, have remained  fully consistent with the Fed’s dual \nmandate  of stable  price s and maximum sustainable employment . \n As everyone likely knows, the Federal Reserve’s policymaking body, the FOMC,  raised \nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points twice since the recovery began – first in December  2015 , \nand then in  December 2016 .  I was strongly supportive of both move s and see them  as reflecting \nthe strength of the U .S. economic recovery.   \nFor reasons that I hope to  make clear in my remarks today , I expect that appropriate \nmonetary policy  will need to normalize more quickly than over the past year, but certainly not as \nrapidly  as in the last tightening cycle , which began in 2004 .  The current unemployment rate is at \nmy estimate of what is likely to be sustainable in the long  run, and total and c ore PCE inflation \nmeasures are  approaching the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation target  (which is defined in \nterms of total PCE inflation) .  Without further gradual increases in interest rates, one might be \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n3 \n concern ed that the unemployment rate could drift below its long -run sustainable level  – and as a \nresult,  inflation could eventually exceed the Fed’s 2 percent target.  So the stance of monetary \npolicy will need to adjust  – to prevent the economy  from  dramatically overshoot ing on both \nelements of the dual mandate , which would place the economic recovery  at risk . \n \nRecent Financial Market Movements  \n Figure 1  shows the federal funds rate over the past 15 years.  It places the recent increase \nof 25 basis points in context , and contrasts  recent policy actions with those of  the last tightening \ncycle.  In the previous tightening cycle  that began in 2004 , the FOMC  raised the federal funds \nrate by 25 basis points at each meeting.  This was described in FOMC statements at the time as \nincreasing rates at a “me asured pace.”  Clearly the last two increases , in December  2015 and \nDecember 2016 , represent  quite a patient policy stance relative to the “measured pace” in the \nprevious cycle.   \nSuch a slow normalization path has been appropriate for several reasons. The significant  \nloss of jobs during the Great Recession ensured the recovery to full employment would not be \nquick.  Real GDP has been growing only slightly faster than potential over most of the recovery, \nalthough the growth of potent ial GDP is certainly slower than it used to be. And through the \nrecovery period, inflation rates both here and abroad have remained well below  the inflation \ntargets  set by central banks. Because policymakers consistently missed on the weak side of both \nelements of the dual mandate, it is my view that the very patient and gradual approach to raising \nthe funds rate has been entirely appropriate.  \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n4 \n  Consistent with the FOMC having raised interest rates quite gradually , expectations for \nadditional increases  assumed by markets remain quite modest .  Figure 2  shows the federal funds \nrate projections through 2017 implied by the futures  market  at three points  – at the time of the \nfirst tightening in December 2015, at the beginning of last July after the Brexit vo te, and as of \nlast Friday.  The financial markets have indicated skeptic ism about how quickly the Federal \nReserve  will be able to normalize  rates , and  imply a path only somewhat  faster than the past two \nyears . \n Despite the relatively slow pace of increases  reflected in market expect ations  for the \nfederal funds rate, longer -term rates have increased significantly since the November FOMC \nmeeting.  The bar chart in Figure 3  shows that the 10 -year U.S. Treasury rate has increased by \nmore than 50 basis points, and long rates in the U nited Kingdom , Germany , and Japan have also \nincreased  – although by much  less.  These results  may reflect the expectation of potentially more \nstimulative fiscal policy, greater confidence that inflation will increase  toward targets , and more \noptimism about global prospects.  \n An indicator  of greater confidence in inflation rates rising to targets is seen in the “break -\neven ” inflation rates that are implied by  the difference between five-year Treasury rates and rates \non five-year Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities  (TIPS) .  As shown in Figure 4 , over the past \nfive years  the break -even inflation rate has been well below the Fed eral Reserve ’s 2 percent \ninflation target, but since early November the implied inflation rate has risen  quite close to that \ninflation target.  This indicates a growing confidence by financial market  participan ts that the \neconomy will successfully reach the Fed’s 2 percent  inflation target, and should average quite \nclose to 2 percent inflation over the next five years.  \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n5 \n  The recent movement in financial market prices should provide greater confidence that \nthe Federal Reserve is  finally closing in on both elements of its dual mandate, and that an \nincreased pace of the gradual  monetary policy  normalization in the United States is appropriate.  \nThis is particularly noteworthy considering that central banks in other developed countries are \nstill easing monetary policy  in attempts  to reach their inflation targets.   \n \nThe Labor Market Outlook  \n Figure 5  shows the path of two measures of unemployment – the U-3 and U -6 \nunemployment rate s – since 2006.  The widely reported and closely followed U-3 measure of \nunemployment was 4.7 percent  in December.  My own definition of full employment  – meaning \nthe unemployment rate associated with full employment  – is 4.7 percent, so we have now in \neffect reached the level of unemployment that I think is likely to be sustainable in the long -run.   \nThe U -6 measure of unemployment is a broader gauge that includes work ers who are \nemployed part  time for economic reasons and potential workers who have become discouraged .  \nThe measure has fallen quite dramatically , to 9.2 percent , but is still somewhat above pre -\nrecession levels.  An open question is whether structural changes in the economy, including the \nincreased use of contractors and part -timers in the so-called “ gig” economy, are likely to impact \nwhether we see a return  to earlier  levels  of the U -6 measure . \n One can see  other indications that labor markets are continuing to tighten.  Figure 6  \nshows the unemployment rates since 2006 for those with a bachelor’s  degree or higher and those \nwith only a high school diploma.  For those with high er educational attainment , the \nunemployment rate is approaching the lows last seen prior to the recession.  With the \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n6 \n unemployment rate for this group at 2. 5 percent, and with m any jobs requiring higher \neducational attainment, it is fair to expect that we will begin to see pressures in labor markets for \nscarce talent.  \nThose with  only a high school diploma have an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent , which \nis also slightly elevated relative to pre -recession levels.  While there are clearly returns to higher \neducational attainment in terms of labor market outcomes, additions to the labor force for the \nhigher -skilled positions will likely require more attention to workforce development and possibly \nmore forms of encouragement to achieve higher educationa l outcomes.  \n Figure 7 shows the 12 -month moving average growth in the labor force from 2006  to the \npresent . The labor force is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those \nwho are searching for employment (that is, are unemployed).  Recently, increases in payroll \nemployment have resulted in smaller declines in the unemployment  rate because the U.S.  has \nbeen experiencing relatively strong growth in the labor force.  Indeed, an i ncrease in the labor \nforce is a potential benefit of relatively tight labor markets.   \nTo look a bit further , Figure 8  shows the 12 -month moving average of entry and exit to \nthe labor force as a percentage of the population.1  The growth in the labor force  has resulted \nfrom declining exits rather  than entries – that is, the percent of the population exiting the labor \nforce has declined more than the percent of the population entering the labor force.  Given the \ndemographic trends of a larger cohort of people reaching retirement age , and thus more likely to \nexit t he labor force , this trend of declining exits is unlikely to continue to be a source of labor \nforce  growth . This in turn implies that, with sustained employment growth, the unemployment \nrate will likely decline faster than it has in recent months.  \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n7 \n  Turning to the wage implications, Figure 9  shows growth in two measures of labor \ncompensation from 2006.  The first is average hourly earnings, from the payroll survey, which \nsimply divides total wages  paid by total hours  worked . Because it is an economy -wide average, \ncompositional changes in the labor force across industries  and occupations, or across high - \nversus low -wage  jobs will influence  the growth rate  in this measure .  The second measure is the \nEmployment Cost Index  (ECI) for wages and salaries. Data for the ECI is generated by asking \nfirms about the compensation they must pay for workers in specific occupations, so it can hold \nthe occupational mix constant in a way that the average hourly earnings measure of wages \ncannot. Both series show that wa ges have been increasing over the past two years, consistent \nwith strong labor market demand.  \n Overall, labor market data are consistent with tight ening  labor markets.  With the \nunemployment rate near or below most estimates of full employment, and with wa ges continuing \nto increase, this part of the  Federal Reserve’s  dual mandate – maximum sustainable employment  \n– seems largely fulfilled.  \n \nThe Inflation Outlook  \n Turning to the inflation side of the Fed’s dual mandate, Figure 10  shows total and core \nPCE inflation rates since 2006.  Over the past year, total and core inflation have been increasing ; \nhowever, both measures are currently below the  Fed’s  inflation target of 2 percent  – the level \nmonetary policymakers  associate with stable prices .  My own forec ast is for both measures to be \nat 2 percent by the end of 2017.  While the Fed’s inflation target is defined in terms of total PCE \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n8 \n inflation, other measures of inflation that often anticipate the direction of total PCE inflation \nhave also been trending up recently.  \n Figure 11  shows total and core CPI prices since 2006.  CPI is focused on the basket of \ngoods pur chased by consumers,2 and has increased r oughl y 0.3 percent faster than the PC E \nmeasure  over the past 10  to 15 years .3  Both measures have been increasing over the past two \nyears.  \n Alternative inflation measures that try to capture the underlying inflation process by \nremoving outliers  are shown in Figure 12 .  The Dallas Federal Reserve Bank comput es the \ntrimmed -mean  PCE.  By removing the outliers,  the series is less volatile  – but again  it has been \nincreasing over the past two years, although it remains below the 2 percent inflation target.  The \nCleveland Federal Reserve Bank provides the trimmed -mean  CPI.  It, too, has been  gradually \nincreasing over the past two years.  \n Overall, the inflation indices provide a fairly consistent pattern of gradually increasing \ninflation rates.  The combination of tighter labor markets and the gradual increases in inflation \nrates , measured in a variety of ways, should provide  more confidence that the economy  will \nattain the Federal Reserve’s inflation target over the next year.  \n \nImplications for Monetary Policy  \n  Figure 13  provides the estimates of the likely  federal funds rate path from the June and \nDecember  Surveys of Primary Dealers , and from Federal Reserve policymakers ( FOMC \nparticipants ).  The dots are the median federal funds  rate projections for year -end as provided by \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n9 \n FOMC participants in the Summ ary of Economic Projections (SEP) at the June and  December \nFOMC meeting s.  Two observations stand out.  First, over the past six months, both the primary \ndealers and the FOMC participants have seen conditions improve sufficiently to expect  \ncontinued normalization of monetary policy.  Second, m arket participants continue to expect less \ntightening than do FOMC participants.   \n My own view is that the SEP median forecast seems reasonable if we continue to see real \nGDP growing faster than the so -called “ potential ” rate .  My own forecast is that we will achieve \nboth elements of the dual mandate by the end of 2017  – and as a result , I believe that a still \ngradual but somewhat more regular increase in the federal funds rate will be  warranted.  \n In addition to short -term interest rates , the Federal Reserve has a second policy tool at its \ndisposal, the balance sheet , shown in Figure 14 .  The central bank’s balance sheet has been \nroughly level over the past two years.  With the federal funds rate expected to continue its  \ngradual ris e from the zero lower bound, the risk of returning to  the zero  lower bound should \ndiminish .  The FOMC has published a statement on its policy normalization principles and \nplans.4  As part of the monetary policy normalization strategy, the FOMC should, of course, \ncontinue to consider whether it needs to maintain such a large balance sheet.    \n \nConclu ding Observat ions \n Given where it was in recent years, t he economy has shown remarkable progress.  We \nnow are quickly approaching  employment and inflation levels consistent with both elements of \nthe Fed’s  dual mandate  – price stability and maximum sustainable employment .  I firmly believe \nthat t he aggressive policy actions taken by the Fed during the financial crisis and recession m ade \n\n*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday , January  9, 201 7, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*  \n \n10 \n a huge difference  – our economy would not be as healthy as it is and we would thus not be near a \ntightening cycle now if we hadn’t been so aggressive then .  As a result , the U .S. is closer to \nachieving its goals for monetary policy than  are most other developed countries.  Looking ahead , \nI see the Federal Reserve as  likely to continue to gradually normalize U.S. monetary  policy, even \nas many other countries  may need to continu e to pursue  more expansionary monetary policies.  \n Thank you for as king me to be with you today.  Best wishes for a very good year  in 2017 .   \n  \n                                                           \n1 As previously noted , the labor force is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those who are searching for \nemployment (that is, are unemployed). Civilians 16 years and over who are not employed or unemployed are categorized as not \nin the labor force.  For  example, civilians 16 years and over who are without jobs but are not actively seeking work are \nconsidered not in the labor force.  Labor force entries are flows into employment and unemployment from not in the labor forc e.  \nLabor force exits are flows fr om employment and unemployment to not in the labor force.  Other inflows and outflows are also \nincluded in this calculation of entries and exits.  These include persons just turning 16, estimated deaths, and adjustments to \npopulation totals.  \n \n2 The CPI is perhaps better known to the public, but its focus on out-of-pocket consumer expenditures makes it somewhat less \ncomprehensive than PCE, which also includes purchases made on behalf of consumers – for example, by health -insurance \ncompanies.   \n \n3 Over the last five years, it has increased only 0.1 percent faster.   \n \n4 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm .",
