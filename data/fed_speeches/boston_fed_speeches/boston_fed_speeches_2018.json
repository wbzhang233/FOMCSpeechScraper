Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nRemarks at a Forum on the Federal Reserve’s Inflation \nTarget – the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy,  \nthe Brookings Institution  \n \n \nWashington, D.C.  \nJanuary 8, 2018 \n \n \nGood afternoon.  It is a pleasure to be here at Brookings.  I’d like to thank David Wessel \nof the Hutchins Center  for inviting me to participate in this forum.  I t is also my pleasure to be \nhere with John David Murra y of the Bank of Canada , to provide some observations in response  \nto his comments .1   \nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express  are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC).  \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n The monetary policy framework ad opted by the Federal Reserve is rooted squarely in our  \n“dual mandate ” from Congress,  which directs the Fed to seek maximum sustainable employment  \nand stable prices .2  And i n the spirit of today’s conference, I want to pose a couple of questions  \nthat tee up my remarks.  G iven that the Congressional mandate has not changed, why might it be \nbeneficial to evaluate the  Fed’s monetary  policy  framework periodically?  And relatedly, w hy is \nthe framework not as durable as the Congressional mandate?  \nImpor tantly , the Congressional mandate is quite broad.  It wa s not until 2012 that the \nFederal Reserve explicitly defined the stable -prices component of the mandate in numerical \nterms , as a 2 percent inflation target tied to total PCE inflation .3  The second half of the man date, \nmaximum employment, was  not assigned  a numerical  target  given that the Fed does not , of \ncourse,  set the natural rate of unemployment – and estimates of the natural rate have changed \nconsiderably over time , with  changes in  demographic and labor -market characteristics .  \nSince 2012, the FOMC has voted at the beginning of each year on a statement of  longer -\nrun goals and monetary policy strategy , which provides a long- run goal for inflation (the 2 \npercent target ) and broadly defines a monetary policy strategy.  Currently, the strategy involves  a \nso-called balanced approach : the Committee gives equal weigh t to deviations of employment \nfrom an estimate of full employment, and to deviations of inflation from the  2 percent target.    \nIn light of this , one could argue that the U.S. version of the Bank of Canada’s five -year \nreview actually occurs at a yearly frequency at the Federal Reserve.   However , the Federal \nReserve’s  annual  reaffirmation of the longer -run inflation goal and monetary policy strategy has \nnot regularly  involved the  extensive discussion, and  incorporation of outside commen ts, that are \npart of  the Bank of Canada ’s process .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n From my perspective, i t is possible that th e absence of m ore involved debate regarding \nthe Federal Reserve’s inflation goal and monetary policy strategy reflect s the fact that the FOMC \nis broadly comfortable with the status quo framework for achieving monetary policy goals and \nour mandate .  Still, with this in mind , I would suggest that there are several compelling \nargument s for a more robust periodic review of the  Federal Reserve’s  monetary policy \nframework.  \nFirst, admittedly the choice of the 2 percent inflation target reflected a commonly used \ntarget of other central banks , and was consistent with a literature that viewed a 2 percent target as \nlikely to be in the neighborhood of optimal.  However, much of that literature was based on pre -\ncrisis research that estimated that the effective lower bound for the policy interest rate would \nrarely  be hit, and that interest rates would remain at the effective lower bound only briefly.  That \nresearch appears to  have significantly underestimated  the real -world probability of hitting the \neffective lower bound.  Moreover, the probability of hitting the effective lower bound is higher \nin an economy with a low equilibrium real interest rate, as would be associated with our current \ncharacteristics of s low productivity growth, slow population growth, and  aging demogra phics .  \nIn fact, the optimal rate of inflation may move around just as does the natural rate of \nunemployment . \nSecond, t he ability to achieve an inflation target over a reasonable amount of time has \ncome into question as the U.S., Euro A rea, and Japan have all fallen short of their inflation \ntarget s, regularly  and quite consistently, since the onset of the financial crisis.  Notably, \nundershooting on inflation has occurred despite  aggressive  use of  less-traditional monetary tools  \ndesigned to make policy more  accommodative in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Great \nRecession, and very slow recovery .4 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n Third, U.S. policymakers must take into account complicating factors. .  W ith fiscal \npolicy constrained by rising debt -to-GDP  ratios, and questions about the potency of \nnontraditional monetary policy tools in generat ing robust recoveries, the trade -offs between the \ngoals  – and even the optimal level of the goals  – may be different now than when the FOMC  \nadopted the  framework.  \nIn light of al l this , in my view it may be a good time to consider putting in place a \nperiodic Federal Reserve led assessment of the U.S.  monetary policy framework that would \ninclude  input from a variety of sources inside and outside the central bank.  Such a periodic r e-\nevaluation could consider whether changed economic fundamentals (such as the equilibrium real \ninterest rate) should alter how best to satisfy the Congressional mandate given to the central \nbank.  \nFurthermore, a  periodic reassessment could involve consider ation of  whether alternative \nframeworks woul d better meet the mandate, and evaluate the costs and benefits of  transition ing \nto the new framework  – as well as  the longer -run implications .  For example, in recognition of \nthe challenges the Federal Reserve has  experienced with our  current framework , a reassessment \nmight include discuss ion of  whether an inflation range , nominal GDP targeting, or price -level \ntargeting  would help the Fed  better achieve its Congressionally -mandated goals.    In fact, my \nown view is that we should be focused on an inflation range , with the potential to move with in \nthe range as the optimal inflation rate changes.  This will be the topic of a talk I am giving later \nthis week, when I will have an opportunity dis cuss the suggestion more fully.  \nSimilar to the Bank of Canada, a U.S. review c ould include research  papers  by Fed \neconomists, as well as input from academics  and other macro -policy institutions .  This type of  \nperiodic  exercise could reinforce the Federal Reserve’s  commitment to attaining the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n Congressional mandates , while providing  a more public and transparent  forum for evaluating our \nperformance in attaining these goals.  \n Finally, I would note that a number of  process details could influence the efficacy of such \na review process .  The Bank of Canada has a full review every five years.   One does not want to \nevaluate a monetary policy  framework  too frequently , given that  changes in underlying \neconomic fundamentals are relatively  infrequent and take time to fully a ssess.  At the same time , \nit is important to make changes if the existing framework is no longer consist with how the \neconomy has evolved.   \nIt would also be extremely important to design a review process that appropriat ely \nbalances  the central bank ’s accountability to Congress for the mandate with  its independence  to \npursue policymaking and technical refinements .  Review s would need to focus on the structural  \nchanges that have reduced the efficacy of the Fed’s  monetary policy framework, not the injection \nof short -term partisan political influence .  While any significant change in the framework should \ninvolve active consultation with Congress  – as was the case when the Fed formally adopted its \nnumerical price ob jective  in 2012 – the review  should be focused on the technical framework \nthat the central bank employs to achieve the Congressional mandate ’s goals  and would need to \nbe seen as such .   \nMy own personal preference would be to conduct a full review with a specified frequency \n– possibly longer than the five years used by the Bank of Canada – but to make it possible to call \nfor an earlier review when warranted.  Given the unpredictability of changes in the optimal \ntargets, providing the option to call for a special review would be important.  This would allow \nfor a re -examination when needed – specifically when most participants view economic events \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.  Eastern Time on Monday, January 8 , 201 8 OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n as justifying a full re -examination of the framework.  Clearly, however, this is just one a pproach \nand there are a variety of other permutations that could be considered by the FOMC.  \nIn summary and conclusion, the Bank of Canada provides a process which I view as quite \ninstructive.  My own view is that the costs of hitting the effective lower bo und, and staying there \nfor a prolonged period, should cause a reassessment of whether a specific 2 percent inflation \ntarget is still warranted.  The optimal inflation rate is unlikely to be 2 percent if economic \nfundamental s cause the central bank’s policy  rate to regularly hit the effective lower bound \nduring economic downturns.  As a result, having a process that can fully and more transparently \nexamine the monetary policy framework would be a process improvement, and would allow the \nFederal Reserve to sy stematically examine and alter its framework when needed.  \nThank you.  \n \n                                                           \n1 As John Murray illustrated in his presentation, the Bank of Canada has a process for revisiting its inflation target \nand monetary policy framework that has been in place for quite some time. This process occurs at a regular five -year \nfrequency, it seeks comments from academics and the general public and, though not legislated, it features the \nexplicit involvement of the government.  See http://www.bankofcan ada.ca/core- functions/monetary -policy/.  \n \n2 The dual mandate is derived from The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.  Among the changes made to the \nFederal Reserve Act was a directive to \"maintain long -run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates \ncommensurate with the economy's long -run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals \nof maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long -term interest rates.\"  The shorthand for this is the goal of \nmaximum employment consist ent with stable prices.  \n \n3 In order to provide more clarity about how the Federal Reserve implemented t he dual mandate, t he FOMC issued \nthe Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which  is important for clarifying to the public \nwhat mon etary policy is about, and also for providing FOMC members with a common framework when conducting \npolicy. FOMC members will have different opinions about economic conditions and where the economy is headed. \nStill, according to the strategy document, the w ay these differences are translated into different policy \nrecommendations should be consistent across FOMC members, in that members agree to share the same inflation \ngoal and assign the same penalty to deviations of inflation and unemployment from their lo nger-run values.    \nThe statement became effective January 24, 2012 , and  was subsequently amended , effective January 31, 2017 . See \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement -on-longer -run-goals -monetary -policy -strategy -fomc.htm .  \n \n4 As already mentioned, the statement on longer -run goals and monetary policy strategy specifies a balanced \napproach on stabilizing inflation around the inflation target and the unemployment rate around its natural level. It \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M.

He was courageous in \nMoney, Models, & Digital Innovation Conference   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n the Dutch Underground in World War II, success ful as a banking leader, a passionate advoca te \nfor invest ment  in inner cities, and committed to many civic and philanthropic causes . \nBefore I begin my remarks today , let me note as I always do that the views I express are \nmy own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).    \nI would like  to start by  reflecting on the past year ’s economic performance , which was \nbetter than most forecasters were expect ing a year ago.  U.S. l abor markets have continued to \nimprove ; and with the unemployment rate now at 4.1 percent , I think we have clearly lef t the \nperiod of the Great Recession behind.   Real GDP growth in the second and third quarters of 2017 \nwas over 3 percent  – well abov e the level of growth economists call “ potential .” By definition,  if \nabove -potential growth  continues , as expected by many forecasters, labor market s will tighten \nfurther , likely pushing the unemployment rate well below its sustainable rate .   \nInflation has also been subdued, especially considering that it has already  been  a fairly \nlong economic recovery b y historical standards.  Low inflation  has enabled the Federal Reserve  \nto pursue  a very gradual exit from the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation  under taken \nto address the financial crisis, the Great Recession, and the slow recovery . The Fed’s policy \naccommodation, along with a well -recovered economy, ha ve been generally good for asset  \nprice s, including stocks . \nWhile the economic news has remained  positive , the extent of  the forecast “ misses ” by \nFOMC participants and private sector forecasters  – our forecast errors for both inflation and \nunemployment – are relevant for the topic of this conference on money and models.  On a \nquarterly basis, FOMC participants provide their economic forecasts for key economic variables, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n called the Summ ary of Economic Projections or SEP.  At the December 2016 FOMC meeting,  \nthe median SEP forecast  was that  2017  would finish with the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent \nand core inflation (measured using the Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index) \nat a rate of  1.8 percent .  Instead, the unemployment rate ended up 0.4 perce nt lower than \nexpected ; and core PCE inflation , based on the data through November, was 0.3  percent lower \nthan expected.  While these are not overwhelming forecast errors by historical standards, t he \ninflation miss, in particular, has  received significant attention by some observers  – as inflation \nhas been lower than expected , despite labor markets  that are tighter than expected . \nMy own perspective on this is that the recent miss es in the Fed’s  inflation forecast ha ve \nnot been particularly large, taken in the context of the forecast errors made historically in \nforecasting infla tion.  The forecast errors for inflation also have not been particularly consistent \nor persistent , which would  be expect ed if the Fed’s  inflation models were missing some \nfundamental change in the inflation process.  As a result,  I would argue that  it does not seem \njustified to assum e there have been  changes in the underlying inflation process , based on  \nrelatively modest recent miss es.  Of course, if we continue to experience one -sided forecast \nerrors for another year or two, the possibility of struc tural change should be considered more \nseriously.   \n           Thus, I do not view the somewhat lower than expected  recent inflation rate as particularly \ntroublesome for near-term monetary  policy .  But looking to the medium and long run, I do see \nlow and fixed inflation targets  as a potential problem  – particularly if we continue to experience \nlow productivity  growth , a low equilibrium interest rate, and the  near-certainty of a slowly \ngrowing  and aging  workforce .  In such an environment, with a two percent inflation goal, \nnominal interest rates are likely to be low , on average.  As a consequence, when a recession \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n eventually does occur , policymakers  would likely start with a low policy rate  – perhaps 3 percent \nor so  – leaving little room to  lower rates to offset the effects of the recession.  The desire to \nretain an adequate “policy buffer”  – by which I mean the amount of room we have to lower rates \nto offset recessions  – lies at the heart of my evolving thoughts on the appropriate monetary \npolicy framework.2   \nIf, as a result,  we seek to avoid a prolonged low  interest rate environment in the future, \nthen my view is that polic ymakers  should start studying and discussing alternative frameworks  to \nmake this outcome less likely.  While there is little that monetary policy can do to impact \nproductivity or labor force growth, policymakers  can influence the prevailing level of interest \nrates by adjusting our medium -term inflation goal.3  One option woul d be targeting a higher \ninflation rate,4 so that nominal interest rates would be higher than otherwise  – and there have \nbeen other more technical proposals  (for example  price -level targeting and nominal GDP \ntargeting)  designed to provide a greater buffer .5  \nI would also suggest that t he optimal inflation rate is not likely to remain constant over \ntime.  An alternative , which  would recognize that the inflation target should not necessarily be \nconstant, is an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target.  W ithin this framework, one \ncould  think of our inflation goal as defined by two components: A range  of inflation rates  that \npolicymakers  would find acceptable across many economic circumstances, and a medium -term \ngoal within that range that policymakers  would set , perhaps year by year, depending on specific \neconomic circumstances.   \nIn my view, a dopting an inflation range  that allows for movement in the effective \nmedium -run inflation goal might be a helpful addition to the Fed’s  monetary policy framework.6  \nAn inflation range that allows some movement in the inflation target , depending on economic \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n fundamentals , would be treating the Fed’s  inflation goal more like the natural rate of \nunemployment, where we recognize that the natural rate will shift over time with demographic \nand other workforce characteristics.  \nOf course, the advantages of greater inflation targ et flexibility would likely be partly \noffset by some costs .  For instance, i t is likely  that such  flexibility would generate more \nuncertainty about inflation in the medium to long run, since we cannot know for sure how long  \nproductivity and demographic tre nds would persist.7  However, if we set the range to  – for \nexample  – 1.5 to 3.0 percent, and were successful in  keep ing inflation mostly in that range, this \nwould represent a set of inflation outcomes that are similar to those  the U.S.  has experienced \nover the past 20 years.   \n \nPerspectives on Recent Forecast Misses  \n          As previously mentioned, o nce a quarter, FOMC participants provide their economic \nforecasts for key economic variables.  Among the charts that are included are the so called “fan \ncharts, ” shown in Figure 1  for PCE inflation.   The fan chart  show s that even at a 70 percent \nconfidence level, the forecast errors for PCE inflation are quite large.   Thus, w ith the current 2 \npercent forecast, it would not be at all surprising to have actual inflation turn out to somewhere \nbetween  1 to 3 percent.   \nThe sources of these forecast misses are many: large , unexpected changes in energy, \nfood, import or other volatile  prices can temporarily disrupt overall inflation measures relative \nto the forecast; the economy can grow faster or slower than we expect; or our assessment of what \nis relatively fast or slow can be off.  A good examp le of an unexpected price change is the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n modification  in wireless service pricing by many U.S. mobile carriers  that occurred last spring . \nThis change  is one of the factors that lowered the PCE inflation rate relative to the  forecast in \nDecember 2016.    \n Figure 2 provides some history on SEP8 and private -sector  forecast errors , comparing the \nmedian core PCE inflation rate forecast for one -year-ahead to the actual rate,  based on both the \nSEP and the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ fourth  quarter forecasts for  each year .9  While \nthe forecast error (based on the 2016  fourth -quarter forecast for the core inflation rate10 for the \nfourth quarter of 2017 ) was clearly a miss, it certainly was not outsized relative to other one-\nyear-ahead forecast errors made over the past 10 years.  In addition, forecasters made  both \npositive and negative forecast errors  during this period , not persistently missing in one direction.  \nThis forecast record  seems inconsistent with concerns of some obser vers who argue  forecasters  \nare missing some fundamental attribute of inflation dynamics.  \n Figure 3 provides forecast errors for the unemployment rate forecast, by comparing both \nthe SEP and the Survey of Professional Forecasters ’ median  unemployment rate  forecast for the \nfourth quarter of the next year with the actual rate, for each fourth -quarter forecast.   While the \n2016 fourth -quarter forecast  error for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 is not \nparticularly large relative to previous y ears, there do seem to be persistent , consistent forecast  \nerrors  in the same direction for the unemployment rate, unlike for the inflation rate .  That is, \nsince 2010 , forecasters have  regularly anticipated the unemployment rate would fall less than \nactuall y occurred.  \n From a short -run policy perspective, the inflation forecast errors do not seem to be \nparticularly noteworthy, and would not seem to indicate serious forecast biases over the past \ndecade .  In contrast , the persistent forecasts that unemployment  will not fall as much as has \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n occurred should provide  policymakers pause , since at 4.1 percent the unemployment rate is \nalready well below most estimates of the sustainable long -run unemployment rate .  The most \nrecent median estimate for the natural rate from the Survey of Professional Forecasters is 4.5 \npercent; the corresponding median longer -run unemployment rate estimate from the December \nSEP is 4.6 percent.  \n \nModels and the Monetary Policy Framework  \nSince January 2012 , the FOMC has publish ed a statement  of longer -run goals and \nmonetary policy strategy11 that it reaffirms, sometimes with small modifications, at each January \nFOMC meeting. The statement provides the FOMC ’s tactical approach for meeting the Federal \nReserve’s dual mandate provided by Congress : foster ing economic conditions to achiev e both \nstable prices and maximum sustainable employment .   \nThe statement  explicitly define s the inflation goal as being a 2 percent inflation target.12  \nThe employment mandate does not have a numerical target because  the natural rate  of \nunemployment  is primarily determined by non -monetary factors , must be inferred from other \neconomic data, and has moved significantly over time .13  The statement also clarifi es that when \nthere are misses in both elements of the dual manda te, the Committee should follow a balanced \napproach , by which we mean that we will give  equal  policy  attention to  deviations of \nemployment from an estimate of full employment, and to deviations of  inflation from its 2 \npercent target.  \nAt the time of adoptio n of the statement o n longer -run goals , the 2 percent inflation target \nwas quite similar to the target set by most other central banks in developed economies.14  Many \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.  Eastern  Time , and 1:15 P.M. Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n academic studies advocate d for a 2 percent inflation target as being consi stent with price \nstability, although  many of the m were conducted prior to the Great Recession.  Most of this \nresearch that attempted to determine how large a policy buffer  would be sufficient  – and thus \nhow high a target inflation rate would be best  – generally estimated that  interest rates were \nunlikely to reach the effective lower bound, but if they did, the expected duration at near -zero \ninterest rates would be measured in quarters, not years .   \nUnfortunately, the economic history of the past 10 years has shown that many developed \ncountries in the wake of the Great Recession and financial crisis were forced to hold interest \nrates  near zero for many years, much longer than the earlier model estimat es suggested .15  Such \nlow interest rate  environments  make it difficult to conduct counter -cyclical monetary policy , and \ncan potentially undermine financial stability , as households and firms “reach for yield” in the \nface of  low interest rates , almost always  taking on additional risk as a consequence . \nIt is not surprising , in my view, that many estimates assumed that a period of prolonged \nlow interest rates w as unlikely.  In an economy with rapid increases in productivity and an \nexpanding  labor force, periods  of prolonged low interest rates are likely to be  avoided  in most \nrecessions .  However, the size of the negative shock from the Great Recession , along with  \nfundamental changes in the economy ,16 have made it much more likely that future recessions \ncould also result in prolonged low interest rates and a need to conduct monetary policy with  \nnontraditional methods , such as asset purchases on  central banks’  balance sheet s – rather than \njust through movement of short -term interest rates.  \nFigure 4  shows FOMC participants’ assessments of the longer -run rate that the federal \nfunds rate will settle to when the Fed has achieved both elements of the dual mandate. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.

Pacific  Time  on Friday, January 12,  2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n Recognizing the effects of slower productivity  growth and labor force growth on this so -called \n“neutral” rate of interest, SEP submissions have gradually lowered this measure since 2012.   \nIn early 2012, both the median forecast and the central tendency of FOMC participants \nwas that the federal funds target rate in the longer-run would be at least  4 percent.  As of \nDecember  2017 , both the median forecast and most of the central tendency expect  that the \nfederal funds target rate will be below 3 percent.17  Since most recessions involve lowering the \nfeder al funds target rate by more than 300 basis points, this makes it seem quite likely that a low \ninterest rate environment will become a more common occurrence.  \nFigure 5  illustrates one possible reason for the decline in the expectations of the longer -\nrun or neutral federal funds rate.  Productivity growth is much lower now than it has been for \nmuch of the previous 50 years.  This lower productivity  growth, as long as it persists,  implies \nthat real interest rates are likely to be lower  on average . \nFigure 6  provides another reason to expect lower real interest rates, which is the \nreduction in the growth in the civilian labor force.  With slower population growth, fewer \nimmigrants, and an aging population , the growth in the labor force is expected t o be much lower \nfor quite some time than it has been in previous decades.  Again, this implies lower real interest \nrates.  \n One way to avoid periods of prolonged low interest rates would be to alter the inflation \ntarget  in response to changes in our estimates of real interest rates  – estimates that have been \nchanging of late.  This would make inflation, like the natural un employment rate, a target that \ncould vary over time.  If , for example , the monetary policy framework set an inflation range  of, \nsay 1.5 to 3.0 percent, the FOMC could vary its medium -term inflation target to be high, low , or \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.

For example, in the current environmen t, with low population \ngrowth and low productivity  growth , policy could move even more gradually to remove \naccommodation, and allow inflation to be somewhat higher in its range.  Should the labor force \nor productivity grow more quickly, the Committee could  seek to gradually reduce the inflation \ntarget  within its range . \nUsing an inflation range would trad e off the costs of more effective policy responses to \nrecessions (and the potential financial stability risk that may attend prolonged low interest rate \nperiods), with the costs of having somewhat less certainty about what the inflation rate would be \nin the long  run.  But a s long as the inflation rate w ere in a relatively narrow band , such as 1.5  to \n3.0 percent, the range would not be a dramatic change from a ctual experience and would \ntherefore be less likely to impact inflation expectations.  If changes in productivity and labor \nforce growth occurred very infrequently, the inflation target would be stable  – but at a level more \nconsistent with avoiding prolong ed low interest rates.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \nRecent forecast errors of inflation and unemployment have not been particularly large, \nand do not pose much challenge to continuing on the current path of gradual increases in the \nfederal funds rate.  Perhaps  the bigger risk for short -run policy  is the fact that the unemployment \nrate continues to fall further below sustainable levels , and will likely continue to do so going \nforward, risking the sustainability of the recovery . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.

If the U.S. economy is  to avoid a scenario in which the \neffective lower bound is reached and the central bank must use its balance sheet for asset \npurchases rather than  move  short -term interest rates for counter -cyclical monetary policy , then \npolicymakers  should consider alternative monetary policy frameworks that would make such \noutcomes less likely.  \nAn inflation range with an adjustable medium -run inflation goal is one way to address \nsuch concerns, but there are a variety of alternative frameworks also worth considering .18  In my \nview, we are approaching a time when a comprehens ive reconsideration of the monetary policy \nframework is likely  warranted , given the experience o f the past 10 years.   Any change we make \nshould be designed to provide policymakers  with the flexibility to set monetary policy \nappropriately as key features of the economy change, as they have repeatedly over U.S. \neconomic history . \nThank you.  \n \n \n1 See https://www.interdependence.org/wp -content/uploads/2013/10/Heldring -\nObituary.pdfh ttps://www.interdependence.org/wp -content/uploads/2013/10/Heldring -Obituary.pdf . \n \n2 For additional discussion, see Jan. 8, 2018 remarks at the Brookings Institution by Eric S.

Or would we expect to adjust the medium -term \ninflation goal down when real rates are un usually high? And what status does the center of the range hold? Do we \nintend for inflation to average somewhere near the center of the range over a longer span of time ?, Do we always \nplan for inflation to return to the center of the range at some horizon?  \n \n7 In addition, FOMC participants  would no doubt consider adjusting our medium -term inflation goal up or down \nonly when we (and others) had estimated that a persistent  change in real rate determinants had occurred and was \nlikely to continue. Such an asses sment is of course difficult and entails uncertainty  \n \n8 Prior to the June 2015 medians, SEP medians are only available with a five -year lag.  Proxies for the medians for \nthe December 2013 and 2014 one -year-ahead forecasts for the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2015, for core PCE \ninflation and the unemployment rate used in the forecast error calculations for Figures 2 and 3 are calculated from \nthe d istribution of FOMC participants’ projections reported in ranges of tenths in the FOMC meeting minutes.   \n \n9 Of course, the actual values are revised over time.  We have used the most up -to-date figures in the calculations.   \n \n10 While total PCE is the target for this exercise, we used core PCE to avoid outsized errors that would be related to  \nthe often volatile food and energy prices . \n \n11 In order to provide more clarity about how the Federal Reserve implemented the dual mandate, the FOMC issued \nthe Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is important for clarifying to the public \nwhat mone tary policy is about, and also for providing FOMC members with a common framework when conducting \npolicy.  FOMC members  will have different opinions about economic conditions and where the economy is headed. \nStill, according to the strategy document, the way these differences are translated into different policy \nrecommendations should be consistent across FOMC members, in that members agree to share the same inflation \ngoal and assign the same penalty to deviations of inflation and unemployment from their longer -run values.  The \nstatement became effective Jan . 24, 2012, and was subsequently amended, effective Jan .31, 2017. S ee \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement -on-longer -run-goals -monetary -policy -strategy -fomc.htm .  \n \n12 This is measured by the annual  change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures . \n \n13 For example, the natural rate has varied as the demographic composition of the labor market has changed . \n \n14 Two percent was seen as a practical compromise between some academic work that suggested that zero (or even \nnegative) inflation was optimal, and work on the other hand that saw value both in “greasing the wheels” of wage \nsetting given reluctance of workers to take nominal wage cuts, and in providing the policy buffer that I have just  \ndiscussed that comes with a positive inflation rate.  \n \n15 Once the central bank gets stuck at near -zero rates, additional counter -cyclical monetary policy can only be \nprovided through alternative monetary policy measures such as quantitative easing, which aims to directly influence \nlonger -term interest rates and  other asset prices.  \n \n16 For example, declining productivity growth and slowing labor force growth.  \n \n17 As of December 2017, the SEP median longer -run federal funds rate was 2.75 percent and the central tendency \nwas 2.75 to 3.00 percent.  Looking at the indi vidual observations from the SEP “ dot plot ” shows that the majority of \nthe central tendency expects a rate of 2.75 percent.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.

Others have proposed using price -level targeting or some variant of it, which is a way of \npromising future inflation when the economy is weak, thus (in theory) adding stimulus by lowering real interest \nrates. This policy also has the advantage of ma king the price level  – the cost of living  – more predictable. And some \nhave suggested following a nominal GDP  target . The virtue of this framework is that it is flexible with respect to the \nmix of overall nominal growth that comes from real growth versus inflation. When real growth is slow, inflation is \nallowed to rise higher, similar to the flexible target range approach I have outlined.",

Springfield’s  winning proposal  focuse s on providing better \nworkforce development opportunities for low er-income individuals to obtain meaningful \nemployment.  Achieving the goals that Springfield has set for itself is , of course , much easier in a \nrobust economy, and the economic outlook I will share today is  consistent with an economy that \nwill require even more workers in the labor force .   \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n3 \n Before I begin my remarks , let me note as I always do that the views I express are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).    \nOver the past year, the unemploy ment rate has fallen and is now below even the lowest \nestimates made by Fed eral Reserve policymakers ( FOMC participants ) for the level that  is likely \nto be sustainable in the long er run.  As  labor markets  have tightened , we have seen a gradual \nincrease in  wages and salaries .  While inf lation2 is still a bit  below the FOMC’s  target, most \nforecasters expect  inflation to rise to, or near, the Fed’s  2 percent target by  the end of 2018.  \nDespite this  good news, the stock and bond markets have be come much more volatile  in \nrecent weeks . This likely reflects , in part , the realization that  financial markets need  to factor in \nthe risk  that wages and prices could grow too quickly , if there were  too much fiscal and \nmonetary stimulus  – particularly with the economy currently at or beyond full employment and \ninflation approaching the Fed’s goal .  I view the underlying insight as a healthy realization  by \nmarket participants  that the risks are two -sided : Unsustainably strong growth that leads to \nexcessive inflation or financial imbalances  is now as much a risk as growth that falls shor t.  And \nthere is a realization that monetary policy makers  need to be vigilant  in calibrating the level of \naccommodation , if continued sustainable growth is to be achieved . \nTo be more specific, a s inflation  approaches  the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target and \nunemployment remain s below what we see as a sustainable rate, it is appropriate for the Fed to \ncontinue to remove monetary accommodation by gradually raising interest rates .  At the \nDecember FOMC  meeting , the median of  Fed policymakers ’ estimates of “ appropriate monetary \npolicy ” called for  75 basis points of additional rate increases over the course of 2018.  My own \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n4 \n view , at that time , was actually that somewhat further removal of accommodation might well be \nneeded  in 2018.  That assessment remained dependent on the tenor of incoming data, of course.  \nAnd s ince th e December FOMC meeting , we have all observed  a mix of news: fiscal \nspending, a large tax cut, and continued strengthening of economies around the world provide \nsupport to U.S. growth.  But, on average, household and business spending data have come in a \nbit weaker than expected, leading many to revise down their forecasts for the current quarter. \nEven so, most forecasters currently expect growth this year to exceed its sustainable pace, which \nimplies further tightening of labor markets and more wage and price pressures over time. Thus, \non balance, developments since December generally reinforce my view of the need for s omewhat \nmore removal of accommodation than was reflected in the December median S ummary of \nEconomic P rojections  (SEP) .  Of course, following through on this expectation is conditional on \nthe economy unfolding about  as expected, and that unexpected events such as a trade war or a \nsubstantial change in the geopolitical situation do not surprise on the downside.  \n \nRecent Developments in the E conomic O utlook  \n Improvements in the economy over the past year have , in large part , been driven by \nstrong consumer spending.  This is not unusual  for the U.S. economy , of course, since consumer \nspending accounts for roughly two- thirds of real GDP.  As Figure 1 highlights, consumption \ngrowth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was quite strong , at 3.8 percent.   \nHowever, as the figure also shows, f orecasts for the first quarter of 2018 are for much \nslower consumption growth.  Th is forecast, from the Blue Chip E conomic Indicators , preceded \nthe relative ly weak retail sales reported for January . If retail sales continue to disappoint, \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n5 \n consumption for the first quarter  of this year  may well be below that projected by forecasters in \nearly February .   \nWhat is the likelihood that we will continue to get weak readings on consumer spending? \nThat is difficult to say, but my view is that the data we have seen so far most likely reflect a \ntemporary pause in this quarter, following unexpectedly strong growth in the fourth quarter  of \n2017 – and as a consequence, we will probably continue to see solid consumption growth over \nthe balance of this year.    \n My optimism in this regard  is driven by  the relatively strong fundamentals that support \nconsumption growth.  Figure 2  shows that household wealth has been rising, and is well above \nthe level from the beginning of 2016.  This gain reflects continued increases  in housing wealth \ndue to rising house prices  in many areas of the country , as well as steady gains in the stock \nmarket.  While there have been some sizable  stock market declines in recent days, Figure 3  \nshows that  current  stock prices remain at roughly the levels they achieved in December  2017.  \n Outside of  stock  market  levels, there has been a notable increase in volatility.  One \nmeasure of stock volatility, the  Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index  \n(VIX), had been unusually low in 2017.  This very low market volatility  can lead  investors to \ntake on more risk, and in a period of still relatively low interest rates, to “reach for yield”  – that \nis, buy riskier assets than one would otherwise, in order to achieve a desired profit or savings \ngoal.  Clearly , as can be seen in Figure 4 , stock market volatility has increased significantly  in \nrecent weeks .  From a financial stability standpoint, I view the increased volatility as a n \nimportant reminder to market participants  that stock prices can be quite sensitive to economic \ndata.3 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n6 \n  Figure 5  illustrates that despite an  increase in  market  volatility , consumers ’ confidence in \nthe strength of the economy  remains high, well above index levels for 2017.  W hile there has \nbeen some weakness in the higher -frequency consumer data, I view high consumer confidence  as \nconsistent with the fundamental underpinnings of consumer spending that I discussed a moment \nago, and suggestive that what we are seeing now will turn out to be a pause by consumers after a \nvery strong fourth quarter.  \n Figure 6  shows that the Blue Chip f orecast ers seem to share my optimism.   For much of \n2017, the forecasters had expected U.S. real GDP for 2018 to result in growth of 2.4 percent.  \nHowever, with the significant reduction in taxes and the increases in government spending, as \nwell as the continued improvement  in the national economies  of trading partners, the  consensus \nforecast  now anticipate s real GDP growth to be 2. 8 percent for the year.  Such a rapid increase is \nlikely to be primarily driven by the fiscal stimulus .  It remains to be seen, however, what signal \nBlue Chip forecasters may take from the more recently released weaker consumption data .  \n \nOutlook for Inflation  \n Some observers of Federal Reserve policy have been concer ned about the low inflation \nreadings for much of 2017.  I have viewed those soft data as likely to be transitory, reflecting \nsharp temporary changes in relative prices  – such as modifications  in wireless service pricing by \nU.S. mobile  carrier s last s pring .  Recent data have given me more confidence in that assessment . \n Figure 7  shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for inflation as measured by the \nConsumer Price Index ( CPI) for 2018.  The Blue Chip survey focuses on the CPI, which tends to \nrun approximatel y 20 to 30 basis  point s higher than the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n7 \n index, the  personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) index.  The f igure shows that in the first \nquarter of 2017, forecasters expected that 2018 CPI would be running at 2.3 percent, consistent \nwith the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target using the PCE measure of inflation.  However, in the \nspring  of 2017, with some  large relative price changes, forecasters  began to  lower their \nexpectation s for 2018 inflation – reaching estimates as low as 1.9 percent  by late summer .  More \nrecently , their forecasts for 2018 CPI inflation are back where they were in early 2017.  \n Figure 8  illustrates how the data have changed more recently , by averaging the PCE \ninflation data over one year, over six months , and over three months.  The year-over-year change \nin the PCE index remains somewhat  below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent  target , as some of the \nsoft data from last s pring have lowered this 12- month change .  However , more recent readings \nthat exclude those s pring observations (that is, the six month data and the three month changes) \nshow a rate of inflation above our 2 percent target.   \nOne final factor that may have temporarily elevated the index is oil prices.  Figure 9  \nprovides a similar chart for the inflation measure that excludes the volatile food and energy \nprices , the so- called core  PCE inflation rate.   More recent readings for core inflation suggest that \nwe have been right at our 2 percent target for the past three and six months. \n \nLabor Market D evelopments  \n Another factor  that gives me some confidence that  the Fed will continue to hit the  \ninflation target is the strength of the labor market.  Figure 10  shows that the number of \nindividuals filing initial claims for unemployment insurance is  at low levels not seen since the \nlate 1960s  and early 1970s , when the labor force was considerably sm aller than it is today .  This \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n8 \n likely reflects a number of positive factors, including: strong demand for workers that derives \nfrom a strong pace of sales for goods and services; employer s’ reluctance to lose employees , \ngiven the difficulty they would face in hiring  replacement workers; and  the fact  that potential \nemployees who lose or switch jobs are able to find new employment  without suffering a spell of \nunemployment.  \n Another way to assess labor market tightness is to look at labor flows  – in other words, \nhow workers move between being employed, unemployed (not working , but looking for work), \nand out of the labor force (neither  employed , nor looking for work).4  Figure 11  shows the flow \nfrom being employed to unemployed.  Official data for gross worker flows begin in the early \n1990s, and consistent with the data on initial claims, the employment- to-unemployment flow is \nnear a recent low.    \nFigure 12  shows the flow from being out of the labor force to being unemployed.  Thi s is \nnear the early 2001 series low , reflecting that when workers decide to enter or reenter the \nworkforce, they find employment opportunities quickly.  \n Figure 13  shows the flow from being out of the workforce into employment.  This series  \nis at a recent high, reflecting that in a tight labor  market more potential workers are being drawn \ninto the workforce .  While this is a particularly good sign for hard- to-employ workers, it also \nhighlights a potential future problem : the supply of  workers outside of the labor force and willing \nto reenter the labor market will be come a constraint over time.5   \n As we experience the welcome development of more workers enter ing employment from \noutside of the work force, there will be a n increasing need for training and other aspects of \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n9 \n workforce development.  As I mentioned at the outset of the talk, that is one of the areas that the  \nSpringfield team has chosen to focus on for their Working C ities Challenge  initiative .6  \nOf course, with labor markets tight, some employers will attempt to attract new \nemployees by offering higher wages and benefits, raising the average compensation paid to many \nemployees over time.  Figure 14  shows the employment cost index measure of wages and \nsalaries for private industry workers, excluding incentive -paid occupations .  This wage measure, \nalong with a number of others , has been gradually trending up ward  over the past several years .  \nAs the labor market continues to tighten  – which would be consistent wit h the  2.8 percent Blue \nChip forecast  for 2018 real GDP growth – one would expect to see continued upward pressure on \nwages and salaries.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, I would say that t he economic data have been quite good, \nmonetary policy remains accommodative , and fiscal policy has just become quite a bit more  \nstimulative.  While a  tight labor market provide s definite advantages  – such as  employment \nopportunities for workers  who have struggled to find a job – nonetheless, providing too much  \nstimulus from either  monetary or fiscal policy  at this stage of the economic cycle could threaten \nto create a so -called “ boom and bust ” economy , which policymakers  certainly want to avoid.   \nTo keep the economy on a sustainable path, I expect that it will be appropriate to remove \nmonetary policy accommodation at a regular but gradual  pace – and perhaps a  bit faster than the \nthree, one -quarter point increases envisioned for this year in the assessment of appropriate policy \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 9, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n10 \n from  the De cember  2017  FOMC meeting . This expectation assum es, of course, the data continue \nto come in more -or-less consistent with my  outlook.  \nThank you.   \n  \n \n \n                                                           \n1 The Working Cities Challenge is  an initiative of the  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , designed to lead smaller \ncities through a rigorous process that builds cross -sector collaboration to solve issues impacting the lives of these \ncities’ lower -income residents. Grounded in Boston Fed research, the Challenge encourages leaders from the publi c, \nprivate, and nonprofit sectors to advance proposals that tackle complex challenges facing smaller post -industrial \ncities and achieve large scale impact across communities. Included in the initiative  is a grant competition designed \nto accelerate promisin g work already underway.  For more information, see:  \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities .  \n \n2 The Federal Reserve measure s inflation  by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption \nexpenditures, or PCE.  \n \n3 In some ways, increased volatility may help to enhance financial stability if it moves market participant s to more \nappropriately assess the risks in their investment s. \n \n4 The stock of unemployed workers, as well as the net job creation in any month, are the net result of a huge number \nof such flows among employment, unemployment, and those not in the labor force.  \n \n5 Because many of those not in the labor force are pursuing education, retired, disabled, or attending to family care, \nthere is a limit to the number of workers not currently in the labor force who can plausibly meet the demand for new \nworkers. At some poin t, the available supply of workers will become a constraint on our ability to grow, although I \ndo not believe that we are there just yet.  \n \n6 For more information on the Springfield Working Cities Challenge effort, see:  \nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round2/cities/springfield .

I would like to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak \nat this , the tenth conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy .  I would \nlike to commend all of today’s presenters for their research contributions, and I am looking \nforward to Saturday’s sessions .   \nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors or the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).   \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n3 \n I particularly appreciate  the chance to focus today on monetary policy and financial \nstability.  Much of my own research has focused on the ways that problems in the financial \nsystem can ripple through to the real economy.  Certainly the last financial crisis  – and the \nensuing Great Recession and very slow recovery  – underlined the role that  financial instability  \ncan play in disrupting the economy and in slowing its recovery.  These episodes  also helped \npolicymakers sharpen their thinking about the need for policy tools  that can be deployed to \nattempt to prevent  financial instability,  as well as  minimize  the effects of instability when it doe s \nemerge .  \nFinancial stability policy  is generally associated with regulatory and supervisory \nmeasures , so the exercise  of financial stability  policy is often seen as being independent from the \nstance of monetary and fiscal policy.  However , I am going to suggest that policymakers  should \nview  financial stability tools more holistically .  Indeed, I would like to  suggest  that the ability to \nappropriate ly set financial stability tools  is integrally related to the ability to fully utilize fiscal , \nmonetary , and financial stability  policy tools  to respond to a large adverse financial shock . \n Figure 1  provides a chart that shows how often from 1987 to 2008  the FOMC \nparticipants used words associated with financial stability concerns .  The analysis  of FOMC \nmeeting transcripts  is taken  from a paper I wrote with Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \neconomists  Geoff Tootell and Joe Peek .1  While there are mentions of financial instability terms \nduring the time s when markets are doing unusually well, the largest  spikes in the series are \nassociated with the occur rences of adverse  financial shocks  – particularly when they are \naccompanied by an economic downturn.   \nTools intended to enhance the resilience of the financial system, such as increased capital \nand liquidity requirements, are important  – and in my view , should be emphasized more  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n4 \n throughout an economic cycle .  But  the analysis we did suggests that the focus  on financial \nstability  concerns is most intense when the adverse consequences are apparent.    \nCrisis prevention is an important matter for further discussion, and one on which I \nbelieve we  have made progress through implementing key aspects of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act  – but prevention is  not really the  focus  of my remarks this \nevening .  Tonight , I would like to focus  on the tools that are available  to policymakers  once a \nsignificant adverse financial shock occurs  (that is, crisis response ).  \n If an adverse financial shock occurs, fiscal, monetary, and financial tools can all play a \nrole in offsetting the economic fallout that often results  – even though maintaining financial \nstability is not the primary goal of monetary or fiscal policy .  But if monetary and fiscal policy  \nhave limited capacity to respond to such shocks  – because public debt is already high, or because \ninterest rates are alread y low, for example  – then this should figure into policymakers’ thinking \nabout how and when to use financial stabili ty tool s.   \nTo be a bit more specific, I have in mind using a broad set of tools to respond to any large \nadverse financial shock that could have a broad impact on the economy .  On the fiscal side, \nwhich of course the Fed does not control, that would likely include cutting taxes  and increas ing \ngovernment spending .  Monetary policy tools would include conventional  tactics  (reducing \ninterest rates ) and less conventional  ones (like expanding the central bank ’s balance sheet  \nthrough asset purchases ).  Finally, I would note how important it is that financial stability tools  \nprovide sufficient buffers.    \nThe use of financial stability tools is generally seen as being co nditioned on and \ncalibrated to the severity of likely  economic stress es – but I would argue that it is also critically \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n5 \n important to take into account the extent to which monetary and fiscal policy are equipped to \nrespond to an adv erse financial shock, so that policymakers  can best coordinate the response to a \ncrisis across all available tools.   Much of what I have in mind has to do with assessing each \npolicy tool’s capacity to respond . \n For example, suppose that a country’s government -debt-to-GDP ratio is high , limit ing the \nability or willingness to use fiscal tools  to offset financial and other shocks.  If that country has  \nalso not develop ed sufficient  financial stability response tools, then most  of the  countercyclical \npolicy  response  will likely fall to monetary policy.  Alternatively, if the government -debt-to-\nGDP  ratio is extremely high and interest rates are already at or near the effective lower bound , \nand the country is unable or unwilling to use less-conventional monetary tools  like quantitative \neasing , then financial stability tools are likely to be more important .  In sum , it is important to \nconsider whether there is sufficient capacity  in the toolkit for policymaker s to adequately (let \nalone optimally ) respond to severe financial shocks.  \n Turning to current conditions in t he U nited States , our economy is now experienci ng a \nvery low  unemployment rate  – in fact, a rate below the level many would associate with  full \nemployment .  In part due to relatively tight labor markets, we are beginning to see modest \nincreases in  wage  and price  inflation , and  a more rapid increase in  asset prices .  Most economists \nexpect continued solid growth and strong labor markets, so this may be the tim e to focus on \nwhether we have adequate buffers among the available  policy tools  – to be prepared, should \nanything disrupt the r ecent trajectory .   \nUnfortunately, I would argue that rather than building sufficient capacity  for possible \ndownturns  – which, by  the way, I am not expecting or predicting  – the U.S. has actually  seen a \nreduction in the capacity of these so-called “ buffers ” across the policy tools .  If fiscal and \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n6 \n monetary policy tools are likely to be limited in the event  of a large advers e shock, I would \nsuggest that policymakers  need to think about  and act on  creating greater capacity and flexibility \nwithin the tools currently available  – including those most directly related to financial stability . \n  \nMonetary Policy Response to Large Advers e Financial Shocks  \n Figure 2  shows the federal funds rate, cover ing the same period – 1987 to 2008 – as the \nearlier chart depicting  mentions of financial instability terms by FOMC  participants , and \nindicating the same episodes of financial disruption .2  One can see that w hen a significant \nfinancial stability shock occurs , the Fe d usually lowers the fund s rate out of concern that the \nshock might precipitate slow growth or a recession .  During the 2008 financial crisis, the federal \nfunds rate was  reduced  to zero and the  central bank’s  balance sheet was expanded.   In prior \nepisodes, the funds rate was high enough that the Fed had plenty of room to reduce it  – that is, \nplenty of cushion.  When  the monetary policy cushion is substantial, the need for very large \nfiscal or financial stability buffers may be co rrespondingly  reduced .   \n Simple math suggests that the ability of conventional monetary policy to respon d to a \ncrisis is currently somewhat constrained , given low prevailing rates.  Figure 3  shows FOMC \nparticipants ’ forecasts  of the federal funds rate likely to prevail in the long er run from the \nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) .  As real interest rates have been depressed by slow \nproductivity and by demographic changes, FOMC participant s’ estimates of the federal funds \nrate in the long er run have declined ; the median is currently 2. 9 percent.  \n Such a low “neutral” or long -run federal funds rate  suggests a monetary policy cushion \n(again, the leeway to lower the funds rate) that is small by  historical standards.  As is shown in \nFigure 4 , in most recessions the Fed lowers the nominal federal funds rate by much more than 3 \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n7 \n percent age points .  So in an economy like ours with low equilibrium interest rates, there is a \nstrong likelihood that in a hypothetical future recession , policymakers will run out of room to \nlower the federal funds rate, and we will hit the effective lower bound .   \nWhile my own view is  that unconventional policy can be a very important tool to provide \nstimulus  once the effective lower bound  is reached , it is fair to acknowledge that policymakers \nknow far less about the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy than th ey do about \nconventional, short -term interest rate policy.  Perhaps even more constrai ning is the political \nunpopularity in many countries of  central bank balance sheet actions .  All this means that such \npolicies could be avoided by policymakers , or even constrained by lawmakers,  in the  future .3 \n As I suggested earlier, i f the monetary policy cushion available to offset  financial shocks \nis smaller, policymakers should consider how the  full array of policy tools might be used to \naddress such shocks.  Sticking with monetary policy for a moment, one approach could be to \nchange the monetary policy operating procedures to make it less likely that the effective lower \nbound is hit in the futu re, perhaps by using an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target , \nas I have discussed in a recent talk .4  If this  monetary policy approach  is not feasible, \npolicymakers may wish to consider whether Countercyclical Capital Buffers  should be incre ased, \nor other financial stability tools employed , to provide greater buffers to adverse shocks.  \n  \nFiscal Policy Response to Large Adverse Financial Shocks  \n Figure 5  shows the U.S. federal government surplus or deficit , measured as a percentage \nof GDP .  Fiscal policy has tended not to respond to financial stability shocks unless they are \naccompanied by a recession.  Fiscal policy response s include  “automatic stabiliz ers,” such as \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n8 \n unemployment benefits, which  rise automatically as newly -unemployed workers file for benefits \nduring significant economic downturns.   While fiscal policy tools normally are not deployed for \nfinancial stability shocks, we can surmise that , were an accompanying recession  to be  large \nenough, a possible  inability or unwillingness of fiscal policy makers  to offset financial stability \nshocks  with expansionary policy  could  exacerbate  the problem.  \n Furthermore, we should recognize that  fiscal limitations can impact the choices that \npolicymakers have to utilize potential financial stability tools.  In response to the financial crisis, \nthe U.S. was much more willing than Europe or Japan to provide direct capital infusions into the \nfinancial system, which arguably limit ed the severity of credit crunches and promoted a quicker \nrecovery in the financial sector in the U.S., relative to Europe.   \n There was sufficient fiscal capacity during the financial crisis to expand the deficit and \nengage in fiscal actions that promoted  a faster recovery, but naturally such actions require a \nfiscal buffer that makes it possible to finance the effort .  Figure 6  shows the general government \ngross debt as a percentage of GDP for the U.S. and several European countries.  The U.S. fiscal \nresponse to the financial crisis placed the government -debt-to-GDP ratio much closer to that of \nEuropean countries .  What’s more , the Congressional Budget Office’s current projections , done \nbefore  the recent tax changes  and increases in the federal budget,  indicate that were a financial \ncrisis to occur in the near-term, the U.S.  would potentially have less fiscal capacity to respond as \naggressively as it did  during the last financial crisis.  \nThe U .S. fiscal situation is noteworthy because of the experience of some European \ncountries during the last recession.  In particular, those European countries with  severe banking \nproblems were most ly southern European countries,  and they experienced  serious fiscal \nproblems in addition to  serious banking problems.   Those  countries in Europe with less severe \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n9 \n banking problems  but substantial fiscal capacity did not want to use their fiscal capacity to \nresolve banking problems in other European countries .  As a result, the banking problems could \nnot be easily resolved with capital infusions from governments, resulting in banking problems \ndragging out and many European banks tightening credit availability in the middle of an \neconomic downturn , in order to improve their capital -to-asset s ratios.  Thus the fiscal capacity \nproblems caused difficulties in resolving financial stability problems, making both worse.  \n In sum, r unning large fiscal deficits can potentially have ramifications for the ability to \nrespon d to possible future financial stability shocks.   If fiscal policy responses to financial \nstability crises are likely to be more constrained  in the presence of larger government -debt-to-\nGDP ratios , it seems prudent  to consider bolstering the tools available to monetary policy and \nfinancial stability policy . \n  \nFinancial Stability Response to Large Adverse  Financial Shocks  \n In many countries, a variety of financial stability tools are available,5 but this is not the \ncase in the United States.  The two primary financial stability tools available to the Federal \nReserve  to respond to financial shocks are, first,  altering the s cenarios used in  the bank stress \ntests that are applied to the largest banks , and second, the setting of the Countercyclical Capital \nBuffer.    \nThe stress test  is primarily a micro prudential  tool, designed to ensure sufficient capital for \nbanks  in the event of a large financial shock , and is dependent on the risk characteristics of the \nindividual institution .6  By “stressing ” particular assets, the test  alters the cost of capital for that \nasset class, with the overall impact on any financial institution depending on its exposure to the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n10 \n asset class and its sensitivity to changes in cost of capital.  Thus, the stress  test does not alter  the \namount of post -stress  capital relative to the bank’s reported capital for all firms in the same way.  \nFirms’ post-stress capital may decrease (or increase) relative to reported  capital by varying \nmagnitudes , depending on the mix of assets and hence the mix of risks.   \n The Countercyclical Capital Buffer , on the other hand,  is intended to be a \nmacroprudential tool.   The buffer  increases  capital for all financial firms it applies to during \nperiods of financial excess , but is intended to release capital during stressful periods .7  Because it \nis not related to particular stress scenarios, it does not alter the cost of capital for specific assets \nand does not impact institutions differentially depending on exposure to specific assets.8  \nMoreover , it is intended to be lowered during stressful times in order to release capital for \nstronger banks , so that binding capital constraints are not addressed by reducing credit \navailability  to firms and households . \n Figure 7  provides the peak unemployment rate included in the severely adverse scenario \nsince the stress tests began in the U.S. in 2009, the current level of the unemployment rate at the \ntime of the development of each scenario, and the difference between th e two.   The stress test \nhas quite high unemployment rates  in its scenarios , even during periods whe n the actual \nunemployment rate is already high.  As the actual unemployment rate has fallen, the change from \nthe current rate to the scenario peak has increased.  As a result,  the stress test as currently utilized  \nmay not effectively release capital in a crisis.   It is certainly possible that the stress tests could \nencourage  banks to reduce credit availability to shrink assets to satisfy binding capital \nconstraints .  As always , we have to examine the possibility of unintended consequences and \nassess whether it may work at cross purposes to other tools designed to speed the recovery from \na negative financial shock .  While t his reflects its focus on ensuring the solven cy of individual  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n11 \n institutions relative to particular stress scenarios , it highlights why other tools may be better \ndesigned to release capital to avoid reductions in credit availability.  \n In contrast, a  financial stability tool that is designed to be countercyclical is the aptly \nnamed Countercyclical Capital Buffer.  Once an adverse  financial stability shock occurs, the \nbuffer would be  reduced, releasing bank capital so the institution  does not need to s hrink its \nlending  – and thus reduce credit availability  to firms and consumers  – by shrinking assets to \nsatisfy a binding  capital constraint.   \n Of course, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer has to be raised in times  of financial excess  \nif it is to  build capital that can  be used when adverse shocks do occur.  Figure 8  shows that many \ncountries have indeed raised their Countercyclical Capital Buffer.  In the U.S., the \nCountercyclical Capital Buffer remains  at zero.9 \n Even if one were to ignor e the opportunity to strengthen financial stability tools, in my \nview an argument can be made  for increasing  the Countercyclical Capital Buffer.  Figure 9  \nshows that commercial real estate valuations are quite stretched , as indicated by capitalization \nrates reach ing series lows, particularly for apartment buildings  (recall that the “cap” rate is the \nratio of net operating income to the price paid  for the property  at the time of a transaction  – a \nshorthand for the income yield that the property is expected to provide ).  While low cap rates are \nto be expected in a low -interest rate environment,  Figure 10  shows that the ratio has been \nimportantly driven by price increases, particularly for apartment buildings.  \nTurning to equities, Figure 11  shows that by histori cal standards current S&P 500 \ncomposite price -to-earnings  ratios are at the high end of what we have observed  since 1968 .  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n12 \n This is even clearer if we use the Shiller cyclically -adjusted  price -to-earnings  ratio shown in \nFigure 12 . \n With asset valuations high, a non -zero Countercyclical Capital Buffer can in my view  be \njustified.  However, the case is even stronger  in the U.S. if one considers that should a shock \noccur, monetary policy and fiscal policy may not be e xpected  to respond as forcefully as t hey did \n– appropriately so, I would add  – in the last financial crisis  and its aftermath .   \n     \nConclu ding Observat ions \n In summary and conclusion, I would argue that n ow is the time to  assess and strengthen  \nthe various policy tools available to respond to adverse financial shocks  – and y et, the tools have \nactually  been diminishi ng.  The Federal Reserve’s  monetary policy buffer has essentially been \ndepleted as the nominal equilibrium interest rate in the United States has fallen.  This makes it \nmore likely that the effective lower bound will be hit in the U .S. if we experience  an adverse  \nfinancial stability shock  (or any other adverse shock) at some point in the future .  Since monetary \npolicy can do little  to prevent the demographic or productivity changes  that lead to lower \nprevailing rates , I believe that  policymakers should consider adjust ing the monetary policy \nframework , to address the possibility  that the capacity of conventional policy tools may be too \nquickly deplet ed.10 \n Fiscal policy buffers are being bolstered  in some European countries as the ir econom ies \nimprov e.  However, we must acknowledge that the same can not be said for the United States.  \nThe government -debt-to-GDP ratio is high by historical standards in many countries , but we see \nthat it is rising  in the U .S.  My view is that U.S. fiscal policy we have seen since the crisis  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Friday, March 23, 2018  OR UPON  DELIVERY  \n \n13 \n emerged in 2008 will simply  give future policymakers less flexibility to respond to a \nhypothetical large fina ncial stability shock  with fiscal policy tools . \n Some countries have been using macroprudential tools to increase their policy buffers.  \nWhile capital ratios in the U .S. are much improved, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer , which \nwas designed to be releas ed in response to a large adverse financial shock , is currently set at \nzero.  \n Many countries are not well equipped  to address a n adverse financial stability shock.  In \nthe United States, one can see that monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential buffers are modest , and \nin many cases are being drawn down  further .  In my view, n ow should be the time that \npolicymakers  carefully consider this state of affairs, and assess which tools could  provide more \npotent buffer s to draw upon  should  a large adverse financial shock occur.   While that is, again, \nnot my expectation or prediction, my view is that it is an opportune time  to prepare for such a \npossibility.   \nThank you.  \n \n \n1 Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell.

Rosengren  \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston  \n \nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce  \nEconomic Outlook Breakfast 2018  \n \nBoston, Massachusetts   \nApril 13 , 2018  \n \n \n Good morning. It’s a pleasure to be back with the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce \nto share my  economic outlook .   \nBefore  I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my \nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC  or Committee ).   \nLast Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics released  the monthly employment report .   \nWhile only 103 ,000 new jobs were created in March, the first quarter as a whole held quite \nstrong  job growth.  O ver the first three months of 2018, the U .S. economy added an average of \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n3 \n 202,000 jobs  per month  – which , over the long er run, is roughly  twice as many as would be \nrequired  to keep the unemployment rate  stable  at current levels  of employment , given the growth \nin the labor force .   \nThis strong first -quarter job growth occurr ed even though the l abor market  is already \ntight, as indicated by an unemployment rate at  4.1 percent , a rate that most economists consider \nto be below the sustainable rate of unemployment .  Consistent w ith tight labor markets , wages \nhave been  rising , albeit gradually  – average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the past year , \nabout three -quarters of a percentage point faster growth than in 2013 and 2014 .   \nThe tight national labor market is also reflected in New England .  When I talk to \nemployers ar ound the Federal Reserve’s First D istrict , which includes the six New England \nstates,  I increasingly hear of the difficulty in attracting employees – and more and more business \nleaders mention  the additional tactics  their organizations  must  use to attract the talent necessary \nto move their  businesses forward.  \n The relative  strength of the first-quarter  employment growth  is consistent with the strong \neconomic forecast provided by monetary policymakers after the Federal Reserve’s FOMC  \nmeeting  in March.  The median forecast of Fed policymakers  was for the economy to grow \nsomewhat  faster in 2018 than earlier in the recovery – specifically,  2.7 percent  in 2018  (versus \n2.2 percent on average since the recovery began in the second quarter of 2009) .1   \nWith t his growth projected to be fairly strong , the unemployment rate  is expected to fall \nbelow 4 percent , with inflation rising close to  the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target by the end \nof 2018 .  These forecasts, it should be noted,  also incorporate the assumption  of two additional \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n4 \n 25-basis -point rate increases in the short -term interest rate during the balance of  2018, beyond \nthe one that occurred at the FOMC’s  March meeting.    \nMy own view s are that labor markets may tighten more  than the median SEP forecast  \nsuggests , and that inflation is likely to increase a bit more than the current median forecast by  \nFOMC  participant s.  Therefore,  I expect somewhat more tightening may end up being needed \nthan is currently reflected in the  projected  median  for the  federal funds  rate. \n Of cours e, I am talking here about  forecast s, not outcome s.  Economic forecasts  often \nprove imperfect , with actual results varying from the forecast in part because economists need to \nmake assumptions about variables that are quite hard to predict.  Simply put, m any important \neconomic decisions are not straightforward .  For example, what will happen with tariffs  around \nthe world  over the course of this  year?  Will the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \nCountries  (OPEC ) significantly alter its pr oduction of oil ?  And how will foreign e conomies ’ \nmonetary policy change?  Many of these question s require the forecasting of political outcomes \nrather than underlying economic relationships  – and this is not an area of comparative advantage  \nfor economists . \n Given this reality , I will spend more time this morning  discussing the risks  around \nforecast s than I will the forecast s themselves .  In particular, I will highlight two important  risks \nto the economy in the short  run (trade and overheating) and two potential  risks in the long  run \n(reduced capacity of both fiscal and monetary policy to act against downturns) .   \nLet me be cle ar that  I am identif ying risks , not making a prediction that they will happen .  \nI think it is important to identify  risks worth thinking about and watching for, and underline why \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n5 \n policymakers  need to continuously monitor incoming economic data and make adjustments \nshould the data come in other than expected.  \n \nExploring the Forecasts from the S ummary of Economic Projections (SEP)  \nFigure 1  provides the actual inflation rate for the  core personal consumption \nexpenditures or PCE (the solid line) , and the median PCE inflation  forecast  from FOMC \nparticipants at the March meeting  (the dashed line) .  As is clear from the chart, we have been \nundershooting the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation target .  This undershoot ing has been \nlargely due to the decline in the relative price of imports from 2014 to 2016 , and the decline in \ntelecommunications prices in early 2017.  But that shortfall is forecasted to end soon – and it is \nnotable that Committee members expect an overshoo t of the Fed’s  inflation target in the medium \nterm.  \n Figure 2 shows that the unemployment  rate has been declining relatively quickly  since \nthe first quarter of 2015 , and that Committee members expect the path to level off in the medium \nterm at well below 4 percent.  Notably, t he median expectation  for the longer -run rate of \nunemployment – usually taken to be policymakers’ estimate of the sustainable rate – is 4.5 \npercent  in the March SEP (the horizontal  line).  Clearly , policymakers expect very tight labor \nmarkets in the short and medium term relative to what we expect to prevail in the long er term. \n Figure 3 shows the actual path of the federal funds rate from the first quarter of 2015 to \nthe first quarter of 201 8, and the median of SEP projections of the federal funds rate ’s path \nthrough the fourth quarter of 2020 .  The median forecast is for three  25-basis -point increases in \n2018  (including the increase which followed the March FOMC meeting ) and another three  in \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n6 \n 2019 .  So again , it is worth noting that  the gradual rise of inflation toward – and then above – its \ntarget, and the projection for a falling unemployment rate that dips well  below  its estimated  long-\nrun sustainable level , occur despite the gradual tightening of monetary policy assumed in FOMC \nparticipants ’ forecasts .  Importantly, some of the underlying economic strength in these forecast s \ncomes from the projected effects of substantial fiscal stimulus , generated both by tax cuts and by \nthe higher government spending incorporat ed in the recent federal  budget.  \n In summary , the Committee ’s median outlook is fairly optimistic .  My own forecast calls \nfor an even more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate , given my expectation that \ncyclical  strength in labor force participation will provide only a partial offset to solid gains in \npayrolls.   Despite this positive outlook, I think it is important to consider the risks around this \nforecast.  So now  I will touch on what I see as some short -run risks, and then some longer -run \nrisks.  \n \nShort -run Risks  \n The first risk I want to discuss  today  is one that has been on the front pages of \nnewspapers and has also been reflected in  the increased volatil ity of  financial markets recently : \nthe outlook for international trade.   Figure 4 shows exports of goods and services relative to \nGDP  from the first quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2017 .  While the United States  \nis less dependent on exports for growth than are many of our major trading partners, exports are  \nstill a relatively large component of total goods and services pro duced in the U.S.  economy.  At \nroughly 12 percent of total goods and services, exports play a  much smaller role in the overall \neconomy than consumption, which is roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy .  But exports play  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n7 \n a larger role than , for example , housing , which accounts for  roughly 4 percent of the overall \neconomy.  Of course , here  I am taking a macroeconomic view o f the economy ; I recognize that \nsome industries and firms will feel more acutely any changes in the export and trade \nenvironment.  \nSome context is important.  It would take a significantly broader set of trade actions than  \nthose reported to date to materially reduce the roughly $2.4 trillion in annual U.S. exports .  Still, \nspillover  effects are possible,  beyond just the industries wh ere exports could be  affected by \npossible trade barriers.  There could  also be indirect economic effects from trade disputes  with \nimportant , but difficult to measure , impact s.  For example, concerns about possible supply \ndisruptions might  cause firms to source supplies from other countries  – and the  new capacity in \nthese other countries  could  potentially  mean less U.S.  investment and employment.    \n A second possible impact is on prices.  As Figure 5 shows, prices of imported goods  \ngrew at a slower pace than overall inflation, thus  holding down overall inflation over the last \nseveral years.  Indeed, imported goods prices fell until about the beginning of 2017, in part \nbecause of a strong dollar , although that trend appears  to be changing more recently .  Of course \nthe imposition of  tariffs also pushes up prices that consumers  pay for goods impa cted by the \ntariff.  In addition, actions to avoid possible tariffs can cause precautionary stockpiling , which \ncan disrupt the flow of order s and cause production bottlenecks.  Concerns about these possible \ndisruptions likely explain some of the  heightened  volatility in stock price s of late .  \n Beyond trade issues, t here is a second short -run risk  to the outlook, and it  moves in the \nopposite direction.  While I expect the unemployment rate to drop to 3.7 percent by the end of \nthis year, it is possible that unemployment will fall even more rapidly in the short -term.  An \nundesirable  “boom -bust” scenario may be come  more likely if unemployment move s far below \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n8 \n where we expect labor markets to settle in the long -run.  Figure  6 shows the difference between \nthe actu al unemployment rate and the C ongressional Budget Office’s (CBO)  estimate of the \nnatural rate of unemployment  from 1970 to the first quarter of 2018, with recessions shaded .  \nToday, u nemployment  is already below the CBO estimate of the natural rate .  As the graph \nshows, periods in which unemployment dipped significantly and persistently below the estimated \nnatural rate historically have tended to generate conditions that resulted in a recession.  \n While labor markets provide important indicator s of potenti al unsustainab ility, it is \nimportant to be alert to  financial  stability issues as well. As Figure 7 shows, the spreads between \ncorporate bonds and 10-Year U.S. Treasuries have fallen to relatively low levels, and several \nacademic studies have highlighted that the investor confidence that generates low credit spreads \noften precedes  subsequent economic reversals .2 \n Let me reiterate that  I am not forecasting signifi cant trade disruptions or substantial \nboom -bust problems .  But the risk that they could develop means  we must be v ery c arefully  \nmonitor ing incoming data  to see if they  indicate an increased probability that these risk scenarios \ncould occur .  \n \nLong -run Risks  \n There are also longer -run risks that should be considered at this juncture in the economy .  \nWith monetary policy still relatively accommodative , and fiscal policy quite accommodative, it \nseem s unlikely that the economy would perform poorly in the near term.  However , it is \nimportant to consider whether some of that accommodation may potentially  generate risks  that \nplay out over the longer term . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n9 \n  One of the risks is illustrated by the CBO projection  of public debt levels  that was \nrecently released .  Gross federal debt as a percentage of GDP, shown in Figure 8, has been rising \nover the past decade.  The dotted line shows the current projection through 202 8.  This debt-to-\nGDP ratio will rise to levels not seen since just after World War II .  My conce rn is this: b y using \nup so much fiscal capacity now  – by which I mean the ability to lower tax rates or boost federal \nspending to offset economic weakness – the country  risks not having sufficient fiscal capacity in \nthe future when it might be needed.  And this lack of fiscal  capacity would be particularly \ntroubling if monetary  policy could not aggressively offset adverse shocks.3 \n Figure 9 shows that there is also some reason to be concerned  about  how aggressively \nmonetary policy can respond to a large adverse shock.  At the onset of m ost previous economic \nrecession s, short -term interest rates were quite high.  This provided plenty of room to reduce \ninterest rates as the economy went into recession.  The one time  that short -term interest rates \nreached zero  in recent history  was in the aftermath of  the Great Recession.  Once the FOMC cut \nthe short -term policy rate to its effective lower bound, reaching the limit of stimulus from that \ntool, the Federal Reserve employed its balance sheet to purchase longer -term assets, thus \nlowering longer -term interest rates and providing further monetary accommodation and stimulus.  \nThese actions, which I fully supported, were nonetheless politically controversial  and the subject \nof some debate among economists .4 \n So how much  room do we expect to have to lower interest rates in response to future \nrecessions?   The Federal Reserve’s SEP includes a forecast of where short -term interest rates \nwill settle  in the long  run.  The most recent median forecast for the long er-run federal funds rate \nis 2.9 percent , which is quite low by historical standards .  The underlying reason for this is that \nmost Committee members expect real interest rates to be quite low, due to a demographically \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n10 \n driven slowing in labor force growth cou pled with slow growth in productivity.  Combined with \na 2 percent inflation goal, this implies low long -run, short -term policy rates, implying that on \naverage we could lower rates by less than 3 percentage points in response to a recession.  Since \nin many recessions we lower rates by as much as 5 percentage points, it is quite likely that \ninterest rates would reach zero again in a downturn.     \nCertainly expanding the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet , and perhaps using other less -\nconventional monetary policy interventions , can help support the economy , should it be needed.5   \nHowever,  several questions and concerns exist.  H ow effective will these unconventional tools \nbe in offset ting adverse shocks ?  Is there significant opposition among the public and  Congress  \nto the Fed using nontraditional tools ?  How limited will fiscal policy  be in  buffer ing a n adverse \nshock or downturn?  These questions, while a bit sobering, highlight the need to increase  the \npotential of  policy buffers to respon d to possible future problems.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n The outlook for the economy projected by participants in  the Ma rch FOMC meeting is \nquite positive.   My own forecast is somewhat stronger in terms of unemployment rates  and \ninflation outcomes than the SEP forecast, which is why I am in favor of somewhat more \ntightening than the median FOMC member.   However, a forecast  of the most likely outcome  is \nnot a promise, and there are important potential  risks to that forecast.  Disruptive international \ntrade actions  or increasing the risk of a boom -bust economy by overextending could , in my view,  \nprove problematic  for the economy .  And the status of fiscal and monetary “buffers” call into \nquestion their ability to work against a shock or downturn.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern  Time on Friday, April 13, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n11 \n  I am hopeful that the risks  I have discussed  can be avoided .  Assuming the se near term \nrisks are avoided , my own forecast is somewhat stronger than the SEP  forecast .  Of course , I \nwould support  a somewhat faste r increase in the federal funds  rates if that  stronger growth  does \nindeed occur.   \n In sum, the economic outlook is good, but we must all be attuned to what could go wrong \nin the short term and in the long term , and what that implies for appropriate monetary policy . \nThank you.  \n  \n   \n1 Measured as the percent change in real GDP  from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018.  \n \n2 See for example, López -Salido, David, Jeremy C.

John Olcay Lecture on  \nEthics and Economics at the  \nPeterson Institute for International Economics   \n \nWashington, D.C.   \nJune 27 , 2018  \n \n \nGood afternoon.  I want to thank the Peterson Institute for International Economics for \ninviting me to join you today.  I am truly honored to  be asked to give a talk in memory of John \nOlcay , whom I met through his connection to Harvard  University  professor Benjamin Friedman . \nI would see John on his periodic trips to Boston ; our first meeting occurred in 2007, just as \nfinancial markets were starting to show stress .  John and I shared rising concerns during this \nperiod  and, unfortunately, through what turned into the  global financial crisis and “Great \nRecession. ”   \nIn those days, John was troubled by the condition of financial markets , and also had a \ndeep concern about the  human  implications of serious economic downturn s – a topic I am going \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n2 \n to focus on  today.   Before I do, however, let me note that the views I express are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , or the Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).  \n Given the matters with which John was concerned,  it is very fitting that this lecture series \nis focused  on “Ethics and Economics. ”  I should note that  many academic disciplines  incorporate \nethics  into required coursework (take medicine, philosophy,  or psychology , for example ), but I \nwould argue that ethics  is not an especially prevalent part of the curriculum  of economics.  In \nmost  courses, c ore economic concepts tend to  overwhelm the syllabus and  displace  the study of  \nethical issues.  If there is any discussion of ethics in profit - or utility -maximizing  frameworks, \nmy sense is that it might take place in the last week of an introductory economics class .  Given \nthis underweighting in the profession , I think it is wonderful that the Peterson Institute hosts this \nseries dedicated to ethics and economics.  \nToday , my remarks will focus on some of the ways in which the impact of negative \noutcomes in the economy are distributed  – disproportionately, I’ll argue .  These distributional \neffects have ethical dimensions that should motivate economic policymakers to do more to \nreduce the negative outcomes.   \nGiven the Fed’s dual mandate  – stable prices and maximum sustainable employment  – it \nmakes sense for us to look at  inflation and unemployment as we begin today.  First, inflation:  \nFigure 1  shows that there has been quite a change in the pattern of inflation over the past 50 \nyears , as measured by the change in the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price \nindex .  In the United States, as in many advanced economies, the cyclical inflation pattern has \nbeen significantly muted.  This moderation beginning around 1980 reflect s, by the way,  the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n3 \n important role that independent central banks c ould and did play in d ampening the inflation \ncycles seen in the past.   \nHowever, Figure 2  shows that the economic cycle, as measured by the unemployment  \nrate, has not been muted  and has not steadily moderated like inflation .   \nTo preview my main point s, in my view  the costs of high unemployment are \ndisproportionately born e by those who can least afford them , and a variety of actions could be \ntaken by policymakers to make periods of high unemployment less likely.  This brings us to  the \nethical dimension  of economics .  This is not just about thoughts or feelings – I want to talk today \nabout manifesting those ethical decisions in very tangible policymaking.  While there are many \nexamples of policies that could mitigate periods of high unemployment, today I will address  \nthree specific realms of policy – state and local government spending ; bank regulatory policy ; \nand finally , monetary policy.   \nFirst, however, I will touch on the impact of high unemployment and its distribution  \nacross several dimensions of the population . \n \nThe Distributional Impact of Periods of High Unemployment  \n The United States has  spent the past nine years recovering from a severe recession.  Some \npopulations  in particular  suffered disproportionately , and despite the recovery, historic gaps \npersist .   \nFigure 3  provides the unemployment rate by racial and ethnic background  from 1972 to \n2018 .  The overall U.S unemployment rate hit 10 percent in the most recent  recession  – the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n4 \n second such time since  1972 in which the overall unemployment rate reached 10 percent.1  \nHowever, it is striking that in every  recession over this period, Black or African -American \nunemployment rates have exceeded 10 percent.  Moreover , in the 1982 recession the  Black or  \nAfrican -American unemployment rate exceed ed 20 percent ; and in the most recent recession, the \nBlack or African -American unemployment rate exceeded 15 percent.  Similarly, Hispanic \nunemployment during recessions is much more elevated than that of the overall population, \nalthough not as elevated as for Black or African -Americans.  \n Economic r ecessions also disproportionately impact unemployment for those with less \neducation , as shown in Figure 4 .  The figure shows  the unemployment rate by educational \nattainment (ranging from less than a high school diploma , to a bachelor’s degree or higher) from \n1992 to 2018 .2  While the unemployment rate for those with a college education  reached 5 \npercent  during the most recent recession , the rate exceeded 15 percent for those without  a high \nschool education . \n Furthermore,  while unemployment significantly impacts individuals , it also affects  \nfamilies.  As Figure 5  shows, the share  of U.S. children under age 18 who are below the poverty \nline increased significantly in the two recessions where the unemployment rate exceeded 1 0 \npercent  – with more than 20 percent of children below the poverty level during the Great \nRecession.   Another sobering  observation I take from  this chart is that th e child poverty rate  in \nthe U.S.  has dropped to 15 percent only once in the past nearly 60 years  – hovering just ab ove or \njust below 15 percent from 1969 to 1973 . \n In sum , the sad reality is that  unemployment disproportionately affects  minorities, the \nless educated, and children  whose families are experiencing unemployment .  The costs to both \nthe entire economy and to parts of our population are significant.  In my view,  if policies could \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n5 \n mitigate  the severity of economic slowdowns , some of those costs could be avoided – and taking \nactions now , when the economy is strong , could be particularly important  to lessening the \nseverity of  a hypothetical future downtur n and its impact on individuals . \n \nState and Local Government Spending  \n Fiscal policy is certainly not in the Fed’s portfolio of mandated responsibilities, but it has \na major impact on the economy so we must take it into account.3  Drawing on the historical \nrecord , I want to suggest some opportunities for fiscal policy to address the issues I have just \nhighlighted .  In my view, s tate and local  government  financing should be designed to buffer the \neconomy during recessions, or at a minimum should not reduce the stimulative effects of \nspending when the economy is most troubled.   \nHowever, Figure 6  shows that since 1960 , state and local government spending tend s to \ndecline when the unemployment rate is high, and increase when the unemployment rate is low.  \nThis pattern likely arises from the fall in state and local tax revenues during economic \ndownturns, coupled with a desire to spend within one’s means  – after a ll, most state and local \ngovernments face balanced  budget requirements .  But it tends to aggravate economic downturns  \nor add additional fuel to a n already  humming economy ( scenario s that would be characterized as \n“procyclical” in the parlance of economists ).  And for context, s tate and local government \nspending is significant in the overall economy, account ing for 11 pe rcent of U.S. GDP, compared \nto 4 percent for residential investment  (which also tends to fall in economic downturns)  and 7 \npercent for federal government spending.  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n6 \n  As I have just suggested, state and local governments likely reduce spending in \nrecessions for good reasons .  I would suggest , however,  that a number of steps can be taken by \nofficial s that would lessen the problematic impact .   \nFirst, the cyclicality of revenue sources for state and local governments can be lessened – \nin other words, revenue streams might  be redesigned to move less cyclically  if other competing \ngoals allow .4  For example, state s that are  highly dependent on c apital gains taxes are much more \nlikely to experience funding shortfalls during economic downturns , so if possible, reducing this  \ndependence c ould help.5   \nSecond, steps can be taken so that the fiscal health of a state does not drive substantial \ncuts during downturns.  A number of large states  (such as Illinois or New Jersey ) have seen \ndeterioration in their financial conditions over the past several years , as represented by declines \nin their credit rating s (Figure 7 ).  This is, in part,  the resul t of chronic underfunding of pension \nliabilities  in some states .  Ideally, a time like now – when the national economy is growing and \nemployment is robust  – would be an opportunity, it seems to me,  to prepare for the next \ndownturn.  This would perhaps include shoring up state finances, reducing unfunded pension \nliabilities, and significantly increasing “rainy day ” funds.6  I am not suggesting it would be easy, \neven in these economic times.  But progress could be made.  A similar argument could be made \nfor the federal government , given how beneficial it would be to  have the capacity to be more \nfiscally expansive in a future  recession .7 \nIn sum,  my view is that in the long run, states should consider how  to balance the various \ncompeting goals  of their fiscal approach – for example the goal of having stable rev enue streams \nand of achieving progressivity .  But to return to my main point, state and local governments \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n7 \n should reassess their revenue structure and fiscal approach with an eye on cyclic al downturns \nand the potential to lessen their impact on people, through policy . \n \nBank Regulation  \n While it may seem somewhat counterintuitive, b anking regulation can also amplify  the \nbusiness cycle , and policymakers can look for ways to lessen these effects .  For example, \nlenders’ losses on loans tend to increase significantly during economic downturns, reflecting \nrising unemployment and the difficulty that many households and firms have in meeting debt \nobligations during  hard economic times .  Figure 8 shows that  nonperforming loans at U.S. banks \ntend to rise during periods of high unemployment and fall during periods of low unemployment.8   \nCertain aspects o f bank regulation can actually exacerbate the consequences of this trend.  \nFor example, capital regulations set a threshold on how low a bank ’s capital – that is, its total \nassets (e.g.  loans) less its total liabilities (e.g. deposits) – can fall.  While this is well-intended  – \nand designed  to ensure that banks can m eet all their obligations  – certain aspects of capital \nregulations  can actually cause banks to act in a manner that essentially extend s their problems to \ntheir customers  in a downturn .   \nWhen the ir capital -to-assets ratio gets too low , banks can choose to  either  raise their \ncapital level, or shrink assets , to restore the ratio .  Raising additional capital is especially costly \nduring economic downturns, and is generally opposed by existing shareholders who do not want \ntheir ownership stake d iluted.  \nAs a consequence , banks most often raise the capital -to-asset s ratio by shrinking  assets  – \nand of course, loans are key assets for banks .  Thus raising the capital -to-asset s ratio can mean \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n8 \n less lending at just the time the economy may need stimulus.  And banks may try to reduce  \ndownturn -related  losses  by raising interest rates or tightening lending standards – both of which \ncan hurt otherwise credit -worthy borrowers.  \nIn light of all this , I would suggest that – just as state and local governments need to \nshore up their finances and build their rainy day funds during a boom – it is incumb ent on a bank \nto raise more capital during good economic times  so that it can deplete that fund during a \nrecession , rather than shrink loans when  the economy  most needs them .  An important regulatory \ntool that can be  used to ensure that a bank builds up this so -called  rainy day fund during good \ntimes  is known as the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).9   \n Figure 9  shows two different ways to implement capital re gulations  – one using a static \ncapital requirement and one using a variable capital requirement .  We see a hypothetical scenario \nin which an economic downturn leads to a loss of 300 basis points  (or 3 percen tage points) on \ncapital.  On the left, this  causes the bank to fall below its capital requirement , given that the bank \nwas holding 200 basis points of excess capital .  As just described, banks often react by shrinking \ntheir assets  to try to satisfy their capital requirement, reducing lending when borrowers most \nneed it.   \nOn the right  side of Figure 9 , we see an alternate scenario in which the bank has \naccumulated a CCyB of 250 basis points during the good economic times that preced e the \ndownturn , as required by regulation upon the activation of the CCyB.  If the CCyB is deactivated \nwhen the economic downturn occurs  and losses are realized , the bank has an additional capital \nbuffer of 450 basis points.   As a result of the bank’s loss es stemming from the economic \ndownturn, th e buffer  is consumed and reduced to zero.  But the 300 basis point loss does not \npush the capital ratio below what is required, and thus the incentive to reduc e lending  is lessened .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n9 \n While this type of CCyB is currently being used in many Eur opean countries  and in Hong \nKong , the CCyB  in the United States remains  at zero.10  Given the overall health of the economy \nand the relatively rich asset valuations now  prevailing , it is my view that  this would be the ideal \ntime to build up capital buffers  in the U.S .  Doing so could help address the incentive that  banks \nwill have to pull back on lending to shrink  assets  in a future economic downturn.11 \n \nMonetary Policy  \n Monetary policy is primarily conducted by moving short -term interest rates.  During \ngood times, the interest rate is set to keep the economy at maximum sustainable employment and \nat the inflation target , which is 2 percent in the United States.  However, w hen a recession occurs \nand the unemployment rate rises, policymakers push down interest rates.  This has the effect of \nlower ing payments for households and firms that are borrowing, and ideally  mitigate s the \nsever ity of  the economic cycle.  As Figure 10  illustrates , since the Volcker disinflation episode \nin the late 1970s  and early 1980s, the short -term federal funds  rate has been lowered \nsignificantly , particularly during periods of very high unemployment rates.  \n However, in the last economic cycle  the inflation rate was relatively modest , and real \ninterest rates were low because of slow growth in population and productivity, so the federal \nfunds rate began the downturn  at an already  relatively low level. This meant that when the \nrecession hit, as the funds rate was reduced  in response,  it fairly quickly hit zero . Because short -\nterm interest rates  started off low, the extent to which they could be reduced to offset high \nunemployment rates  was limited .   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n10 \n As Figure 11  shows, estimates of the equilibri um interest rate12 have been declining .  \nAccording to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), currently Fed policymakers \nanticipate that the median federal funds interest rate in the long run is expect ed to be only 2.9 \npercent  in nominal  terms .  Subtracting the Fed’s 2 percent inflation goals, this implies a long-run \nreal interest rate of just 0.9 percent .   \nWhile the central bank  has other tools  to offset economic downturns , such as expanding \nits balance sheet  to lower long -term interest rates , many economists view short -term interest \nrates as a more effective (and certainly a better -tested and understood) countercyclical tool.  The \nFederal Reserve can do little to change the equilibrium real interest rate in the long  run, since it  \nis determine d more by factors such as productivity and demographics .  So it is appropriate to \nconsider other ways  to avoid hitting zero with short -term interest rates.  One possibility is to \nconsider more flexibility with the inflation target, perhaps focus ing more on  an inflation range  \nthan a specific number.13  One might allow the inflation target to rise within the range during \nperiods of low real rates, thus providing more room for the funds rate to fall during an economic \ndownturn.  \nSuch a change in the monetary pol icy framework is something that should be considered, \nalong with a careful assessment of the potential costs and benefits.  However, if the monetary \npolicy framework is not changed, policymakers  should look at other policy tools that can more \neffectively reduce the severity of recessions.  \n Current policy also has a role in preparing  for, or postponing, the next recession.  As \nFigure 12  shows, over the time period since 1960 , whenever the economy  significantly exceed ed \nfull employment , a recession ensue d.  The one counter -example is the 1960s, whe n fiscal policy \nwas quite expansionary because of the deficit -financed Vietnam War, even though the economy  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n11 \n was already running strong with the unemployment rate below the level associated with  full \nemployment.  However, that period was also characterized by rising inflation , which triggered  \nsignificant problems in the following  decade  related to  elevated inflation and inflation \nexpectations.   \nWhether imbalances appear as higher wages and prices, or higher asset prices, correcting \nimbalances in the economy (for example, if  unemployment falls below a sustainable rate)  \nwithout a recession is a challenge for central banks to accomplish.   As a result,  I think the policy \npath that will increase the probability of a longer recession -free period is the path where the \neconomy does not run above capacity and thus , fall far below the  sustainable unemployment rate. \nI put these notions forward as policymakers  continue to seek ways to lessen the severity and \nimpact – particularly the disparate impac t – of cyclical economic downturns.  \n \nConclu ding Observations  \n In summary and conclusion, w hile ethics is not generally a central focus of the discipline \nof economi cs, my view is that the costs of economic downturns – and the uneven distribution  of \ntheir impact  – are, in fact, ethical issue s.  I suspect  our friend John Olcay would concur .  Both in \nthe spirit of ethics and to sharpen policy effectiveness, I believe a  more active discussion should  \nbe occurring among fiscal, supervisory, and monetary policymakers .  All of them , as I have \nsuggested today, could continue and perhaps expand their efforts to make cyclical downturns – \nand resulting periods of high unemployment – less severe.   \nThank you.  \n  \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30  P.M.  Eastern  Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018  OR UPO N DELIVERY  \n12 \n   \n1 1972 is the first date for which this breakdown is available.  \n   \n2 1992 is the first date for which this breakdown is available.  \n \n3 For additional perspective, see remarks by Eric S. Rosengren:  “Monetary, Fiscal, and Financial Stability Policy \nTools: Are We Equipped for th e Next Recession? ” delivered on March 23, 2018, in Washington D.C.    \n \n4 Tax policies have multiple, often competing goals and therefore policymakers fa ce tradeoffs. One important goal is \nto reduce income inequality. While income taxes (especially capital gains taxes) are very cyclical, they are often \nmore progressive (i.e., tax as a share of income is higher for higher -income households) than sales taxes  and other \ntax vehicles.  \n \n5 Capital gains taxes are a large revenue source for many states. Cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes will \nautomatically require a very large increase in sales taxes and other taxes and fees if we talk about a revenue -neutral \nscenario.  \n \n6 Linking cyclical revenue sources (such as capital gains taxes) to rainy day funds could be a good comp romise \namong maintaining high revenue -raising capacity, improving progressivity, and reducing cyclicality.  In my view, \nthe macroeconomic effects have probably been underwei ghted. For additional discussion on the needed siz e of state \nrainy day funds, see 2014 Working Paper by Boston Fed Senior Economist Bo Zhao: “Saving for a Rainy Day: \nEstimating the Appropriate Size of U.S. State Budget Stabilization Funds. ”   \n \n7 It is worth noting that  despite long -run fiscal challenges, lack of support during serious recessions extends the \nrecessio n, and thus extends the period of lost tax revenue, and exacerbates underlying woes in the state. I n my view,  \na short -term investment in a modest increase in indeb tedness may pay back over time.  \n \n8 Furthermore, the combination of nonperforming loans and lower interest rates during recessions have the effect of \nadding pressure to banks’ earnings.  \n \n9 For more info on the CCyB, see: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160908b.htm .  \nIn addition to the CCyB, other bank regulatory tools include the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review \n(CCAR) and the Dodd -Frank Stress Tests  (DFAST). There are countercyclical elements to the stress tests.  More \nstressful scenarios in good times require banks to build more capital.  For more on CCAR and DFAST see \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress -tests-capital -planning.htm .  \n \n10 As Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell noted in his recent press  conference on June 13, 2018, “ …the \ncountercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when \nfinancial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. ”  I am suggesting  a slightly different application  \nmight also be appropriate . (See transcript of the Chairman’s press conference here.)    \n \n11 For additional perspective, see remarks by Eric S. Rosengren:  “Monetary, Fiscal, and Financial Stability Policy \nTools: Are We Equipped for th e Next Recession? ” delivered on March 23, 2018, in Washington D.C.    \n \n12 It is important to note that the equilibrium interest rate isn’t precisely known.  \n \n13 For additional perspective, see remar ks by Eric S.

(somewhat speculative)\n▶Recognizing weaknesses, changing structure is \ninherently difficult\n▶Once a convention is established, hard to change, \nespecially with a large, consensus- driven Committee\n▶A process that institutionalizes a periodic step \nback to devote significant time to evaluate \ncurrent framework and consider alternatives, \nmay lead to more timely improvements in \nframework when necessary\n▶These considerations motivate the need for a \nregular, formal, transparent review that includes \noutside perspectives\n\n12What Would a Review Look Like?\n▶Review should normally be at a fixed frequency\n▶Suggest every four years –second year of Chair’s term\n▶Flexibility to review off -schedule when needed\n▶Agenda for review set by FOMC –changes to \nframework require vote of FOMC\n▶Review would include evaluation of current framework –\nand consideration of alternatives that might improve on \ncurrent framework\n▶Open process –general call for papers\n▶Costs to regularly evaluating framework?\n▶Loss of credibility, uncertainty about inflation goal?\n▶Given that we already change frameworks, could also \nlower the cost by making the process more transparent\n\n13How Would Such a Review Differ \nfrom Current Practice?\n▶Review should normally be at a fixed frequency:\n▶Annual January review\n▶No specific recommendations for alternatives to \nvote on\n▶Agenda for review:\n▶Minimal agenda for the annual discussion, not set \nby FOMC.

It is a pleasure to be speaking with you today at the 60th annual meeting  \nof the National Association for Business Economics.  Let me also welcome you to our wonderful \ncity of Boston.  \n Before I begin my remarks, let me note that the views I express are my own, not \nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal \nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).  \nLast week the FOMC  raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points , a move consistent \nwith the very strong economic performance seen over the l ast two quarters .  With this latest \nmonetary policy action, the federal funds rate  has now been increased  three  time s this year  – and \n\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n2 \n at 2 to 2- 1/4 percent , it is now  above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2 percent for the \nfirst time since the financial crisis and Great Recession.   \nToday, U.S. m onetary conditions  remain mildly accommodative , with short -term market \nrates barely higher than the inflation rate (thus barely positive in real terms).  A nd given tax cuts \nand spending realities, f iscal policy remains quite accommodative.    \nGiven t he accommodative stance of monetary and fiscal policy, it is not surprisin g that \nmost private forecasters, as well as most members of the FOMC, expect the economy to grow \nstrongly for the second half of this year .  Many economist s expect  real growth for the second half \nof this year to be approximately 3 percent.  That is strong enough to further tighten  labor markets \nand further push down  the unemployment rate , currently at 3.9 percent .  Consistent with this \nexpectation , the Blue Chip f orecasters  anticipate  the unemployment rate fall ing to 3.5 percent  by \nthe end of next year . \n This strong U.S. economic growth is occurring despite some clear risks to the global \neconomy , which I’ll touch on today .  The announcement of increased tar iffs by both the U .S. and \nChina last  Monday heighten ed concerns that trade disruptions could be come a significant \nheadwind over time.  In addition, several emerging market economies  are now more stressed – \nparticularly those such as  Turkey, whose corporations ’ U.S. dollar -denomi nated debts have \nbecome costlier as  their currency has depreciated  against the dollar .  And w hile Europe has \nshown some signs of improving, there is still the possibility of more significant disruptions \nemerging from a  potential ly disruptive Brexit , or from  the exposure  of many European banks  to \nsome of the troubled emerging market economies. \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n3 \n  How should U .S. monetary policy makers  respond to the se conditions – a strong U .S. \neconomy , but clear signs of rising risks emanating from  other economies?  I a m carefully \nwatching factors  that could pose risks to the  continued U.S.  economic expansion.  But  my own \nassessment is that the most likely outcome will be a  U.S.  labor market that continues to tighten  \nand the  likely build up of economic imbalances, including , but not limited to , inflationary \npressures.   \nWhile inflation remains well contained to date, pushing the economy too hard risks \ninflation ary concerns  or financial -stability risks .  Either of these outcomes might necessitate a \nmore f orceful  monetary policy response.  While a more forceful policy might be appropriate \nunder such conditions, it is not a risk -free strategy  and could put at risk the  continued expansion. \nThe history of rapid rate increases in the U .S. suggests that such a risk is real, and as a result  my \npreference for a strategy that allows a continued , but gradual , pace of monetary tightening.   \nAssuming the potential  global  risks I mentioned do not materialize and disrupt strong \nU.S. GDP growth , I believe that continuing to raise short -term rates gradually , until monetary \npolicy becomes mildly restrictive , is likely to be appropriate  and beneficial over the long term . \n \nLabor M arkets  \n Conditions in labor markets  are, of course, foundational  to my analysis .  In every  \ndiscussion I have with business people  in New England, a  theme that continually comes up is the \ntightness of the labor market.  Turning to the data, Figure 1  shows that the number of initial \nclaims for unemployment insurance is now near a series low and much lower than it has been \nduring all but one of the  previous recoveries since 1967.  It is not surprising that f irms are not \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n4 \n laying people off , because the economy  continues to be quite strong, but another factor is the \ndifficult y finding  someone  to replace a worker who is laid off or leaves .  So l ayoffs may remain \nuncommon even if firm s experience some  slowdown  in their business . \n Figure 2  shows the so -called “ quits rate, ” the number of people who  voluntarily leave  \ntheir job as a share of  total employment, since 2003.  Keep in mind that if you quit your job, you \ndo not qualify for unemployment insurance.  So, essentially , the quits rate provides an indication \nof workers ’ confidence in their ability to find a new job.   \n Figure 3  shows the job openings rate  – which is the number of job openings at the end of \nthe month, relative to total employment plus job openings , monthly since 2003 .  The job \nopenings rate is now significantly higher than at the peak before the crisis and  recession .  This \nmeasure of firms’ demand for labor is at its highest level since the series was first repor ted in late \n2000. \n Figure 4  shows the unemployment rate , which has fallen to 3.9 percent .  The Blue Chip \nconsensus forecast  expect s it to fall to 3.5 percent by the end of next year.  Such an outcome \nwould be well below most estimates of the natural , or long -run, rate of unemployment.  At \npresent, the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) suggests that  no FOMC  \nparticipant  estimates the long -run unemployment rate to be lower than 4 percent .  The median \nlonger -run unemployment rate projected by FOMC participants  is 4.5 percent.  I would suggest \nthat a  forecast where  the unemployment rate fal ls well below its estimated long -run sustainable \nlevel for a significant period of time is a sign of macroeconomic imbalance, which poses a risk of \nrising inflation or increasing  financial stability concerns  – or both.  \n \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n5 \n Wages and P rices  \nTurning to wages and prices, Figure 5  provides the average hourly earnings of  \nproduction and nonsupervisory private -industry employees  from January 2003 to August 2018.  \nOver the past five years, earnings have gradually risen, and are currently roughly consistent with \nthe sum of 2 percent inf lation , plus the somewhat subdued productivity gains  of roughly 1 \npercent .   \nInterestingly, if you examine service- providing industries and goods -producing \nindustries , you see that earnings in both have been increasing.  The service -providing industries ’ \nearnings closely match th ose of the total , while goods -producing industries  (which include those \nthat are more export -intensive and thus  more likely to be directly impacted by tariffs ) have seen \nearnings increase more quickly of late – although I should note that the volatility of these \nearnings is always higher than that of services .  Should the upward trend in wages  continue, one \nwould expect  firms to either  shrink their profit margins or begin to pass  on some of the costs as \nprice increases.  \n Figure 6  shows total and core PCE  measures of inflation.  The inflation measures have \nfluctuat ed recently  around the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent inflation target , although there is a \nmodest upward trend over the past three years .  Private forecasters in the Survey of Professional  \nForecasters  now expect PCE  inflatio n to be just above  2 percent both this year and  next.  \nConsistent with my earlier comments on tight labor markets, I personally believe there are some \nupside risks to this outlook. \n Figure 7  shows PCE  inflation separately for  goods and services  from 2003 through the \nsecond quarter of  2018.  While s ervices  PCE  inflation has been a bit above 2 percent over the \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n6 \n past two years , the more volatile g oods PCE  inflation has , for the most part , been below 2 \npercent  – although it  has been rising recently.   \nAs we study price movements, we need to consider trade and tariffs.  T ariffs may be \npassed through, at least in part, to prices in goods -producing industries over time.  But tariffs \nmay also be used as “cover” for passing through the rising cost of labor1 as labor markets tighten \nfurther.   Indeed, many of our  business contacts in New England have highlighted that they now \nreceiv e little resistance to passing on price increases.  These anecdotes  may reflect an unintended \nconsequence of the tariffs: suppliers may now feel they have more pricing flexibility, posing an \nupside risk to measured inflation. \n \nReal GDP  Growth  \n Figure 8  shows the pattern of real GDP growth.  At 4.2 percent growth, t he second \nquarter of 2018 was quite strong.  However, some of this growth likely reflects shifts in the \ntiming of spending in expectation of the imposition of tariffs on some goods.  For example, \nsoybean shipments increased in the second quarter , apparentl y to beat  the imposition of tariffs ; \nshipments are likely to fall now that the tariffs are in place.   \nOver the second half of this year, private forecasters are expecting that real GDP growth \nwill average around 3 percent, with growth next year ranging fr om 2 to 2.5 percent.   Since that \nexceed s what economists call the economy’s potential rate of growth (somewhat below 2 \npercent ), I would expect to see further declines in the unemployment rate over this horizon. \n Figure 9  provides the pattern of consumption.  While consumption growth slowed \nunexpectedly  in the first quarter, it rebounded in the second quarter.  Most forecaster s expect \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n7 \n consum er spending to be a key  driver of the economy , reflect ing high consumer confidence, \nrising stock and housing prices, and continued growth in personal income.  \n Given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and foreign growth, the trajectory for e xports of \ngoods and services  remain s uncertain.  Exports represent  a sizable s hare of GDP, as shown in \nFigure 10 .  If retaliatory tariffs  roughly match the tariffs imposed by the United States , the result \ncould be a roughly equal reduction in exports and imports , leaving the trade deficit \napproximately the same.   \nHowever, tariffs i ncrease the uncertainty around the path of net exports.  Trade \ndisruptions could cause countries to source their purchases from new countries , for instance  – but \nin many cases this is not a change that could happen easily or quickly.  M oreover, uncertainty  \nabout how long the tariffs might be in place  makes the decision about whether to relocate \nproduction or  to find new supply sources or markets even more difficult.   \nOver the past 20 years , supply chains have become increasingly interconnected across \nmany countries for any one good.  As suggested above, the threat of tariffs may disrupt the \nglobal supply chains , causing firms to source from more costly  (without tariffs) – but potentially \nmore dependable – suppliers.  T hese complex supply adjustments are likely to play out over an \nextended period.  This implies  a modest upward bias to the  inflation forecast over the next \nseveral years.  In an environment of strong growth and tight labor markets , these staggered one -\ntime price changes  run a greater risk of  becom ing more solidly incorporated into inflation \nexpectations.   \nAn added concern for exporters is the high er value of the dollar , which makes it more \ndifficult for our goods and services  to remain competitive, as shown in Figure 11 . \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n8 \n Risks  \n There are certainly significant  risks to the forecast.  I will mention three here.   First, the \nstrength of the U.S. dollar has generated complications for some emerging market economies.   \nFigure 12  shows the significant currency devaluation s for two emergi ng economies, Argentina \nand Turkey.  Businesses in th ese countries that have borrowed in dollars  will of course find it \nmore difficult to pay their debts as the value of their own currency  falls relative to the dollar .   \nA second challenge for emerging markets is the increase in oil prices.  Many of the \nemerging economies are importers of oil that is priced in dollars ( Figure 13 ), so rising oil prices \nonly complicate matters , as both higher  dollar  prices and a rising  value of the  dollar act as a tax \non these countries’ incomes .  To the extent that emerging market growth is slowed by rising oil \nprices, this in turn will pose a challenge to  U.S. growth. \n There have also been increased concerns over  a potential slowdown in China. Perhaps \nreflecting such unease , Chinese stock prices have declined recently ( Figure 14) .  As a  highly \nleveraged economy faced with significant tariffs , the risk of a more significant slowdown in the \nworld’s second largest economy  should be considered.  \n \nConcluding Observations  \n I will conclude with a few final observations on policy.  Figure 15  shows the median \npath of interest rate  projections through 2021from  the SEP .  The median forecast in the  SEP has \nthe federal funds rate rising to 3.4 percent.  T he median estimate for longer -run or equilibrium \ninterest rates in the SEP is 3 percent, so this implies interest rates gradually rising to become \nmildly restrictive.   \n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M.  Eastern  Time on Monday, October 1, 2018  OR UPON DELIVERY  \n9 \n My own view is generally  consistent with the SEP  forecasts .  I believe that Federal \nReserve policymakers  will likely need to move interest rates gradually from a mildly \naccommodative stance to a mildly restrictive stance  in order to best fulfil our mandate – stable \nprices and maximum sustainable growth.   \nWhile this amounts to one person’s  forecast, it is important to note that it is fully \nconsistent with a forecast of GDP growth above potential that leads to  further tightening of labor \nmarkets , and inflation mildly overshooting the Federal Reserve’s  2 percent target.   Of course, if  \nsome of  the risks that I have highlighted today  become more germane to the outlook, a different \npolicy path would be warranted . \n Thank you.  \n \n                                                           \n1Adjusted for productivity.",
