            "content": "Takeaways from Boston Fed President Susan M. Collins’ Remarks\nCollins said the U.S. economy is in a good place overall.\nActivity continues to grow at a solid pace. Collins anticipates “that inflation will return to the Fed’s 2 percent target in a timely way – and crucially, amid a healthy labor market.”\nOn monetary policy, she said given the disinflation progress to date, further adjustments in the policy rate will likely be needed after the September initial rate cut.\n“My confidence in the disinflation trajectory has increased – but so have the risks of the economy slowing beyond what is needed to restore price stability.” Collins will remain highly attentive to both price stability and maximum employment, the two parts of the Fed’s Congressional mandate.\nCollins said labor-market conditions are no longer too hot, nor too cold – softening from the unsustainably tight job-market conditions a year ago.\nThe unemployment rate remains low by historical standards. Job growth has slowed on balance in recent months but remains relatively solid. We continue to see a low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance, as well as muted levels of continuing claims. “A labor market with supply and demand in better balance is a key reason for disinflation becoming more broad-based” said Collins, adding that the goal is not further cooling in the labor market.\nInflation’s components show services prices (excluding housing) expanding at a rate more consistent with 2 percent overall inflation, while housing inflation has moderated some recently – but is the most “sticky.”\nHousing inflation “remains above its pre-pandemic average despite some recent improvements. However, there are good reasons to think that this stickiness in current shelter inflation reflects existing rents still catching up to new market rents,” she said.\nCurrent, elevated wage growth reflects robust gains in worker productivity and therefore, should not necessarily lead to additional price pressures.\nWhile nominal wage growth has exceeded inflation for the past year, this follows a period when inflation outpaced wage growth – so wages are in part catching up to past price increases. Also, real wage growth over this recovery has yet to match measured productivity gains; Collins noted Boston Fed research that concludes nominal wage growth could continue to exceed inflation for a while but remain consistent with the on-going disinflation process.\nFinding economic resurgence in the face of long-term challenges often involves local people willing to collaborate across sectors on shared goals and strategies. Collins noted the growing “playbook” of effective local strategies that New Englanders are deploying.\n“Some locales have focused on business retention and recruitment and strengthening neighborhoods. In others, local leaders have decided to focus on reducing impediments to participation in the labor force – addressing tangible problems like job readiness, childcare, and transportation. In others, people are focusing on entrepreneurship support.” Collaborative leadership across sectors can be “easy to say, difficult to do” – but is vital.",

Still, the appropriate approach to monetary policy continues to require patience. Collins says recent economic information is encouraging, after the string of higher-than-expected inflation readings during the first quarter of 2024. The data suggest an economy with demand and supply coming into better balance, as needed to restore price stability. However, she says, this process may take more time than previously thought. It is still uncertain whether inflation is durably on a path back to the 2 percent target. The appropriate monetary policy approach continues to require patience, providing time for a methodical assessment of the evolving constellation of available data.\n“Working Places” is an example of how the Fed encourages economic progress on the local level. Collins says the research-based Working Places initiative is grounded in the Boston Fed’s public service mission to build a vibrant and inclusive economy and the Fed’s Congressional mandate to achieve price stability and maximum employment. It’s an example of a strategic partnership, she says, that aims to improve New England’s economy. This community development effort complements the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy, research, payments, and supervision work as it seeks to fulfill its mission and mandate.\nIn Lawrence, Massachusetts, collaborative leadership and a shared vision continue to impact the resurgent city’s future. Lawrence is home to one of the first success stories of Working Places. Collins says the efforts here illustrate how shared leadership and collaboration between sectors can help spark economic progress and resilience through waves of change and challenge.",

Collins’ April 11, 2024 Remarks\nCollins expects inflation to return to 2% while the job market stays strong.\nCollins is committed to returning inflation to the Fed’s 2% target and expects this process to unfold over time, with the labor market remaining healthy. She notes that risks to the economy are two-sided (risks from cutting rates prematurely, as well as from waiting too long).\nCollins continues to expect it will be appropriate to begin easing policy later this year, but more time is needed to gather information instilling greater confidence that progress will continue.\nPolicy decisions must be based on holistic data assessment, and the risks and uncertainties remain elevated. It may take longer to discern whether the economy is sustainably on a path back to 2% inflation, and thus less easing of policy this year than previously thought may be warranted. Monetary policy is currently well positioned for the requisite patient, methodical approach, and to manage the risks.\nSupply improvements have so far played a key role in rebalancing the post-pandemic economy.\nImproved supply chains, increased productivity, and growth in labor supply have resulted in better-than-anticipated outcomes in 2023. But we cannot count on these improvements to continue at the same pace, and demand growth will need to moderate to achieve further progress on inflation.\nThe lower risk that conditions are overly tight supports taking a more patient approach to deciding when to ease.\nEconomic activity has remained robust despite high interest rates. While this resilience is good news, it raises questions about the restrictiveness of the policy stance and broader financial conditions. In this context and with less sign of labor market fragility, Collins believes there are now fewer concerns about policy remaining too restrictive in the near-term.\nRecent data haven’t changed the outlook, but suggest patience rather than urgency.\nData highlight the likelihood that disinflation will continue to be uneven. We should not be surprised by some higher inflation readings after the low numbers in the second half of 2023. While expecting all indicators to be well aligned is too high a bar, further signs of progress towards the 2% inflation target will be necessary.",

            "content": "Takeaways from Boston Fed President Susan M. Collins’ February 28, 2024 Remarks\nThe U.S. economy overall performed remarkably well in 2023: inflation slowed notably, while job growth and output growth remained quite strong. Importantly, the pandemic recovery has been unusually equitable, with employment gains having been broadly shared across racial and ethnic groups.\nRecent economic data releases highlight that progress toward achieving the Fed’s mandated goals—price stability and maximum employment—could continue to be bumpy. And with the volatility of monthly inflation remaining elevated, it is important not to overreact to individual data readings. More time is needed to discern whether the economy is sustainably on a path to price stability, amid a healthy labor market.\nCollins notes she will need to see more evidence that the disinflationary process will continue before starting to carefully normalize policy—however expecting all of the data to speak uniformly is too high a bar. Some of the factors Collins plans to consider in assessing progress toward the Fed’s dual mandate goals include inflation expectations remaining well anchored, as well as an orderly moderation in labor demand. She also wants to see continued evidence that wage growth is not adding inflationary pressures, consistent with the recent work by Boston Fed economists.\nCollins also wants to see continued declines in housing inflation and non-shelter services inflation—the two subcomponents of inflation that have been stickier and are taking longer to return to pre-pandemic levels. The focus on inflation components is not about adding additional objectives—the Fed’s target is 2 percent year-over-year growth of total PCE prices—but rather about gaining greater confidence in the overall inflation outlook.\nStill, in Collins’ view, the threat of inflation settling persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent target has receded, and risks to the economy overall are moving into better balance. However, a durable return to 2 percent inflation will likely require demand growing at a more moderate pace this year. Collins sees the current stance of monetary policy as consistent with achieving this outcome. And while not on a preset path, she believes it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy later this year.\nCollins also notes that overall, the strength of an economy has many dimensions. In this regard, the Federal Reserve is involved in a breadth of activities to support a vibrant economy that works for all: monetary policymaking, economic research, bank supervision, infrastructure and services for the financial system, and supporting collaborations that expand prospects for progress in low- and middle-income communities.",

            "content": "Takeaways from Boston Fed President Susan M. Collins’ November 17, 2023 Remarks\nCollins emphasized that the two aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate are complementary.\n\nWhile there often is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has shown that price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy – it is an important precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. So, both aspects of the dual mandate are interrelated and complementary.\nA challenge for the Fed, explored at this conference, is how to operationalize a broad concept of full employment when setting monetary policy.\n\nFull employment has often been defined by referencing an unemployment rate. But no one statistic can adequately characterize the labor market, since aggregate numbers do not show the wide range of experiences across people, sectors, and places.\nCollins emphasized the connection between the full employment goal and the Fed’s role in fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone.\n\nFor some people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in economic outcomes – including but not limited to employment. This underutilization of the workforce adversely affects national productivity and prosperity.\nA better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if the Fed is to meet both its full-employment and price-stability goals, said Collins.\n\nThe aggregate unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full employment when the labor force participation rate is changing. If participation increases in a tight labor market, labor supply expands, and higher levels of economic activity may not generate additional price pressures requiring tighter monetary policy. And the higher levels of activity and participation can benefit those drawn into the labor market.\nIt is essential to examine factors that could limit people from participating in the economy, and to support research and collaborations that promote economic progress.\n\nThe Fed’s mandate and the concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to participation in the workforce, and the challenges that can prevent people from doing so (for example child care, housing, and infrastructure). Often these impediments are long-run, structural factors that cannot be resolved with monetary policy. However, to assess the productive capacity of the economy, the Fed needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving. And a better understanding can lead to expanded opportunities for more people.",

Collins’ October 12, 2023 Remarks\nCollins knows inflation is still taking a toll across New England, but inflation is moderating.\n\nIn her travels around New England, Collins has spoken with residents and business owners who are continuing to struggle with higher prices. But she sees the Fed making progress in its efforts to lower inflation, as some signs are emerging that demand and supply are realigning.\nDespite some favorable indicators, Collins says it’s too soon to be confident that inflation is on a sustained trajectory back to the Fed’s 2 percent target.\n\nCollins says much of the recent moderation in the core inflation measure is due to declines in core goods inflation, which can be traced to improvements in supply chain conditions. But she adds that firms’ incentives to pass on these costs savings may be short-lived unless demand slows. Meanwhile, core services inflation remains elevated.\nThe recovery from the pandemic has been unusual, and Collins says that in this highly uncertain environment, policymaking requires patience.\n\nCollins says that policymakers need time to draw conclusions about the data and allow special factors that have been supporting near term activity to play out. She adds it’s unlikely we’ve yet seen the full effects of the Fed’s actions to date, so patience is critical as policymakers weigh the risk of inflation remaining persistently high against the risk of activity slowing more than expected.\nRecent increases in long-term interest rates reinforce Collins’ view that we’re very near or perhaps at the peak of the current tightening cycle.\n\nCollins noted the 10-year Treasury yield has moved up since mid-September, and that increase has been accompanied by higher corporate bond yields and mortgage rates. Collins says the rise in these rates implies some tightening of financial conditions, which if persistent could reduce the need for further monetary policy tightening. It also reinforces her view that we are very near or perhaps at the peak of this tightening cycle.\nCollins’ travels around New England have given her insight into its strengths and challenges and shown her again how important community banks are to regional economic health.\n\nShared concerns include childcare, housing, and infrastructure. At the same time, the region benefits from its collective brainpower, a diverse and skilled workforce, and relatively high job opportunity. Collins says the region’s banking industry plays an essential role everywhere, serving communities of all sizes and providing households and businesses with the funding they need for economic health and growth.",

            "content": "Takeaways from Boston Fed President Susan M. Collins’ October 11, 2023 Remarks\nCollins highlighted three main forms of uncertainty that monetary policymakers confront, all present in the pandemic era.\n\nThe first relates to data and measurement – how accurately statistics describe the variables they intend to measure. The second relates to relationships between key economic variables that influence policy decisions – examples include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics. The third is related to unforeseen events, such as pandemics, natural disasters, or geopolitical developments.\nFor policymaking, the appropriate response to uncertainty depends on its type as well as the context.\n\nUncertainty can call for policy to move unusually rapidly – or to take a more wait-and-see approach. In the current policy cycle, this has contributed to different policy phases, starting with a period of holding rates low when pandemic-related risks were still high, followed by a period of aggressive moves, and then the current more gradual, patient approach to policy.\nSome special factors have impacted the pandemic recovery that make it difficult to compare to previous business cycles, adding to the uncertainty.\n\nDespite many expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained remarkably resilient to date. Household balance sheets have been solid, partially due to savings accumulated during the pandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated due in part to locking in financing at previously low rates. Factors like these have likely made the economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles, to date.\nWith progress on inflation and continued elevated uncertainty, the FOMC appropriately shifted to a new, more gradual and \"patient\" policymaking phase.\n\nThough inflation levels are still too high, taking the time to holistically assess incoming information is warranted. It reflects the fact that we are likely close to the peak of this tightening cycle, with the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely balanced with the risk of slowing activity more than needed to achieve price stability. Still, Collins expects we'll need to hold rates at restrictive levels until we see evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.\nCollins remains realistic, but optimistic, about restoring price stability without a significant economic downturn.\n\nOverall, she continues to be realistic about the economic uncertainties and risks, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and only a modest increase in the unemployment rate – an outcome consistent with both parts of the Fed's dual mandate.\nOne key policy lesson, Collins suggests with the benefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply shocks.\n\nThe pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers; and risk assessments, however difficult to make, had to be made. But Collins observes that the risk of widespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a stronger case than previously realized for insuring against too-high inflation by removing policy accommodation more quickly.\nCollins also offered some takeaways to students about learning and careers.\n\nShe recommended a mindset of lifelong learning and seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives. In working environments, she also underlined the importance of gathering information broadly – quantitative and qualitative – and intentionally hearing from a wide range of stakeholders, including voices that have not traditionally been \"in the room.\"",

Collins’ September 22, 2023 Remarks\nPrice stability is essential for a well-functioning economy, and an important precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time.\n\nCollins continues to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too-high inflation. The focus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to the 2 percent target.\nWhile recent inflation readings have been encouraging, inflation remains too high. Some important components of inflation have yet to show sustained improvement.\n\nAlthough still elevated, inflation is down from its earlier peak. However, most of the moderation in core inflation has come from a decline in goods inflation. Shelter inflation has also moderated recently, and will likely ease further. However, inflation in core services excluding shelter (over half of the Fed's preferred inflation measure) has yet to show improvement consistent with price stability.\nCollins fully supports the FOMC's attentiveness to inflation risks and commitment to price stability.\n\nSustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming into better balance with supply across the economy. While there is some evidence this realignment is underway, especially in the labor market, economic activity continues to be above trend and it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to target. Collins agrees with the policy guidance in the median SEP projections which show rates staying higher, and for longer, than previous projections had suggested; and further tightening is certainly not off the table.\nThis phase of policymaking requires considerable patience, to extract the signal from noisy data and to allow some temporary factors to play out. Collins is realistic about risks, but optimistic about restoring price stability with an orderly realignment of demand with supply.\n\nThe economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be, highly unusual. This phase of monetary policy requires patience. Collins is a \"realistic optimist\" – realistic about the uncertainties, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with only a modest increase in the unemployment rate. She believes the pathway to achieving this outcome has widened.\nAcross Maine (and New England), local leadership efforts are addressing economic challenges and promoting resurgence.\n\nThere are many dimensions to economic prosperity – so the Fed has a broad portfolio of activities, including encouraging local initiatives to foster economic resurgence in areas facing long-term struggles. An essential element is cross-sector collaboration among local individuals. In Maine, there are six such \"Working Places\" efforts, and the Fed simply helps the local networks emerge and flourish. Collins notes that collaborating to improve opportunities for people and places to not be left behind – but rather join in the economy – is good economics, good citizenship, and good business.",

            "content": "Takeaways from Boston Fed President Susan M. Collins’ September 6, 2023 Remarks\nHolistic Assessment: Collins reviews a wide range of information to assess the evolving economy. She looks for patterns and trends showing sustained reductions in inflation, and progress on the underlying goal of bringing demand and supply back into better balance. She notes that price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy and an important precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time.\nCurrent Indications: Strong demand relative to supply has been a key factor driving higher inflation. While we are seeing some signs of moderation, demand continues to outpace supply, creating price pressures. Core inflation shows modest and relatively recent moderation. There are promising developments, but given continued strength in demand, Collins' view is that it is just too early to take the recent improvements as evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to the 2% target.\nPatience and Data Dependence: This phase of monetary policy calls for patience and holistic data dependence. One reason is the difficulty of extracting signal from noise in the data. Another is increased uncertainty about the timing and ultimate impact on the economy of policy tightening to date – including some reasons to expect longer lags than normal due to some unique aspects of the pandemic recovery.\nStaying Resolute: Importantly, patience does not mean indecision, or a change in commitment to the 2 percent target and to achieving price stability in a reasonable amount of time.  Collins expects we'll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time. And while we may be near, or even at, the peak, further tightening could be warranted, depending on incoming data. We are well positioned to proceed patiently, carefully, yet deliberately; recognizing the risks while remaining resolute.\nOptimistic While Realistic: Continued restrictive monetary policy should temper demand further, to bring it into better balance with supply – however, Collins does not believe a significant slowdown is required. She remains realistic about the risks and uncertainties around the outlook, while optimistic that price stability is achievable with an orderly slowdown and only a modest unemployment rate increase – ideally preserving some of the current favorable labor market dynamics.\nEngagement and Collaboration: The Fed's mandate and concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy lead us to study economic issues that prevent people from participating in the economy or workforce, as well as the gaps in wealth accumulation and prosperity. Collins will continue to prioritize hearing from those in a wide range of roles, who make up and shape our region's economy. The Boston Fed will continue working to support a vibrant, inclusive economy full of opportunity, working collaboratively with organizations across the region to understand and address challenges.",

Collins’ May 25, 2023 Remarks\nCollins wanted her first visit to an educational institution as Boston Fed president to be at a community college – because they provide affordable, accessible higher education to learners from all backgrounds. Community colleges play a crucial role in helping students develop the necessary skills to contribute in the economy of today and of the future. It is essential that our economy has opportunities for everyone to thrive, and that makes community colleges particularly important.\nHigh inflation impacts everyone – and we need to make sure it does not become entrenched. An inflation rate that is low and predictable is needed for fostering conditions that promote a vibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. This is why it is so important to remain resolute in bringing inflation back down to the Fed's 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time.\nWhile inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation. Collins believes we may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising interest rates. This will provide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the actions taken to date and the general tightening of credit conditions on economic activity. However, it is important to make each policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of information available at the time.\nCollins noted the breadth of ways the Fed advances its mission – e.g., providing back-end infrastructure that underpins the financial system that people and organizations depend on; supervising banks for safety, soundness, fair lending, and community reinvestment and serving as a \"lender of last resort\"; working to support community economic development and identify impediments to participation in the job market and economy; and conducting economic research and analysis to support monetary policymaking, in pursuit of the dual mandate from Congress to promote price stability and maximum employment.",

Collins’ March 30, 2023 Remarks\nFinancial stability: The banking system is strong and resilient, with well-capitalized institutions and ample liquidity. Recent difficulties, and the decisive actions taken in response, demonstrate commitment to use all our tools to ensure the financial system remains safe and sound, and to take action as needed. The lessons learned from the review underway will be welcome, and instructive.\nMonetary policy and the macroeconomic outlook: Recent data show that inflation is still too high, continuing to take a toll on households and firms. I anticipate that some additional policy tightening will be needed as we follow through on our commitment to price stability. However, while recognizing the risks and uncertainties to the outlook, I remain optimistic there is a path to bringing inflation down without a significant downturn, because of the resilience I see in the economy.\nFinancial infrastructure and payments services: The Fed provides essential financial infrastructure the economy depends on – and innovates to meet evolving needs and preferences. In today’s world, people want quick and easy ways to make payments instantly, with immediate access to those funds. To help financial institutions offer instant payment services to their customers around the clock, we will launch the FedNowSM Service in July.\nCommunity economic development and opportunity: While the Fed’s activities are broad, they all relate to supporting a vibrant and inclusive economy, consistent with our mandates – stable prices and maximum employment. That’s why, for example, we have for decades studied the gaps and disparities behind the aggregates. It is also why the Boston Fed is helping spark collaboration among the private, public, nonprofit, and philanthropic sectors, to find local solutions to complex economic problems in urban and rural areas.",

My views will continue to be based on a holistic assessment of available information. And while aware of the risks and uncertainties, I remain optimistic there is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn.\nThe root of the inflation surprise was an imbalance between demand and supply. During 2021-22, realized demand exceeded supply, and forecasters were overly optimistic about supply recovering to meet the increase in demand as the economy reopened. The interaction of supply chain bottlenecks and constraints to labor supply compounded the forecasting misses. Supply chains were under strain due to continued bouts of COVID variants; and later, Russia’s war in Ukraine.\nMy view is that, in 2021 – in the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant continued uncertainty, and with inflation expectations in a reasonable range – supporting the economy versus pre-empting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision.\nPolicy lessons from this still-evolving episode include that capacity constraints can lead to a less favorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment – and this potentially has implications for the future conduct of monetary policy, as we at the Fed fulfill our dual mandate. Furthermore, I’ll observe that additional wide-ranging indicators can be especially helpful for evaluating policy options in unusual contexts.",

More measured rate adjustments will better enable us to address the competing risks that monetary policy now faces.\nWhile realistic about the risks and uncertainties, I remain reasonably optimistic that there is a pathway to reducing inflation without a significant economic downturn. I see ongoing resilience in the economy, evidenced by many firms’ continued hiring plans, and household and business spending that is holding up relatively well.\nNew England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to address. This is an opportunity to take stock, look ahead, and assess long-term trajectories, opportunities, and imperatives – especially related to the availability of both workers and housing.\nThe Fed’s mandate and mission involve an economy with opportunities for all – but outcomes persistently differ in certain places, and for certain people or groups. The region’s economy is healthiest when it’s providing opportunities for all to contribute and prosper, not leaving some people and places behind. Today’s conference will explore the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the post-pandemic economy for New Englanders.\nSince 2014, the Boston Fed has been leading promising work focused on encouraging local efforts to find economic resurgence – in smaller cities where manufacturing once flourished, and rural areas facing challenges. We call it the Working Places Challenge – and the model is proving effective.\n“Working Places” is based on research that showed a key to resilience, through waves of economic change and challenge, is cross-sector collaboration among local individuals willing to take on shared leadership. The program is structured as a competition for grant money (not from the Fed but from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders are building cross-sector vision and priorities, and working on them together. It helps communities weave together many small individual approaches into one, coherent system – and then improve the system. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts.\nWorking Places helps the Fed encourage economic progress in local economies, grounded in our mission of a vibrant and inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price stability and maximum employment – for all not just some. It is one example of strategic partnerships the Boston Fed creates to improve New England’s economy.

Restoring price stability remains our current imperative as monetary policymakers, and it is clear there is more work to do. Understanding how the pandemic is affecting employment in the short and longer term, while challenging, is essential for that effort.\nThere has been a significant amount of work on COVID-19 and the labor market among academic economists as well as researchers within the Federal Reserve System. This conference brings together leading experts on the topic, enabling us to benefit from their perspectives and learn about remaining questions to be answered.\nAnswering key questions about the pandemic’s effects on labor demand and labor supply is important for calibrating monetary policy and reducing inflation back to 2 percent. By raising rates, we are aiming to slow the economy and bring labor demand into better balance with supply. I remain optimistic that there is a pathway to re-establishing labor market balance with only a modest rise in the unemployment rate – while remaining realistic about the risks of a larger downturn.\nPotentially long-lasting effects of the pandemic on the labor market, such as increased remote work and accelerated automation of service-sector jobs, are likely to have differential effects across the workforce.

It is clear there is more work to do, to get there. I expect this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate, followed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time.\nBoth unemployment and inflation are very costly for individuals and our economy. The costs for both are also disproportionately borne by those who are most vulnerable in our society, like those with lower incomes. Returning to low, stable inflation will set the foundation for maximum employment that is sustainable; and for a vibrant, resilient, inclusive economy that works for all.\nLowering inflation requires slowing economic activity, and bringing demand and supply in the labor markets into better balance to relieve inflationary pressures. While there are risks and uncertainties, I remain optimistic about the possibility of achieving this without a significant economic slowdown.\nThe aggressive pace of interest rate increases to date has been appropriate, given rates had been near zero before March. Now that rates are in restrictive territory, the next phase of tightening should shift from a focus on pace to a focus on levels – determining the level needed to be sufficiently restrictive.  I expect it will be appropriate to continue raising rates, with the size of future increases determined by a holistic assessment of incoming information.\nAs policy becomes more restrictive, the risks of overtightening rise.

            "content": "5 takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s June 25, 2021, remarks to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum\nTakeaway: Rosengren observed that short-term credit markets have been disrupted in the past two recessions, and significant risks remain. For example, prime money market mutual funds and stablecoins bear attention.\n\nExcerpt on money market funds: “The result has been that [prime] money market funds have been a critical feature of the financial crises that we've seen in the last decade, and this is a problem that has yet to be resolved.”\n\nExcerpt on stablecoins: “I think there's a financial stability concern that a future crisis could easily be triggered as these become a more important sector of the financial market, unless we start regulating them and making sure that there's actually a lot more […] stability to what is being marketed to the general public as a ‘stable’ coin.”\nTakeaway: Substantial emergency actions were necessary to support lending during the pandemic, and the economy would benefit from being less dependent on ad hoc measures in crises.\n\nExcerpt: “We need a less ad hoc approach to these crises. We need to think more systematically about how we can make sure that credit is available, and not only to the largest institutions, but many of the small- and medium-sized enterprises as well.”\nTakeaway: A properly implemented Countercyclical Capital Buffer, or CCyB, would help avoid some of these issues.\n\nExcerpt: “I think a well-designed CCyB, which is a counter cyclical capital charge, which builds up capital buffers during good times [and] gets released when we have bad economic times, would have made … at least some of those measures less necessary, because it would have been a natural way to provide a lot more capacity for banks to continue to do their lending.”\nTakeaway: Unfortunately, emergency facilities do well supporting large firms but are challenged somewhat to reach small firms. Without better facilities for small firms, the situation will increase economic concentration.\n\nExcerpt: “So, if we continue to have these kind of crises where these kind of interventions are needed, I think ultimately it's going to result in a greater concentration that we want in the U.S. economy, in the corporate sector.”\nTakeaway: Housing prices have played a role in financial stability problems in the past, so recent housing price trends should be monitored closely by policymakers.\n\nExcerpt: “Around the world, banking crises and financial stability periods are frequently tied to real estate... And, so, I think this bears watching as a potential ‘side effect’ that [policymakers] have to be thinking about as we [determine] what appropriate monetary policy is, going forward.”",

            "content": "5 takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s June 23, 2021, remarks\nTakeaway: Vaccination rates have been better than expected in much of the U.S., and that’s led to a more rapid reopening of the economy than was forecast earlier this year.\n\nExcerpt: “I think the most important message is that we really have a quite a robust recovery that is underway. The economy is opening up faster than we would have anticipated five or six months ago. Vaccination rates particularly in New England but throughout the country have occurred more rapidly than we anticipated. And as a result, businesses are reopening much more quickly.”\nTakeaway: Forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP) have been significantly upgraded since the start of this year, with the median forecast of Federal Open Market Committee members at 7% growth for 2021. That is unusually high for a U.S. recovery.\n\nExcerpt: “Seven percent is … more like a number that you would expect from an emerging market, not a developed country like the United States, and really highlights how strong the economic growth is expected to be over the course of this year.”\nTakeaway: Despite the positive signs, we still have quite a way to go before we reach full employment, given the most recent unemployment rate was 5.8%, substantially above the 4.5% FOMC participants project by the end of 2021. One reason for that is a slower recovery in public-facing services, including tourism, hospitality, restaurants, and retail.\n\nExcerpt: “If you're working in a store, if you’re working a hotel, you're probably having a lot of contact with people, some of whom will be vaccinated, some of them will not, and you may just not be willing to take that much of a risk for a job that's not paying much more than minimum wage.”\nTakeaway: Inflation is higher, but spikes in food and energy prices explain much of this, and those will moderate. Increased inflation can also be attributed to a variety of things that have happened over the last six months because of the unusual facets of coming out of a pandemic – including shortages in a variety of goods and services that we don’t normally experience during a recovery.\n\nExcerpt: “Most Fed speakers have talked about expecting inflation to come back to 2%. That is my forecast as well, that I expect us to be slightly above 2%. … So, I think the Fed’s expectation, that most of the price movement that's occurring this year is not sustained into next year, is actually a pretty common forecast.”\nTakeaway: Low rates and a high degree of stimulus have been appropriate, but it is important over time to watch for conditions that potentially raise financial stability issues.\n\nExcerpt: “Housing prices [are] something worth closely monitoring. If we continue to see housing appreciation like we've been seeing, I think over time we'd have to take a hard look to see whether we're getting some spillovers from some of the monetary policy accommodation that we're having and think about ways to mitigate that.”",

            "content": "Six Takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s May 5, 2021 Remarks\nTakeaway: The economy is seeing rapid growth in real output and notable improvements in payroll employment, relative to the depths of the pandemic. But despite improvements on public health and economic activity, significant slack remains in the economy as millions have not yet regained jobs.\n\nExcerpt: “The unemployment rate does not include the millions who have left the workforce since the pandemic began. The labor force participation rate, measured by the percent of the population in the workforce, whether employed or unemployed, remains depressed. Therefore, while rapid economic growth is very good news, it was, and still is, badly needed to offset the sizable shock that occurred with the COVID-19 pandemic.”\nTakeaway: Some analysts are worried inflation could pick up significantly.  It is likely that several temporary factors will make measured inflation this spring higher than its underlying trend – but these factors are largely the result of the ebbs and flows of the pandemic, which has produced unusual patterns in monthly economic data, and they seem unlikely to have an enduring impact.\n\nExcerpt: “We should expect that measured inflation will accelerate this spring. However, my view is that this acceleration in the rate of price increases is likely to prove temporary. … To date, inflation expectations and the underlying inflation rate look to be stable.”\nTakeaway: The temporary factors likely to push up inflation numbers this spring include supply disruptions, increased consumer spending after months of pent-up demand, and higher prices for commodities such as oil.\n\nExcerpt: “Oil prices, which declined dramatically as travel fell, have increased significantly of late. Pent-up demand for goods has resulted in the rise of shipping costs, and delays in unloading at ports have made it difficult for many businesses to restock their shelves. All these factors will likely result in temporary increases in prices.”\nTakeaway: The pandemic’s fluctuations have affected economic indicators besides inflation, and one example is social-distance-sensitive spending. Room for recovery remains in these kinds of indicators, and that’s reason for optimism about continued economic growth.\n\nExcerpt: “While much progress has been made, one reason to continue to expect strong growth in employment and real GDP going forward is that there are a variety of industries still impacted by the pandemic. Policymakers expect these effects to further diminish as a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated.”\nTakeaway: Policymakers will need to be vigilant, watching that the post-pandemic environment does not bring structural changes with implications for inflation. It will be particularly important to see whether wages and prices continue to be relatively unresponsive to a tightening labor market.\n\nExcerpt: “Policymakers need to be alert to potential changes to the economy. … Both spending patterns and work environments are likely to be altered by the pandemic. It is too early to know whether the economic relationships we observed pre-pandemic will behave similarly in the post-pandemic era.”\nTakeaway: Despite the ebbs and flows of the data, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 percent. This should allow monetary policymakers to be patient in removing accommodation…until more progress in the labor market has occurred.\n\nExcerpt: “My perspective is that the emphasis on actual outcomes rather than forecasts of rising inflationary pressures when setting monetary policy appears justified.”",

            "content": "Six Takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s April 12 Remarks\nTakeaway: The economy is showing signs of recovering from the impacts of the pandemic, but many businesses and households are still experiencing significant economic distress. Industries where social distancing is difficult have been disproportionately affected, and they include many lower-wage and Black and Hispanic workers. Women, too, have been disproportionately affected.\n\nExcerpt: “Policymakers [should] examine some of the problems brought to the forefront over the past year…to ensure we are rebuilding an economy that works for all Americans throughout the inevitable business cycle.”\nTakeaway: Assuming vaccines remain effective against new variants of the virus, the U.S. economy is likely to recover strongly, propelled by pent-up demand and accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nExcerpt: “It seems likely that the economy will grow rapidly this year … over the next couple of years, we will see the unemployment rate falling back to pre-pandemic levels, with significantly improved labor-force participation rates.”\nTakeaway: The Fed seeks to avoid a prolonged slow recovery, but it’s important to acknowledge that running a so-called “hot” economy for a prolonged period is not without risks. It arguably factored into some of the challenges to financial stability that emerged at the start of the pandemic:\nPrime and tax-exempt money market mutual funds saw rapid outflows, disrupting short-term credit markets.\nMany financial firms experienced a liquidity squeeze that led to a wave of sales of usually liquid Treasury securities, disrupting the Treasury market.\nVarious forbearance for borrowers and banks became necessary, to prevent constriction of the flow of bank credit, which would have exacerbated the economic downturn.\nExcerpt: “The factors underlying these financial market stresses, in my view, must be addressed – to avoid a future repeat of the issues the economy experienced at the start of the pandemic.”\nTakeaway: There are some potential solutions to these structural risks, which should be considered:\nRequire prime and tax-exempt MMMFs to convert to so-called government funds (which invest in short-term U.S. Treasury and agency securities and private debt fully collateralized by such instruments).\nCreate a structure less reliant on broker-dealers’ balance sheets to maintain liquid markets for U.S. Treasury securities.\nEnact a capital regime that’s sufficiently flexible during economic downturns without temporary, special measures (e.g., use a Countercyclical Capital Buffer built up during good times and utilized during downturns).\nExcerpt: “During the economic recovery, policymakers should be diligent about removing these risks to financial stability, which translate into risks for the economy and every firm and worker in it.”\nTakeaway: The Fed’s revised monetary policy framework should support a quicker recovery. In the past, forecasts of returning to full employment at the target inflation rate of 2% would have suggested increases in interest rates. But the median FOMC participant expectation is that short-term rates will remain close to zero through 2023.\n\nExcerpt: “With the revised [framework] adopted by the FOMC, monetary policymakers can be more patient and wait for more tangible signs that inflation has increased, rather than just forecasts, before starting to raise rates.”\nTakeaway: The most recent data on employment is quite consistent with an economy beginning to expand from the constraints of the pandemic. But there are signs of continued strains on the labor market, including reduced labor force participation rates of prime working age men and women.\n\nExcerpt: “With many schools either in a remote or hybrid learning mode, many parents have left the workforce to provide support for their children. … Reduced labor force participation represents a concerning development. While … improving of late, it is still well below the participation rate we saw before the pandemic.”",

            "content": "Six takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s Feb. 19, 2021 remarks\nTakeaway: The COVID-19 vaccines are a very promising development, suggesting a robust economic recovery in the second half of the year, but at present the virus continues to limit individuals’ willingness to leave home.\nExcerpt: “… A more rapid pace of economic activity will be realized only when there are widespread inoculations. Indeed, a successful vaccination rollout by the middle of the summer suggests that by the second half of this year a robust economic recovery should be underway.”\nTakeaway: The pandemic has had significantly divergent impacts on different industries and workers, as sectors that rely on social interaction – like recreation, entertainment, retail, restaurants, travel, and hotels – have been hit hardest. These sectors employ many workers receiving relatively low wages. Many working in these sectors are Black or Hispanic. So these population segments have suffered disproportionately.\nExcerpt: “... The disparate economic outcomes for some individuals and groups during the pandemic have further exacerbated long-standing issues in our economy. […] The uneven nature of this downturn has highlighted the need to rebuild the economy in a more inclusive way.”\nTakeaway: Younger workers and women have also been disproportionately impacted during the downturn. The jobless rate for younger workers is roughly double older workers, under the broader U-6 measure. And the labor force participation rate for women has fallen more sharply, with the differential more pronounced by age.\nExcerpt: “For the younger age groups, women’s labor force participation rates have fallen by over a full percentage point more than men’s labor force participation. The younger age categories are those where families might have child care issues during the pandemic which could cause a parent, likely a woman, to leave the labor force.”\nTakeaway: Despite a potentially difficult road ahead, it is notable that monetary policy remains accommodative, with interest rates at the lower effective bound. Meanwhile, legislators in Washington have already taken significant fiscal policy action and are rightly considering further steps.\nExcerpt: “Importantly, fiscal policy is the most effective option when monetary policy has reached the lower effective bound for interest rates. […] From my perspective, both the monetary and fiscal policy responses have been quite appropriate, given the severity of the public-health-induced economic crisis.”\nTakeaway: As the recovery continues, it isn’t enough for policymakers to focus on the macroeconomic response to the pandemic. The pandemic has shown the importance of finding ways to make work and life better for low-income workers, so the benefits of the eventual recovery are widely shared.\nExcerpt: “The recovery provides us a unique opportunity to ensure that the economic rebuilding process advances a more-inclusive economy. Indeed, the pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of finding ways to improve workforce development, increase workplace flexibility, and revitalize areas where many low-income workers reside.”\nTakeaway: Finding ways during the recovery to raise “job quality” can be a win not only for workers but also for employers seeking to attract and retain talent. We also need to do more to help parents remain in or return to the workforce, including supporting affordable quality early child care and education.\nExcerpt: “I believe that as we think about recovery from the pandemic, we should take the time to look for ways that our economy can be reimagined for the better with what we have learned during this trying period. We should learn from the challenges that the pandemic brought to the forefront – but were simmering even before COVID-19. And we should capitalize on the opportunities that stem from realizing new ways of working and extend them more broadly to benefit more workers – especially those in low- and moderate-wage occupations – along with employers, industries, and local economies.”\nFor more information about Working Places, please visit bostonfed.org/workingplaces.",

            "content": "6 takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s Jan. 12, 2021 remarks\nTakeaway: We enter 2021 with some optimism about the economy. Two effective vaccines for COVID-19 are already being distributed, and we should see broader economic recovery in the medium term.\nExcerpt: “…as the new year dawns, it seems likely that the public health crisis that has inflicted so much damage – on individuals, families, businesses, and the economy generally – will dissipate over the course of this year.”\nTakeaway: The economic outlook remains intertwined with that of virus, and the path to stabilizing the economy hinges on first getting COVID under control.\nExcerpt: “…recent indicators suggest near-term problems stemming from elevated infections and persistent public health concerns. So clearly, the near-term recovery is highly dependent on rapid, widespread vaccination. Unfortunately, to date, the inoculation rate has been disappointing.”\nTakeaway: There are several reasons for optimism about the medium-term outlook, including favorable financial conditions, rising asset prices, and a resilient housing market. Meanwhile, household savings remain elevated.\nExcerpt: “…for those whose incomes were not interrupted (for example, those whose jobs were conducive to working from home, and whose industries were not stalled by the pandemic) there is significant capacity to make expenditures once the pandemic is over. Because consumption is such a large part of the economy, in the second half of the year if vaccinations are widespread, we are likely to see a significant pick up in consumption.”\nTakeaway:  Despite these optimistic signs, the pandemic is likely to continue to be a problem for public health and the economy in the first half of 2021, until widespread vaccinations take hold. Policymakers must be mindful of the deep pain still occurring in many segments of the economy.\nExcerpt: “…many of the economic problems caused by the pandemic have actually been deferred, to date – for example, problems in commercial real estate and the bank loans tied to such property are likely to only be fully revealed later this year.  … Importantly, the disparate economic outcomes we have seen during the pandemic have further highlighted the problems of income inequality that remain a significant challenge.”\nTakeaway: The economy’s resilience can be credited in part to significant fiscal support, and monetary policy actions that reduced interest rates to their lower limit. Support also came from the variety of Fed emergency lending facilities, including the Main Street Lending Program, which was operated from the Boston Fed.\nExcerpt: “Policymakers must continue to find ways to support those…disproportionately and severely impacted by the pandemic. … My personal preference would have been to continue the (Main Street) program through the first half of 2021. The program filled a hole often left unaddressed – support for medium-sized businesses. … The program extended more than $16.5 billion in lending to over 1,800 companies. … The program settled just under 650 loans in the months from July to November, then over 1,150 loans in December alone … with settled loans across 49 states and two U.S. territories. Looking at the industries utilizing the program’s loans suggests some unsurprising areas of need, given the pandemic’s toll on certain industries where social distancing is challenging.”\nTakeaway: Despite the challenges, the Main Street program provided helpful financing and showed the feasibility of marshalling lenders and the public sector to assist hard-to-reach businesses that can survive with the support of a bridge to better times. But, were certain tweaks permitted, the program could have been more impactful.\nExcerpt: “First, with less focus on mitigation of potential loss to the Treasury, much more credit would have been made available. Second, designing the program to have less legal and operational complexity, and structuring the banks’ role differently – for example, as an opportunity to earn fees as long as the loan performed, rather than a 5 percent participation – may have increased the attractiveness of the program for banks. Finally, longer terms and greater ability to refinance would have provided support to medium-sized businesses more akin to what was available to larger companies...",

            "content": "Key takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s Nov. 10 remarks\nTakeaway: Economic shocks happen, but the severity of the consequences depends on how fragile, or susceptible to financial instability, the economy was prior to the shock. In the U.S., excessive risk-taking behavior prior to COVID-19 is likely to delay the recovery, even though the initial response by fiscal and monetary policymakers was a prompt and substantial mitigant.\n\nExcerpts: “Excessive risk-taking during the previous recovery period is, unfortunately, likely to prolong the country’s economic distress – especially for those most disproportionately affected.” “Those economies that go into a recession in more fragile financial condition are likely to experience amplified economic problems that could have been ameliorated with more proactive financial stability steps, taken in advance.”\nTakeaway: The consequences of excessive pre-pandemic risk-taking are seen in the corporate sector, as firms that eventually defaulted after the onset of COVID-19 issued much more debt before the shock. This increased leverage appears to have affected their ability to survive the pandemic downturn.\n\nExcerpt: “Financial factors, including excessive leverage, can influence how severe the consequences of a shock will be, and how painful a recession becomes. Imbalances in the real economy and financial factors accelerating recession dynamics can make the effects of a shock, and the severity of a recession, much worse.”\nTakeaway: Sadly, the impact is tending to be greatest on workers that are least able to adjust and adapt. Workers who are women and minorities may not only be disproportionately impacted by excessive risk-taking by defaulted firms, they are more likely to leave the workforce altogether.\n\nExcerpt: “Those segments of the labor market most affected by amplified business cycles – when financial stability ‘guardrails’ are limited – can be populated by those workers who are most vulnerable and least able to adapt to the changed economic environment. That imbalanced human toll is a bad outcome for democracy as well as the economy.”\nTakeaway: The virus has had a deeper effect in economies that disproportionately involve services, which tend to require more personal interaction than the production and sale of goods. This is because service activities proved to be more affected by the need to social distance.\n\nExcerpt: “In the U.S., consumption of goods now exceeds what was consumed at the beginning of the year, while services consumption remains depressed. Americans have continued remodeling houses and buying durable goods, but things like traveling and recreational activities outside of the home are taking place at a lower rate.”\nTakeaway: This is a time to focus on preventing the buildup of financial imbalances, as many central banks are considering modifying how they respond during shocks. In the U.S., that implies more reluctance to raise interest rates until full employment and 2% inflation are achieved. Rosengren supports these goals, but says they should be accompanied by a more proactive supervisory and financial stability focus.\n\nExcerpts: “Easy monetary policy requires more guardrails protecting against rising financial instability risks. Without financial stability governance and tools, recessions have the potential to be more severe and fall disproportionately on those that can least afford it. And the recessions are likely to be deeper and longer, requiring more fiscal and monetary stimulus than would otherwise be necessary.”  “Instead of pushing the unemployment rate below its natural rate, the focus should be on avoiding the subsequent large spikes of unemployment and slow recovery that occur when the downturn is made worse by a lead-up that involves excessive risk-taking and the associated imbalances, both real and financial.”",

            "content": "Key takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s Oct. 8 remarks\nWatch the recording of the Remarks at the Marburg Memorial Lecture hosted by Marquette University Economics Department.\nTakeaway: The state of the economy as it encounters a shock or downturn – and the health of the financial system – can play important roles in recessionary dynamics, and how the recessionary burden is spread across the economy.\n\nExcerpt: “Highly levered firms and excessive concentrations of commercial real estate lending at some institutions would make the economy more vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including a pandemic or other shock.”\nTakeaway: Many firms increased their leverage as the prevailing low-interest-rate environment provided more capacity to take on debt. This leverage magnifies returns in good times, and losses in bad times.\n\nExcerpt: “In an economic downturn, greater leverage – with its principal and interest repayment demands – may prove problematic for firms, or by extension the economy.”\nTakeaway: Increased risk-taking in the low-interest-rate environment that preceded the current economic downturn will likely make the recovery from the pandemic more difficult.\n\nExcerpt: “Abnormally low rates for a long period during times when economic slack is no longer a concern can result in excessive risk-taking, as businesses and firms take on additional debt and accumulate more risky assets in search of better returns – potentially bidding up asset prices to unsustainable levels. The financial pressures associated with such behavior build gradually, and only become clear in the next economic downturn.”\nTakeaway: Losses due to financial shocks adversely affect a wide range of stakeholders – notably, workers; including those who are least able to endure an economic downturn. A wave of unnecessary bankruptcies resulting from such shocks can cause a spike in job loss and significant scarring of the labor market.\n\nExcerpt: “If the costs for taking on the extra risk were borne only by investors knowingly taking that risk, it might not be so problematic. … [But] a leveraged business is more likely to declare bankruptcy, permanently severing its many formal and informal contracts with customers, suppliers, and employees. … Excessive leverage can exacerbate job losses from temporary demand shocks, and make the recovery process slower and more painful than it would have been without the leverage.”\nTakeaway: An important mechanism that plays a role in recessionary dynamics is the tightening of credit terms and credit availability during an economic downturn. \n\nExcerpt: “In part, the importance of this channel is amplified by a low interest rate environment during the preceding economic expansion when households and firms accumulated loans, oftentimes in real estate.  A prime example in the current downturn is commercial real estate, where the high leverage build-up before the crisis and the severe hit from the crisis have led to a noticeable tightening in credit conditions.”\nTakeaway: In the years preceding the pandemic, Rosengren and others raised questions about the need for accommodative interest rates when the economy was doing well, and emphasized the need to take more precautions against financial stability risks.\n\nExcerpt: “In the United States, we do not have a cohesive set of regulatory and supervisory tools to moderate risk build-ups. And while we do have the Financial Stability Oversight Council, we do not have a regulatory and supervisory body endowed with tools and structures that can be deployed to limit financial stability risks.”",

            "content": "Key takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s Sept. 23 remarks\nTakeaway: Rosengren’s forecast for the economy is less optimistic than his peers for several reasons, including a concern that a second wave of COVID-19 infections this fall and winter is likely. This could cause some states to impose new restrictions on mobility and sap the willingness of consumers to spend and invest.\n\nExcerpt: “The biggest challenge to the economy, and the risk to a more optimistic forecast, continues to be our inability in the U.S. to achieve the public health progress on the virus seen in many other developed countries. … A full recovery probably requires the availability of vaccines and more effective treatments for the virus because until then, many businesses and households are unlikely to return to more normal spending habits.”\nTakeaway: Also, additional support to the economy from fiscal policy is very much needed but seems increasingly unlikely to materialize.\n\nExcerpt: “Additional fiscal policy is probably the more effective tool at this time, since it can directly allocate money to firms and businesses most impacted by COVID-19 without requiring them to take on additional debt.”\nTakeaway: If infection rates increase this fall, financial spillovers from businesses impacted by the virus are likely to become a more significant headwind. For instance, even conservatively underwritten properties will face challenges if consumers are afraid to shop in stores and stay in hotels, and that will also impact the financial institutions that hold their loans.\n\nExcerpt: I worry “about a ‘second shoe dropping’ that will particularly affect small and medium-sized banks, which provide a large share of commercial real estate loans and small business loans. A curtailment of credit resulting from such problems has caused serious headwinds to recoveries in the past, and may be a serious problem going forward.”\nTakeaway: Further improvement in the unemployment rate will be difficult to achieve until disruptions from the virus become less acute. The most likely labor market outcome is continued improvement, but with slower gains.\n\nExcerpt: “Employment still remains below where it was earlier this year, even in industries that have recovered more significantly, so the path for further reemployment will not be easy – particularly if a second wave of infections makes consumers reluctant to participate in activities where social distancing is difficult.”\nTakeaway: Continued monetary stimulus remains necessary, Rosengren says, and the recent Federal Open Market Committee statement indicates the Fed intends to keep interest rates low.\n\nExcerpt: “The statement highlighted that the federal funds rate range is expected to remain at the currently low level until three conditions are met. First, that the economy reaches maximum sustainable employment. Second, that inflation has risen to 2 percent. Third, that inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. These three conditions come with a caveat that no risks emerge that could impede the Fed achieving its dual mandate – such as increased financial instability.”\nTakeaway: The Fed’s Main Street Lending Program can play an important role in the recovery by providing “bridge loans” to support firms that were profitable before the pandemic and expect to be profitable following it. Bridge loans can be scarce during crises for small- and medium-sized firms, and the Fed’s program enables banks to help communities avoid layoffs and bankruptcies by keeping credit flowing to local markets.\n\nExcerpts: “The Federal Reserve recently provided new clarifying FAQs encouraging banks to focus on borrower status both before and after the pandemic when considering whether a borrower is appropriate for the program. We also published an FAQ that clarifies how the loan should be treated by bank supervisors, with all three federal regulators agreeing on the clarification. Hopefully, these developments will encourage some banks to more actively engage with borrowers impacted by the pandemic, using the Main Street program.”",

            "content": "Key Takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s Aug. 12 Remarks\nTakeaway: The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. So, limited or inconsistent efforts by states to control the virus are not only placing citizens at health risk, but are also likely to prolong the economic downturn.\n\nExcerpt: “As long as the virus poses significant threats to public health, a full economic recovery will be very difficult as individuals, often voluntarily, avoid activities that place their health at risk. […] Indeed, the trajectory of the economic recovery will be determined more by the path of the virus than by the path of policymaking, although monetary and fiscal policy can mitigate, and have mitigated, some of the most significant adverse impacts.”\nTakeaway: Despite sizeable interventions by monetary and fiscal policymakers, the economic data indicate that the recovery may be losing steam, as activities in many states are once again restricted, officially or voluntarily, to slow the virus’s spread.\n\nExcerpt: “The forecast for this fall is quite uncertain, but my view is that the recent slowdown in economic activity…is likely to continue. Currently, we have an unemployment rate above 10 percent, and because of the continued community spread of the virus, I am concerned that the pandemic will limit the ability of the economy to recover quickly.”\nTakeaway: States that re-opened early saw a temporary economic benefit, but that gain has been short-lived and came at a cost – including rising rates of infections, which have resulted in less spending more recently.\n\nExcerpt: “Lifting restrictions too quickly hurt both the economy and public health down the road. In the Northeast, where restrictions were more substantial and lasted longer, states are now experiencing both better public health outcomes and more spending in sectors of the economy that are sensitive to social distancing.”\nTakeaway: While both Europe and the U.S. had significant increases in infection rates in the spring, Europe enacted more stringent and longer-term shutdowns and limits, and did not reopen until the virus had reached low levels. Their infection rates fell faster and further, and have remained relatively low, and economic activity has been more robust.\n\nExcerpt: “In contrast, in the United States, infection rates remain elevated, as states lifted protective measures too soon and in a manner not calibrated for the true risks posed by the virus.”\nTakeaway:  Credit interruptions prolong recessions and harm individuals and businesses, so it is important that the Fed stands ready, with the Main Street Lending Program, to facilitate credit flows that can bridge businesses and nonprofits of many sizes, at reasonable rates.\n\nExcerpt: “The program is attractively structured for many facing cash-flow interruptions due to the pandemic, facilitating 5-year loans with no payment of interest in the first year and no payment of principal until the third year. It is attractive for lenders because they can meet the credit needs in their markets while retaining only 5 percent of the loan on their books, with the Federal Reserve taking a 95 percent participation interest in the loan. […] The Fed is aiming to help [entities] that … given the uncertain outlook, might otherwise have difficulty in obtaining credit from a lender that would have to hold 100 percent of the loan. The Main Street program can provide essential financing to help these entities avoid shutting their doors and permanently laying off their employees.”\nTakeaway: Some suggest that the Main Street program’s modest initial activity is evidence of failure, but Rosengren disagrees completely.  The Program is one important way the Fed is doing all it can to support the businesses, nonprofits, and individuals that make up our nation’s economy.\n\nExcerpt: “The numbers seem consistent with a gradual pace of initial activity that is more recently expanding as participants become familiar with the program parameters. […] Loans are contracts between borrowers and banks, and the negotiations for loans can take some time and effort. […] As borrowers and banks have become more familiar with the program, we have seen a steady increase in loans submitted to our portal. There are currently more than $856 million in loans active, with more than $250 million in loans committed or settled. Much of the increase has occurred recently, and I expect we will continue to see more.”",

            "content": "Key Takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s June 19 Remarks\nTakeaway: Ongoing public health concerns have created an unusually complex employment situation, with U.S. unemployment at 13.3 percent, up dramatically from February in all age cohorts. But a return to work by more people is good news only if can be done safely and on a sustained basis.\n\nExcerpt: “If workplaces reopen without the necessary health precautions, the recent increases in payroll employment could be offset by possible business closures and serious health outcomes later. … If reopening can be done in ways that protect public health, then better outcomes now will also translate to better outcomes in the future.”\nTakeaway: The economic rebound in the second half of the year is likely to be less than what was hoped for at the outset of the pandemic, due to the continued community spread of COVID-19 and the acceleration of new cases in many states. In addition, more fiscal and monetary policy support will likely be needed.\n\nExcerpt: \"I expect the unemployment rate to still be at double-digit levels at the end of the year, given what are likely to be persistent economic headwinds from the pandemic over the second half of the year. And my own more pessimistic forecast does not fully incorporate the challenges of a second wave of the virus.\nTakeaway: The economic toll of the virus is closely tied to how well the U.S. can get the public health pandemic under control, but efforts to date have not been particularly successful. A more rapid and complete economic recovery requires better ability to contain the pandemic.\n\nExcerpt: “If there are significant flare-ups in states that have aggressively reopened, the reduction in social distancing that contributes to stronger economic performance in such states now may translate to more depressed economic activity and increased public health issues in those states in the future. … Given the death toll of the virus even with the economic lockdown, I see a substantial risk in reopening too fast and relaxing social distancing too much.”\nTakeaway: In two of the past three recessions, lending conditions tightened significantly and restricted the supply of credit. The Federal Reserve created the Main Street Lending Program to facilitate the flow of credit to small to medium-sized businesses.\n\nExcerpt: “The Fed will participate in the lending by purchasing a 95 percent interest in the loan. … By purchasing this percentage of the loans, the Federal Reserve will take on most of the risk that would otherwise need to be absorbed solely by lenders, and will create additional balance sheet capacity for lenders to extend more loans at this challenging time for our country’s economy.”\nTakeaway: Recent changes to the Main Street Lending Program made it even more widely attractive for more borrowers, allowing more small and medium-sized business to receive loans.\n\nExcerpt: “Our hope is that this program will, over time, provide an important source of liquidity for small and medium-sized businesses that might otherwise not receive credit on the same terms. In addition, it provides an important backstop should the pandemic be more severe than anticipated this fall.”\nTakeaway: The Main Street Lending Program is off to a positive start. The registration and verification process for possible lenders in the program opened on Monday, and as of Thursday, more than 200 financial institutions, large and small, had initiated registration.\n\nExcerpt: “These are still early days in the program, and we are seeing a steady stream of interest … We encourage lenders who have not yet registered to explore the program. … Lenders have a vested interest in the resilience of the businesses in their market, and this program gives them a way to help bridge those businesses that were sound before the pandemic to better days.”",

            "content": "Key Takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s May 19 Remarks\nTakeaway: The absolutely necessary response to the COVID-19 pandemic – social distancing, aimed at protecting lives – comes at a high economic cost. The recent employment report underscores the unprecedented speed and ferocity with which jobs have been affected by this public health crisis.\n\nExcerpt: “I expect that the unemployment rate will likely peak at close to 20 percent. Unfortunately, even by the end of the year, I expect the unemployment rate to remain at double-digit levels. This outlook is both sobering and a call to action. Now is the time for both monetary and fiscal policy to act boldly to minimize the economic pain from the pandemic.”\nTakeaway: It is important that our progress to date not be undone, and simply allowing business to reopen is not a panacea. Our economic challenges are rooted in public health concerns. If consumers are not comfortable visiting restaurants and shops, relaxing restrictions may do little to bring back business and jobs.\n\nExcerpt: “Public health solutions are paramount – without them, it will be virtually impossible to return to full employment. It is vital that the design and timing of reductions in business restrictions not result in worse health outcomes and higher unemployment over a longer period of time.”\nTakeaway: The Fed has taken strong actions to mitigate the economic consequences of the pandemic. We want to limit the potential for medium- and longer-term “scarring” from the crisis. This means, among other things, working to minimize the length of unemployment spells and ensuring solvent firms have necessary liquidity.\n\nExcerpt: “Preventing bouts of financial instability from having significant spillovers to the flow of credit to consumers and businesses is a vital crisis role for central banks, and the Fed has aggressively played that role during this very challenging period.”\nTakeaway: It is important to note that the powers granted to the Federal Reserve for emergency actions involve “lending, not spending.” All of the Fed’s programs involve loans, to be repaid – they are not grants by the Fed.\n\nExcerpt: “Lending can play a crucial role in a crisis and in bridging to more normal conditions.”\nTakeaway: The Main Street Lending Program, expected to open in the coming weeks at the Boston Fed, is one of the Federal Reserve’s more innovative and important programs. It is designed to help credit flow to small- and medium-sized businesses that were in good financial condition prior to the crisis, but now need loans that can help them until they have recovered from, or adapted to, the impact of the pandemic.\n\nExcerpt: “This is an important program, and we’ve worked very hard to get it right. We listened carefully to initial feedback and expanded the program in a number of ways to serve a wider range of borrowers. It will not be able to assist everyone, but we expect that it will provide an important bridge for many businesses that employ much of the American workforce.”\nTakeaway: How we respond to this public health crisis will greatly influence whether many of these temporary job losses become permanent. As Fed policymakers, we will continue to vigilantly pursue ways to help the economy return to full employment.\n\nExcerpt: “The economic shock is an unprecedented challenge for economic policymakers including the Federal Reserve, where we will do whatever we can to support a return to full employment and stable prices – our mandate from Congress – and our commitment to financial stability, which is important to the well-being of all Americans.”",

In many respects, [he] provided a prescient preview of many of the actions ultimately taken by global central banks during the Financial Crisis.”\nTakeaway: Goodfriend suggested that negative interest rates might be an effective policy tool in some situations – but Rosengren remains skeptical, saying the experience in Europe and Japan shows the adverse side effects are likely quite large.\n\nExcerpt: “In my view, negative interest rates poorly position an economy to recover from a downturn. … I view the recent experience of countries with negative rates as evidence that such a policy would not be particularly successful in stimulating economic activity. … [Also,] we need banks to be healthy enough to provide credit and liquidity in challenging economic times.”\nTakeaway: Goodfriend foresaw that the equilibrium real rate of interest might fall to a very low level. This has significantly diminished the “space” for monetary policy to operate before hitting the effective lower bound.\n\nExcerpt: “If the economic reaction to the coronavirus does result in the funds rate falling to its effective lower bound, [the observed] heightened sensitivity of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate to adverse news raises the possibility that the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate could follow close behind. … As a result, there would be little room for the Federal Reserve to lower rates through large purchases of long-term Treasury securities – like it did to make conditions more accommodative in and after the Great Recession – if a recession occurred in this rate environment. Such a situation would raise challenges policymakers did not face even during the Great Recession.”\nTakeaway: In a situation where both short-term interest rates and 10-year Treasury rates approach the zero lower bound, allowing the Federal Reserve to purchase a broader range of assets could be important.\n\nExcerpt: “In such a case, as Marvin highlighted in his 1999 article, we should allow the central bank to purchase a broader range of securities or assets. Such a policy, however, would require a change in the Federal Reserve Act. … Alternatively, the Federal Reserve could consider a facility that could buy a broader set of assets, provided the Treasury agreed to provide indemnification.”\nTakeaway: In a low-rate environment, an alternative to using monetary policy to stimulate the economy during a downturn is depending on fiscal policy to shoulder a greater share of the burden.\n\nExcerpt: “Somewhat surprisingly, there seems to be little movement toward making [fiscal] automatic stabilizers more prominent, or preparing to invest significantly more in the sorts of public investment projects that yield positive returns.\"\nTakeaway: Policymakers dealing with challenges should seek to emulate the boldness and imagination Marvin Goodfriend showed two decades ago.\n\nExcerpt: “In 1999, Marvin Goodfriend was able to consider what had not occurred in the recent past, and contemplate bold alternatives. Over the next few years, that type of vision and boldness will be needed by all policymakers if we have to consider how policy should react to any large, adverse shock to the economy.”",

            "content": "4 takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren’s Jan. 13 remarks to the Connecticut Business & Industry Association in Hartford, Conn.\nTakeaway: As 2020 begins, Fed policymakers anticipate an “almost ideal” economic outcome: inflation returning to target, labor markets remaining strong, and economic growth close to potential. But possible risks to this benign forecast are also worth watching.\n\nExcerpt: “As a practical matter, central bankers do not have much historical experience with extended periods where interest rates are running below the estimated equilibrium level while unemployment rates are, simultaneously, historically low. So we want to be alert to any potential risks emerging. …If these risks remain contained, my view is we will likely have another year of good economic outcomes.”\nTakeaway: One potential risk is that inflationary pressures could build at a faster pace than expected, should labor markets tighten to unsustainable levels. The extent to which we see this inflation risk materialize may depend on how willing or able firms are to absorb rising labor costs, as wages respond to low unemployment.\n\nExcerpt: “More rapid than expected inflation remains a risk of running the economy with accommodative monetary policy and tight labor markets.” \nTakeaway: Another potential risk is that low interest rates could lead consumers and firms to seek higher returns, or “reach for yield,” by taking on riskier investments. This could increase asset prices to unsustainable levels, which ultimately could threaten financial stability. Given its history, the real estate sector is worth watching closely in this regard.\n\nExcerpt: “It is important to see and understand the risk that sustained low interest rates could place more pressure on real estate asset prices through reach-for-yield behavior – a scenario that preceded the 1990 and 2007 recessions. In certain scenarios, financial stability risks could potentially emerge as a problem for the otherwise benign forecast.”\nTakeaway: Monetary policy is currently accommodative, while forecasts for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation remain favorable, and stable. So it’s not surprising that the median forecast for interest rates is “no change” for this year and gradual increases over the next two years.\n\nExcerpt: “Certainly, the lack of inflationary pressure to date has provided one justification for accommodative monetary policy despite the duration of the recovery and a current historically low unemployment rate. However, maintaining interest rates below the consensus longer-run ‘equilibrium’ interest rate is predicated on both inflationary pressures not building up and financial stability concerns being contained.”",

            "content": "Takeaway: The economy is currently in a good place – having performed pretty much as professional forecasters expected, despite recent concerns about the risks presented by slower global growth and uncertainty about trade policy.\n\nExcerpt: “The U.S. economy is quite solid, and barring an unexpected adverse shock, my view is that the economy is currently well positioned for the coming year. …Labor markets are strong, inflation is moving to target, and growth is likely to be somewhat above potential.”\nTakeaway: An economic downturn is unlikely in 2020, given generally positive economic conditions and the continuation of accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, and assuming no significant negative shock.\n\nExcerpt: “With both fiscal and monetary policy being accommodative, financial conditions supportive, and recent data positive, I agree with the surveyed professional forecasters that the likelihood of a recession in 2020 is relatively low. However, a low probability does not mean it cannot happen, and certainly a negative shock from abroad or a significant flare up in trade disputes could change the outlook significantly.”\nTakeaway: Unemployment will likely fluctuate narrowly around its current rate of 3.5 percent in 2020, and inflation will be close to the Fed’s 2 percent target.\n\nExcerpt: “In early 2019, core PCE inflation was lower than expected. However, most forecasters continue to believe that shortfall reflected temporary factors – and thus they expect the core PCE … to remain close to the Fed’s 2 percent target in 2020. My own forecast is quite similar. I expect that given the strong labor market, core PCE inflation should move in a narrow range around the 2 percent target.”\nTakeaway: The economy has grown at close to a 2 percent annual rate over the past two quarters, as strength in households has offset weaknesses in business investment. That pattern is likely to continue, as consumer spending is bolstered by job creation and increases in personal income and wealth.\n\nExcerpt: “Trends in the saving rate and household wealth (net worth) … also highlight why the consumer is well positioned to spend. … Plentiful jobs and growth in income have provided improvements in confidence and bode well for holiday sales and beyond.”\nTakeaway: Barring a material change in the outlook, additional policy easing is likely unnecessary in the near term.\n\nExcerpt: “Given that monetary policy works with lags, and Federal Reserve policymakers have already eased monetary policy three times in 2019, my view is that it is appropriate to take a patient approach to considering any policy changes, unless there is a material change to the outlook.”",

            "content": "Takeaway: It is important at this stage of the business cycle to assess whether our economies are prepared for a hypothetical next downturn, and consider whether policymakers have built sufficient resilience into the financial system.\n\nExcerpt: “One significant difference between now and previous cycles is the low level of interest rates in the United States, Germany, and Japan. […]  The low interest rate environment that many developed countries face requires policymakers to re-examine other economic buffers.”\nTakeaway: One effect of the low interest rate environment is that monetary policy buffers are diminished. For instance, in the event of a hypothetical downturn, policymakers have little room to try to stimulate the economy by reducing short-term rates.\n\nExcerpt: “Given the current diminished monetary policy buffer, recessions may be deeper and recoveries slower than what we have experienced historically, unless additional buffers are provided by fiscal, regulatory, and financial stability policies and deemed appropriate to utilize by policymakers.”\nTakeaway: The diminished capacity of monetary policy to offset shocks implies policymakers also need to carefully examine regulatory and financial stability tools. But the policies and tools that may have been appropriate during a downturn in a high interest rate environment are not likely to be sufficient in a low interest rate environment.\n\nExcerpt: “For several reasons, a low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to exit recessions. This difficulty is due not just to the smaller monetary policy buffer, but also to the fact that a low interest rate environment encourages greater household and firm leverage that will amplify the severity of a downturn, should it occur.”\nTakeaway: Steps that increase capital would put banks in a better position to handle an economic downturn, and hopefully, better-capitalized banks would help compensate for limited monetary and fiscal policy buffers.\n\nExcerpt: “I am not sure that recent developments and proposals in bank regulation properly reflect the risks we are likely to face in a low interest rate environment that challenges bank profitability and provides less by way of monetary policy buffers. Specifically, capital buffers should be rising now so that there is more room for them to decline if the economy falters. While this is true for the United States, it may be even more true in Japan and Europe.”\nTakeaway: In a low interest rate environment, corporations and households have more incentive to add debt. Meanwhile, a greater global willingness to pursue higher yields creates a ready market for highly leveraged loans. This excessive leverage could amplify the economic problems that arise in a downturn.\n\nExcerpt: “I believe U.S. policymakers would do well to explore ways that policies could be used to prevent the buildup of leverage in a low-rate environment, hopefully reducing the macroeconomic spillover that could result from over-levered households and firms.”",

            "content": "Takeaway: The economy faces elevated risks, including trade disruptions and geopolitical concerns. But overall, the economy is close to where many policymakers expected it would be, with the U.S. at full employment and inflation trending toward the Fed’s target.\n\nExcerpt: “Overall, then, the economy has evolved about as expected, despite the unanticipated increase in tariffs and the slower growth of exports and business fixed investment. Moreover, recent monetary policy easing is likely to provide some stimulus over the next several quarters. … In sum, the U.S. economy is now very close to meeting the Fed’s Congressional mandate of full employment and stable prices (which we define as 2 percent inflation).”\nTakeaway: Strong consumer spending – bolstered by plentiful jobs, growth in personal income, and increases in household wealth – has fueled the U.S. economic expansion. The key question is, will consumption continue to offset other challenges?\n\nExcerpt: “Sustaining growth at potential depends on the U.S. consumer continuing to offset the weakness we are seeing in exports and business fixed investment. … While U.S. consumers have been resilient to date, continued resilience is not guaranteed. So it is important to consider whether the economy can continue on its quite favorable path – with growth around potential, tight labor markets, and inflation near the Fed’s target of 2 percent.”\nDespite risks to growth, policymakers can afford to be patient and evaluate incoming data before further cutting interest rates. Right now, more cuts don’t appear needed, as many forecasters expect growth close to potential – and policy is already accommodative.\n\nExcerpt: “My forecast for the economy does not envision additional easing being necessary. However, should risks materialize and economic growth slow materially, to below the potential rate, I would be prepared to support aggressive easing… To me, it seems appropriate to continue to closely monitor incoming data to determine if the forecast of growth around potential is likely to be achieved, or if the risks I have outlined are indeed materializing.”\nTakeaway: Regarding financial indicators, many see the decline in 10-year Treasury bond yields as a sign of an impending slowdown, but an alternative explanation is that low foreign long-term rates are leading to lower U.S. rates. Other financial indicators run counter to worries about a slowdown, including robust stock prices and the restrained spread between corporate and Treasury bond yields.\n\nExcerpt: “Very low (and in some cases negative) foreign long-term rates are playing a role in pushing down U.S. long rates, as foreign investors move money from low-rate economies into the (relatively) high-rate U.S. markets, pushing down U.S. yields. … Other financial indicators do not portend a significant slowdown.”\nTakeaway: There are risks to “easing too much,” or lowering interest rates too aggressively. One risk involves unintended consequences of chasing higher returns or “reaching-for-yield.” \n\nExcerpt: “While the risks to the global and U.S. economies remain, there are also risks to easing too aggressively, as I’ve highlighted in previous speeches. Ever-lower interest rates could encourage reaching-for-yield behavior at exactly the wrong stage of the economic cycle. This remains an important consideration factoring into my views on the elements policymakers must weigh and balance at this complex time for our economy.”",

            "content": "Takeaway: The central bank’s monetary policy stance is already accommodative, whether the Fed Funds rate is judged relative to inflation or relative to its long-run neutral level.\n\nExcerpt: “Yet, it is notable that the federal funds futures market is pricing in a significant probability of another decrease by year end. The market apparently believes the economy needs added stimulus to continue the expansion. My own view is different.”\nTakeaway: The economic data suggest continued expansion. The national unemployment rate is currently at 3.7 percent – very low by historical standards. And inflation is moving toward the Fed’s 2 percent target.\n\nExcerpt: “Current economic conditions are quite favorable, and stable, and private forecasters expect those conditions to remain quite similar through the end of the year. […] The data we have in hand suggest instead that the recovery would continue apace even with little monetary policy accommodation. […] In my view, with inflation near target, this level of accommodation is not needed.”\nTakeaway: Risks to the economic outlook are of concern, to be sure. The trade dispute with China is having an impact on both the U.S. and global economies. Still, growth near its estimated sustainable rate is continuing.\n\nExcerpt: “Even with these trade-related impediments, real GDP grew 2 percent in the second quarter, a bit above my estimate of its sustainable rate. And economic forecasts, which incorporate the effects of tariffs and slower global growth on the U.S. economy, expect growth to continue in real terms at close to 2 percent.”\nTakeaway: Responding to the risks to the outlook with too much monetary accommodation entails costs, and introduces risks of its own. One such risk is the potential build-up of economic instability as households and firms respond to lower interest rates by taking on too much debt.\n\nExcerpt: “The current situation involves pushing rates lower when asset prices, and in particular some risky asset prices, already seem inflated. I don’t see current financial risks as causing a downturn, but such conditions have the potential to amplify a downturn should it occur. […] Additional accommodation is not needed for an economy where labor markets are already tight – and risks further inflating the prices of riskier assets, and encouraging households and firms to take on what may be too much leverage.”\nTakeaway: The costs of credit conditions that are too accommodative can appear in unexpected places. One potential financial stability risk has to do with an evolving market model of co-working spaces in many major urban office markets.\n\nExcerpt: “This is an important time in the cycle to be thinking about structures and situations that could challenge financial stability in a downturn. The combination of reaching for yield with runnable liabilities is a common problem in financial stability situations. It’s important to think about the potential for runs on commercial real estate stemming from a situation where short-term leases might not be renewed in recession, and long-term leases are no longer economically viable. Interest rates play into the situation, as low rates potentially lead to a reach for yield, and building owners are more willing to lease to SPEs to get higher returns (rents) at a time when capitalization rates are quite low.”",

            "content": "Takeaway: It was an eventful August in the financial markets amid talk of additional tariffs and tax cuts, the falling 10-year Treasury rate, and volatility in stock prices. But the economic data and forecasts indicate a relatively good domestic economy.\n\nExcerpt: “Despite these headline-grabbing swings in financial conditions, domestic economic conditions have remained relatively benign.\nThe economy grew by 2 percent in the second quarter.\nThe unemployment rate reached nearly a 50-year low of 3.6 percent in April and currently stands at 3.7 percent.\nInflation, as measured by the PCE price index, is running below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.”\nTakeaway: The financial market gyrations – during a time of relatively strong U.S. economic conditions – seem to be explained by increased concerns about risks for the U.S. economy from international trade disruptions and other geopolitical situations.\n\nExcerpt: “Potential trade disruptions are emerging at a time when many U.S. trading partners are facing mounting economic challenges. … China is heavily reliant on trade, so trade restrictions will take a bite out of the country’s economic activity. … Japan, South Korea, and many European economies are even more dependent on trade than the U.S., and face a number of unusual challenges of their own.”\nTakeaway: An inverted yield curve – when long-term yields fall below short-term yields – is often seen to portend an economic downturn. But this view is not being echoed in equity markets, bond spreads, or economic forecasts. And this time, the inversion is being driven by the decline in longer-term rates, rather than policy actions to raise short-term rates.\n\nExcerpt: “An alternative explanation is that the inverted yield curve reflects challenging economic conditions in other countries … This provides an incentive for foreign investors to buy U.S. government securities. … But such an increase in demand pushes the price of U.S. securities up, and yields down.”\nTakeaway: Policymakers shouldn’t be overconfident the economy will be just fine or that an economic downturn is inevitable. The data bear watching closely for signs of risks materializing, to determine if any policy adjustments are necessary to achieve the Fed’s mandate.\n\nExcerpt: Should those risks materialize, and threaten the U.S. outlook, then “the appropriate monetary policy would be to ease aggressively. However, to date, these elevated risks have not become reality, at least for the U.S. economy.”\nTakeaway: Economic forecasts and the underlying data are consistent with a U.S. economy growing slightly above its potential rate. Continued strong consumption is key to that outlook – and has been offsetting weaknesses in other components of GDP.\n\nExcerpt: “If the consumer continues to spend, and global conditions do not deteriorate further, the economy is likely to grow around 2 percent, in part because the underpinnings of consumption growth – household income growth and household wealth – remain strong, and consumption accounts for about 70 percent of GDP in the U.S.”",

The Fed has also taken steps to increase transparency, which improves accountability.\n\nExcerpt: “…Increased transparency at the Fed has included clarifying annually our strategy of long-term goals and objectives, and adopting an explicit inflation target of 2 percent. What’s more, increased transparency around goals makes it easier for the public and Congress to evaluate how well the Fed’s actions are performing relative to those goals.”\nTakeaway: Studies focused on central bank independence have found countries with more independent central banks, such as the U.S., have lower inflation rates than those with less independent central banks.\n\nExcerpt: “With greater clarity on goals, and more transparency and communication around how policymakers alter policy to achieve those goals, there has been considerable success in changing the inflation experience. … The high and variable inflation of the 1970s has been replaced by a low and remarkably stable rate of inflation since the early 1990s.”\nTakeaway: It is possible that the goals of the U.S. central bank (which center on attaining medium-run economic prosperity) can differ substantially from the understandably shorter-term pressures facing elected officials.\n\nExcerpt: “Allowing the central bank the independence to alter its instruments as it deems necessary in the short- to medium-run reduces the possibility that political or partisan pressures will divert the central bank from its mandated monetary policy goals.”\nTakeaway: The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework has changed significantly over the past 50 years, in response to evolving conditions. This ability to dynamically change the implementation of monetary policy is a critical aspect of independence.\n\nExcerpt: “For a central bank to prove the value of its tactical independence, it needs to evolve with changes in the economy and explain clearly why its policies are consistent with achieving the overarching mandate from the peoples’ elected representatives.”\nTakeaway: There are many analogies to central bank independence in modern life. We ask people to act our behalf, with independence, all the time.\n\nExcerpt: “For example, lots of very smart people leave it to commercial airline pilots to get them to their destination, plotting the best course and flying the plane through any emergencies. But we expect the pilots to keep us informed, too.”",

In addition, because of the global reach of the largest Japanese banks, the problems were essentially exported, as Japanese banks pulled back on foreign lending in order to bring assets better in line with their shrunken capital. Essentially, Japanese banks reduced their global footprint.\"\nTakeaway: Effective use of macroprudential tools – that is, banking regulations aimed at mitigating financial-system risk – could have lessened the crisis in Japan. Unfortunately, it wasn't until the financial crisis of 2008 that countries began to work on improving macroprudential policies.\n\nExcerpt: \"…my own view is that with effective implementation of macroprudential policies, many of the issues would have been substantially mitigated.\"\nTakeaway: Bank stress tests and the use of a countercyclical capital buffer (or CCyB) are two macroprudential tools that emerged from the financial crisis which could have reduced the severity of the banking crisis in Japan.\n\nExcerpt: \"Rigorous stress tests would have revealed emerging problems, required retention of more bank capital, and discouraged aggressive lending. A CCyB would similarly have brought about a larger capital cushion to absorb shocks, which would have reduced the need for such dramatic shrinkage of lending when asset prices declined.\"\nTakeaway: The Japanese banking system is again being affected by adverse economic conditions. Like the U.S., Japan might benefit from considering an expanded set of macroprudential tools.\n\nExcerpt: \"Despite the passage of time and adoption of better policies, one could argue that the Japanese banking system is now, once again, being threatened by adverse economic conditions. A shrinking population, aging demographics, and very low interest rates provide very little room for Japanese banks to operate profitably. This of course provides an incentive to reach for yield, potentially implying additional risk-taking. …All this raises questions about how resilient the banking system is, or could be, in the face of some future global downturn.\"",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "In remarks on Tuesday, Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren explored the current economic environment, characterized by low unemployment and lower-than-target inflation – which are somewhat opposing signals for monetary policymakers. “The Fed’s dual mandate from Congress had not posed this type of conflict in the early years after the global financial crisis, as unemployment had been undesirably high and inflation somewhat low. Both implied the need for monetary stimulus. But today, the two elements of the Fed’s mandate are sending opposing signals for monetary policy, with low unemployment perhaps suggesting a bit tighter policy, and low inflation the opposite.”\nRosengren described the economy as displaying a sounder footing than it was at the start of 2019. He expects the unemployment rate to fall even further. “Equity markets declined significantly in the fourth quarter of last year, but had largely recovered prior to recent events. Other concerns – for example, worries about foreign growth slowing as a result of Brexit, and about the Chinese economy faltering – appear to have subsided since the beginning of the year. And first-quarter growth in the U.S. was stronger than many forecasters expected.”\nRosengren believes there is no clear need to alter the current stance of monetary policy in the near term. “I see no clarion call to alter current policy in the near term. I view current policy as slightly accommodative and likely to be consistent with inflation returning to the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target over time.”\nClearly there are challenges associated with regularly undershooting inflation, including a resulting decline in inflation expectations that have proven difficult to reverse in other areas, said Rosengren. “While policy should not overreact to temporary inflation misses from the Fed’s target, it would not be desirable to continue consistently undershooting inflation. Regularly undershooting could cause inflation expectations to decline, a process that has been shown to be difficult to reverse in other developed areas, including Japan and Europe.”\nA prominent downside risk – more disruptive trade negotiations – is another reason for policymaker patience, although Rosengren’s forecast assumes resolution of the U.S.-China trade dispute and projects the uncertainly it has created will be temporary and have only a modest effect on the economy. “For now, I am optimistically assuming that both sides in the trade negotiations will work to reach an agreement. I am also assuming that while the uncertainty is not helpful, it will be transitory, and thus have only a modest effect on the forecast for the U.S. economy overall.”\nRosengren says it’s worth discussing whether the Fed should aim for somewhat above-target inflation during recoveries, knowing it will likely undershoot the target during downturns. “Such an approach would not change the Fed’s inflation target over the cycle. Rather, it might reinforce the notion that policymakers aim to achieve 2 percent inflation on average, not allowing long periods of below-2 percent inflation to reset inflation expectations below the 2 percent inflation goal.”",

            "content": "Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren spoke Monday at Davidson College in North Carolina.\nKey takeaways from Rosengren’s remarks:\nThe economy is doing well, but the inflation rate remains below the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nBelow-target inflation and a low interest rate environment limit policymakers’ “room to maneuver” in the event of an economic downturn.\nA more firmly ingrained inflation target would help – for example, the Fed could aim to achieve its inflation target on average over the economic cycle.\nIn addition to the limited room for short-term rate cuts, an alternative tool – influencing long-term rates – is also constrained.\nWith the economy doing well, it’s a good time to consider if changes to the Fed’s policy framework could provide “policy space” for action in a hypothetical future downturn.\nIn hindsight, Rosengren said, the Fed’s 2 percent target has acted more like a ceiling than a symmetric target. Still, below-target inflation factors into current policy: “One reason for the policy committee’s decision to be patient in determining future rate adjustments, despite tight labor markets, is waiting to see more convincing evidence that inflation will achieve and sustain the 2 percent inflation target.”\nRosengren said the below-target inflation and low interest rate environment would give monetary policy-makers little space to maneuver in a hypothetical next recession. In each of the last three downturns, the Fed has lowered short-term rates by more than 5 percentage points. Today, rates are well below that level, which implies policymakers today “now have much less latitude to use short-term rates to counter a recession.”  \nRosengren said there are various ways the inflation target could be more firmly ingrained. One would be for the Fed to “aim to achieve its inflation target on average over the economic cycle. This would allow the inflation rate to move within a rangecentered around its target.” The Fed could offset an undershoot of the inflation target during recessions by overshooting the target during recoveries. By keeping inflation expectations stable and creating space for policy to act, in sum, inflation averaging would “make the extent of recessions less severe.”\nPolicymakers aren’t limited to cutting short-term rates as their only policy tool: Central banks can purchase longer-term assets to reduce their rates, using the central bank’s balance sheet. But Rosengren noted that long-term yields are already close to zero in Germany and Japan. The U.S. 10-year Treasury rate provides policymakers with more space to act, but it’s still low by historical standards. “So this other monetary policy tool – influencing long-term rates – would also have limited power to respond to a hypothetical economic downturn,” Rosengren said. He added, “if we want to have more capacity to lower long-term rates in recessions without increasing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, policymakers may wish to hold more short-term securities in good times.”\n“Now is a good time to reflect on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework,” Rosengren concluded, referring to a process that is underway. “Both the U.S. and many developed economies are likely to be challenged by the implications of a low interest rate environment for our ability to offset recessions.”\nRosengren was speaking at Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina, delivering the 33rd Cornelson Distinguished Lecture sponsored by the economics department.

            "content": "Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren explored misconceptions about the Fed’s balance sheet – the assets the central bank holds, and the liabilities and capital used to finance those assets – in a speech in Hong Kong.\nRosengren disagreed with the view that the market turbulence at the end of 2018 was caused by the Fed’s ongoing balance sheet reduction.\nHe also said “it is unrealistic to expect the Fed’s balance sheet to return to the size it was before the financial crisis,” as some have suggested, because factors not related to monetary policy impact the balance sheet’s growth.\nRosengren also emphasized that central banks may need to turn to balance sheet tools to stimulate the economy during the next recession, given a low-rate environment with limited room to reduce rates before they reach zero.\nHe described the Fed’s post-crisis approach to monetary policy implementation as requiring a larger balance sheet.\nRosengren said there seems to be little correlation between equity market movements and the relatively small and steady decline in the Fed’s balance sheet. Markets recovered in early 2019 despite little change in the magnitude of the balance sheet’s “still quite gradual” run-off. “In my view, concerns about the international economy, potential trade disputes, and a U.S. government shutdown are much more plausible explanations for the financial market turbulence.”  \nGrowth in the Fed’s balance sheet, said Rosengren, is not solely related to monetary policy actions, as many assume. Growing liabilities not primarily determined by monetary policy are important too – such as currency, and Treasury deposits. “Part of the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet occurs as a normal consequence of a growing economy with a growing need for currency, a factor not related to monetary policy action.” Simply put, “the change in currency holdings alone highlights that the Fed’s balance sheet will not be able to shrink to earlier levels.”  He also noted that relative to GDP, the U.S. balance sheet is actually small compared to those of central banks in many other developed countries. Overall, “it is a mistake to focus primarily on the size of the balance sheet, with much less attention placed on the quantity of bank reserves and the duration of the assets being held.”\nLooking ahead, Rosengren explored how the balance sheet could be used to stimulate the economy in a hypothetical downturn. It may well be that many central banks have little room to reduce short-term rates. This will likely generate an increased need to utilize the balance sheet as a stimulative tool. “In my view, monetary policymakers should give more consideration to structuring the balance sheet to provide more leeway for policy measures to be taken when the next economic downturn occurs.” To that end, he said that lowering the duration of securities held as assets may be an important goal as part of the normalization process, and “would give the Federal Reserve the flexibility to take the policy step of lengthening the maturity of its balance sheet assets the next time a significant economic downturn occurs.”\nRosengren also noted the Federal Reserve’s recent statements on policy implementation and balance sheet normalization. The Fed anticipates an ample supply of reserves (which are a balance sheet liability) to avoid volatility, and a floor system of administered rates controlling the level of the Federal Funds Rate.\nRosengren concluded by saying it is important for policymakers to continue to study how balance sheet operations influence the economy – “and I dare say it is important for market observers, lawmakers, and the public to become more comfortable with the benefits of central banks using their balance sheet tools to pursue the public interest.”\nRosengren was speaking at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference, in Hong Kong.",

            "content": "Eric Rosengren, the Boston Fed president, on Tuesday offered up a “relatively strong forecast” for the economy in 2019: growth somewhat above 2 percent, inflation close to the Fed’s 2 percent target, and a labor market that continues to tighten.\nHowever, “risks to that outlook have increased recently,” he said, in a talk focused on assessing and managing those risks.\nThe fourth quarter of 2018 featured drops in stock indices, rising stock volatility, falling oil prices, dropping long Treasury rates, and widening credit spreads.\nBut “after the calendar turned to 2019, many financial markets recovered smartly.”\n“However, many of the underlying global growth issues that generated the recent spate of financial-market concerns are as yet unresolved,” Rosengren observed. These issues include slowing growth in China and Europe, constraints on international trade, the potential for Brexit-generated challenges, and problems at some European banks.\nWhile there has been some recovery in equity prices, financial markets continue to price in downside risks to the economy. This is most obvious in longer Treasury rates and wider credit spreads, consistent with the ongoing risks posed by slower global growth.\nIt remains to be seen if signs of economic weakness at the end of 2018 reflect an underlying slowdown, or were a response to “temporary concerns that may fade.”\n“There is some risk that more pronounced slowdowns in the rest of the world could dampen U.S. growth more than I am forecasting,” said Rosengren.\nWhile labor markets are tight and wage pressures are rising, inflation is so far quite well behaved. And “earlier concerns that the economy might overheat in a number of ways seem somewhat less pressing at this juncture,” he added.\n“Together these factors are sufficient to justify a pause in the recent monetary tightening cycle,” said Rosengren. “In the face of heightened risks, policymakers can be patient,” waiting to better discern the direction of the economy before taking further monetary policy action.\nRosengren was speaking before the National Association of Corporate Directors, New England Chapter, in Boston.",

At this juncture, with two very different scenarios implied by market volatility and by economic forecasts, “I believe we can wait for greater clarity before adjusting policy.”\n“There should be no particular bias toward raising or lower rates until the data more clearly indicate the path for” economic growth. “Monetary policy should not be on a set course, but rather should take into account and reflect how the real economic data unfold.”\n“If the pessimism evident in financial markets eventually shows through to economic outcomes, there would be less need—and perhaps no need—for further increases in interest rates,” Rosengren said. “However, my current expectation is that the more optimistic view will prevail, with economic outcomes consistent with the more upbeat forecasts” – given factors like robust labor markets and strong consumer confidence.\nBut in sum, “the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy seems appropriate for now, and can patiently observe future economic developments,” Rosengren said.\nEric Rosengren was speaking to the Boston Economic Club.",

Either of these outcomes might necessitate a more forceful monetary policy response by the Fed, putting at risk the continued expansion.\n“The history of rapid rate increases in the U.S. suggests that such a risk is real, and as a result my preference for a strategy that allows a continued, but gradual, pace of monetary tightening,” he said.\nRosengren considered a number of global risks, including tariffs, problems in emerging markets, and a potentially disruptive Brexit. “If they do not materialize and disrupt strong U.S. GDP growth, I believe that continuing to raise short-term rates gradually, until monetary policy becomes mildly restrictive, is likely to be appropriate and beneficial over the long term.”\nExamining the data on the labor market’s tightness, Rosengren suggest that the forecast of an unemployment rate “well below” its estimated long-run sustainable level for a significant period of time is a sign of a macroeconomic imbalance that “poses a risk of rising inflation or increasing financial stability concerns — or both.”\n“I believe that Federal Reserve policymakers will likely need to move interest rates gradually from a mildly accommodative stance to a mildly restrictive stance in order to best fulfil our mandate — stable prices and maximum sustainable growth.”\nRosengren was speaking at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) 60th Annual Meeting in Boston, MA.",

            "highlights": "O. John Olcay Lecture on Ethics and Economics",
            "content": "Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said today the costs of high unemployment are disproportionately borne by those that can least afford them, and a variety of actions could be taken by policymakers to make periods of high unemployment less likely.\nThis ethical dimension of economics “is not just about thoughts or feelings,” Rosengren said, while exploring ways to manifest such ethical decisions in “very tangible” policymaking: state and local government spending; bank regulatory policy; and monetary policy.\n“The sad reality is that unemployment disproportionately affects minorities, the less educated, and children whose families are experiencing unemployment,” Rosengren said, acknowledging that the costs to both the entire economy and to parts of our population are significant.\n“In my view, if policies could mitigate the severity of economic slowdowns, some of those costs could be avoided – and taking actions now, when the economy is strong, could be particularly important to lessening the severity of a hypothetical future downturn and its impact on individuals.”\nIn exploring state and local government financing, Rosengren said it should be designed to buffer the economy during recessions, or at a minimum “should not reduce the stimulative effects of spending when the economy is most troubled.”\nState and local governments likely reduce spending in recessions for good reasons, he said, but a number of steps can be taken that would lessen the problematic impact. “Ideally, a time like now – when the national economy is growing and employment is robust – would be an opportunity, it seems to me, to prepare for the next downturn,” Rosengren said. “This would perhaps include shoring up state finances, reducing unfunded pension liabilities, and significantly increasing ‘rainy day’ funds. I am not suggesting it would be easy, even in these economic times. But progress could be made.”\nBanking regulation can also amplify the business cycle, and policymakers can look for ways to lessen these effects, Rosengren said. For example, lenders’ losses on loans tend to increase significantly during economic downturns. When their capital-to-assets ratio gets too low, banks can choose to either raise their capital level, or shrink assets, to restore the ratio. Loans are key assets for banks, so restoring the capital-to-assets ratio can mean less lending at just the time the economy may need stimulus.\nGiven the overall health of the economy and the relatively rich asset valuations now prevailing, it is Rosengren’s view that this would be the ideal time to build up capital buffers in the U.S., which he says could help address the incentive that banks will have to pull back on lending to shrink assets in a future economic downturn.\nTurning to monetary policy, Rosengren said it is appropriate to consider ways to avoid hitting zero with short-term interest rates. One possibility, he said, is to consider more flexibility with the inflation target, perhaps focusing more on an inflation range than a specific number. “One might allow the inflation target to rise within the range during periods of low real rates, thus providing more room for the funds rate to fall during an economic downturn.” He also noted that a policy path that does not overshoot the sustainable unemployment rate likely increases the probability of a longer recession-free period.\n“The costs of economic downturns – and the uneven distribution of their impact – are, in fact, ethical issues,” Rosengren concluded. “Policymakers could continue and perhaps expand their efforts to make cyclical downturns – and resulting periods of high unemployment – less severe.”\nRosengren was speaking at the Fourth Annual O.

He noted that today's unemployment rate is below the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the natural rate.\n\"Periods in which unemployment dipped significantly and persistently below the estimated natural rate historically have tended to generate conditions that resulted in a recession,\" Rosengren said, showing the relevant historical charts.\nTurning to longer-run risks to the economic outlook, Rosengren said that the current status of fiscal and monetary policy buffers \"call into question\" their ability to work against a shock or downturn.\n\"By using up so much fiscal capacity now – by which I mean the ability to lower tax rates or boost federal spending to offset economic weakness – the country risks not having sufficient fiscal capacity in the future when it might be needed,\" Rosengren said.\nAdditionally, there is \"some reason\" to be concerned about how aggressively monetary policy can respond to a large adverse shock, noting the median forecast among FOMC members for longer-run interest rates is 2.9 percent – \"quite low\" by historical standards, resulting from slow labor force growth coupled with slow growth in productivity.\n\"Since in many recessions we lower rates by as much as 5 percentage points, it is quite likely that interest rates would reach zero again in a downturn,\" Rosengren said.\nRosengren is, in sum, hopeful these risks can be avoided. \"The economic outlook is good, but we all must be attuned to what could go wrong in the short term and in the long term, and what that implies for appropriate monetary policy.\"\nRosengren was speaking at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce's Economic Outlook Breakfast 2018 in Boston, MA.",

Simple math suggests that given prevailing low rates, policymakers could quickly run out of room to lower the federal funds rate – and so the ability of conventional monetary policy to respond to a crisis is somewhat constrained.\n\"I believe that policymakers should consider adjusting the monetary policy framework, to address the possibility that the capacity of conventional policy tools may be too quickly depleted,\" Rosengren said.\nHe noted that fiscal policy buffers are being bolstered in some European countries as their economies improve, but that the same cannot be said for the United States.\n\"My view is that U.S. fiscal policy we have seen since the crisis emerged in 2008 will simply give future policymakers less flexibility to respond to a hypothetical large financial stability shock with fiscal policy tools,\" Rosengren said.\nShould a shock occur, monetary policy and fiscal policy may not be expected to respond as forcefully as they did in the last financial crisis and its aftermath.\nThis highlights how important it is that financial stability tools \"provide sufficient buffers.\"  These tools include altering the scenarios used in the bank stress tests that are applied to the largest banks, and the setting of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer.\nHe noted that the Countercyclical Capital Buffer remains at zero, and said that with asset valuations high a non-zero buffer can be justified.\n\"In my view, now should be the time that policymakers carefully consider this state of affairs, and assess which tools could provide more potent buffers to draw upon should a large adverse financial shock occur,\" Rosengren concluded.\n\"While that is not my expectation or prediction, my view is that it is an opportune time to prepare for such a possibility.\"\nRosengren was delivering keynote remarks at the tenth conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy.",

            "content": "Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren today suggested that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework has an opportunity to adapt to the recent experience with prolonged low interest rates.\nRosengren said low inflation has enabled the Federal Reserve to pursue a very gradual exit from the “extraordinary” monetary policy accommodation undertaken to address the financial crisis, Great Recession, and slow recovery – adding that he does not view the “somewhat lower than expected” recent inflation rate as particularly troublesome for near-term monetary policy.\nBut “I do see low and fixed inflation targets as a potential problem – particularly if we continue to experience low productivity growth, a low equilibrium interest rate, and the near-certainty of a slowly growing and aging workforce,” Rosengren said.\nIn such an environment and with a two percent inflation goal, interest rates are likely to be low, on average. When a recession eventually does occur, Rosengren said, policymakers would likely start with a low policy rate leaving little room to lower rates to offset the effects of the recession.\nIn addition to making it difficult to conduct monetary policy, low interest rate environments can potentially undermine financial stability, he said, as households and firms “reach for yield” in the face of low interest rates, almost always taking on additional risk as a consequence.\nFundamental changes such as lower growth in productivity and in population have made it much more likely that future recessions could also result in periods of prolonged very low interest rates and a need to conduct monetary policy with nontraditional methods.\n“If we seek to avoid a prolonged low interest rate environment in the future, then policymakers should start studying and discussing alternative frameworks to make this outcome less likely.”\nSuggesting that the “optimal” inflation rate is not likely to remain constant over time, Rosengren offered the alternative of an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target – a range of inflation rates acceptable to policymakers across many economic circumstances, and a medium-term goal within that range policymakers would set depending on the current circumstance.\nStill, Rosengren acknowledged that such flexibility would generate more uncertainty about inflation in the medium to long run. However, he said as long as the inflation rate were in a relatively narrow band, such as 1.5 to 3.0 percent, the range would not be a dramatic change from actual experience and would therefore be less likely to impact inflation expectations.\nTurning to forecasts, Rosengren said recent forecast errors of inflation and unemployment have not been particularly large, and do not pose much challenge to continuing on the current path of gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\n“Perhaps the bigger risk for short-run policy is the fact that the unemployment rate continues to fall further below sustainable levels, and will likely continue to do so going forward, risking the sustainability of the recovery.”\nRosengren was speaking at the Money, Models, & Digital Innovation Conference hosted by the Global Interdependence Center.",

He sees “a gradual rise toward the 2 percent target in the coming quarters.”\nExploring other labor market indicators beyond the widely reported unemployment rate, Rosengren said the data seem “consistent with labor markets being quite tight” – not characterized by slack that could suggesting unemployment is not actually below its sustainable rate.\nRosengren was speaking at the Economic Policy Forum Fall 2017, hosted by the Department of Economics at Northeastern University.",

Or should they be able to determine how best to achieve the outcomes mandated by Congress (maximum sustainable employment and stable prices)?\n\"The resolution of the 'rules vs. discretion' debate will have significant consequences,\" said Rosengren, opening a conference on the subject and exploring the positive aspects of policy rules, as well as some drawbacks.\nRosengren said that rules provide important benchmarks, allowing policymakers to compare potential policies to historical norms. He noted that rules could make inherently complex policies more understandable, could aid in communicating those policies, and could make policy more consistent over time despite changing personnel.\nRosengren said that policy rules like those described in research by conference presenter John Taylor, have the advantage of being firmly tied to the ultimate goals that Congress has set for the Federal Reserve. \"I view policy rules tied to the central bank's mandate as extremely useful benchmarks.\"\nFed policymakers regularly refer to a variety of policy rules, said Rosengren—but not one rule alone, as different policy rules can give very different policy prescriptions.\nIn Rosengren's view, legislating the use of simple policy rules would be \"quite counterproductive.\" Picking the wrong rule can entail significant costs: an ineffective or inappropriate rule could produce distinctly sub-optimal results for the economy.\nAnd simple interest rate rules, he said, \"do not capture the full range of policy instruments available to the central bank,\" such as the expansion and change in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\nRosengren also said that concerns about financial stability are reflected in FOMC actions, but not modeled in simple rules.\n\"A legislated policy rule that is rigid could lead to large policy mistakes,\" Rosengren concluded.\n\"From my perspective, policy effectiveness will be better served by a more robust formulation of monetary policy that draws on a diverse set of guidelines and benchmarks—which is the exercise Fed policymakers conduct every six weeks for actual FOMC meetings.\"\nRosengren was speaking at the Boston Fed's 61st Economic Conference, \"Are Rules Made to be Broken?

Prudent risk management, he said, would argue for the continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation in order to minimize the risk of outcomes that might prematurely shorten the current economic recovery.\nRosengren was speaking at the 84th International Atlantic Economic Conference in Montreal, hosted by the International Atlantic Economic Society.",

Both suggest that by the end of next year, inflation is expected to be close to target, while the unemployment rate will continue to fall – and as a result, will move further below most estimates of a sustainable unemployment rate.\n\"This outcome poses risks – specifically that an overheated economy will lead to price or asset-price inflation, risking the sustainability of the recovery,\" Rosengren said.\nRosengren noted that low inflation readings are viewed as transitory by both FOMC participants and private-sector forecasters. In contrast, Rosengren noted that most forecasters see the recent low readings for unemployment as persistent, and they envision additional declines on average.\n\"While such forecasts are still of course subject to errors – possibly even significant ones – I believe policymakers should not overreact to low current inflation readings that are widely expected to be temporary,\" he said.\n\"In my view, appropriate risk mitigation would argue for continued gradual removal of monetary accommodation, even though we are currently below the inflation target.\"\nRosengren was speaking to the Money Marketeers of New York University.",

This, he said, would represent an unsustainable, \"overshooting\" pace for the economy – and provides an important rationale for continuing the process of normalization of monetary policy that is currently underway.\n\"My primary message today is about the importance of achieving positive, but long‐run sustainable, economic conditions – full employment and stable prices – and, by extension, that monetary policy supports such an outcome.\"\nRosengren acknowledged potential risks to the forecast – including around bank lending and risks from abroad. But, while bank loan growth has not been as robust as in previous cycles, this likely reflects the nature of the crisis, recession, and recovery rather than a particular weakness in underlying economic conditions. And the risk of a slowdown from abroad seems to be abating as of late.\nExploring the stance of policy, Rosengren said U.S. monetary policy remains \"quite accommodative,\" while economic conditions are now consistent with full employment and the Fed's inflation target.\nNoting that the median forecast among Fed policymakers is for two more increases for this year, Rosengren said his own view \"remains that along with a gradual reduction in the level of the balance sheet, it would still be reasonable to have three rate increases over the remainder of this year, assuming the economy evolves like my forecast envisions.\"\nRosengren was speaking to the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce and the Central Vermont Chamber of Commerce, in South Burlington, Vermont.",

            "content": "Speaking in New York on Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren discussed commercial real estate valuations. While a variety of favorable conditions account for some of the elevated valuations, he noted that at such times it is worth asking what could go wrong and cause a reversal.\n\"While I do not expect that a downturn in commercial real estate prices would by itself cause a significant problem for the economy, in some past recessions such an occurrence has propagated an initial adverse shock – and by constraining financial intermediaries, made the extent of the subsequent economic downturn more severe for a wide range of households and businesses that depend on intermediaries for credit,\" Rosengren said, echoing themes he has stressed in prior analysis.\nRosengren said the regulatory community must also remain attuned to developments, understand how a reversal may propagate through the financial system, and consider whether the system is resilient enough to withstand such shocks, should they occur.\nHe acknowledged a number of favorable \"tailwinds\" accompanying rising commercial real estate valuations, including low and stable inflation, accommodative monetary policy, and the relative economic strength in the U.S. compared with the rest of the world. Rosengren also said that greater urbanization, later marriage age, and preferences among the large cohort of millennials are additional favorable trends for multifamily commercial real estate.\nHowever, Rosengren cautioned that it is harder to know if these conditions warrant the extent of price increase we have seen to date.\n\"For almost any asset category, positive trends can sometimes evolve into prices that increase more than fundamentals justify,\" Rosengren said. \"It is very hard to distinguish how much of the price gain is the result of the favorable fundamentals, and how much reflects an abundance of optimism by investors.\"\nRosengren noted that government‐sponsored enterprises (or \"GSEs\") have significant holdings or guarantees of multifamily loans outstanding. If future reform proposals required the GSEs to reduce their holdings of multifamily loans \"a potential and significant shock to this sector of the commercial real estate market could occur.\"\nRosengren concluded by noting that leveraged institutions and GSEs have significant exposures to commercial real estate. In the event of an adverse scenario such as a recession, these exposures could pose significant risks to these institutions.\n\"While I am certainly not expecting such a scenario to occur, central bankers are charged with thinking about adverse risks to the economy. So current valuations in real estate are one such risk that I will continue to watch carefully,\" Rosengren said.\nRosengren was speaking at the Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Financial Markets Conference at New York University's Stern School of Business.",

A combination of low inflation, low rates of productivity growth, and slow population growth may imply an economy \"where equilibrium short-term interest rates remain relatively low\" by historical standards.\nAs a result, reductions in short-term rates to combat recessions will encounter the zero boundary and \"will not be sufficient,\" Rosengren said – so \"it is likely to be more common for central banks to engage in asset purchases to stimulate the economy by reducing longer-term rates.\"\n\"So balance-sheet expansions – and exits – are likely to become more standard monetary policy tools around the world.\"\nStill, Rosengren noted that the Federal Reserve should adopt balance sheet exit strategies \"that reinforce the primacy of interest rate policy.\"\nRosengren said that while the FOMC is still carefully considering its balance sheet exit strategy, his ideal policy \"would take a very gradual approach to balance sheet reduction.\"\n\"In my view that process could begin relatively soon, and should not significantly alter the FOMC's continuing gradual normalization of short-term interest rates,\" he said.\nRosengren added that by initially retiring only a small percentage of maturing securities, and then very gradually shrinking the volume of the securities being reinvested, \"the tightening of short-term interest rates should not need to be much different than it would be in the absence of shrinking the balance sheet.\"\n\"Starting to shrink the balance sheet earlier – and doing so in a very gradual fashion – implies very little reduction in the degree of monetary stimulus coming from the U.S. central bank's balance sheet,\" Rosengren said.\n\"This, in turn, will allow policymakers to focus on gradual increases in the federal funds rate target as the primary mechanism for normalizing monetary policy and calibrating the economy.\"\nRosengren was speaking at the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College's 26th Annual Hyman P.

He noted improvements since the financial crisis that have left financial institutions with better capitalization and liquidity, and resolution plans.

He cited October payroll employment growth of 161,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent as evidence that the economy is at or close to most economists' estimates of \"full employment.\"\nAs a result, \"Absent significant negative economic news over the next month,\" the market's assessment of the likelihood of monetary policy tightening in December \"seems plausible.\"\nTo achieve the goal of a continued, sustained economic recovery, Rosengren noted that Fed policymakers must consider the risks inherent in waiting too long to gradually remove monetary accommodation.\n\"I would much prefer that tightening be gradual, and that policymakers try to avoid circumstances in which we need to tighten more quickly,\" said Rosengren. \"My concern is that more rapid tightening, were it necessary, could risk disrupting the recovery\" that is now attaining full employment and price stability.\nGrowth forecasts imply that we are likely to see some further tightening in labor markets. Rosengren noted that since the unemployment rate is already close to its full employment level, further declines would increase the risk of overshooting what is likely to be a sustainable unemployment rate in the longer run. That outcome, he said, could lead at some point to the need for a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation.\n\"It is certainly good news that the labor force has grown more rapidly of late, and that workers have been drawn from out of the labor force into employment. But this trend is likely to be limited going forward by the demographic changes in the workforce\" and the result could be overshooting.\nTurning to inflation, Rosengren said at last it appears to be trending toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal. The Boston Fed forecast expects both the total and core PCE inflation measures to hit 2 percent over the next year. Progress to date and the expectation of further progress likely explain why markets have priced in a high probability of a rate hike in December.\nAcknowledging his September vote to increase interest rates, Rosengren said that he felt that at the November FOMC meeting that the changes in the FOMC statement were well aligned with the notion (and the market perception) of a high likelihood of tightening in December.\n\"Going forward, I will be attuned to assessing whether my forecast – continued progress toward achieving our inflation target and employment goals – is on track.\"\nRosengren was speaking to the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce in Portland, ME.",

The pairing of slower, sustained real GDP growth with a relatively rapid decline in the unemployment rate is one of the \"clear puzzles\" of the recovery, he said.\nRosengren noted that the falling unemployment rate has also been accompanied by falling labor force participation.  Also, the higher savings rate may suggest different savings behavior stemming from the Great Recession. \"Should this pattern persist, it has implications going forward for consumption patterns and the economy more broadly,\" he said.\nThe real federal funds rate in the current recovery, Rosengren observed, also differs markedly from previous recoveries. Reflecting the depth of the Great Recession, the real federal funds rate has been significantly lower, and consistently negative, in contrast to the two earlier recoveries.\nTurning to asset prices, Rosengren said that anomalies in this recovery are leaving an imprint on only some financial asset classes.  Price to earnings ratios for stocks, and price to rent for residential real estate, are only somewhat elevated – and are well below previous peaks in these series.  In contrast, Rosengren observed that 10-year Treasury rates and commercial real estate capitalization rates are unusually low relative to the past.\n\"This recovery has been full of surprises, most of which have not been good,\" Rosengren said. \"While one must always be cautious about assuming that current trends reflect something different from historical experience, it is important to consider whether this time has indeed been different.\"\nIf it has, Rosengren concluded, then the lessons from this recovery – perhaps an understanding of a \"new normal\" environment – may very well impact how we should be thinking about monetary policy going forward.\nRosengren was speaking at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 60th Economic Conference: The Elusive \"Great\" Recovery: Causes and Implications for Future Business Cycle Dynamics, held at the Federal Reserve Bank.",

It may also allow some asset markets to \"become too ebullient,\" and he reiterated previous concerns over commercial real estate prices.\n\"The risks to the forecast are becoming increasingly two-sided, in my view,\" Rosengren explained. \"Weakness emanating from abroad poses short-term downside risks to the domestic U.S. economy,\" yet there are also \"longer-term risks from significantly overshooting the U.S. economy's growth.\"\n ",

But should prevailing economic conditions change in response to a large negative economic shock, commercial real estate prices could decline relatively quickly, leading to large losses at leveraged firms.”\nRosengren said that because commercial real estate debt is widely held by depository institutions, commercial real estate losses could erode banks’ capital ratios and lead to a contraction of credit availability for firms and households – similar to the credit crunch experience in the early 1990s.\n“The financial stability concerns that could arise from a low interest rate policy continuing for an extended period of time should be considered in conjunction with how best to achieve” the central bank’s full employment and price stability goals, “now and over time,” Rosengren concluded.\n   ",

He noted also some evidence of inflation moving toward the 2 percent target.\n\"I expect that the U.S. central bank will gradually normalize monetary policy as the three conditions set out in the April FOMC minutes are met,\" he continued.\nRosengren said he was a strong supporter of pursuing quantitative easing in the U.S. during the aftermath of the financial crisis, to provide further stimulus after short-term rates reached essentially zero.

He was speaking to the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce, in New Hampshire.\nReferring to April's employment report, Rosengren said that while it was a bit below market expectations, it still reflected relatively strong employment growth at a time when the U.S. economy is close to what most economists consider full employment. Should April's payroll employment growth continue, it “should be strong enough to bring some further tightening of labor markets,\" he added.\nRosengren also acknowledged diminished headwinds from abroad, and a tentative upward trend in average hourly earnings.\nHe reiterated his earlier perspectives – that the market remains too pessimistic about the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy, and the likelihood of removing monetary accommodation is higher than is currently priced into financial markets.\nRosengren also acknowledged the benefits of probing the natural rate of unemployment to see how low it might be, given the benefit to workers. “We have seen workers rejoin the labor force, many of them previously having given up looking for work.\"\nHowever, Rosengren continued, there can be potential costs to accommodation if rates stay too low for too long, potentially encouraging speculative behavior.\nThe commercial real estate market is one area where Rosengren has particular concern, noting that prices now exceed the peaks reached prior to the financial crisis, and growth in mortgage debt on multifamily properties is up sharply from lows reached in 2010.\n“History shows that most periods of serious financial instability involve a scenario in which debt is high relative to a volatile underlying asset, and the value of the asset subsequently declines,\" Rosengren said. He cited the scenario that played out in New England in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and said “it is important that we take actions early enough to avoid a repetition of that experience.\"\nRosengren also noted the limits in monetary policy's ability to fine tune the economy, saying it has “proven difficult\" to calibrate policy so as to gradually increase the unemployment rate, gently nudging it back toward full employment. “The lesson is that policymakers should avoid significantly overshooting their best estimates of the natural rate of unemployment,\" he said. “Waiting too long to have more normalized rates risks possibly overshooting on the unemployment rate, and needing to tighten more quickly than would be desirable.\"",

This is inconsistent with Rosengren’s forecast—and that of many forecasters—for continued moderate growth in the U.S. economy.\n\"While I believe that gradual federal funds rate increases are absolutely appropriate, I do not see that the risks are so elevated, nor the outlook so pessimistic, as to justify the exceptionally shallow interest rate path currently reflected in financial futures markets,\" Rosengren said.\nLooking at longer-term market rates, Rosengren also noted that market rates on 10-year Treasury securities are below 2 percent. If the Fed is successful in averaging 2 percent inflation over the next 10 years, then investors are accepting a negative real rate of return.\nIn Rosengren’s view, it is quite appropriate to probe how low unemployment—currently at 5 percent—can go, given that the inflation rate is below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target and wages are only increasing modestly. One reason for probing how low the unemployment rate can go is that it will encourage more people to return to the labor force.\nBut given these conditions, an interest rate path as shallow as implied in futures markets could introduce risks of overheating.\n\"A large, rapid decline in unemployment could be risky, as an overheating economy would eventually produce inflation rising above our 2 percent goal.\"\n\"I would prefer that the Federal Reserve not risk making the mistake of significantly overshooting the full employment level, resulting in the need to rapidly raise interest rates—with potentially disruptive effects and an increased risk of a recession.\"\n\"At the Boston Federal Reserve Bank we have been expecting only a slow decline in the unemployment rate, a forecast in part predicated on people being drawn into the labor force,\" Rosengren said. \"Our model has assumed that real GDP growth somewhat over 2 percent will be consistent with some gradual further decline in the unemployment rate.\"\nRosengren delivered the American Savings Foundation Distinguished Lecture at Central Connecticut State University.",

Futures markets assign a very high probability of one or zero increases in rates by the end of this year.\n\"My own sense is that financial markets may have reacted too strongly,\" Rosengren said.\nWith financial market volatility subsiding, Rosengren expressed some surprise that the expected path of monetary policy embedded in futures markets is so low.\n\"A weak forecast doesn't seem to explain the path expected for the funds rate,\" he said. \"As I see it, the risks seem to be abating that problems from abroad would be severe enough to disrupt the U.S. recovery. Financial-market volatility has fallen, and most economic forecasts do not reflect expected large spillovers from continued headwinds from abroad.\"\nRosengren said it increasingly appears that the U.S. has weathered foreign shocks quite well.\n\"I personally expect that a stronger economy, at essentially full employment and with gradually rising inflation, will lead to more tightening than is currently priced into the futures market expectations for the next two years,\" Rosengren said.\nRosengren was quick to emphasize that his outlook still calls for a gradual pace of increases and that, as always, the path should depend on incoming economic data.\nTurning to cybersecurity, Rosengren noted that the risks in the cyber realm are, unfortunately, not abating.\nWhile banks must continue to evolve with and invest in financial services innovations, Rosengren said, they are staying attuned to and strategic about the cyber risks that come with online and mobile delivery.\nIn Rosengren's view, banking organizations need to continue to evolve as these risks morph, and as new innovations and expectations of convenience introduce new challenges to security.\nIn setting the context for the remainder of the day’s program on cybersecurity, Rosengren said \"Cyber risks make it imperative that we all work together to ensure that resiliency, monitoring, detection, and recovery capabilities are operational in the financial system.\"\nRosengren was speaking at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 2016 Cybersecurity Conference",

He specifically cited higher capital, and rigorous stress tests.\nMaintaining standards for loss-absorbing capital has long been central to bank regulation, but the specifics of how that regulation is implemented can have very different implications for the broader economy.\n\"There are trade-offs to carefully consider,\" Rosengren said. \"Policymakers need to balance the resilience that higher capital ratios bring against the possibility of pullback in the provision of credit, and downstream impacts on the ability of firms and households to borrow and invest.\"\n\"I am in favor of using bank supervision to more quickly insulate the largest financial institutions from adverse economic shocks that may emerge. But ideally, this would be done in ways that also encourage financial intermediaries to continue lending,\" Rosengren added.\nHe noted that in the U.S., the recession in the early 1990s was exacerbated by a credit crunch resulting from the approach to binding capital requirements. \"Less collateral damage to borrowers may have occurred if supervision had taken the tack of more forcefully requiring retention of earnings or the raising of new equity capital.\"\nRosengren observed that in the United States of late, banks have been able to significantly improve capital ratios while still expanding their lending.\nRosengren was speaking at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Conference: \"Supervising Large, Complex Financial Institutions: Defining Objectives and Measuring Effectiveness\"",

A more gradual approach is an appropriate response to headwinds from abroad that slow exports, and financial volatility that raises the cost of funds to many firms.\"\nHe added that his view could change \"if we were to experience a more rapid abatement of headwinds, or much stronger domestic economic growth than I am currently anticipating.\"\nRosengren touched on recent economic factors, such as the declines to date in energy costs that \"are likely to bring about continued temporary downward pressure on core inflation.\" And he noted the dollar's appreciation, making imported goods cheaper and reducing U.S. inflation as it raises the cost of U.S.-produced goods to foreign buyers.\nHe added that if inflation expectations change for households and firms, then these temporary downward pressures could pose more permanent impediments. A survey by the New York Fed shows a gradual but clear downward trend in inflation expectations over the past several years. \"This suggests we cannot take for granted that regular, persistent, but seemingly temporary shocks to inflation will not have a larger and more lasting impact.\"\nRosengren also noted that hourly earnings and wages and salaries for private workers have been slowly increasing, and while the increases are more modest than those seen in previous recoveries, the gradual upward trend, were it to continue, would build confidence in reaching the 2 percent inflation target.\nHowever, \"If more pronounced global weakness were to materialize and be transmitted to the U.S.,\" said Rosengren, \"I personally believe there would be little need to raise rates until the economy was growing closer to its potential rate.\"\n\"Since the Fed published its Summary of Economic Projections in December, we have seen oil prices decline and global stock indices become more volatile – and more generally a lack of inflationary pressures and the presence of global headwinds that make future economic growth somewhat more uncertain,\" Rosengren said. \"Should these conditions persist, and slow progress on attaining the Fed's dual mandate, I believe the normalization of monetary policy should be unhurried, and wait for economic data to improve.\"\nPresident Rosengren was speaking at Colby College.

He focused on two areas of progress since the financial crisis—increased capital buffers aimed at reducing the probability of failures, and steps to reduce the spill-over of problems from one troubled institution to others and the financial system.\nRosengren noted that a number of the largest institutions have grown over the past five years. But it may be too soon to judge what size organizations are likely to be once the full set of regulations is implemented. He said the most important progress to date on Too Big to Fail involves reducing the probability that these institutions will fail—and should they fail, reducing the risks they would pose to the entire economy.\nOf the regulatory initiatives designed to reduce the probability of failure, Rosengren called the introduction of stress testing that examines the ability of large bank holding companies to withstand stressful economic and financial conditions \"perhaps the most crucial change\" to the supervision of large financial institutions. He also pointed to regulatory changes that have significantly altered the capital regulation of Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Companies or \"GSIBs\" and specifically the GSIB capital surcharge, which is designed to reflect the systemic risk posed by these organizations because of the size and complexity of their operations.\n\"The effect of [these regulations] is to significantly reduce the probability that a GSIB fails,\" Rosengren said. \"The combination of these and other capital regulations (as phased in) should result in a significant improvement in capital ratios for GSIBs.\"\nRosengren also highlighted actions to try to reduce the cost if—despite stress tests and enhanced capital regulations—a GSIB were still to fail. He discussed the proposed rule for total loss-absorbing capacity, saying that its purpose is to \"insure that if a GSIB were to fail, sufficient debt financing would have been employed so that taxpayer resources would not be needed in order to resolve the institution.\" In addition, Rosengren noted that GSIBs are required to develop resolution plans or so-called \"living wills,\" covering how they could be resolved. Ratings agencies are viewing these actions as \"significantly reducing the Too Big to Fail problem.\"\nRosengren's talk also briefly touched on a number of other areas of progress, including a shift in the clearing of some derivatives to central counterparties; the application of regulations to non-bank, systematically important financial institutions; steps to increase the resiliency of large foreign banking organizations by requiring them to form intermediate holding companies, subjecting them to stress testing requirements and the same capital standards as their U.S. counterparts; and the establishment of new regulatory tools intended to make financial firms more resilient to liquidity shocks.\nIn all, Rosengren cited progress, while noting the significant work still remaining.",

The future path of rates, he said, will depend on incoming economic data, and how that data affects policymakers' outlook for the economy.\n\"I hope the economy continues to improve, so that further normalization is appropriate. It is important, however, to carefully manage risks to the economy,\" said Rosengren - adding that, in his view, further increases in rates are likely to be gradual. This gradual notion reflects the current economic landscape, including the fact that inflation remains well below the Fed's 2 percent target.\nRosengren noted the good news on employment, with 292,000 jobs added in December, and an average of 284,000 jobs added per month over the past quarter. However, other news around the start of the year has been less positive, including weak stock markets in much of the world, weak oil and commodity prices, and falling estimates for fourth-quarter real GDP growth in the United States.\n\"While monetary policy should not overreact to short-term, temporary fluctuations in financial markets, policy makers should take seriously the potential downside risks to their economic forecasts,\" he said.\nRosengren observed that improvements in the economy \"provided the conditions necessary for the Federal Reserve to finally begin removing some of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that was the necessary, appropriate, and effective response to the financial crisis, recession, and painfully slow recovery.\" The first step in this gradual process was December's increase in the federal funds rate - the first since the Great Recession. He added that the response to the increase was quite uneventful.\nGiven the extremely large volume of excess reserves in the market post-crisis, increasing the federal funds rate this time requires different tools: borrowing facilities with administered interest rates, rather than relying on changing the balance of reserves in the banking system to influence rates. \"These administered rates help us create the top and bottom of the new target range for the federal funds rate.\"\nAfter the December FOMC meeting, the interest rate on reserves was set at 0.50 percent (the upper end of the target range) and the reverse repurchase rate was set at 0.25 percent (the lower end). The effective federal funds rate has traded in between those two rates all but one day (December 31).\nWhile December's first increase was the beginning of normalization, Rosengren noted that rates remain well below their pre-crisis levels. He added that the Fed?s policy committee stated it \"expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\"\nAudio from President Rosengren's talk will air on Boston NPR affiliate WBUR at 8 p.m. EST on Jan. 17.

Looking beyond headlines of tepid third quarter GDP growth, he cited a more robust reading of the underlying strength in domestic demand (real final sales to domestic purchasers). It reflects the strength of consumer spending, boosted by improvements in labor markets, lower gasoline prices, and the relative strength in housing prices and stock prices.\nThe strength suggests the U.S. was little affected by the problems in emerging market countries, or by the resulting financial-market turbulence. \"With little collateral damage evident from external sources, I expect domestic demand to continue to support the economy.\"\nRosengren also spoke about employment, citing Fed policymakers' economic projections. The current 5 percent unemployment rate is, he noted, squarely within Fed policymakers' \"central tendency\" for longer-run unemployment, which ranges from 4.9 to 5.2 percent.\nStill, \"Given persistently low wage and price pressures, and the relatively slow real GDP growth forecast in the SEP, a more gradual path of normalization may be necessary to ensure reaching the 2 percent inflation target.\"\nRosengren touched on financial stability considerations and the exceptionally low rate environment. Early signs of \"search for yield\" may be showing up in the commercial real estate market, and Rosengren suggests that the trend in commercial real estate prices be thoughtfully monitored - particularly in light of the role that commercial real estate played in the region's economic downturn in the late 1980s.\nGradual removal of accommodation offers several advantages, Rosengren noted, including providing more time to analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening tools, as well as allowing for additional time to analyze how the tightening is affecting the real economy. \"A slower pace reduces the risk that the Committee takes more or less aggressive action than needed or intended,\" he said.",

His own view of the forecasts for inflation, he explained, largely rests on whether he thinks the economy will continue to experience growth above potential and whether the subsequent declining labor market slack will be sufficient to raise his confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent in a reasonable time frame.\nTurning to employment, Rosengren noted that although the typical, widely-reported measure of unemployment (known as \"U-3\") is lower now than at the outset of the earlier tightening cycles of 1994 and 2004, the broader definition of unemployment (\"U-6\", which includes those who are working part time for economic reasons and those only marginally attached to the workforce), is not particularly low compared to the start of the prior two tightening cycles.\n\n\"If one believes the broader measure of unemployment better captures slack in the economy, then labor markets would not be viewed as unusually tight for commencing the tightening cycle,\" he said. \"This potential additional slack would also be a reason for policymakers to follow a more modest interest rate path at the beginning of a tightening cycle.\"\nRosengren also noted that Federal Reserve policymakers expect a gradual tightening cycle, as suggested by their published Summary of Economic Projections. The implied path is much slower than the path taken in 2004, with the federal funds rate increasing at roughly half the pace of that tightening episode.\nConditions this time \"likely require a different path of tightening,\" said Rosengren. He also noted that \"In my own view, given current and forecast conditions, not only is the pace likely to be gradual, but the federal funds rate in the longer run may be lower than in previous tightening cycles.\"\n\"The more gradual tightening cycle should enable monetary policymakers to gauge how tight labor markets can be while maintaining stable prices,\" Rosengren concluded. \"The very low inflation rates here and abroad make it a particularly good time to not be too tied to imprecise measures of full employment.\"",

            "content": "The Global Interdependence Center's Seventh Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit Victor, Idaho\nDownload Speech Audio Download Q,A Audio\nSpeaking today at the Rocky Mountain Economic Summit in Victor, Idaho, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren discussed some of the uncertainties that affect forecasts as well as monetary policy decisions.\nOne such area of uncertainty centers around inflation in the U.S. - currently at 1.2 percent and well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. The data on core inflation have remained weak, even as labor markets have improved. One of the conditions the Fed's monetary policy committee has for beginning to raise short-term rates is reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\"One reason the inflation rate may be so subdued is that significant slack - that is, excess supply - may remain in the labor market despite the simplest and most widely-reported unemployment rate having fallen to 5.3 percent,\" Rosengren said. The drop in the percent of the population in the U.S. that is officially employed (the employment to population ratio) may be evidence of such slack, although some of this decline is the result of demographic change.\nRosengren said that he has lowered his own estimate of the so-called natural rate of unemployment to 5 percent. Should inflation continue to undershoot forecasts, he said his own estimate may need to be adjusted even lower.\nRosengren also provided some perspective on a second area of uncertainty, international developments. The fluid situation in Greece is an example of how difficult-to-predict international events can make forecasting the future course of the economy difficult.\n\"The situation also calls for some sober reflecting on how best to preserve financial stability, in all parties' interests,\" he added. \"I would underline the desirability of Greece and its creditors finding a reasonable compromise, which would not only help Greece but would avoid some unintended consequences for all parties in the Euro Area.\"\nFortunately, to date geopolitical issues and concerns around the world have not significantly altered the outlook for an improving U.S. economy. As the economy continues to improve, Rosengren expects that inflation will begin to move closer to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target, making it appropriate to consider starting to normalize monetary policy later this year.\nAs the Federal Reserve gets closer to its dual mandate goals (stable prices and maximum sustainable employment), Rosengren believes that monetary policymaking needs to be particularly data dependent.\n\"Data dependence at this point means that we wait for data that gives us greater confidence in our forecast, especially our forecast for inflation. We also wait to get a better handle on how the crisis in Greece gets resolved, so that we can better gauge its potential to impact on financial markets and the domestic economy.\"",

            "content": "Capital Workforce Partners “Workforce Stars” Event Hartford, Connecticut\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Monday that the economy has been softer than many forecasters expected in the first half of this year. Over the past three quarters, real GDP growth has been disappointing. And forecasts have tended to be too optimistic. While a severe winter deterred some economic activity, the data \"were also weak before the storms and have been weaker than expected ever since.\"\nAlso, there has not been a \"snapback\" in the numbers since the weather improved. And retail sales do not show large variations by region, while only some regions had severe winter weather. Also, the personal saving rate has remained well above where it was prior to the Great Recession.\n\"If consumer behavior is still being impacted by the experience of the financial crisis, the Great Recession, and the painfully slow recovery, then it is possible that the economy will not be as robust as many economic models would suggest, because the models do not take into account this behavioral change.\" Exploring the implications for Fed policy, Rosengren said the data demonstrate why \"the conditions for beginning the tightening of monetary policy have not yet been met.\"\nIn each of the previous tightening cycles, he observed, real GDP growth in the two years preceding the tightening was above 3 percent. Today we are faced with a growth rate of 2.3 percent over the past two years, and the strong possibility that growth in the first half of this year will average much less than 2 percent. \"In my view, such a pace of GDP growth does not meet some of the economic preconditions we look for when we begin a tightening cycle.\"\nNoting that the Federal Reserve's dual mandate from Congress is focused on stable prices and maximum sustainable employment, Rosengren said that measures of inflation are not yet showing much evidence of returning to the 2 percent target that the Fed considers ideal. \"If the economy continues to grow at the same pace as we witnessed on average in the current and the past two quarters, I do not expect to see timely improvements in the unemployment rate and sufficient progress towards the 2 percent inflation target. This, in my view, makes a compelling argument for continued patience in monetary policy.\"",

            "content": "Chatham House London, England\n\nWatch Rosengren's remarks on Bloomberg.com\nIn a speech on Thursday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren noted that the Federal Reserve's policy committee in March provided two conditions for raising short-term interest rates. First, the policy statement indicated that the Federal Open Market Committee needs to see further improvement in the labor market. Second, the Committee needs to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\"At this time,\" said Rosengren, \"I do not think that either condition has been met. Although there has been noticeable improvement in the labor market over the past few years, \"since March the indicators have been a bit mixed. Furthermore, inflation remains stubbornly below our target of 2 percent.\"\nWhen the Fed publishes Committee members' forecasts, many observers focus on the interest rate projections. But Rosengren urged a focus on \"the recent striking reduction in the longer-run estimates of the unemployment rate and the reduction in the level of the federal funds rate that FOMC participants expect to see in the longer run,\" as well.\n\"In addition to being relevant for current monetary policy decision-making, these measures are also relevant to the discussion of how best to utilize simple monetary policy rules\" - a topic of much debate among economists as well as lawmakers.\nThese key variables can change - and, according to FOMC participants' published projections, have changed significantly over the past three years. The variability of these two key estimates - normally assumed to be constant in simple monetary rules - \"highlights just one of the many perils of using simple rules to constrain monetary policymaking,\" said Rosengren.\nA number of factors may be behind the lower estimates for the unemployment rate in both the medium and the longer run. One possibility is that the standard unemployment rate usually quoted may not fully capture the current slack in the labor market. Another reason may be \"the absence of wage and price pressure,\" which \"is consistent with some slack still remaining in the labor markets, even with an unemployment rate that has fallen to 5.5 percent,\" said Rosengren.\nRosengren also discussed the implications of lower longer-run, or equilibrium, federal funds rates. First, rates may not need to rise as much to return to \"normalized\" interest rates. \"This is one reason that rate increases might not need to follow as steep a path as in previous recoveries.\" Second, policymakers may have less room to lower interest rates in the event of economic weakness, \"and will thus be more likely to hit the zero lower bound for interest rates.\" He added that \"this may imply that inflation targets have been set too low.\"\nThese changes provide a further rationale for looking beyond simple monetary rules, which \"cannot capture the full complexity involved in determining appropriate monetary policy, especially during periods when economic relationships may be changing.\" Many of these simple rules would have dictated a tighter policy for some time, even as employment has fallen short of full employment and inflation has run below the Fed's 2 percent goal, more than seven years since the start of the recession.\n\"For me, there is wisdom in utilizing a more flexible and comprehensive set of variables and models when considering appropriate monetary policy,\" said Rosengren. \"Rules are likely best used as guidelines, along with a host of other inputs - the most important of which are good judgment and hard-won experience.\"\nRosengren was speaking at Chatham House in London.",

A program that is open-ended and focused on areas where spreads are large-in conjunction with a communication strategy tied to goals-seems to have made a material difference in outcomes for the U.S., he said.\nHe went on to say that the so-called \"dual mandate\" is one reason why the Federal Reserve moved more aggressively than many other central banks to address the significant undershooting of inflation in the U.S., and that many other countries have experienced.\n\"How aggressively a central bank reacts to this situation depends on whether that central bank's mandated goals involve inflation alone, or as in the U.S., a dual mandate that includes employment,\" said Rosengren. \"I felt it was important that the focus on weak labor markets, as well as the undershooting of inflation, together provided important support for U.S. monetary policymakers to decide to move aggressively during the financial crisis, and indeed its long aftermath.\"\n\"However, I would argue that regardless of mandate, delays by central banks in moving to address the undershooting on inflation can be costly-especially if such delays lead households and firms to expect very low inflation rates.\"\nIn the absence of the dual mandate, significant and needed policy actions, like Operation Twist or QE3, may not have occurred, Rosengren said. Had these policy actions not occurred, he believes it would have \"prevented what was ultimately important pre-emptive action against a persistent undershooting of the inflation target that could have become much worse, as in some other parts of the globe.\"",

A more immediate issue would be an attack on payment systems aimed not at financial gain but at disrupting transactions-for example, by a rogue state or entity. \"An attack on payment systems that renders consumers and businesses unable to transact business could be extremely disruptive\" to an economy.\nThe prevention of these kinds of attacks puts an emphasis on ensuring that resiliency, monitoring, detection, and recovery capabilities are operational in any payment system. Rosengren argued that the adoption of a national defense grade security level, rather than a commercial grade security level, would mean a much more resilient-albeit expensive-payment system.\nAs an additional challenge, diffuse roles and responsibilities in the payments landscape, involving both the private and public sectors-and \"the many potential points of failure\"-make a unified cyberprevention approach difficult. \"There are serious challenges and obstacles to comprehensive solutions,\" said Rosengren, and \"central banks are essential to this discussion.\"\nRosengren called for a level of information-sharing and expectation-setting by national defense agencies, regulators, supervisors, and operators exceeding that of today. \"Sharing actionable information about cyber-attacks has the potential to significantly improve a firm's preparedness,\" he said.\nAs an example, he referenced a 2014 pilot program conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston focused on the sharing of cyber-threat information by, and among, small- to medium-sized banks. The successful pilot, Rosengren said, highlights that \"more peer sharing for groups of smaller institutions has the potential to help thwart cyber criminals' potential entry to payment systems.\"\n\"Given the importance of a safe and available payment system to the functioning of a nation's economy, investment in core aspects of systems to ensure they are as secure and cyber resilient as possible must be a national priority.\"",

Such patience also provides support to labor markets.\"\n\"The timing of the initial tightening of short-term interest rates after a recession depends on several factors,\" Rosengren said. \"Previous liftoffs can provide only an imperfect guide to likely future actions - but do provide some indication of factors that should be considered.\"\nRosengren observed that the last time the Federal Open Market Committee raised rates after a recession in June of 2004, the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent, below the current 5.8 percent, and inflation was at 2.8 percent - well above its current reading of 1.2 percent.\n\"Some worry that patience will mean deferring the first rate increase until well past the arrival of economic conditions that historically result in tightening, but I would point out that we have some way to go before reaching those conditions, and so have not been unusually patient as yet.\"\n\"Clearly, an unusual set of conditions prevails as the Federal Reserve considers beginning a move toward more normal rates,\" said Rosengren. Three areas stand out as complicating current discussions of raising short-term interest rates. These include the fact that inflation is still well below the Fed's target, that compensation is so subdued at a time when raising rates is under discussion, and that nontraditional monetary policy has enlarged the Fed's balance sheet which will need to be normalized in conjunction with normalizing short term rates.\n\"The low inflation rates experienced globally may also allow for a more gradual normalization process than typically occurs,\" he added. \"With so little wage and price pressure, and relatively slow productivity growth, it is possible that rates may not normalize at the same level they were prior to the financial crisis.\"\nIn conclusion, Rosengren noted that the complexity of monetary policy normalization is more pronounced than in 1994 and 2004. However, the fact that discussion of policy normalization is now appropriate is a welcome change from discussions of monetary policy over the past six years.\nRosengren also participated in a panel discussion on \"Credit Availability 20 Years after Peek and Rosengren.\" Slides from that presentation are available here.",

Parker Willis Lecture in Political Economy Washington and Lee University Lexington, Virginia\nIn a speech Monday at Washington and Lee University, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren explored the worrisome implications of very low inflation.\n\"Many central banks around the world have persistently missed their stated inflation targets\" since the financial crisis, said Rosengren. He described why too low an inflation rate can be costly, and why it is \"important that our inflation target be viewed as 'symmetric'\" - meaning that too-low inflation merits a response, as would too-high inflation.\nWhen the starting point is very low inflation, Rosengren said, an unexpected weakening of the economy could lead to outright deflation - a fall in the overall level of prices that leads people to postpone expenditures. Deflation also brings pain for debtors, as the real value of their loan payment rises.\nThe long period of mild deflation that Japan faced was also a period of slow economic growth. In Europe, inflation rates have continued to decline, and combined with very weak economic growth have raised concerns among some observers that the Eurozone could experience mild deflation as well.\n\"When inflation and interest rates are already quite low, monetary policy has only limited room to further lower interest rates to offset negative shocks to the economy\" before hitting zero, said Rosengren. Also, failure to achieve a clearly stated inflation target can undermine the credibility of a central bank, which can unsettle expectations.\nRosengren said \"one possibility for why we have been missing on the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target could be that there remains significant labor market slack.\" He noted the still-elevated level of the broader measure of unemployment that includes workers who are part time for economic reasons and who are marginally attached to the labor force.\n\"We should not be complacent about persistently missing our inflation target,\" concluded Rosengren. And \"until it is clear that we are on the path to achieving both our 2 percent inflation target and maximum sustainable employment,\" monetary policymakers should remain patient about removing accommodation.\nRosengren was delivering the H.

Laws and regulations prevent bank support for affiliated nonbank subsidiaries like broker-dealers, and laws also now limit the government's ability to provide emergency support during crises.\nSo it is \"imperative that preventive measures be taken to ensure that in future crises, broker-dealers' financing mechanisms are robust enough to endure potential financial stress.\"\nRosengren agrees with other policymakers who have said that a capital charge on short-term wholesale funding would help. And he noted that \"much greater disclosure on 'runnable' liabilities could utilize the power of markets to help curb unhealthy levels of reliance on such funding.\"\nOn the topic of disclosures, \"work has begun to look for opportunities to provide more detail on short-term wholesale funding in bank holding company reports,\" said Rosengren. \"I am hoping that this effort will develop sufficient detail on collateral type and maturity structure so that risks in this market can be better assessed, going forward.\"",

The resulting project is called the Working Cities Challenge.\nThe Challenge asked struggling mid-sized Massachusetts cities to submit proposals for solving a specific problem facing low- and moderate-income individuals. Proposals had to demonstrate strong collaboration between sectors.\n\"While the ultimate socioeconomic impact of this competition may take years to observe in the data, the initial qualitative results look promising,\" said Rosengren.\nWhile income inequality may be a somewhat controversial issue, most people agree that equality of opportunity is a most worthy goal. \"While we must not underestimate the challenges, hopefully we will be able to look back a decade or so from now and see significant progress in our communities and steady improvements in equality of opportunity.\"",

It appears that some potential workers became discouraged with job prospects and withdrew from the labor force, while others never joined at all.\n\"However, as labor markets tighten, the job prospects for these discouraged workers should improve,\" said Rosengren. \"It is likely that some of the new jobs opening up will be filled by individuals not currently counted in the labor force.\"\nWith more potential workers in the labor force, the unemployment rate may come down more slowly than its recent trend-even if the pace of job creation continues as in the first half of this year.\nRosengren noted the importance of the broader measures of labor market conditions-measuring things like discouraged and marginally attached workers, who have stopped looking, and those who are working only part time because full time work or schedules are not available.\n\"Inflation remains at only 1.6 percent, with no sign of significant wage pressures in labor markets. The lack of wage pressures suggests that we are not yet near full employment.\"\nAs a consequence of all this, Rosengren considers it appropriate for monetary policy to be \"patient\" in removing accommodation, in the interest of ensuring that the economy reaches full employment and the 2 percent inflation target as quickly as possible.\nRosengren does not expect that it will be appropriate to raise short-term rates \"until the U.S. economy is within one year of both achieving full employment and returning to within a narrow band around 2 percent inflation.\"",

            "content": "Conference on the Risks of Wholesale Funding New York, New York Tuesday,\nIn a speech in New York, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren called for a comprehensive re-evaluation of the regulation of broker-dealers (intermediaries that effect transactions in securities), given the lessons of the financial crisis.\n\"Broker-dealers played a dramatic role during the crisis,\" said Rosengren. Given their dependence on unstable, short-term funding, \"broker-dealers can experience significant funding problems during times of financial stress and, unfortunately, that potential for problems has not been fully addressed since the crisis.\"\nBefore the crisis, broker-dealers' reliance on collateralized borrowing in the form of repurchase agreements was assumed to insulate them from runs, perhaps because many viewed collateralized lending as providing little default risk. But as Rosengren notes, this proved to be wrong once the crisis hit. \"Many of their creditors did not want to take possession of the collateral backing the repurchase agreements in the event of a default by a broker-dealer. As a result, there were widespread runs on broker-dealers, particularly those experiencing acute financial problems.\"\nThis was not, however, just a problem for broker-dealers. Because of broker-dealers' crucial role as market-makers, liquidity in the credit markets that support economic activity was severely impaired.\nRosengren added that the largest domestic net suppliers of repurchase agreement financing are money market mutual funds. \"During the financial crisis, deteriorating confidence in broker-dealers was compounded by the fact that investors were also fleeing money market mutual funds.\"\nGiven the lessons learned from the crisis, one might have expected less reliance by broker-dealers on repurchase agreements, and a significant increase in capital required of broker-dealers. \"What is striking is the lack of change - while there has been some improvement in capital, the 2013 liability structure looks surprisingly similar to the structure that prevailed before the financial crisis,\" said Rosengren.\nRosengren said that perhaps the most direct way to reduce runs related to unstable funding is to require financial organizations dependent on unstable funding, like broker-dealers, to hold significantly more capital than they would if they used stable sources of funding. He also suggested an increase in the capital required for any holding company with significant broker-dealer operations.\nThese and other potential policy remedies would have an impact on profitability, but given recent history, Rosengren believes that trade-off may be unavoidable and in the public interest from a financial stability perspective.\n\"Given the widespread support provided to broker-dealers and the difficulties they encountered during the crisis, a comprehensive re-evaluation of broker-dealer regulation is overdue.\"",

            "content": "The Central Bank of Guatemala, XXIII Cycle of Economic Lectures Guatemala City, Guatemala Monday,\nIn a speech at the Central Bank of Guatemala, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren discussed \"new\" monetary policy tools (including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases) and shared his opinion on how U.S. monetary policy could evolve.\n\"My own view is that the ‘new' monetary tools were essential,\" Rosengren said. He said that large-scale asset purchases, forward guidance, and the Fed's program to purchase longer-term securities (maturity extension), contributed to lower marketplace interest rates, \"a faster improvement in labor markets than forecasters were expecting,\" and rebounding asset prices. All this at a time when the U.S. economy was in the throes of a significant recession and a painfully slow recovery-with the federal funds rate hitting the zero lower bound.\nAs the Federal Reserve considers its exit from a very accommodative policy stance, significant attention is being given to potential financial stability matters. \"I personally do not expect that it will be appropriate to raise short-term rates until the U.S. economy is within one year of both achieving full employment and returning to within a narrow band around 2 percent inflation,\" said Rosengren. \"However, both the transition to higher rates and the operating procedure for doing so could entail financial stability effects that should be thoughtfully considered-and I am certain will be.\"\nRosengren offered a few potential exit-strategy options, including the possibility of a gradual and transparent reduction in the Fed's balance sheet, when that becomes appropriate. One possibility would be reinvesting \"all but a percentage of securities on the balance sheet as they reach maturity,\" and gradually increasing that percentage.\nTurning to raising rates, when appropriate, one tool would be raising the rate of interest that the Federal Reserve pays on excess reserves. Or, the Federal Reserve could engage in overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which are, in effect, collateralized loans to the Fed that would provide a risk-free rate of return to investors. The Fed \"could in effect place a floor on how low short-term rates would fall in the marketplace\" since investors would be unwilling to accept lower rates of return.\n\"Regardless of the tools eventually chosen, history shows that monetary policy ‘exits' can be unsettled,\" said Rosengren. \"Effective and transparent communication has become even more important.\" Still, he called it important to avoid binding specificity about future actions, since policies should be responsive to actual conditions.\n\"While the new policies have been instrumental in achieving better economic outcomes, clearly they are not without challenges,\" Rosengren noted. But \"we need to seize this opportunity to carefully consider a broader set of monetary policy tools-and how those tools impact financial stability in addition to inflation and unemployment.\"",

            "content": "Husson University Bangor, Maine\nIn a speech at Husson University in Bangor, Maine, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren advanced his view that monetary policy should remain highly accommodative until the economy is on more solid footing. He also explored the Fed's \"forward guidance\" challenges, and whether certain economic behaviors will return to pre-crisis norms.\nRecent incoming data continue to be consistent with a slowly improving economy, said Rosengren. This improvement is allowing the Federal Reserve to slowly pare back asset purchases and to be less precise in its forward guidance. However, he believes the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should be cautious and patient before returning monetary policy to a more normal, less accommodative stance.\n\"It has been more than six years since the beginning of the last recession, and yet we still have a national unemployment rate of 6.7 percent, and the PCE inflation rate is less than 1 percent,\" said Rosengren.\n\"And, actually, the widely reported unemployment rate understates the severity of the problem.\" The broader labor-market indicators that include workers who are \"part time for economic reasons\" and workers who have looked for a job in the past year but not in the past four weeks - \"marginally attached\" workers - remain unusually elevated by historical standards, he pointed out.\nA variety of economic data have behaved differently since the recession. It is possible that previous patterns will be re-established as the economy normalizes, or that \"'scarring' from the recession may have longer-lasting impacts if households, firms, and labor markets persist in behaving in ways that differ from historical patterns,\" Rosengren said. \"This uncertainty makes it particularly difficult to predict exactly what 'normal' will look like - and why specific forward guidance in monetary policy becomes difficult as the economy gradually improves.\"\nAt the March FOMC meeting, the Committee adjusted forward guidance and suggested they would hold shortterm rates at very low levels \"for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends…\"\nLaying out a possible evolution of forward guidance, Rosengren said \"my personal view is that, ideally, forward guidance should, for the time being, remain qualitative but increasingly be linked to progress in achieving our dual mandate, based on incoming economic data.\" He added, \"I believe the FOMC's forward guidance should be consistent with keeping interest rates at their very low level until we are within one year of reaching full employment and our 2 percent inflation target - and the guidance could explicitly state that intention.\"\nRosengren said he would like to see \"a more productive state of affairs\", where market participants are more attentive to the incoming data and how the data fit (or do not fit) with the expectations in the forward guidance - are \"focused more on data and less on changes in the setting of monetary policy tools.\"",

He also cited the still-high unemployment rate, and the very low inflation rate.\nThese factors are all consistent with significant \"slack\" in labor markets. Rosengren argued that the traditional, widely reported measure of unemployment \"probably understates the degree of slack remaining in labor markets and the economy more generally.\"\n\"While the unemployment rate has recently fallen to 6.6 percent, there remain 7.3 million Americans who want full-time work but are currently working part time,\" Rosengren said.\nThese 7.3 million Americans are working part time for so-called \"economic reasons,\" and likely reflect a large supply of underutilized workers. \"These are people who would be working full time if there were sufficient demand, but firms have reduced their hours because of business conditions,\" said Rosengren.\nAnd while the number of individuals working part time for economic reasons is down from a peak of approximately 9 million Americans after the recession, it remains dramatically higher than was experienced from 1994 until the financial crisis.\nIn addition to the broader measures of unemployment and under-employment, Rosengren cited the absence of inflationary pressures. \"The absence of pricing pressure\" is consistent with the still-elevated number of unemployed workers and the very elevated numbers of under-employed workers.\nWhile the unemployment rate has approached the 6.5 percent \"threshold\" noted in the policy statement of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Rosengren said there still remains significant slack in labor markets, actual inflation remains well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, and inflation expectations remain stable.\nRosengren noted that 6.5 percent is \"a threshold, not a trigger.\" As the unemployment rate falls and approaches that threshold, the Federal Reserve must make an assessment of the degree of remaining labor market slack as it sets monetary policy.\n\"It is vitally important that labor markets continue to improve,\" Rosengren said. In his view, \"Monetary policy should continue to be accommodative, supporting a return to full employment, given the very low inflation rates.\"",

In fact, the broader the measure, the further the current reading is from its pre-recession level and from its average from 1994-2007.\nRosengren noted that while his talk focused on data points and measures, \"we cannot lose sight of matters of human toll and potential, as well.\"\nThe broadest measure is particularly striking. It includes people who are available to work full time but have had their hours reduced, or can only secure part time work. \"Even at this point in the recovery, the measure is still nearly four and a quarter percentage points or 6.5 million people above the pre-recession average,\" said Rosengren. \"The large number of individuals working part time for economic reasons highlights the need for much more improvement in labor markets.\"\nAs a result, Rosengren firmly believes that monetary policymakers should remain quite patient in removing accommodation. \"In my view, labor-market conditions remain far from where they would need to be to justify raising short-term rates.\" This perspective, he noted, is consistent with the recent FOMC statement indicating that the Committee expects short-term interest rates to remain low well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below the 6.5 percent threshold.\nRosengren also pointed out how much higher all the unemployment measures are now than they were June 2004, when the Federal Open Market Committee first tightened rates during the previous recovery.\nAnd a patient approach to removing accommodation is further justified, said Rosengren, because inflation is so subdued - the inflation rate remains far below the Fed's 2 percent target.",

He spoke alongside fellow Reserve Bank Presidents from the New York, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia Reserve Banks, on a panel moderated by Stanley Fischer, Distinguished Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nRosengren mentioned three areas where the Boston Fed has provided distinctive perspectives on economic issues: foreclosure prevention, financial stability, and monetary policy.\nSeeing foreclosures disproportionately impacting low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in 2007 led to focused research, and bank-hosted events where thousands of residential borrowers and their lenders worked to prevent additional foreclosures. \"The long lines of borrowers illustrated for the Boston Fed and other Reserve Banks that there was an opportunity to reach more distressed borrowers - and to focus policy discussions to address these problems,\" said Rosengren.\nIn terms of financial stability, during the financial crisis the Boston Fed hosted a System emergency liquidity facility addressing the run on money market funds. The crisis, said Rosengren, \"spurred interest in identifying and putting in place regulations that could help avoid a repetition of the problems experienced and the need for emergency measures.\" The Bank has researched and continued to speak out about the ways the current structure of money market mutual funds \"poses significant financial stability concerns.\"\nRegarding monetary policy, Rosengren said the Boston Fed focuses on both elements of the \"dual mandate\" from Congress - employment as well as inflation. \"We have highlighted the high costs related to being below full employment for a long period of time. And we have strongly argued that policymakers should be as concerned about inflation being too low as being too high, given the toll and persistence of deflation were it to emerge.\"\n\"With the inflation rate below target and the unemployment rate significantly above target, we believe strongly that monetary policymakers have the opportunity to be patient in removing accommodation, speeding up the process of achieving both elements of the Fed's dual mandate.\"\n\"The work that I have highlighted today,\" Rosengren concluded, \"illustrates our belief that data-driven research can also inform and guide policy actions. \"Ultimately, our hope is to make a positive difference in these important areas.\"",

McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies Boston, MA\nIn a speech today at UMass Boston, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren illustrated how unusually weak this recovery has been, which emphasizes the need for continued accommodative monetary policy.\nSince January, the unemployment rate has declined from 7.9 to 7.2 percent, and interest-sensitive sectors such as housing and autos have continued to improve. But despite these gains, the economy remains challenged. \"Unemployment is well above what anyone would consider a 'full employment' rate, and inflation remains well below our 2 percent target,\" said Rosengren.\nThe Fed's monetary policymaking has helped keep interest rates low, encouraging recovery in sectors of the economy that are interest-sensitive. However, monetary policy has not been able to fully offset the headwinds created by the financial crisis, fiscal retrenchment, and unusually weak economies among many trading partners.\nRosengren pointed out that in the three most recent recoveries, employment returned to its previous peak within two years. But \"despite the significant lapse of time since the trough of the recession in 2009, we still have not reached the pre-recession peak in employment,\" he said. \"The severity of the employment loss, and the significant headwinds facing the economy after the severe financial crisis, are both important reasons why monetary policy has needed to remain quite accommodative.\"\nOne of the unusual features of this recovery has been significant fiscal retrenchment. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that fiscal austerity measures like higher income taxes and substantial reductions in real government spending have reduced 2013 GDP growth by 1.5 percentage points - a very significant headwind.\n\"Had the economy grown by 3.5 percent rather than 2 percent over the past year, job growth would almost surely have been stronger, unemployment lower, and inflation closer to the two percent goal,\" said Rosengren.\nRosengren presented analysis suggesting that a growth rate below 3 percent will result in a long wait to reach full employment - exacting, of course, a heavy human toll. \"At a growth rate of 2.8 percent, we do not attain 5.25 percent unemployment until the end of 2018.\"\n\"Even when the Fed eventually removes some of its accommodation, such as large-scale asset purchases, we will in my view need to leave short-term interest rates at their very low levels until there is much more progress reaching full employment and the 2 percent inflation target,\" he added.\nThe pace at which the Fed raises rates, when that becomes appropriate, should be in Rosengren's view quite gradual - unless the economy picks up much faster than is currently expected.\nOverall, Rosengren believes that monetary policy needs to continue to be data driven and, of course, to be focused on meeting the Fed's dual mandate – within an appropriate time frame.",

Long-term rates are still about 100 basis points higher than they were at the beginning of May.\nContributing to the rise were communications from Fed officials indicating that if the economy were to improve as they expected, it might be appropriate to reduce the central bank's monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities sometime in the fall.\n\"The fact that the possibility of small future changes in policy could elicit such large movements\" shows that central bank communication can be a powerful tool, but \"an imprecise and unpredictable instrument in terms of its impact on long-term rates.\"\nWhile monetary policy should be data driven, \"saying that we will rely on all available data series, and that we will respond to news in the data…probably provides less clarity and guidance than much of our audience desires,\" said Rosengren. \"A data-driven policy that also considers the risks to our forecasts can be difficult to communicate.\"\nFurthermore, \"it is likely that caveats about conditionality, data-driven policy, and responsiveness to incoming data are likely to receive far less attention\" than calendar dates, whether stated or inferred.\nRosengren pointed out that alternatives for policy communication also come with challenges. For instance, committing to altering policy on a particular date could lock policymakers into inappropriate policy actions, should conditions change. Or, tying policy to a particular economic variable risks that the variable will cease to be as a good proxy for overall conditions - for example if the unemployment rate drops due to workers leaving the workforce rather than from an increase in jobs.\n\"We have more learning to do on how best to communicate monetary policy during uncertain and unprecedented times,\" said Rosengren. \"However, the most important thing we at the Fed can, and should, communicate is that the policies we are setting are consistent with our goals - our mandate - for maximum employment and price stability.\"\nRegarding his own recent vote on policy, Rosengren said \"We saw weaker economic data emerge between the June and September FOMC meetings, and a higher than anticipated jump in market interest rates,\" along with the risk of fiscal disruption.

            "content": "Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce\nIn a speech today in Vermont, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren described why he strongly and unequivocally supported continuation of the Fed's asset purchase program at the last policy meeting.\n\"Policy actions of the central bank should be rooted in and dependent on incoming data,\" said Rosengren. The data the Fed's policymaking committee saw in September \"did not show the progress I had hoped,\" he said. The economy seems to be in a \"holding pattern - just treading water rather than gearing up to make significant improvement in the still very elevated unemployment rate.\"\nRosengren cited factors like tepid growth in payroll employment, the declining labor participation rate, sluggish consumer spending, and only modest GDP growth. In addition to the disappointing economic data, he noted the possibility of disruptions in the nation's fiscal policies and the recent rise in long-term market rates.\nAll this led Rosengren to believe \"it would have been premature to begin reducing the rate of Fed asset purchases.\" Premature reduction in monetary policy accommodation, he added, \"risks slowing the sectors of the economy that have shown the greatest strength - the interest-sensitive sectors.\"\nCommenting on the recent public debate over Fed communications, Rosengren said that \"Fed actions are not determined by Wall Street's expectations of what we might or should do\" but rather by goals like Main Street's return to full employment, and appropriate levels of inflation.\nRosengren also emphasized that policy that is dependent on incoming data cannot always be \"signaled\" clearly, in advance. \"Reality doesn't always live up to our forecasts. Had U.S. fiscal matters not been so problematic, and incoming data on real GDP and employment stronger, it may well have been appropriate to take some action in September. Unfortunately, those were not the facts we faced.\"\nDespite the communications challenges, policymaking that leans on actual data \"is far preferable to the alternatives,\" said Rosengren.\nLooking ahead, Rosengren said \"If the economy evolves as expected, policy should in my view include only a very slow removal of accommodation over the next several years - and that should only occur when the data ratify our forecast for an improvement in real GDP and employment.\" He stressed that \"We should seek to get the economy on a path to achieve both elements of the Fed's dual mandate - employment and inflation - as soon as possible.\"",

            "content": "Conference on Stable Funding\nIn a speech today in lower Manhattan, Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren made the case for strong money market mutual fund reform, which he believes is overdue.\nMoney market mutual funds (MMMFs) grew rapidly during the period leading up to the financial crisis, but experienced a significant outflow when the failure of Lehman Brothers led the Reserve Primary Fund to \"break the buck\" (becoming unable to maintain a fixed $1 per share net asset value). Concerned that other funds with exposure to Lehman might not be able to maintain their NAVs, investors ran from prime MMMFs, causing significant disruption in short-term credit markets.\n\"Many of the structural weaknesses that lie beneath these run episodes have yet to be fully addressed by market participants and policymakers,\" said Rosengren. \"MMMF runs should not be allowed to once again impede the flow of stable funding within our financial system.\"\n\"Promising a fixed NAV with no capital while taking credit risk is not sustainable,\" said Rosengren, \"especially in potential future crises where the response of the public sector will be substantially limited, compared to 2008.\"\nThe SEC recently proposed two MMMF reforms, and Rosengren recommended some changes and enhancements to the two proposals.\nThe first SEC proposal would treat institutional prime MMMFs like other mutual funds and allow the value of a share of the fund to float with the value of its underlying assets. The second proposal would require the fund's directors to impose a fee on all redemptions in the event that the fund's liquid assets fell below a specified threshold. (The proposal gives the fund's directors discretion to impose a lower fee or no fee if they determine that such action is not in the best interest of the fund.)\n\"The SEC proposal to allow funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates should be dropped,\" said Rosengren. \"This particular proposal is, in my view, worse than the status quo. Liquidity fees and gates fundamentally change the investor's decision-making process during a financial crisis\" in a way that \"might actually increase run risk\" and \"only increase the risk of financial instability.\"\nBut Rosengren strongly supports requiring a floating NAV for all prime funds, both institutional and retail, which would treat those funds like other mutual funds. \"With a floating NAV, if the assets properly reflect market values, the incentive to run that stems from the possibility of ‘breaking the buck' under the current rules should be significantly reduced.\"\nRosengren noted that \"MMMF reform is overdue. However, it is important that the reforms actually reduce the financial stability issues that remain.\"",

            "content": "The Economic Club of Minnesota Minneapolis, Minnesota\nI would like to thank the Club for your invitation, and in particular Mark Olson, a former member of the Fed's Board of Governors.\nIt is a great pleasure to be back in Minneapolis. When I was in graduate school at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, my brother was in graduate school at the University of Minnesota - so I have fond memories of visiting the Guthrie Theater, enjoying the lakes, and seeing the passionate way a warm day is welcomed in this city.\nI am also grateful that you were looking for a speaker in May, and not January.\nMy comments today will focus on the progress the economy has made since the Federal Reserve adopted an open-ended large-scale asset purchase program last September. I should mention as I always do that my comments reflect my views, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Fed's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAt last September's meeting of the FOMC, we took into account the August unemployment rate of 8.1 percent, and weighed concerns that without more policy accommodation the economy would make little progress in returning to full employment in the near term.\nSince adopting an asset purchase program focused on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) last September, [1] and additional longer-term Treasury securities in December,[2] there has been some evidence of strengthening labor markets. The unemployment rate is currently 7.5 percent, and payroll employment growth has averaged more than 200,000 jobs per month over the past several months. I expect that the unemployment rate will be down to 7.25 percent or a bit lower by the end of the year. This has been my forecast since the beginning of the year, but the recent incoming data have bolstered my confidence in that degree of improvement being achieved. In fact, I see it as a quite positive sign of underlying economic strength that labor markets are improving despite significant fiscal \"headwinds\" in the form of the payroll tax increase and the federal budget sequester.\nWhat are the implications of these incremental changes in the economy for the Federal Reserve's asset-purchase program? The program was designed to continue until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, as long as the benefits of the purchases outweighed the costs. My personal view is that the benefits of this accommodative monetary policy program still significantly outweigh the costs. While some improvement in labor markets has been achieved, it does not yet constitute progress sufficient to merit halting the asset purchase program.\nAs for the costs, the Fed is and should be very attuned to unintended consequences - and is intently monitoring an array of asset prices, including stock prices, housing prices, and other widely held assets. At this point it seems that fundamentals are prevailing, and potential costs are well contained.\nI also believe that the Federal Reserve should make adjustments to the program based on economic outcomes - that if the economy and the outlook improve, the rate of purchases could be gradually reduced, rather than suddenly stopped once we have achieved substantial improvement in labor markets. By the way, a reduction is one possibility, but of course adjustments could be down or up - because if the incoming economic data do not reflect improvements consistent with both elements of our dual mandate, I believe the Fed should be willing to increase asset purchases.\nProgress in the Economic Outlook\nFigure 1 shows how the Blue-Chip forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2013, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters[3] projection for the same, have evolved since last September. As the actual, current unemployment rate has slowly receded, there has been a gradual improvement in the forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of this year. Both forecasts are now projecting the unemployment rate will be lower at the end of the year than they had projected last September, although they are still not quite as optimistic as my own forecast.\nTurning to inflation measures, Figure 2 shows the evolution since last September of the Blue Chip forecast for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) at the end of 2013, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters projection for the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation rate at the end of 2013. Both show declining forecasts of inflation for 2013, as incoming data consistently come in below forecasts - raising the possibility that inflation will fall further below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.\nFigure 3 shows the growth in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.[4] We have been purchasing $85 billion in securities per month. Were we to decide to lower the purchase amount somewhat, our assets would continue to rise but at a more modest rate. Thus we would be increasing monetary accommodation, but at a slower pace.\nOf course, many asset prices are calibrated to the anticipation of our cumulative purchases. Thus the effect of our purchases ultimately depends on whether they result in a larger or smaller balance sheet for the central bank, which in turn depends on when the purchase program ends, given the pace of purchases. If asset purchases at a lower rate were to continue for longer than they would otherwise, the Fed's balance sheet could actually grow larger than it would with more sizable purchases over a shorter period. So, in short, altering the flow of purchases may or may not result in a smaller central bank balance sheet, depending on how long the reduced inflow of assets continued.\nFigure 4 provides a scatter diagram that attempts to depict the economy's experience with inflation and unemployment, the two facets of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate from Congress. Of course a variety of factors play a role in these outcomes, not just monetary policy - but it is instructive to look at the actual recent experience.\nOn the horizontal or x axis I have plotted the PCE inflation rate minus 2 percent - so when the inflation rate is at our target, 2 percent, the dot should lie on the vertical or y axis. If inflation is above 2 percent it will be to the right of the vertical axis and if inflation rate is undershooting our target it will be to the left of the vertical axis. By the way, while the FOMC has only had an explicit 2 percent inflation target for the past 16 months, there is strong empirical evidence suggesting that the central bank had an implicit 2 percent inflation target over the past two decades.[5]\nThe chart's vertical or y axis focuses on the employment side of our mandate. It plots the deviation of the unemployment rate from the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) estimate of full employment. When the unemployment rate is above the full employment level, the observations are above the horizontal or x-axis, and when the unemployment rate is below the full employment level the observations are below the horizontal axis.\nIn short, a hypothetical \"bull's eye\" outcome reflecting the dual mandate framework could show up as an inflation rate of 2 percent and an unemployment rate at the CBO's estimate of full employment - and such an observation would lie at the intersection of the two axes. Points that are near the intersection of the axes could be considered close to achieving both elements of the mandate.\nThe three red diamonds represent the most recent three quarters. They appear in the upper left quadrant, where unemployment is well above the full employment level and inflation is below target. The red diamonds are well above the cluster of observations representing quarters where performance was closer to mandate (closer to the origin where the axes cross) - but at the same time are much closer to the origin than at earlier stages of the recovery, when we experienced much higher unemployment rates than we see currently.\nFigure 5 provides the same information as Figure 4, but uses the core PCE measure of inflation rather than the total PCE. With the core measure, the more volatile food and energy prices that the Federal Reserve cares about but cannot control are excluded. Clearly this measure of the inflation rate does not show as wide a range of observations, in particular because it does not encompass the significant swings in oil prices that we have seen over the past two decades.\nThe chart clearly shows a dense set of observations near the origin and a somewhat less dense set of observations above the three red diamonds. The chart implies that we are transitioning from being well away from full employment, and have been moving closer to the horizontal axis as the economy has recovered.\nFigure 6 shows total PCE inflation over a longer time period, the past three decades. The solid horizontal line reflects the most recent observation of total PCE inflation. While there are three periods when total PCE inflation has been lower over the past 30 years, the current PCE inflation rate is much lower than it has been over most of that period.\nFigure 7 shows the core PCE inflation over the past three decades, again with the most recent observation reflected in a dark horizontal line. This shows even more starkly just how low the inflation rate is currently. The current core PCE inflation rate is close to the low point for the past 30 years.\nSwitching from inflation to unemployment, Figure 8 shows the unemployment rate over the past three decades with a dark horizontal line at 7.5 percent unemployment, the current unemployment rate. While the unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its peak during this business cycle, it is still quite high. At an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent, the rate is above the peak level in the last prior recession (2001) and near the peak level associated with the 1990 recession.\nThe charts highlight that while we have seen some improvement in labor markets, the unemployment rate remains well above what can be considered full employment, and the inflation rate remains well below target. In fact, core inflation remains at the very low end of recent experience, and the unemployment rate is close to the cyclical peaks of the past two recessions. And as I mentioned before, potential unintended costs of the accommodative policy are not currently evident. Taken together, these facts provide the rationale for my own view that, while we have seen some improvement in labor market conditions, significant accommodation remains appropriate at this time.\nDisaggregated Labor Market Data\nFigure 9 shows the pattern of unemployment by state - with dark green representing states that have had a decline in the unemployment rate of 1.0 percent or more since last September, light green representing states that have had a decline between 0.5 and 1.0 percent, yellow representing states that have had a decline ranging from 0.0 to 0.5 percent, and red representing states that have had an increase in the unemployment rate.\nThe overall improvement in unemployment rates has been widespread. Only five states had higher unemployment rates in April 2013 than in September 2012, and one of them is North Dakota - a state that has a very low unemployment rate of 3.3 percent. Some of the states with the biggest declines in the unemployment rate have been among those with very high rates, such as Nevada, Rhode Island, California, and Florida. Also notable is the fact that states that were particularly troubled by falling real estate values and elevated foreclosure - such as California, Florida, and Nevada - are all among the states with the largest declines in the unemployment rate.\nIt is also instructive to examine not just unemployment rates but the state patterns in payroll employment growth - since in some states the unemployment rate fell in part because of declines in the labor force, which could be the result of discouraged workers giving up the search for a formal job. Figure 10 shows payroll employment growth by state. Dark green states have had positive payroll employment growth that expanded faster than the labor force. Light green states have had increases in payroll employment but no increase in the labor force. Yellow states have had positive payroll employment growth, but the expansion has been slower than growth in the labor force. And the red states have had declines in payroll employment.\nIt is encouraging that only three states have experienced declines in payroll employment. Also, those states that were hit hardest by declines in real estate values - California, Florida, and Nevada - are all among the states that have experienced growth in payroll employment that exceeds growth in the labor force.\nTaken together, Figures 9 and 10 indicate that improvements in labor markets have been relatively widespread, and that regions that were particularly impacted by real estate problems are among the states that have recovered the most since last September. Overall, this indicates that the economic recovery is beginning to positively impact most regions of the country.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, since last September there has been continued slow improvement in labor markets. Most regions of the country now have better labor market conditions than they did last September. Despite the slowly improving labor market outlook, the unemployment rate remains at levels close to the peaks of the past two recessions, indicating that the economy remains far from the full employment level.\nIn terms of monetary policy, it would in my view be premature to stop the Fed's large-scale asset purchase program at this time. I believe the Fed should continue the purchase program until we see more sustained improvement in labor markets and have greater confidence that the economic recovery is sufficiently self-sustaining to yield continued progress in reducing the still very high unemployment rate.\nHowever, I would also say that it may be undesirable to abruptly stop purchases, so it may make sense to consider a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases if we see a few months more of gradual improvement in labor markets and improvement in the overall growth rate in the economy - consistent, by the way, with my forecast, which is somewhat more optimistic than that of many private forecasters.\nI would reiterate that with an open-ended asset purchase program, changing the flow of purchases does not necessarily yield, in the end, a smaller central bank balance sheet. That would depend on having a fixed point for cessation of purchases, combined with a lower flow of purchases. So, even if we were to adjust the rate of monthly purchases, the ultimate size of the Fed's balance sheet would depend on the point of cessation. If economic growth proves sufficient and the purchase program was not extended over a longer time period, the size of the balance sheet could be smaller than otherwise.\nThe bottom line is that we really need to see the economy grow, as I hope and expect, more quickly than at the 2.1 percent growth rate it has averaged over the recovery. Faster growth is essential to attaining inflation and employment outcomes consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate from Congress - and more broadly for the economic wellbeing of the many Americans who have struggled through a long and slow recovery.\nThank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "The Global Interdependence Center Central Banking Conference Milan, Italy\nIt is a great pleasure to be invited to participate in the Global Interdependence Center's conference on central banking. This continues to be a period requiring unusual policy actions - even experimentation - at central banks around the world. So it is important to understand the forces affecting policymaking as well as the impact of the policies, both domestically and internationally.\nI always begin my talks by noting that these remarks reflect my views, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). That is always the case, but I want to emphasize it today given my topic - the implications of fiscal austerity for monetary policy. This is a matter of great debate in most developed economies, as governments contend with relatively high debt burdens - at least by recent historical standards - as well as the after-effects of a deep recession, and a painfully slow recovery. Certainly fiscal matters are the subject of intense debate in the United States.\nOf course, much of the discussion - and many of the headlines - about fiscal austerity emanate from Europe. But, when we total up the cuts in state and local government spending and employment, the cuts in federal government spending and employment, and recent tax policy, we actually see that U.S. fiscal policy has been quite contractionary for several years now - beginning well before the recent payroll tax increase and the reductions in fiscal spending mandated by the federal sequester.\nUnlike some of its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank has a dual mandate, covering both inflation and employment. So it is important when pursuing our mandate and shaping our policy to consider all the factors that affect the economy. Fiscal policy is one such factor. For instance, contractionary fiscal policy will in the near term place downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment.\nCurrently the personal consumption expenditures or PCE inflation rate, which the Federal Reserve chose as the measure for its inflation goal a year ago, is about 1.0 percent. This is well below our 2 percent target. And the unemployment rate is 7.5 percent, which while lower than many other countries remains well above most estimates of U.S. \"full employment.\"\nIt is critically important that the United States achieve a balanced and sustainable framework for government spending, but the timing is important. For example, making cuts too quickly to restore balance to the federal budget deficit will have a dampening effect on near-term growth and the recovery, and as such will push the economy further from a state that achieves both elements of the Fed's dual mandate. [1]\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, fiscal policy is just one of the many factors that the Federal Reserve considers in policymaking, but one can see how the central bank - pursuing its dual mandate - would be likely to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance if government spending were contracting in the midst of an economic recovery. Again, timing is key - long-term budget sustainability is vital, but decisions to front-load or back-load cuts in spending, or increases in taxes, have implications for the current stance of monetary policy.\nOf course, some observers and indeed policymakers have criticized the degree of monetary accommodation in the United States as excessive. However, when we look at the data on outcomes in the economy to date, I see it differently. The outcomes could lead one to argue that policy has not been sufficiently accommodative. Inflation is below target and unemployment is above target, and based on the summary of economic projections (or \"SEP\" ) - which is published by the Federal Reserve and summarizes the economic forecasts of FOMC members - this condition is likely to persist for several more years.\nAt least part of this \"miss\" on inflation and employment outcomes can be attributed to the emergence of more fiscal restraint than might have been expected. You may recall that the federal sequester was originally designed to pose such an unpalatable outcome that all involved would prefer to reach an agreement on a more balanced fiscal approach. Unfortunately, that has not been the result. By definition, the increased fiscal austerity in the U.S. has weakened the outlook for near-term GDP growth, since government spending is a component of GDP.\nTo be sure, the progress of the economic recovery to date has been frustrating. And, despite the presence of significant headwinds - fiscal, financial, and otherwise - some have suggested that the slow recovery proves that recent monetary policy actions have been ineffective. However, contrary to what these observers claim, I would argue that the \"miss\" on outcomes is not evidence of monetary policy ineffectiveness. In fact, in the sectors of the economy that are likely to be most responsive to lower interest rates, like housing and consumer durables, recent growth has been quite rapid. Contrary to the notion that policy has not succeeded, I would actually say that monetary policy has been quite effective in offsetting the contractionary effects of recent fiscal policies.\nAs everyone here probably knows, the overall growth rate of real U.S. GDP during this recovery has been quite slow - averaging roughly 2 percent at an annual rate. Growth has also been slow relative to the growth that occurred during the most recent economic recoveries in the U.S. However, looking at overall GDP growth is only part of the story. Looking more closely at the components of real GDP reveals differences, and provides more perspective on the U.S. economy's tepid recovery.\nFigure 1 shows growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers. Essentially this is just the consumption and investment components of GDP (household and firm spending), net of inventory accumulation. It tries to capture the growth in domestic spending not attributed to government spending or to the foreign sector.\nOver the past three years, real final sales to private domestic purchasers have been quite strong, reflecting particular strength in consumer durables and residential investment[2] - the most interest-sensitive sectors. With household and firm spending relatively strong, other sectors of the economy must account for the slow growth in overall GDP.\nFigure 2 adds real final sales to all domestic purchasers to Figure 1, so the difference between the two lines is attributable to government spending. This measure has only been growing at a rate a little below 2 percent over the past three years. In short, while household and firm spending has been relatively robust, it has been offset by a fiscal headwind - reduced government spending - netting out to only tepid overall growth.\nFigure 3 shows the growth in government spending. Clearly, over the past three years the growth rate has been mostly negative, so real government spending has brought down the GDP total. This is in contrast to the earlier period, during the recession, when government spending was actually an offset to the weakness in the private sector. During that period there was federal stimulus money, and federal funding for state and local governments designed to help them better \"weather the storm.\"\nFigure 4 shows another way to measure the impact of government spending on economic growth - the percent contribution of government spending to the percent change in real GDP. Recently, the increase in real GDP includes a sizable negative contribution from reductions in government spending.\nFigure 5 splits government spending into the federal component, and the state and local component. State and local spending has been weak over the entire recovery, although as the economy has recovered and state and local governments have seen more tax revenue, it has become much less of a headwind than earlier in the recovery. On the other hand, federal spending has recently fallen sharply and is likely to continue to be a source of weakness in the GDP accounts, given the federal sequester.\nHistorically speaking, this pattern is unusual during economic recoveries. Figure 6 indexes government spending at the trough of the recession to 100 for the current and previous three recoveries. This recovery has been unusual in that government spending is not normally a significant source of headwind as the economy recovers - in fact usually the opposite is true.\nConsider the 1982 recovery - the last time we had a recession where the unemployment rate reached 10 percent. Government spending by this stage of the recovery had increased by 20 percent, one reason that particular recovery was strong. By contrast, during this recovery real government spending has declined by more than 5 percent over the 15 quarters of the recovery.\nFigure 7 shows total payroll employment and private payroll employment. The difference between the two reflects changes in government employment. During the recession, total payroll employment was less negative than private payroll employment, indicating the government sector was not shedding jobs at a time when the private sector was significantly downsizing. However, during the recovery period, private sector payroll employment has grown more rapidly than the total, reflecting the loss of government jobs that has persisted over the recovery.\nIn sum, fiscal restraint during the recovery has been notable and naturally has factored into the recovery's pace. While the sectors that are sensitive to monetary policy have responded to the Fed's accommodative policy actions, the results have not fully offset the headwinds, fiscal and otherwise, that we have seen. The overall result has been economic growth around 2 percent, and only a very gradual improvement in labor markets.\nThe unemployment rate is about 7.5 percent - at least 2 percentage points above my estimate of the U.S. \"full employment\" rate. Add to this the recent U.S. inflation experience and the other factors I have been discussing, and it seems to me that highly accommodative monetary policy is currently appropriate.\nDespite concerns expressed by some that increases in the Federal Reserve balance sheet may be inflationary in the near term, the inflation rate remains well below target nearly five years after our balance sheet expanded significantly. Make no mistake, in many situations such balance sheet activity would be inflationary, but the fact that it has not been underlines how challenging the recent financial crisis, recession, and slow recovery have been.\nFigure 8 provides total and core PCE inflation. Core PCE inflation has remained below 2 percent since December 2008 and currently is only 1.1 percent, close to the low for the last five years. Total PCE inflation is slightly below 1 percent, at 0.97 percent.\nIndeed, the level to which the inflation rate has fallen would actually be of some concern in the event that the economy was hit by a negative shock. Such a situation might echo the historical experience of Japan, where low rates of inflation were not addressed and a significant negative shock caused Japan to experience deflation, which has been quite difficult to reverse. In the U.S. there is no evidence that inflation expectations have fallen, despite the actual experience of persistently undershooting the Fed's 2 percent target. However, remaining at such a low rate of inflation rate does increase the risk that a negative shock could alter the stable inflation expectations that we have experienced.\nFigure 9 shows one reason why this is a concern. It plots the real interest rate as the difference between the 3-month Treasury rate and the year-over-year core PCE inflation rate. In effect, this assumes that inflation expectations equal the past year's core PCE inflation rate. Since the 3-month Treasury rate has remained very close to zero for more than four years, the movements in the real rate must primarily reflect changes in the other part of the equation - the inflation rate. Importantly, as the inflation rate falls, the real interest rate rises. Higher real interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, after controlling for changes in inflation. Japan has been an extreme example of this dynamic, given that deflation has caused the real interest rate to remain positive despite a weak economy and falling prices.\nIn sum, the longer we in the U.S. remain so far below our 2 percent target, the greater the risk that inflation expectations could fall and real interest rates rise. In part to offset this risk, the Fed has conducted large-scale asset purchases that increase its balance sheet.\nFigure 10 shows central bank assets in the United States, United Kingdom, and the Euro area. Each central bank has expanded its balance sheet, with the U.K. and the U.S. being particularly active.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has seen a renewed increase in the size of its balance sheet, starting in the fall of last year, reflecting the new program of open-ended asset purchases. This latest program has helped keep prevailing interest rates low, so that housing and consumer durables can continue to support the expansion and so we make further progress on both elements of the Fed's dual mandate (inflation and employment).\nWe have seen a gradual improvement in labor markets, in part as a result of these actions. The unemployment rate was 7.8 percent in September when we began the program, and is currently 7.5 percent. Employment growth averaged about 150,000 jobs per month in the three months ending in September; then for the most recent three months (February through April) employment growth averaged over 200,000 jobs per month. But despite modest increases in employment in recent months, the employment-to-population ratio remains low.\nThis last observation carries the more ominous implication that, while there has been improvement in labor markets, much of the improvement in the unemployment rate is just a result of workers leaving the labor force. More significant improvement in the employment picture will require growth in real GDP that is faster than the 2 percent we have been averaging.\nAs I noted earlier, restrictive fiscal policy has had an impact on near-term economic growth during the recovery. As Figure 11 shows, cuts in real government spending in the United States over the past three years have been quite large. In fact, the cuts in government spending in the United States have been much larger in percentage terms than in the U.K. or the Euro area, where fiscal austerity has received more attention. Fiscal restraint is one of the headwinds that we factored into monetary policymaking, framed of course by our mandates from Congress.\nWhile Figure 11 considers only government spending, Figure 12 presents a broader measure of fiscal austerity, by including the revenue side and adjusting for the business cycle. The chart shows the impact of changes in taxes as well as government spending, after controlling for economic growth (removing the impact of the business cycle). Looking at the change in the general government structural budget balance[3] relative to potential GDP over the period 2010 to 2013, the degree of fiscal austerity is fairly similar across the U.S., U.K., and Euro area.\nGiven the additional restraint imposed by the federal sequester, the United States is likely to once again be a leader in cutting government spending. The Federal Reserve should, and will, continue to consider the likely state of fiscal policy, like many other economic factors, in making monetary policy.\nThe U.S. economy has continued to gradually improve. Labor markets have also slowly improved. The progress has been in part the result of the accommodative monetary policy. While household and firm spending has grown relatively rapidly, it has been partially offset by headwinds including cuts in government spending - resulting in only modest overall economic growth.\nLet me close by reiterating that a long-term sustainable solution for fiscal balance is absolutely in the country's interest. But timing is an issue. We have suffered a severe financial crisis, a deep recession, and a painfully slow recovery. Fiscal policy is obviously the jurisdiction of the legislative and executive branches of government, but given the economic realities I would urge policymakers to consider scenarios where some elements of fiscal rebalancing take effect only after the economy has more fully improved, and the possibility of a less restrictive fiscal stance until that time.\nThank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "\"Building a Financial Structure for a More Stable and Equitable Economy\", the 22nd Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference on the State of the U.S. and World Economies, The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College and the Ford Foundation\nI am grateful to the Levy Institute for the invitation to take part in a conference that focuses on such a vital goal - building a financial infrastructure that supports a more stable and equitable economy.\nBefore I begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that I join you from a community in Boston that on Monday endured a terrible and profoundly cruel tragedy, at the Marathon. My thoughts are with the many people who were wounded, with those –including Boston Fed staff – who were uninjured but at the scene, and most of all with the families and friends of those whose lives were lost.\nSo with heavy hearts we turn to the matter at hand, perhaps finding a small bit of encouragement in doing work that intends to make things better for all participants in our economy.\nToday I would like to discuss the risk of financial runs – and the implications for the stability of the financial system, which underlies a well-functioning economy. Of course, I would like to note that the policy views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath have significantly increased the attention policymakers devote to financial stability issues. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) and a variety of new bank regulatory initiatives, including the Basel III capital accord, are intended to reduce the risk of similar problems in the future. For commercial banks, the policy changes stemming from the crisis have been increases in bank capital, stress tests to ensure capital is sufficient to weather serious problems, increased attention to liquidity, and new measures intended to improve the resolution of large systemically important commercial banks.\nWhile these measures are clear steps toward improved financial stability, I believe the actions taken around other, less traditional financial institutions have not moved nearly as markedly or at the same pace as the corrective actions taken for commercial banks. This is despite the fact that less traditional financial institutions were at the epicenter of the crisis. My comments today will focus on one area that has received less attention in the United States than elsewhere – the need to ensure that large broker-dealers will not need to rely on a government safety net in the future.\nThe financial runs that beset highly leveraged institutions, structures, and products were significant and unfortunate features of the financial crisis. While deposit insurance reduces the risk that depositors will flee en masse from commercial banks, the financial crisis highlighted that other types of financial institutions and structures were also highly susceptible to runs. For example, money market mutual funds, which are not required to hold capital, experienced credit losses and significant investor flight (i.e., runs) during the crisis. Policymakers put in place temporary backstops – insurance funded by the U.S. Treasury and a liquidity facility facilitated by the Federal Reserve – to avoid further collateral damage. Since then, there has been much public discussion of regulatory actions that could significantly reduce the financial stability concerns around money market mutual funds – which are regulated by the SEC – but industry opposition has been vocal, and no significant actions have as yet been taken.[1] Former SEC Chair Schapiro was right to pursue money market fund reform, and now that her successor is confirmed I am hopeful that the SEC will revisit this issue.\nStructured investment vehicles (SIVs), which financed long-term, risky financial assets with short-term commercial paper, also encountered trouble during the crisis. Investors who were concerned about the valuation of the SIVs’ long-term assets “ran” from the short-term commercial paper the SIVs issued to finance their assets, causing many SIVs to fail or be wound down.\nAdditionally, broker-dealer firms – which were assumed by most observers to present less risk of a run because their borrowing is often fully collateralized – proved vulnerable and also played a prominent role during the crisis. However, widespread questions about the appropriate valuation of collateral during the crisis made it apparent that collateral in and of itself was not sufficient to avoid runs.\nBrokers act as agents for others and are defined by the Securities and Exchange Act to include those that “engage in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.”[2] Dealers are “engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for their own account.” Both are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are subject to a variety of regulations including net capital requirements, restrictions on the use of customer accounts, and various accounting and reporting requirements.\nBroker-dealers are a critical component of our financial infrastructure. They act as “market-makers” in securities, ensuring that markets remain highly liquid and that financial transactions can be conducted efficiently and effectively. Still, notwithstanding their market making strengths and capabilities, these organizations were not immune from the widespread seizing up of markets – and indeed found themselves at the center of events in the financial crisis.\nTwo prominent broker dealers failed at critical junctures during the crisis. The first major broker-dealer failure involved Bear Stearns. Arguably the most disruptive failure was Lehman Brothers. Emergency loans were provided to Bear Stearns, and in the wake of its assisted merger a variety of emergency credit facilities to backstop the industry were set up. Additional actions were taken, to forestall more widespread runs after the failure of Lehman Brothers. \nDespite the central role that broker-dealers played in exacerbating the crisis, too little has changed to avoid a repeat of the problem, I am sorry to say. In short, I firmly believe that a reexamination of the solvency risks of large broker-dealers is warranted.[3]\nHence, my remarks today will highlight the need for more regulatory focus on broker-dealers. I will begin by discussing the role of broker-dealers and their experience during the financial crisis. I would then like to detail some of the policy actions taken during the crisis – actions that backstopped broker-dealers and prevented further collateral damage. Then I will examine why being housed within a bank holding company should not obviate the need for the broker-dealer subsidiary to hold more capital. Then I will provide some concluding observations.\nBroker-Dealers and the Financial Crisis\nSome of the largest broker-dealers serve as a counterparty to the Federal Reserve when the Fed buys and sells securities – performs so-called “open market operations” – in the conduct of monetary policy. Traditionally, most of the Fed’s open market operations involve the buying and selling of Treasury securities, so broker-dealers that are the largest players in this critical market play a significant role in maintaining liquidity and market functioning. Most of these firms are also very active in making markets in a variety of other financial instruments, and as such they help to facilitate well-functioning credit markets more generally.\nFigure 1 describes 10 large broker-dealers in 2006, with the fourth column noting their crisis-era changes. Rather striking changes have occurred among the largest broker-dealers as a result of the financial crisis. Two of the largest became bank holding companies (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns – formerly ranking among the ten largest – both failed. Merrill Lynch, which fell just short of the top 10 in 2006, was acquired while it was experiencing financial difficulties. And one of the largest foreign broker-dealers in 2006 (UBS) needed to be supported by its home government. These outcomes occurred despite two substantial emergency lending programs that provided backstop support to the large broker-dealers during the crisis.\nDramatic changes in organization and ownership occurred among these critical entities. That, and the extent of their problems during the financial crisis, make it clear that they did not hold sufficient capital to weather the magnitude of problems they would face during the crisis. \nLiquidity Facilities during the Crisis\nIn 2008, the Federal Reserve established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) to help stem the financial crisis by providing overnight loans to primary dealers. The assets that were put up as collateral for the loans were subject to significant “haircuts” – that is, the dealers could only borrow against a fraction of assessed market value – to protect the Fed and minimize the risk that could stem from a borrower’s default. As with the Fed’s so-called Discount Window lending to commercial banks, lending was at the Fed’s primary credit rate and the dealer was fully responsible for the repayment of the loan, beyondthe collateral pledged (in other words, the loans were made with recourse).\nThe program began in March 2008, in the wake of the Bear Stearns failure, and ended in February 2010.[4] The PDCF was, in effect, tantamount to the Fed providing a “Discount Window” type lending facility to primary dealers – in order to ensure adequate functioning in securities markets that are a key part of the tri-party repo market.[5] These markets are widely-used in short-term financing, and importantly are used by the central bank to conduct the trades in short-term government securities that allow it to maintain the federal funds rate at the level dictated by the FOMC. It is important to point out that when all was said and done, all the loans made through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility were paid off in full; and the sizable returns to the Fed generated by the program were remitted to the U.S. Treasury.\nAs Figure 2 highlights, primary dealers used the program extensively during the crisis. Lending peaked at $156 billion.[6] And, while foreign-owned primary dealers did participate in the program, it was much more extensively utilized by domestic primary dealers.\nThe Fed established a second emergency program, the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), which allowed primary dealers to lend less-liquid securities to the Federal Reserve for one month, for a fee, in exchange for highly liquid Treasury securities. This program provided needed liquidity to the market at a time when trading in a wide variety of securities had become impaired. The TSLF was also announced in March 2008 and ended in February 2010. As with the PDCF, there were no losses on the program, and the revenue the Federal Reserve generated in operating the facility was returned to the Treasury.\nFigure 2 also shows that the peak balance of the term securities lending program was $246 billion.[7] This program had roughly equal participation by domestic and foreign primary dealers.\nFigure 3 shows the loans outstanding over time with the PDCF. The outstanding loans peaked in the fall of 2008 as primary dealers found it particularly difficult to fund their positions.\nFigure 4 provides the outstanding securities lent through the TSLF. Again the peak occurs in the fall of 2008, when liquidity for securities trading became particularly problematic.\nIn sum, broker-dealers experienced dramatic difficulties during the 2008 crisis, and the Federal Reserve needed to temporarily backstop broker-dealers with substantial lending. Given that recent history, the assumption that collateralized lenders like broker-dealers are not susceptible to runs has been proven wrong.\nAt the same time, broker-dealer capital regulation by the SEC remains largely unchanged, despite the lessons of the financial crisis. Consequently, broker-dealers remain vulnerable to losing the confidence of funders and counterparties should the world economy again experience a significant financial crisis.\nAs I have mentioned in other speeches,[8] during stress periods, bank holding companies with a low concentration in broker-dealer activities had less stock price response to the stress periods than institutions with greater concentration in broker-dealer activities. We have also examined the data on credit default swap spreads – a market gauge of the cost to insure against a party’s default – and the data show materially higher spreads during times of financial turmoil for major banks with higher concentrations of broker-dealer activity.\nMoreover, the current broker-dealer situation vis-à-vis capital poses the potential for significant moral hazard. Were a crisis to once again cause serious problems in liquidity and in securities-market functioning, it is quite possible that programs such as the PDCF and TSLF would need to be considered again (notwithstanding likely public opposition to what could be perceived as “bailouts”). If broker-dealers assume that they will once again have access to such government support should markets be disrupted, they will have little incentive to take the steps necessary to shield themselves from financing problems during a crisis and thus minimize their need for a government backstop.\nBroker-Dealers and Bank Holding Companies\nOne of the fallouts of the financial crisis is that many of the large broker-dealer operations are now part of bank holding company structures. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies during the crisis. Bear Stearns was acquired by J.P. Morgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America. While these large broker-dealer operations are in bank holding companies, there are significant regulatory requirements and restrictions that apply, including capital thresholds and limitations on transactions between the FDIC-insured depository subsidiaries and the affiliated broker-dealer subsidiaries. Despite these restrictions, however, broker-dealers can still pose a risk to the broader organization by leaning on the parent bank holding company for support and, accordingly, reducing the availability of funds at the parent company to support any FDIC-insured depositary.\nBank holding company capital requirements are applied to the consolidated holding company. Arguably, the appropriate level of consolidated capital should depend on the risks inherent in the holding company’s liability structure, as well as in its assets. For example, to avoid solvency risk for a firm dependent on wholesale funding may require significantly more capital than a firm with all insured deposits, because of the possibility for runs and “fire sale” disposal of assets. Those bank holding companies that are primarily funded by insured deposits are unlikely (or less likely) to suffer a substantial run. However, a bank holding company may find that liabilities of the broker dealer may be more susceptible to runs. In addition, current regulations restrict bank subsidiaries from supporting non-depository subsidiaries with funds from the insured depository. This suggests to me that bank holding companies with large broker-dealer affiliates should hold more capital to reflect the reduced stability of their liabilities during times of stress.\nFigure 5 shows the Tier 1 common equity capital ratio over time, and Figure 6 shows the leverage ratio over time. While bank holding companies with large broker-dealer operations generally have more Tier 1 common equity than bank holding companies with little or no broker-dealer activity, this result primarily reflects that broker-dealers hold securities, which have low risk-weights compared to loans. In contrast, bank holding companies with large broker-dealer operations tend to have much lower leverage ratios than bank holding companies with limited broker-dealer activity. However, given the very different risks of runs posed by broker-dealers and their less stable liability structure, an argument can be made for higher capital requirements for broker-dealers as well as organizations, such as bank holding companies, with significant broker-dealer operations.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would just reiterate that broker-dealers did not perform well during the financial crisis. Many of the largest broker-dealers failed or were converted to or subsumed into bank holding companies. Despite these structural changes, significant government intervention was required to maintain market functioning and liquidity, in markets key to the stability of the U.S. financial system and the economy that relies on it.\nUnfortunately, despite this history of failure and substantial government support, little has changed in the solvency requirements of broker-dealers. The status quo represents an ongoing and significant financial stability risk. In my view, then, consideration should be given to whether broker-dealers should be required to hold significantly more capital than depository institutions, which have deposit insurance and pre-ordained access to the central bank’s Discount Window.\nThank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 57th Economic Conference: \"Fulfilling the Full Employment Mandate - Monetary Policy, The Labor Market\" Boston, Massachusetts\nThe data in this speech have been updated to reflect revisions to the data series that occurred after it was delivered. These updates were made because the speech was being prepared for publication in an issue of the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking.\nIt is a pleasure to welcome everyone attending the Boston Fed's 57th economic conference. The topic of this year's conference - fulfilling the full employment mandate - is particularly relevant today, when most developed countries have unemployment rates substantially above their estimates of full employment.\nI see a number of important questions about the full employment mandate that should be explored at this conference and beyond. For example, how should central banks react to high unemployment rates in a period of well-anchored inflation expectations? Does the unconventional nature of many of the monetary policy tools currently being employed alter how central banks should think about their mandate? And even more fundamentally, what should be the mandate of central banks - should there be a single inflation goal, as occurs in many countries around the world, or should there be a dual mandate as has evolved in the United States?\nMy answer to this last question is an emphatic yes, by the way - the Fed should have a dual mandate. But I expect that conference participants and those reading the papers and presentations from afar will gain fresh perspectives on these and other important questions.\nBefore I begin my remarks I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nIn the United States, we currently have an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent and an inflation rate of 1.5 percent using the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index. Falling short on both elements of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate from Congress - inflation and employment - provides a strong rationale for continuing our highly accommodative monetary policy. With inflation at 1.5 percent, and with my own forecast that inflation will remain well below our 2 percent target over the next two years, one could argue that consistently missing our inflation target alone would justify a highly accommodative policy. However, coupled with persistently high unemployment, the justification for continuing highly accommodative policy by large-scale asset purchases is clear. This is a time when the dual mandate is important and, I would add, particularly useful for communicating policy to the general public.\nThe dual mandate is being utilized in recent Federal Reserve policy statements to clearly describe to the public how monetary policy will be conducted, going forward. In particular, recent FOMC policy statements have made explicit reference to the role of employment in considering changes to our monetary policy stance. With regard to the Fed's large-scale asset purchase program, the March statement said the FOMC will continue purchases \"until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.\"\nThe FOMC statement highlights that maintaining interest rates at exceptionally low levels will be appropriate \"at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent long-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\" Data for both inflation and unemployment measures are readily available, and with the publication four times a year of the Committee's projections for these variables via the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)[1] the public can observe the FOMC's outlook for these measures as well.\nBoth inflation and unemployment are viewed by the public as important gauges of economic well-being, so tying the trajectory of policy to data and published forecasts for these economic outcomes clarifies things for the public. In fact, this type of central bank communication has been quite effective. With a clearer understanding of the policy objective, yield curves have flattened and forward rates have fallen to reflect policy announcements.\nSuch announcements would likely not be as straightforward in countries with a single mandate related only to inflation. In such countries, a modest shortfall in inflation relative to target would not by itself justify a significant monetary policy response. In circumstances such as today's, invoking a non-mandated \"escape clause\" to attend to real activity while inflation is well-contained would not do justice to the size of the problems in the real economy. To be sure, many countries have found ways around these difficulties in recent times, but the Federal Reserve's dual mandate is especially well suited for times like these, when it is clear that the primary rationale for our aggressive policies derives from the first-order problems in labor markets, not from a second-order escape clause that \"permits\" (but does not mandate) monetary policymakers to consider labor markets.\nGiven the communication challenges that are present with a single inflation mandate at a time of a significant slack in resources (high unemployment), it is natural to ask if there are significant differences in how central banks with a single inflation mandate behave relative to central banks with a dual mandate. The conclusion I will reach - by looking at the data - is that with a dual mandate in the United States, our inflation outcomes have been at least as good as those in countries with a single mandate, and we have the added benefit of a much clearer and more direct way to communicate with the public.\nI would note that several nations have been considering revisiting their central bank mandate. The evidence I will share with you today suggests that there should be a broader consideration of moving to a dual mandate, such as we have in the United States.\nTo give you an overview of my presentation today, I will first explore whether countries with a single mandate, focused solely on inflation, generate different outcomes. Then I will explore the issue of central bank actions when inflation exceeds the target. I will follow with a discussion of current policy in the United States and the role played by the dual mandate, before offering some concluding observations.\nDo Countries with a Single Inflation Mandate Generate Better Outcomes?\nThe first matter I would like to explore is the inflation experience of single mandate versus dual mandate countries. The data show that many countries over the past 20 years have been very close to a 2 percent average inflation rate over that period; a result that is surprisingly consistent with price level targeting, where large increases or decreases in inflation are offset in future periods to maintain the same average inflation rate. Interestingly, by this measure the United States performs a bit better than countries that use only an inflation mandate.\nFigure 1 shows the inflation experience of the U.S., the Euro area,[2] and Japan over the past 20 years. The price level for each is indexed to 100 in January of 1993. The Federal Reserve now has a 2 percent inflation target tied to the PCE inflation index, and the red line indicates the path the price level would take if inflation were exactly 2 percent for the entire 20 year period (which would be consistent with either error-less inflation targeting or perfect price level targeting).\nWhile the 2 percent inflation target was only officially adopted by the FOMC in January 2012, the figure suggests that the Federal Reserve observed an implicit inflation target of 2 percent over this 20-year period. The actual path followed by the PCE level is represented by the darker blue line. The fact that the PCE price index always returns to the 2 percent line over the 20-year period implies, naturally, that the average inflation rate over that period was 2 percent. Also, the proximity of the PCE price index to the 2 percent line indicates that inflation deviated very little from 2 percent during that period. The only period of significant divergence occurred when oil prices rose significantly in 2008, and that divergence clearly proved temporary.\nOne might think that the unexpectedly severe \"Great Recession\" forced the inflation rate back to the 2 percent path. However, it is interesting to note that even before the Great Recession, the average was very close to 2 percent. With inflation generally falling at the beginning of this period, the pattern is consistent with a U.S. monetary policy that may not have \"forgiven\" the period of above-target inflation as \"water over the dam,\" as a 2 percent inflation targeting central bank would, but instead engineered below-2 percent inflation in the ensuing period, to achieve a 2 percent average inflation rate - much like a price-level targeting central bank would.\nThis in turn implies a central bank that was more restrictive following the period of above-2 percent inflation than a pure inflation-targeter would be, potentially leading to a higher unemployment rate than would otherwise have been the case. Of course, it is possible that these inflation outcomes simply arose from a pattern of exogenous shocks (such as oil shocks) to inflation that produced an average inflation rate of 2 percent, in spite of the central bank's actions. But whether this pattern arose by chance or design, the chart is striking. The chart also highlights that during the most recent period of highly elevated unemployment - when we have remained persistently below 2 percent inflation - we could have justified even more accommodative policy than was generally enacted.\nThe Euro area's harmonized price level index is shown on the chart in lighter blue. While also quite close to the 2 percent line, the inflation rate in Europe has tended to be higher than that of the United States, and at the end of the 20-year period is above the 2 percent line, and above the inflation index for the United States. Of course, the ECB took control of monetary policy in January 1999, at the inception of the euro, but the statement is still true if one begins this exercise at that time.\nThe other line provides the index for Japan. While recently the Bank of Japan has discussed a 2 percent inflation target, that does not appear to have been the target over the last 20 years. Reflecting the inflation outcome, it would appear that the Bank of Japan has been following essentially a zero percent price level target and that the recently announced intent to hit a 2 percent target, if implemented, will be a significant change from the past 20 years in Japan.\nGiven the very different inflation target and outcome for Japan during much of the last two decades, I will today focus on countries that have been following a 2 percent inflation target. Figure 2 shows the price level path for the U.S., the U.K., and Sweden. Both the U.K. and Sweden have 2 percent inflation targets, and both remain fairly close to the 2 percent line. However, at the end of the 20-year period, the U.K. is above the 2 percent line and above the inflation experience of the U.S. while Sweden is below. Clearly the United States has yielded no worse outcomes on inflation than other countries with a single mandate.[3]\nIn terms of inflation outcomes, all countries have been relatively close to the 2 percent inflation line (with the exception of Japan), consistent with a move toward well-anchored expectations in all of these countries. However, it is notable that even with a dual mandate the United States is the country closest to the 2 percent line at the end of the 20-year period.\nIt is, of course, possible that over two decades inflation could average 2 percent, but that a country with a dual mandate might allow inflationary pressures to build up more than a country whose sole mandate was inflation, leading to more pronounced swings of inflation (and the price level) around its target. One way to explore this possibility is to examine the cumulative squared deviation of inflation from the 2 percent target - a measure that places greater weight on large misses from the target. Figure 3 provides the cumulative squared deviations of the annual (year over year) inflation rate from a 2 percent inflation target. The analysis[4] is symmetric, meaning it places an equal weight on large misses above 2 percent and similarly on large deviations below 2 percent.\nThe most rapid increase in the cumulative squared deviation from the inflation target for the United States was in 2008, when rising oil prices caused a sharp increase in energy prices that persisted for several quarters. However, in the period after 2009 the U.S. line really flattens. The unemployment rate remained quite elevated, and the inflation rate stayed quite close to the 2 percent target and, in fact, is much flatter than in Sweden and the U.K., which have only an inflation mandate. In addition, the misses - the cumulative squared deviations from the inflation target - over the entire period are smaller for the U.S. than for the U.K. or Sweden, but somewhat higher than for the Euro area.\nHowever, since much of the miss in the United States is the result of the temporary spike in oil prices in 2008, it is worth examining whether underlying inflation measured by core inflation provides the same picture. Core inflation measures exclude the volatile food and energy segments that are obviously very important but are not controllable by central banks. Figure 4 provides the cumulative squared deviations of core inflation from a 2 percent target. For the United States we see that the increases in the cumulative squared deviations from the inflation target are quite gradual over the entire period. Perhaps even more notable, using core inflation the cumulative squared deviations for the U.S. are lower than those of the U.K., Sweden, or the Euro area. Furthermore, when the unemployment rate is the highest in the United States, the increases in the cumulative squared deviations are less than in the other three areas.\nNow I'd like to show a figure, first with the countries not labeled and then with them labeled. This figure, Figure 5 , provides a scatter chart depicting core inflation and unemployment outcomes over the past 16 years. The key question, I would suggest, is whether inflation and unemployment outcomes for the United States, with a dual mandate, look significantly different than for other countries.\nIn terms of quarterly inflation outcomes, both Sweden and the U.K. have more high-inflation observations than the United States. Sweden, the U.K., and the Euro area all have a higher range of quarterly inflation outcomes than the United States. In terms of unemployment, the United States has more density in unemployment rates between 4 and 6 percent relative to the other three, but the range of unemployment rates is wider than that of the U.K. and Sweden.\nThat the U.S. has a tighter inflation range and a broader unemployment range than many other countries with a single inflation mandate is striking, as is the very high unemployment rate in Europe. The results suggest that criticism that a dual mandate country might suffer from more frequent and enduring spells of high inflation is overdone - and if anything the evidence might raise the question of whether, with a dual mandate, there should have been more aggressive monetary accommodation during periods of elevated unemployment, particularly in the past five years.\nAnother interesting aspect of the analysis shown in Figure 6 is whether the dual mandate results in the United States having a larger concentration of high-inflation outcomes during periods of high unemployment. But the opposite is true, as most of the high-inflation observations occur during periods of low unemployment. Interestingly, for Sweden and the U.K. more of the high-inflation observations are during periods of high unemployment, which might partly be attributable to open economies that may be more exposed to exchange rate and energy shocks.\nTo summarize, I would note that the dual mandate in the United States has been criticized by some for providing an inflationary bias. However, the data show little such evidence. Inflation outcomes in the United States over the past 15-20 years appear to compare quite favorably to those of single mandate countries.\nCentral Banks' Actions When Inflation Exceeds the Target\nOne way of capturing differences that might exist between single and dual mandate countries is to examine whether single-mandate central banks were much more reticent to ease policy if unemployment were high and they were currently somewhat above their inflation target. Such an approach can certainly be justified when bound to a single mandate for inflation, but the justification for easing policy in such a circumstance would be that the inflation forecast suggests that inflation will return to 2 percent. Contrast this with a dual mandate country, where rather than relying on an inflation forecast that is expected to fall - possibly because of slack resources - the central bank can directly appeal to the elevated unemployment rate as balancing the concerns over a somewhat elevated inflation.\nOver the past five years, short-term interest rates in many countries have been close to, or at, the zero lower bound. So it may be instructive to explore just how willing countries have been to expand their central bank's balance sheet during periods of above-target inflation. Figure 6 shows the core rate of inflation in the U.S. and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in recent years. The only observations of core inflation above 2 percent were in 2008. However, this was the period of the most rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. With a dual mandate, a period of fast-rising unemployment rates makes it straightforward to communicate the need to rapidly expand the balance sheet.\nFigure 7 provides similar information for the Bank of England. Unlike the United States, the core inflation rate in the U.K. has been above 2 percent for much of this period. Interestingly, the most rapid expansion of the balance sheet occurred in late 2008 when core inflation was above 2 percent, and the balance sheet began to grow further in 2011 when inflation was well above the 2 percent target. So, despite the single mandate, the Bank of England has been willing to expand its balance sheet even with core inflation rates persistently higher than target.\nFigure 8 contains similar information for the Euro area and the European Central Bank. The most rapid increase - but not the largest - in the balance sheet was in 2008 when the core inflation rate was above 2 percent. While core inflation remained below 2 percent for the rest of the period, the expansion of the balance sheet resumed in 2011 when the core inflation rate was at a local maximum very close to 2 percent.\nFigure 9 provides the same information for Sweden. Sweden, like other countries, increased its balance sheet when core inflation was above 2 percent. What is distinctive about Sweden is the reduction in the central bank's balance sheet, and how low their balance sheet has remained despite being well below 2 percent core inflation.\nThe good news is that periods of higher inflation do not seem to constrain any of these countries from easing monetary policy when the real economy is in serious distress, even if they are above a 2 percent inflation target. But again, I would observe that with a dual mandate, the communication around these periods and policy actions is likely to be much more straightforward. Perhaps a lesson to draw from these episodes is that, regardless of the formal structure of the central bank, all of us are dual mandate banks \"at heart.\"\nCurrent Policy in the United States and the Dual Mandate\nFigure 10 looks at an estimate of the period-by-period loss function for the U.S. central bank, proxied by the squared deviations of inflation from an inflation target (not cumulative) in the top panel, and the squared deviations of unemployment from an estimate of full employment utilizing the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessment of the natural rate for each year (not cumulative) in the bottom panel. There is no stated inflation target for the United States during much of the sample period, so that during the earlier periods a filter is utilized that provides a smoothed inflation target that ranges from 2 to 5 percent.[5]\nFigure 11 stacks the deviations from the previous two charts. The misses from inflation are shown in dark blue and the misses from unemployment are in light blue. In effect this reflects a loss function that places an equal weight on inflation misses and unemployment misses. Parenthetically, I would point out that an interesting question to consider is whether the possibility of long-term effects of unemployment, as will be discussed during this conference, should alter the relative weights of inflation and unemployment in the loss function.\nMost of the large misses in the 1970s and early 1980s were the result of very high inflation rates. After the Federal Reserve dramatically reduced inflation rates under the leadership of Chairman Volker, inflation has remained well anchored and has not resulted in large inflation misses. What is more striking is that now the misses have been associated with periods of high unemployment. The Great Recession resulted in such a large miss in unemployment that the squared deviations were higher than in any period in the past 30 years. Even now, the squared deviations remain at a high point for the past 20 years. This may indicate that during the period of the 1970s and early 1980s too little weight may have been placed on inflation misses but in the more recent past we may have placed too little weight on unemployment misses - and if anything, we should have acted more aggressively to reduce the unemployment rate.\nWith the unemployment rate at 7.5 percent and both core and total PCE inflation at 1.5 percent, the communication of accommodative monetary policy is quite straightforward. We are well above our unemployment target and well below our inflation target, so highly accommodative policy is both appropriate and necessary.\nFurthermore, the dual mandate, coupled with the FOMC's January \"framework\" statement, has made it easier to provide forward guidance. The threshold language has clearly stated that unemployment is an important objective of monetary policy and an important determinant of when we will begin to raise short-term interest rates. Similarly, the FOMC statement makes clear that we are looking for substantial improvement in outlook for the labor market, in a context of price stability, before stopping large-scale asset purchases. Given how far we are below the 2 percent inflation target, these actions could be motivated by large misses on inflation - but the dual mandate provides a much clearer, more transparent, and direct way to communicate with the public.\nConcluding Observations\nThe dual mandate in the United States has provided a clear and transparent way to communicate the need for aggressive monetary policy. Our inflation outcomes have been as good as, if not better than, many countries with a single inflation mandate. Furthermore, many central banks with only a single inflation mandate have chosen to expand monetary policy accommodation despite being at or above a 2 percent inflation target.\nThe general similarity of actions across central banks, despite differing mandates, is illuminating. Again I would suggest that the dual mandate may have made the communication around our actions easier than in single mandate countries. But the historical record shows that even this dual mandate central bank may have been a bit slow to place sufficient emphasis on unemployment deviations. If that is the case, then as countries consider or reconsider their central banks' mandate, moving to a dual mandate may provide dual benefits: on the communications front, it will make it easier to provide forward guidance that conditions on both inflation and employment outcomes. On the policy action front, a dual mandate may help to ensure that employment gets an appropriate weighting in the central bank's assessment of appropriate policy, particularly during times when employment ranks first in terms of economic woes.

            "content": "Early Childhood Summit 2013: Innovation and Opportunity\nI am pleased to be participating in this early childhood summit. And I would particularly like to thank the Boston Children's Museum for continuing its tradition of innovative work on behalf of children by co-sponsoring this and other events during this their centennial year. The Boston Children's Museum is a close neighbor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and my children and I personally benefitted from this proximity as we often took advantage of its many exhibits and programs. It was the only museum that my children did not respond with, \"not another museum\" when I told them where we were going that day.\nI became aware of some of the important economic work being done on early childhood programs in a series of discussions I had over the years with fellow Fed economist, Art Rolnick. Art was then the re search director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and made two important observations. First, if you help someone early in life, they reap a lifetime of benefits. And a second close corollary is that programs that help kids learn have a high return for them as individuals and for society as a whole. These observations have been validated by good empirical research and have served as a foundation for the funding of important programs that apply these observations. Others on the agenda today are going to discuss such programs in more detail.\nWhile many of the economic studies on the value of good early childhood programs have focused on the average return from these investments, I am going to discuss how educational attainment can impact the variability of a person's economic outcomes. In particular, during economic downturns, those with poor educational attainment are disproportionately likely to become unemployed and that unemployment can have a far-reaching impact on other aspects of life, including expected future earnings, wealth and home ownership.\nThe second point I will emphasize today is the importance of helping those communities that have the fewest resources available to address both economic and social problems. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been doing significant work in mid-sized cities in New England, and we will be announcing a new mid-sized cities initiative in Massachusetts next month in conjunction with a number of partners including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Living Cities, and the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership. Today I want to highlight that if you are living in a mid-sized city in Massachusetts with a high poverty rate, your chances of educational attainment look quite different from what they would be if you lived in a mid-sized city with a low poverty rate. While there has been progress in more widespread adoption of early childhood education - especially in reaching communities that have difficulty affording such programs - it is exactly these communities that potentially generate the highest returns on such investment. This is particularly important because these investments not only influence educational attainment as a youth, but can be an important element in employment opportunities and job retention as an adult, even during difficult economic times, such as those we continue to experience.\nEducational Attainment and the Variability of Economic Outcomes\nFigure 1 displays the unemployment rate by educational attainment. First, notice that the unemployment rate for less educated workers is always significantly higher than the rate for more highly educated workers. Second, while the unemployment rate approximately doubled during the Great Recession across all education categories, the unemployment rates of people with low educational attainment rose to staggering levels. For those with less than a high school education, the unemployment rate was a bit below 8 percent prior to the recession and reached a peak of almost 16 percent as a result of the recession. Thus, nearly one in six people with less than a high school education were unemployed at one point during the recession. Thankfully, the unemployment rate for those with low educational attainment has come down, despite the only modest overall recovery we have had to date.\nWhile it is well established that spells of unemployment have a significant negative impact on labor income for years, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston staff recently examined the impact that a long duration of unemployment has on future labor income.[1] Their research found that 10 years after a spell of unemployment, an individual makes 16 percent less on average than an individual who did not experience that spell of unemployment. The impact is even larger with longer-duration unemployment. After 20 years, the earnings of a short-duration unemployed worker are roughly the same as those without a spell of unemployment, but the individual with a long-duration spell of unemployment is still somewhat worse off. Furthermore, there is no \"catch up\" for the years of lost income. It is important to note that our staff found that longer-duration unemployment is negatively correlated with education.\nNot surprisingly, those lost opportunities result in unfavorable collateral effects. For example, spells of unemployment have a significantly negative impact on future homeownership rates, and those who experience a period of long-duration unemployment have a significant permanent loss in wealth.[2] Spells of unemployment also entail huge non-pecuniary costs to the individual and the family.\nSuch observations are important in a variety of contexts, but let me mention two. In terms of monetary policy, it implies that spells of unemployment can have a lasting impact long after the economy recovers. If spells of unemployment have a persistent impact on income, wealth and home ownership, then a more aggressive response to persistently high unemployment rates is warranted. More rapid economic growth is likely to not only reduce the unemployment rate, but also reduce some of the collateral damage the economy may otherwise face from the spells of long-duration unemployment. Continued accommodative policy, such as continuing our asset purchase program through this year, is an appropriate response to labor market scarring.\nParticularly relevant for today's discussion is that the failure to help children reach their highest potential educational attainment level can have a significant impact on their likelihood of experiencing significant economic shocks when the economy experiences a downturn. This much greater risk of unemployment as an adult for the child who does not receive a sufficient education impacts a variety of other economic outcomes, such as whether an individual can buy a home or accumulate wealth to afford a reasonable retirement or educate their children.\nA critical factor in obtaining sufficient education in many disadvantaged areas is the availability of programs that help maximize a child's potential. Government cuts that do not consider the long-run return on investment from such programs are likely to be both economically inefficient and could potentially cause longer-run harm to the economy.\nA Comparison of Massachusetts Cities\nI would like to highlight differences in educational attainment by examining Massachusetts mid-sized cities with the highest poverty rates versus those with the lowest poverty rates.[3] These charts demonstrate that patterns in failure to obtain a high school education actually are fairly persistently present in the data by educational outcome at much earlier ages.\nFigure 2 shows the differences in the share of children under age five living below the poverty level, comparing those cities with the lowest overall poverty rates to those with the highest poverty rates as well as to the statewide average for all cities and towns. In four of the five high poverty mid-sized cities, more than 40 percent of the children under age five are living below the poverty level. In all five cities, the share of children under age five living below the poverty level is more than double the average for Massachusetts. Among the cities with the lowest poverty rates, four of the five cities have child poverty rates less than half the Massachusetts average of 16.8 percent.\nFigure 3 shows that differences for children occur as early as three or four years of age. In the low poverty mid-sized cities, 67.7% of children age three and four are enrolled in a preschool or pre-kindergarten program. In contrast, less than half - 42.6% - of children age three and four are enrolled in school in the high poverty mid-sized cities. Lawrence has the lowest share at 26.8%.\nFigure 4 shows that the patterns of enrollment visible in Figure 3 are quite similar to the patterns in third grade Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) test scores. Cities with high poverty rates report much lower scores on both the reading and math MCAS tests, sometimes having less than half the proficiency rate of cities with low poverty rates. Though there are many population differences between high and low poverty mid-sized cities that can affect test scores, it appears that early school enrollment is a critical factor that clearly has an effect on student achievement.[4]\nFigure 5 shows that these patterns persist with high school graduation rates. In all five low poverty cities, 80 percent or more of students graduate from high school in four years. In all five high poverty cities, less than 70 percent of students graduate from high school in four years. In four of the five high poverty cities, the high school graduation rate is 61 percent or lower. This has implications for future earning power, as those who do not graduate from high school earn much less on average than those with higher educational attainment. As I highlighted in the beginning of my talk, this also has significant implications for the likelihood of experiencing a spell of unemployment with the associated collateral impact. Thus, not only the stream of earnings but also the volatility of earnings may be impacted.\nChildren in high poverty cities face considerable challenges on many levels. However, access to educational opportunities can have a significant impact on their economic outcomes throughout their lives. Given the discrepancies between childhood outcomes related to education, both public and private resources need to be focused on providing more educational and developmental opportunities for children living in cities with fewer resources, resources that have been particularly strained over the past five years.\nConcluding Observations\nThe work of this conference is important. There is more to be done to make sure that all children have the opportunity to succeed and flourish. Educational opportunity is an important element in the likelihood of that happening.\nI do want to end on a positive note. Figure 6 shows that there has been a significant increase in the number of children with access to full day kindergarten. Research and policy advocacy regarding early childhood education has had an impact, and resources from private and public sources are increasingly providing more educational opportunities for children. However, as my charts indicate, more work needs to be done, and I hope all of us in this room will do our part to make that happen.\nThank you.",

            "content": "The Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire Bankers Association Saint Anselm College, Manchester, NH\nIt is a pleasure to be back in New Hampshire to discuss the economic outlook with you. While economic growth was modest in the latter part of 2012, recent data suggest some improvement in the first part of this year. On balance economic growth has been a bit better than expected, considering the notable headwinds of fiscal restraint and issues in Europe that reflect the still-fragile global recovery. The current expectation of many private-sector forecasters is that the economy will expand slightly more rapidly than its potential rate of growth in the near term.\nStill, the economy remains far from where we want it to be, especially given the Fed's dual mandate for maximum sustainable employment and price stability. The national unemployment rate is 7.7 percent, far higher than the 5.25 percent unemployment rate to which I think the economy will eventually return. Similarly, the inflation rate (measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index or PCE) over the twelve months ending in January 2013 averaged only 1.2 percent, far below the Federal Reserve's PCE inflation target of 2 percent.\nToday, I will discuss both the economic outlook and the role that monetary policy has played in the improving economy. Certainly the \"no free lunch\" doctrine applies here, so along with the benefits there are some potential costs. I will discuss some of the potential costs of our current policies, particularly those dealing with financial stability. Of course I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nTo preview my conclusions, I will argue that the Federal Reserve's policy of open-ended purchases of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities - currently proceeding at a pace of $85 billion a month - has contributed importantly to the gradual improvement in labor markets that we have seen, despite the fiscal headwinds. I will also argue that the costs of these policies are outweighed by their benefits, and by the costs likely to result if we did not pursue them.\nIt is clear to me that monetary policy actions have been benefiting the economy. Some observers argue that the beneficial effects are offset by the cost of reduced financial stability. Certainly, this is an area we need to watch closely. Financial stability is exceptionally important to me personally, as my research and talks underscore. I have been vocal about significant policy actions that, in my view, should be taken to avoid financial stability problems in the future. However, I see little evidence that our monetary policies are generating significant financial stability problems at this time.\nPut simply, the benefits of our asset purchases have exceed any reasonable estimate of the costs. The asset-purchase program is having the desired impact, and the faster economic growth that is in part the result of monetary policy actions will bring us more quickly to a situation where this degree of additional accommodation is no longer necessary.\nThe Economic Outlook\nI expect the economy to grow at a rate a bit above 2 percent in the first half of this year, despite the headwinds resulting from more fiscal austerity than many expected. As Figure 1 shows, government spending, a GDP component, has declined for the past two years - even before the federal sequester. This is true for federal spending as well as state and local government spending. Fiscal austerity has been offset in part by improvements in housing and also auto sales (part of consumer durables). Housing and autos are the most interest-sensitive components of GDP, and their strength partly reflects the positive impact of Federal Reserve policies to push long-term interest rates down with our large-scale asset purchase program.\nFigure 2 provides the longer-run economic forecasts of the 19 Reserve Bank presidents and Federal Reserve Board governors who participate on the FOMC, taken from the periodic report known as the Summary of Economic Projections or SEP.[1] Once a quarter, each FOMC participant is asked to provide an economic forecast for a variety of variables, including the unemployment rate and the PCE inflation rate.\nIn the left panel, the range and midpoint of forecasts for unemployment at the end of 2013 and 2014 are provided for the most recent FOMC meeting, in March, and for the FOMC meeting last September when we began the open-ended purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Last September the FOMC participants expected the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 would range from 7 to 8 percent, with a midpoint of 7.5. At the March FOMC meeting the range from the SEP was narrower and lower - the range was now from 6.9 to 7.6 percent, and the midpoint had dropped by 25 basis points.\nMy own forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 is just above the midpoint of the range. Similarly, the forecast range for unemployment at the end of 2014 is now lower, and the midpoint fell by 30 basis points to 6.6 percent. For 2014, my forecast is again just a bit above the midpoint. In sum, FOMC participants see improvement in the unemployment forecast since last September - for both 2013 and 2014. And, comparing the midpoints of the unemployment rate forecast for the two years shows that the overall level has declined, but the size of the decline expected over 2014 is the same - six tenths.\nTurning to the right-side panel, the midpoint of the PCE inflation forecast for FOMC participants fell from 1.8 to 1.65 for 2013 between the September FOMC and the March FOMC meetings. Furthermore, the midpoint forecast for 2014 fell from 1.9 to 1.75. My own forecast is below the midpoint of the range for both 2013 and 2014.\nIn sum, the March SEP was quite positive, with declines in the midpoint of the forecast ranges for both unemployment and PCE inflation, in 2013 and 2014. However, even at the end of 2014, unemployment is expected to be almost 1.5 percentage points above most estimates of full employment. Given that the midpoint for the inflation forecast for both years is below our 2 percent target, I believe we have the flexibility to pursue a policy that encourages faster economic growth and a more rapid improvement in the unemployment rate. To me, that implies that we should continue our large-scale asset purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities through this year - although the amount may need to be adjusted up or down, depending on how the economic situation evolves.\nBenefits and Costs of Large-Scale Asset Purchases\nThe Fed's purchases of long-term securities are intended to lower longer-term interest rates, like rates on home mortgages and auto loans, in order to promote faster economic growth. These purchases also encourage households and businesses to shift somewhat from riskless low-yielding short-term government securities to investments that bear a sensible degree of risk and have a stronger economic effect, like corporate bonds and stocks.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston staff use two different models to estimate the impact of asset purchases on the economy. One explicitly articulates household and business behaviors[2] and the other is a purely statistical model.[3] Reassuringly, both models give similar results. Our best estimate implies roughly a one-quarter-point decrease in the unemployment rate for a $500 billion asset-purchase program.\nBy this estimate, the benefits of the large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) program include almost 400,000 additional workers employed for every $500 billion in purchased assets (which earn a return while on the Fed's books), returning to our inflation target somewhat more quickly, and a somewhat better debt-to-GDP ratio as a result of the lower interest rates and improved GDP and revenue growth. While these estimates are model dependent, and are clearly subject to estimation error, they are broadly consistent with other studies - and with the growth in asset prices and the expansion of the interest-sensitive components of GDP seen since last September.\nOne of the potential costs of LSAPs would be that they could be viewed as inflationary. Most of the original critics of LSAPs voiced concerns over the potential impact on inflation and inflation expectations. However, the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet began in 2008 and five years later we currently have a PCE inflation rate of 1.2 percent, well below our 2 percent target. As the years have passed and inflation has remained stable, this criticism has become more muted.\nFOMC participants seem to agree with the assessment: looking at the range of FOMC participant forecasts from the SEP for March, most FOMC participants expect us to undershoot our 2 percent target this year. And in 2014, while the range extends to 2.1, most indicate that inflation would be between 1.5 and 2.0 percent, undershooting or achieving the target (an observation based on the published central tendency of 1.5 to 2.0 percent).\nA second concern expressed about LSAPs is that they might undermine financial stability. For example, if one expects the Fed to hold short-term rates at zero for a long time, one could choose to earn higher yields by taking on substantially more credit risk or interest rate risk.\nIt is true that the Fed's low interest rate policies are intended in part to encourage additional, responsible risk-taking of the sort that advances real economic activity and growth - for example, spurring banks to lend more rather than hold cash or government securities, and non-financial firms to seek higher-return investment opportunities rather than hold cash or government securities. However, it is possible that the expectation of very low interest rates could encourage too much risk-taking - in the form of excessive leverage, or taking credit risks that could not withstand another economic slowdown. While some households or firms may choose to take excessive risks, even with more normalized interest rates, it is the widespread taking of excessive risk - particularly by leveraged institutions - that is likely to generate macroeconomic financial stability problems.\nSome observers have noted that stock prices have risen quite substantially, as shown in Figure 3. Of course our policy doesn't specifically target a particular asset market, but encouraging investors and firms to take more of the responsible risks that contribute to economic activity and growth would normally mean a shift into assets such as stocks and investments with higher expected returns.\nMake no mistake, this would pose a financial stability problem if stock prices had significantly outstripped likely earnings - particularly if those investing in stocks had become highly leveraged and were particularly susceptible to a reversal in share prices. Figure 4 shows the S,P stock index relative to composite operating earnings over the past 20 years. While share prices have risen, so have operating earnings. And while there has been some increase in the ratio, it remains well below the 20-year average.\nOther observers have noted that residential real estate prices have risen significantly in some markets, and that this could pose a financial stability problem. Since homes are normally purchased with significant debt, a rapid increase in prices could risk a repeat of the problems of the past decade. Figure 5 looks at the Case-Shiller home price index in a variety of metro areas. While housing prices have risen in many markets recently, they remain well below their peak prices.[4] Furthermore, if one compares an index of house prices to a rent index (shown in Figure 6), assessing whether the values of homes are approximately in line with the services that housing provides, as reflected in rental rates, house prices have now fallen enough that this ratio is back to where it was in 1993, well before the run-up in house prices.\nAnother area of potential concern has been the increase in high-yield bond issuance. As Figure 7 shows, high-yield bond rates are now quite low by historical standards. Firms with high-yield bonds are refinancing those bonds, much like many homeowners have refinanced their houses. This refinancing improves the cash flow of companies and makes them more able to weather shocks. However, if these yields are low because investors are bidding aggressively for such bonds, reaching or over-reaching for higher yields in a low interest rate environment, then one would expect to see high-yield bond rates fall more than relatively safe rates, reflecting the strong desire to take on more of this debt at lower yields, despite its higher risk.\nBut Figure 8 shows that while the rates have fallen, the decline has largely been due to the decline in all longer-term interest rates, including safe Treasury rates. The spread between high-yield bonds and 10-year Treasury securities is currently a little below the average spread over nearly two decades.[5] That means that high-yield rates have fallen approximately in line with the rates on safe assets, implying stable rather than significantly diminished compensation for risk. As Figure 9 shows, high-yield bond rates have been declining in a manner quite similar to other rates, such as rates on home mortgages and auto loans.\nAnother way of looking at this data is that it highlights that the Fed's program of purchasing long-term securities has affected a wide range of financial markets - from safe Treasuries to mortgages to auto loans, well beyond the specific market where the purchases are occurring. Thus, the decline in high-yield bond rates looks broadly in line with other market rates, and the widespread rate declines are contributing to a faster recovery than we would otherwise have seen.\nAnother potential area of concern is banking. Asset price declines have much greater economic impact if the assets are held by highly leveraged financial institutions that may respond to losses by reducing credit availability.\nBut here the news is somewhat encouraging as well. Figure 10 shows the capital ratios for the largest banks. Since the financial crisis in 2008, banks have restored their capital ratios and have raised capital levels much higher than they were prior to the crisis and recession.[6] This reflects both the banks' tightening of their own capital levels, and the impact of our stress tests which reveal whether banks are holding sufficient capital to weather an adverse economic, interest rate, or market shocks. The increased scrutiny of capital and liquidity at banks has made banks much better positioned to withstand potential future economic shocks.\nEven with more capital and liquidity, however, banks can experience difficulties if they have very large positions in asset classes that could experience sharp declines in prices. Some observers have noted that farmland prices have experienced significant increases in prices over the past several years. Figure 11 provides the banking industry's exposure to agricultural loans by bank size. The largest banks have relatively small exposures to agricultural loans, less than 1 percent for the largest two categories (banks exceeding $1 trillion in assets and banks from $100 billion to $1 trillion in assets). Furthermore, in some parts of the country, like New England, and in urban based areas, banks' exposure to agricultural loans is quite modest.\nHowever, in agricultural areas of the country, some smaller banks have a significant exposure to agricultural loans. Such exposures are unlikely to pose financial stability concerns that affect the nation. In such circumstances, raising interest rates on all household and business borrowers, as some have suggested might be appropriate in response to a boom even in such a narrowly-held sector, seems to me a very blunt tool to address this exposure. Instead, this seems a particularly good area for continued, enhanced supervisory focus with individual banks - with large agricultural exposures being challenged by bank supervisors to ensure the banks have sufficient capital to sustain a theoretical reversal in farmland prices.\nIn sum, broad-based financial stability concerns do not seem particularly acute at this time. Interest rates in most markets have fallen, and asset prices are rising. This is the expected and intentional result of the Fed's efforts to promote a more rapid return to more normalized conditions. As the economy continues to improve, and labor markets and inflation return to more normalized levels, the recent levels of monetary accommodation can be reduced.\nThis is not to say we should not be vigilant about potential financial stability concerns. We should remain humble about our ability to detect such imbalances, given our failure to do so in the recent crisis. Thus we should closely monitor whether the high degree of monetary accommodation is having unintended consequences. I would now like to briefly discuss some particular financial stability concerns that I believe should be watched carefully.\nFinancial Stability Monitoring and the Need for Additional Regulatory Focus\nWhile the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy has been an important driver of the current economic recovery, and the financial stability costs appear relatively modest at this time, we cannot be Pollyannas. There are areas that we should closely monitor. Some areas that bear watching, in my view, are specific markets where underwriting standards are slipping - or where rapid growth in financial products could become a more significant concern.\nIn terms of underwriting standards, the covenant quality on new high-yield bond issuance should be closely monitored. Bond covenants are intended to protect investors, and the issuance of bonds that reduce or eliminate common covenants in their contracts could become an area of concern. In fact, there is some evidence that some new bond issuance reduces covenants that protect investors.[7]\nAlso,financial structures that involve the use of short-term borrowing to finance longer-term assets should be monitored carefully. For example, agency real estate investment trusts (agency REITS) have grown rapidly, involve leverage, and are susceptible to sharp interest rate movements. Such financing structures need to be monitored to ensure they do not pose broader financial stability concerns.\nFinally, many non-depository financial institutions that were susceptible to runs during the financial crisis still have not resolved that run risk. For example, money market mutual funds experienced a severe run requiring substantial government intervention during the crisis, yet the regulatory reform effort is moving only slowly. Similarly, Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo[8] and New York Fed President William Dudley[9] have raised concerns about broker-dealers and wholesale funding markets. These concerns have substantial merit and deserve attention.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion and in sum, the economy continues to improve, but at a painfully slow pace. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve to speed up the pace of the economic recovery seem to be having the desired impact. Interest-sensitive sectors are growing more rapidly, asset markets are returning to pre-crisis levels, and economic forecasters are expecting continued improvements over the next several years.\nWhile the benefits of our actions continue to outweigh the costs, we need to closely monitor financial instruments, financial institutions, and financial markets for potentially emerging financial stability concerns. There are areas that I have highlighted today that require close monitoring - including, unfortunately, some problems in financial market that were significant contributors to the financial crisis but have not yet been fully remedied.\nWhile the economy is improving, global financial conditions remain fragile, as events in Europe are highlighting. And the economy still has a long way to go before we have full employment and PCE inflation at about 2 percent. Still, I believe the Federal Reserve will continue to do its part in this process, with a clear focus on improving economic conditions for all Americans.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Bank for International Settlements Forum on Key Regulatory and Supervisory Issues in a Basel III World Bank of Korea, Seoul, Korea\nThe impact of the recent financial crisis has significantly changed the supervision and regulation of financial organizations.[note] Countries such as the U.K., Switzerland, and Sweden are not only planning on implementing the tougher Basel III capital standards, but are also considering whether they should require institutions to hold capital significantly above Basel III capital levels.\nIn the United States, the financial crisis has caused reexamination of how we think about bank regulation, bank supervision, and financial stability. Bank regulation before the financial crisis had become focused on using risk weighting to determine appropriate regulatory levels of bank capital. However, the risk weights on certain assets did not perform as expected when mortgages with low risk weights became the epicenter of problems, when many securities that had high ratings and low capital charges fell dramatically in price, and when the originate-to-distribute (versus originate and hold) model[1] of lending was exposed as not distributing risk as widely as assumed.\nAssets with high ratings received little supervisory attention, as risk-focused supervision focused on lower-quality assets. And off-balance-sheet exposures received insufficient supervisory scrutiny. Supervisors gained a false sense of comfort from models that aimed to look far out into the so-called tail of banks’ potential loss distributions. But, these models failed to explicitly consider what would occur during times of severe macroeconomic stress.\nIndeed it seems in hindsight that the very concept of financial stability was poorly understood before the financial crisis. Too little attention was devoted to the consequences of large institution failures, as the impact of such failures had not been fully considered in a way that adequately reflected a broader understanding of interconnected relationships. While liquidity had been receiving more attention at commercial banks, insufficient attention was given to the potential for runs on other financial institutions (for example broker-dealers) or products (such as money market mutual funds). Run risk was also badly underestimated in structured investment vehicles and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, which became difficult to finance during the crisis.\nAs a result of these important crisis lessons, dramatic changes have been made. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the DFA), in conjunction with Basel III capital standards, significantly increased the quantity and quality of capital expected to be held by banks. The introduction of stress tests, mandated by the DFA, increased attention on whether capital will be sufficient during stressful situations. While rules have not yet been finalized in the U.S., there will be additional capital charges for systemically important financial institutions. In addition, as required by the DFA, the largest banks have already submitted plans describing how they may be resolved should that be necessary.\nGiven the rapid changes occurring in supervision and regulation, some commenters have argued that the regulatory pendulum has already overcompensated, and that capital requirements are increasing too much and too fast. In particular, given the fragile state of the recovery that has occurred in most advanced economies, some argue that new capital requirements are overly conservative relative to historical experience and their imposition could stall the economic recovery.\nToday, I will briefly examine the evidence for these arguments in the United States. I will first examine whether regulatory capital thresholds are too high, based on evidence from the financial crisis which will be more fully described in a forthcoming Federal Reserve Bank of Boston working paper. The results of that work will highlight that capital depletion during the financial crisis was extensive, and occurred relatively quickly, for many of the largest financial institutions in the United States – which is why it is critically important to examine whether large financial institutions are holding sufficient capital.\nI will argue that the improvements in capital ratios that have occurred since the crisis are quite striking and have placed the U.S. economy in a better position to finance the recovery going forward. If, however, enhanced capital were the only regulatory response to the crisis, then our analysis would suggest that the size of the “SIFI surcharge” could be insufficient. But in conjunction with the SIFI surcharges, regulators have undertaken several other significant reforms – including liquidity standards, stress tests and resolution plans. Our results highlight the importance of taking this multi-pronged approach.\nAnd contrary to arguments put forth by some commenters, our results suggest that even under the current multi-pronged approach, the current calibration of the SIFI surcharge does not appear excessive. Throughout I will argue that as we better understand systemically important financial institutions, we may want to better integrate lessons from stress testing and resolution procedures into capital requirements for the largest banks.\nI. Capital Depletion at Systemically Important Institutions during the Financial Crisis\nA paper that will soon be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston uses a panel of large, systemically important banks to examine the magnitude of capital erosion that occurred during the financial crisis. The panel includes banks that failed, banks that were merged into other institutions, and banks that survived the crisis intact. The analysis uses a variety of adjustments to make the accounting measures of capital consistent across institutions – including removing sources of direct government capital support, adjusting for structural changes to the firm, and making accounting adjustments for firms that were not bank holding companies throughout the period.[2]\nThe paper examines how much Tier 1 common equity ratios deteriorated (the “capital erosion”) during each institution’s crisis period – defined as the period during the financial crisis when the institution suffered its largest capital erosion.[3]\nThe results are shown in Figure 1. Not surprisingly, those institutions with the largest capital erosion tended to be institutions that merged or failed during the crisis. These institutions tended to have a heavy exposure to residential real estate, like Washington Mutual and Countrywide, or tended to have a business model particularly susceptible to runs because of dependence on wholesale funding – such as the investment banks Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. The loss of capital during this period is striking, and underscores how much capital can be depleted during an unusually severe financial crisis.\nFigure 2 shows the erosion of Tier 1 common equity relative to buffers being used in the Basel III framework. During the stress test exercises associated with the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Adequacy Review (CCAR) program we have required that bank capital exceed 5 percent Tier 1 common equity over the forecast horizon, based on the premise that such a buffer would be required for financial firms to fully operate and maintain investor and counterparty confidence during stressful periods. Basel III sets the minimum Tier 1 common equity plus the conservation buffer at 7 percent. Furthermore, under Basel III, systemically important financial institutions are expected to maintain additional buffers of 1 to 2.5 percentage points. This heightened standard provides capital buffers of 200 basis points, 300 basis points, and 450 basis points above the Tier 1 common equity benchmark used during the stress tests.\nFor the 26 large banks examined in the Boston Reserve Bank’s study, half had losses below the 200 basis point buffer. That is, given the losses experienced during the financial crisis, which was quite severe, half of the largest banks – if they held at least 7 percent Tier 1 common equity – would have remained above the 5 percent Tier 1 common ratio during their period of most severe capital erosion during the crisis. On the other hand, this also highlights that for some banks, such a buffer would not have been sufficient.\nTurning to those financial institutions with the largest capital erosion, eight of the 26 banks would have had losses that exceeded 450 basis points. Such losses would have exceeded the buffers provided by the currently proposed maximum \"SIFI surcharge\" (for systemically important financial institutions)[4] and conservation buffer, and would have caused capital to fall below the 5 percent tier 1 common equity floor that has been used in the CCAR stress tests unless banks were holding capital above the regulatory required minimum. This highlights that while the capital buffers should provide significantly greater capital than was held prior to the crisis, the capital buffers do not seem excessive given the losses experienced during the financial crisis at some of our largest institutions.\nWhile such results arguably substantiate the need for relatively large SIFI surcharges, high capital levels alone are not enough. Our results highlight the need for a multi-pronged approach that employs newly-developed supervisory tools – including stress tests, liquidity standards, and resolution plans – in conjunction with capital charges.\nII. Improvements in the Quality and Quantity of Capital\nFigure 3 shows how dramatic the improvement in capital ratios has been at large U.S. financial institutions. For example, the Tier 1 common capital ratio aggregated across 15 large U.S. banking organizations fell to close to 5 percent in late 2008.[5] However, during the economic recovery these institutions have significantly improved their Tier 1 common capital ratio, to above 10 percent. The broader definitions of capital show similar strong improvement relative to pre-crisis norms.\nIn addition, Figure 4 highlights that the quality of capital has also significantly improved. Tier 1 common capital accounts for a larger share of total risk-based capital as shown in the top chart. Tangible common equity, a narrow definition of capital shown in the bottom chart, has improved significantly since the fourth quarter of 2008. While total capital has improved, the particularly large increase in narrowly defined tangible capital highlights a significant improvement in loss absorption capacity.\nRelative to the 7 percent minimum for Tier 1 common equity plus the capital conservation buffer, banks that are reporting pro forma Basel III capital ratios for the end of 2012 have already reached this minimum standard, as seen in Figure 5.[6] Furthermore, many of these large banks are now holding more than 8 percent Tier 1 common equity on a pro forma basis.\nFigure 6 compares the pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common equity standard relative to the Tier 1 common equity under Basel I. It shows that the Basel III standard results in a much lower – and thus more stringent – capital ratio than the Basel I standard, although the difference can vary greatly depending on the business activities of the financial institution and the quality of assets held. Overall, for those banks disclosing pro forma Basel III capital ratios, the difference between the Basel III pro forma Tier 1 common equity ratio and the Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio averages more than 2 percent. It is encouraging that many large U.S. financial institutions have already reached the minimum Basel III Tier 1 common equity standard – which is more restrictive than under Basel I, and is set at higher thresholds.\nIII. Capital and Other Regulatory Tools\nIn the United States the new supervisory tools being employed are far more extensive than just raising minimum capital standards. In conjunction with the SIFI surcharges, regulators have undertaken several other significant reforms – including liquidity standards, stress tests and resolution plans. Examining capital under stress situations, improved liquidity standards, and resolution plans (the so-called “living wills”) are some of the more important innovations that complement the higher capital standards.\nOur results highlight the importance of taking this multi-pronged approach. None of these tools were used before the crisis, and they are likely to be increasingly important tools as regulators and financial institutions gain more experience with them. Thus any historical examination of capital erosion may not fully reflect the many changes that have occurred at financial institutions and in supervision and regulation in recent years.\nIt is also worthwhile considering how the various new supervisory tools could be combined for enhanced impact. For example, one possibility is to make the trade-off between higher capital and the ability to easily resolve large institutions more explicit. One reason for imposing a SIFI surcharge is that large, complicated banks are likely to cause problems that spill over throughout the financial system (and by extension the economy) if they need to be resolved. Smaller banks are usually resolved over a weekend, with most of the assets and liabilities transferred to an acquiring bank. However, such a process is not always feasible for large institutions – as we saw in the case of Lehman Brothers. The failure of Lehman Brothers disrupted other financial intermediaries, seriously impaired functioning of a number of markets, precipitated runs on other financial intermediaries, and highlighted the need for better resolution of large institutions.[7] To address this risk, difficult-to-resolve large institutions could receive a higher SIFI surcharge than those large institutions that are more easily resolvable.[8] Such an approach would both encourage large firms to enhance their resolvability and would further reduce the probability of failure for remaining difficult-to-resolve institutions.\nThus, the cost to society of disruptive failures of systemically important institutions warrants that these institutions hold more capital – and indeed the Basel III accord is already imposing capital surcharges for large and difficult-to-resolve institutions. At this point the resolution process is new and untried. However, presumably SIFI surcharges should reflect in part how successful resolution plans are likely to be.\nContrary to arguments put forth by some commenters, our results suggest that even under the current multi-pronged approach, the current calibration of the SIFI surcharge does not appear excessive. Given the losses in excess of 450 basis points at a number of large institutions during the last financial crisis, minimum standards for large institutions may be too low.\nConcluding Observations\nThe changes to supervision and regulation since the financial crisis have been extensive. Many of those changes are not yet fully implemented, and many of the regulatory tools remain untried during times of stress. Nonetheless, U.S. financial institutions are now well placed to finance the economic recovery, as many of the institutions have already recapitalized.\nDespite the dramatic improvement in bank capital positions, examination of capital erosion during the financial crisis highlights how large and quick the capital erosion was at some of the largest financial institutions. While the SIFI surcharges have the potential for providing even more of a capital buffer for the largest institutions, it will be critically important to determine how other tools such as stress tests, tougher liquidity requirements, and resolution plans supplement the higher and more stringent capital standards.\nThe high levels of government support during the financial crisis were problematic. Government authorities don't want to be in a position of having to provide support again, and in fact, might not be able to so. And it is certainly in the industry's best interest not to need government support. That makes the enactment of effective capital regimes all the more important.\nThank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nThe paper \"Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises and the Role of Monetary Policy\" by Greenlaw, Hamilton, Hooper, and Mishkin provides both a theoretical and empirical look at the fiscal challenges facing many advanced economies. The first part of the paper focuses on the sustainability of current trends, given the number of countries with high levels of fiscal debt to GDP and serious trade imbalances.\nThe paper makes some observations with which I concur:\nThat unsustainable fiscal policies need to be made sustainable.\nThat the \"tipping point\" for fiscal policies in many developed countries should be an area of concern and continued attention.\nThat the tipping point can be difficult to precisely determine for individual countries, but the range of debt-to-GDP levels in many advanced economies should make policymakers attentive to imbalances.\nI would like to split my discussion of the paper into two parts. First, I will discuss the authors' empirical work on tipping points. In that discussion I will emphasize that the empirical work is a good first step in analyzing the potential of reaching a tipping point, but that the empirical work would probably benefit from a more extensive examination of other factors that influence tipping points.\nIn the second part of my comments today I will discuss the costs and benefits of the large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) program as an instrument of monetary policy. While remittances - which the authors focus on - are one potential factor worth considering when estimating the costs of this program, I will suggest that a fuller set of benefits and costs of the program for the economy are needed.\nAs always, I would note that the views I express here today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nEmpirical Work on Tipping Points\nThe paper provides an empirical model of long-term government bond rates. The basic model estimates the government bond rate as a function of debt to GDP (both net and gross), the current account deficit, and time and country dummy variables. This model is in the spirit of much literature that looks at the probability of a sovereign default or tries to empirically estimate sovereign debt default premiums. While much of the earlier literature was focused on problems with sovereign default for less developed countries, this study focuses on the potential for sovereign default premiums to rise in a set of advanced economies.\nFrom this rather parsimonious model the authors draw a number of conclusions. In particular, that at the level of current account deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios currently experienced in many advanced economies, the risk of rising sovereign default premiums is quite high. Furthermore, if unaddressed, these premiums could reach a tipping point that becomes unsustainable.\nWhile this degree of parsimoniousness in a model can be a virtue, I would suggest that if there are important omitted variables from the empirical work then the coefficient estimates can be biased, and the effects attributed to the variables in the model can be a proxy for effects that are really driven by movements in the omitted variables. Because the model includes both dummy variables for countries and time, the omitted variables would need to be variables that could drive long-term rates that vary over time and by country. How likely is that to be the case with this simple regression?\nConsider the example of Ireland. Figure 1 shows that in 2006 Ireland had a very low debt-to-GDP ratio. In fact, debt to GDP was substantially lower than that of the U.S., U.K., and France. The current account deficit was better than that of the United States, similar to that of the U.K., and somewhat worse than that of France. Despite this relatively sanguine situation in 2006, Ireland was close to the tipping point. Debt to GDP was about to rise quickly, as seen in Figure 2, and Ireland was about to lose the ability to issue long-term debt.\nThe problem in Ireland was that while fiscal debt was well controlled, the country was facing a serious financial stability problem. So, what type of financial stability variables might capture the impending tipping point in a way that is not captured by the simple empirical model?\nOne example of a potentially important omitted variable is the financial strength of the banking sector. For example, non-performing assets of the banking sector relative to GDP would capture the impact of building banking pressures. In Ireland, banking problems rather than fiscal problems were an important driver in hitting the tipping point. Another variable that varies over time and by country would be the percentage change in real estate prices or possibly the difference between the return on owning and the return on renting. These types of variables would try to capture the growing risk of bubbles in Ireland and Spain.\nA second set of potential omitted variables relates to the political determinants of risk premiums. One frequently sees that credit default rates spike around elections, and that countries that are politically destabilized have difficulty generating the political will to address problems - particularly if public opinion is as fragmented as the political process. This might be captured by how frequently national elections were held over the past four years, or by other political variables capturing the difficulty in obtaining a stable majority political party in some countries at some times.\nAnother political variable that might be relevant is a variable that captures whether there is stable fiscal federalism in a country. For example in Spain, debt and banking problems have been exacerbated by the reality of regions that were autonomous but not necessarily fiscally responsible. A variable that might capture this impact is state and local government debt to GDP.\nA third set of potential omitted variables would reflect labor market conditions. With a currency union, persistent differences in competitiveness can push countries to the tipping point. Measures of labor market productivity might capture this impact, which may vary over countries and over time. Another potential important variable would be differences in unfunded pension liabilities relative to GDP. Countries with growing unfunded pension liabilities relative to GDP may need to eventually raise government debt to fund these liabilities, pushing a country to the tipping point.\nA variety of other potential omitted variables could be explored. Credit default swap rates tend to move as countries approach high rollover periods. A debt management variable might capture this rollover risk by looking at short-term debt relative to GDP. And demographic variables may also be relevant. Countries with fast-growing, well-educated populations may be less at risk of tipping points than countries with declining populations that are not well educated.\nWhile this is not an exhaustive list of omitted variables, it does highlight that such a pared-down model may ignore important drivers of tipping points. In addition, one cannot be sure that the coefficients used in simulations might not change significantly with a more richly specified model.\nWhile this paper provides a good discussion of tipping points, the coefficients and simulations should be viewed as indicative of a more general point - that policymakers should consider how a variety of public policies, including fiscal policies, can influence tipping points.\nBenefits and Costs of LSAPS\nThe final section of the paper discusses the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. It highlights a potential problem - that if monetary policy is successful in returning us quickly to full employment, or if interest rates rise for other reasons such as reaching a tipping point, remittances to the Treasury would be impacted. The baseline scenario the authors provide reflects gains overall for the LSAP, but under the authors' most pessimistic scenarios significant losses are generated.\nUnfortunately, this discussion does not do justice to the policy trade-offs, in my opinion. To take them into account, ideally one would do a more complete comparison of how the economy and fiscal policy would evolve with and without large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs in place.\nThe purpose of the LSAP is to reduce long-term interest rates to stimulate the economy. Analysis of the LSAP program requires looking at more than remittances. Ideally one would start with how well policy - with and without LSAPs - fulfills the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, provided by Congress. Even if one wanted to focus on the more narrow fiscal impact, I believe one would need a much fuller analysis.\nAnd to capture the benefits of the LSAP you need a fuller model. One of the models currently used by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston provides a relatively conservative estimate of the economic benefits of a hypothetical additional $750 billion LSAP. Based on historical experience, the model implies that such a purchase would lower long-term rates by 20 to 25 basis points, relative to not making the additional purchases. The impact of this large a reduction in long-term rates is a cumulative gain in real GDP, relative to the base, of 1.6 percent or $260 billion. In our model such a purchase also results in a decline in the unemployment rate of 0.25 percent or 400,000 jobs. Some of the models we run provide a larger impact to such purchases.\nNonetheless, such estimation provides a baseline for considering the economic benefits of additional purchases. These estimates are subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the impact could easily be higher or lower than that implied by our model. However, based on our statistical work using historical data, we believe these are reasonable estimates of the benefits.\nEven if one wanted to focus on the fiscal impact of the LSAP program, I would suggest that the impact goes beyond remittances provided to the Treasury. The first effect would be to examine the path of interest rates on government debt with and without the LSAP program. Since the LSAP reduces interest rates, such a simulation would show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is reduced by the lowered cost of financing fiscal deficits as a result of the LSAP program.\nThe second fiscal impact would be from faster economic growth. Faster economic growth produces more tax revenue and, by reducing unemployment, reduces government entitlement expenditures on programs such as unemployment insurance. Thus, LSAPs actually produce a much more positive fiscal impact than the authors suggest.\nMoreover, the evaluation of the program needs to include the contributions of LSAPs to achieving the goals of the dual mandate for U.S. monetary policy. We currently have an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent in the country and PCE inflation of 1.3 percent. Had we not undertaken LSAP policies, we would be even further away from achieving each element of our dual mandate, with an unemployment rate higher and an inflation rate lower than we currently have (assuming we have been successful in improving the economy).\nAs Figure 3 shows, loan rates on mortgages and autos have declined since the zero lower bound for the federal funds rate was hit, and home and auto sales have been improving. These interest-sensitive sectors have been among the fastest growing components of real GDP over the past year. Some of this improvement is the result of our LSAP policies.\nFinally, extended periods of unemployment may have long-run costs that have both fiscal and broader economic impacts. If an extended period of high unemployment causes more workers to drop out of the labor force and places many new workers on a permanently lower income growth path - as many studies have shown - then failing to undertake LSAPs can have much broader impacts on fiscal and economic policies.\nConcluding Observations\nThe authors of this paper have provided a useful contribution to the literature by highlighting the impact of not considering fiscal tipping points. As their work highlights, hitting fiscal tipping points can have dire consequences for all citizens - and predicting when such a tipping point will be hit is difficult. As a result, fiscal and monetary policymakers need to be mindful of the potential of their actions to impact tipping points.\nBut I hope my discussion today has highlighted that, with respect to monetary policy, the LSAP program improves the broader fiscal outlook by lowering interest rates and providing more economic growth. In addition, it returns the economy to full employment and an inflation rate at the 2 percent target more quickly than would have occurred in the absence of such actions. We do well to also consider these benefits, and the costs of inaction, when evaluating policy.\nThank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce Policy Forum Providence, Rhode Island\nI appreciate having been invited to speak again to the Providence Chamber of Commerce. As all of you know, Rhode Island was one of the states most severely impacted by the recession, and it remains one of the hardest-hit states even at this point in the economic recovery. Rhode Island is one of only two states that as of November continued to have a state unemployment rate in excess of 10 percent.\nPersistently high unemployment rates have enormous personal and societal costs. So in my view it is critical that public policy continues to actively support the economy's return to full employment.\nToday I would like to highlight that the Federal Reserve's approach to monetary policy has played an important role in the recovery we have seen to date. And I would like to explain why I consider it imperative that monetary policy continue to actively support the economy at present - since we continue to have an unacceptably high unemployment rate while, at the same time, inflation is undershooting the Federal Reserve's 2-percent target.[1]\nAs always, I would note that my remarks encompass my own views, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nThe U.S. economy has grown at an average 2.2 percent annual rate since the recovery officially began in June of 2009. Data suggest that growth was likely a bit below that rate for the most recent quarter, and the employment report for December showed that the national economy continues to only gradually improve. Given that many businesses and households were deferring decisions until there was more clarity on the fiscal outlook, the emerging picture of the fourth quarter (stemming from sources such as the employment report) is encouraging. The national fiscal uncertainty cast a shadow on the economy, but it seems there have been some signs of underlying strength.\nI consider it particularly encouraging that some interest-sensitive sectors, which are likely to be especially responsive to monetary stimulus, are clearly showing themselves to be \"on the mend.\" Both the housing sector and purchases of consumer durables have been recovering, in part as a response to the accommodative monetary policy the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.\nUnfortunately, recent economic improvements have been partially offset by the deferral of spending decisions by households and firms. In all likelihood, these deferrals result in part from uncertainty over national fiscal policy, as well as from the impact of fiscal austerity that has already taken place - particularly at the state and local government levels. If some of the \"headwinds\" from fiscal austerity discussions here and in Europe abate, we should begin to see growth come in at a pace that is above the economy's long-run potential growth rate. Such growth would bring about both economic expansion and improvements in labor markets.\nInterest sensitive sectors are responding to monetary policy\nThe sectors of the economy that are showing the most improvement recently are those that economists generally consider to be the most responsive to monetary policy and interest rates. Particularly notable is the improvement in the outlook for the housing market. Figure 1 shows growth in real residential investment compared to growth in real GDP. Over the past year real GDP growth has averaged 2.6 percent. In contrast, growth in residential investment occurred at much higher rates, and I expect this positive momentum to continue through 2013.\nFigure 2 provides the rationale for my optimism about residential investment. Housing prices in many parts of the country have begun to rise, and although it is not broken out on the chart, this includes prices in some of the areas that were hardest hit by declines in housing prices. In addition, mortgage rates remain near their cyclical lows and well below the average mortgage rate experienced over the past 25 years. With prices edging up and interest rates at historic lows, there is now something of an incentive for a potential home buyer to actively pursue buying a home. This is the case because both mortgage rates and house prices could be higher if potential buyers delay their purchase decisions.\nThis current dynamic substantially improves the outlook for housing in my view, together with the fact that houses have become more affordable. The ratio of house prices to rents - a summary measure of the cost of owning versus renting - has fallen back to traditional levels after rising to significant heights during the housing bubble. Finally, in the wake of the financial crisis and recession, many people postponed creating new households as they sought to improve their financial position. But there has been an improvement in household formation recently and many of these new households will be potential home buyers.\nFigure 3 shows that consumer-durable purchases have also increased, in part as a result of the very low interest rate environment. Consumer-durable purchases have been a source of strength over the past year, and have grown much more quickly than real GDP. I expect consumer-durable purchases to continue to be a source of strength over 2013.\nOne particular area of rapid growth has been new car purchases (Figure 4). Recent purchases may have something to do with the fact that the average age of cars on the road is now 11.1 years.[2] Some potential car buyers surely postponed decisions until the economic outlook was clearer. So we are seeing a need to replace some aging cars, along with particularly attractive terms available because of the low interest rate environment. The result was purchases of cars and light trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of well over 15 million in November and December. However, a potential concern is that the payroll tax increases that were part of the recent tax agreement will impact the real disposable income of potential buyers. Partially offsetting this had been the lower average gas prices in the fourth quarter, although they have risen somewhat, recently.\nSo overall, I see monetary policy having an impact, in encouraging the purchase of interest-sensitive assets like homes, cars, and consumer durables. The most interest-sensitive sectors have been responding to the monetary stimulus from the Fed, and this stimulus has provided a major source of strength for the economy last year. And it is likely to be a source of support in 2013.\nUnfortunately, the strength in interest-sensitive sectors is partially offset by weakness in other areas of the economy. In particular, while the country certainly needs to get to a sustainable long-term fiscal path, the direct and indirect impacts of recent fiscal austerity deliberations have in my view been one reason that the economy has not snapped back more quickly.\nFiscal policy, policy uncertainty, and Europe remain potential constraints\nIndeed, a major source of economic weakness during the recovery has been the need for state and local governments to cut budgets. [3] Whatever your views on the political economy of government spending, in the short term fiscal austerity removes spending from the economy. In many cases this drop in public spending increases unemployment as teachers, police, and other workers are laid off.\nIn part due to the weakness in housing that strained state and local government finances, state and local government spending has been a large drag on the economy. This spending accounts for close to 12 percent of the goods and services purchased in the economy.\nAs Figure 5 illustrates, while state and local government spending remained a drag in late 2011 and the first half of last year, there was actually a slight increase in real state and local government spending in the third quarter of last year. Many expect that state and local spending will increase modestly this year, too. Federal spending has been more volatile, but generally has been a source of weakness as a component of economic activity as well.\nSince federal spending accounts for roughly 8 percent of the goods and services purchased in the economy, this is a major source of uncertainty for 2013. Given the large fiscal deficits still being run, the process by which the nation can reach a more sustainable long-term fiscal policy remains rather uncertain. What does seem certain is that there will be cuts in government spending which, like higher taxes, will by the simple math of the GDP calculation slow down overall economic growth.\nThere is substantial uncertainty over the fate of federal government grants to state and local governments.[4] Substantial cutbacks in these grants would have a ripple effect on the economy. Similarly, there is the issue of potential federal tax base broadening in order to reduce the federal budget deficit. This will have implications for business and family budgets.\nWhile the need for long-run sustainable fiscal policy is both clear and uncontroversial, I believe it is important to achieve sustainability in a way that does not risk the tentative economic improvements we have experienced to date.\nOne area that has probably been impacted by the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy has been business investment, shown in Figure 6. Nationally, business investment had been a source of strength in the early stages of the recovery, but capital spending by firms weakened significantly in the third quarter of last year - as many firms sought more clarity on government tax and spending decisions before committing to long-term investments. Fiscal uncertainty therefore accounts for at least some share of the recent weakness in business spending, and unfortunately this potential cause for weakness in business spending is likely to persist this year.\nA third source of weakness remains the weak outlook for many of our trading partners, as shown in Figure 7. Both Japan and Europe have grown more slowly than the United States. Additionally, Japan still struggles with a serious deflation problem, and Europe continues to address fiscal imbalances in many of its peripheral countries. Both regions are also experiencing aging populations, demographically speaking, which brings some difficult fiscal and economic challenges.\nDespite these headwinds at home and abroad, I do expect improvement in U.S. economic growth this year. While in the first half of 2013 I think the economy is likely to grow at roughly its potential level of growth, I expect growth in the second half of the year to be closer to 3 percent - assuming that headwinds from fiscal imbalances around the world are not resolved in economically disruptive ways.\nBoth inflation and unemployment remain far from long-run FOMC estimates\nFigure 8 shows the U.S. inflation experience since 2003. While many critics of monetary policy have been concerned with inflationary pressures, through most of the recovery core PCE inflation has remained below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. Notably, despite the rapid growth of the central bank's balance sheet in 2008, as well as the balance sheet's continued growth more recently, there has been no upward trend in inflation. Total PCE inflation is only 1.4 percent over the past year and core PCE inflation is at 1.5 percent.\nSo current inflation is well below the Fed's target, and expected inflation[5] is well below levels that the FOMC has stated would generate a discussion of lifting short-term rates.[6] Being more than half a percent below our target for PCE inflation highlights why I believe aggressive monetary policy remains appropriate, given that the 7.8 percent unemployment rate is well above where the FOMC expects the unemployment rate to settle in the longer run.\nThe national unemployment rate has fallen during the recovery, as shown in Figure 9, and in fact payroll employment growth has averaged 151,000 jobs over the past three months. Nonetheless, the societal costs to elevated unemployment rates that are falling only slowly show why accommodative monetary policy is both appropriate and needed.\nFigure 10 shows employment in the construction and consumer durable sectors as a share of the U.S. labor force. By our calculation, if construction employment returned to its 2004 levels and durable goods manufacturing regained half of the jobs lost since 2004, the unemployment rate would be 6.5 percent (meaning an additional 2.1 million people would be employed).[7]\nWhile interest-sensitive sectors are one of the areas of growth, a more rapid return to the more normal employment shares for those sectors would significantly improve job prospects for workers that have been unemployed or underemployed. Construction and durable goods are both industries that have provided employment opportunities for some with less educational attainment, an area of particularly elevated unemployment rates (as shown in Figure 10. A faster recovery in construction and durable goods would help re-employ those working in sectors of the economy that have suffered greatly during the recession and the painfully slow recovery.\nIn conclusion I would just reiterate my view that continued monetary accommodation is absolutely appropriate and indeed needed as long as we are projected to miss on both elements of the Fed's dual mandate, inflation and employment. Currently inflation is somewhat below our 2 percent target, and unemployment is well above a longer-run sustainable rate.\nAs the recent FOMC statement highlighted, monetary policy should be guided by current and future economic outcomes, not calendar dates. Interest-sensitive sectors have been responding to accommodative policy, and we should all continue to encourage a quicker recovery in those sectors. If we were able to see construction and durable-goods production return to a more normalized share of the workforce, it would have a meaningful impact on potential employees in those interest-sensitive sectors and also on the broader national labor markets.\nAgain I thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. And particularly in light of the challenges Rhode Island has encountered in recent years, I wish you all an improved year in 2013.\nThank you.",

I would like to offer special thanks to the staff at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, many of whom are still dealing with the consequences of Hurricane Sandy. My brother lives in Northern New Jersey and like so many others he experienced significant structural damage to his house. I know many at this Bank and across the region have similar and, unfortunately, even more tragic stories resulting from the storm.\nAs awful as the storm was, it brought out the remarkable resilience of the Greater New York area. Much progress has been made, though there certainly remains much to be done for homeowners and businesses in affected areas.\nThis conference is focused on the spread between longer-term interest rates prevailing in the marketplace and the rates consumers pay on mortgages. This is an important topic, given that one of the more important monetary policy initiatives since short-term interest rates reached the zero lower bound has been the purchase of longer-term assets, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These policies seem to be having the desired effect as the Federal Reserve's two announcements of asset-purchase programs focused on MBS immediately generated significant declines in the yields on such securities (on MBS).\nOf course I want to begin as I do all my talks with the reminder that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nJust how these asset purchase programs actually influence the rates paid by homeowners is complicated by a variety of institutional factors. These include the market structure of mortgage lenders, the cyclical nature of refinance activity, changes in the credit profile of borrowers, changes in the role of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the mortgage market, and expectations of future interest rate changes that impact the likelihood of refinancing activity. The pass-through of Federal Reserve asset-purchase programs can be influenced by changes in any of these factors, and at times changes in these factors can provide headwinds or tailwinds impacting the efficacy of the policies.\nAs a result, this is a particularly fruitful time for research in this area, with an eye to policy - as research presented today suggests.[1] And I hope the development of further research agendas around these issues will be one result of this conference.\nStill, while we have much to learn about mortgage market developments, and how large-scale central bank asset purchases pass through to mortgage lending, I want to state very plainly that I believe the monetary policies designed to lower mortgage rates and stimulate more activity in interest-sensitive sectors have been effective, and are an important reason why the U.S. economy has performed better than many of our developed-country peers. Work being done at both the Boston and New York Reserve banks has shown that the pass-through of these Fed actions to consumers, appropriately measured, has been quite large. This type of empirical work is important as both an academic inquiry and a policy-relevant finding.\nConsider that many businesses have reported putting their plans on hold given uncertainties around fiscal policy here and in Europe, yet household spendinghas continued and housing-related activity has picked up - despite the uncertain environment.\nGiven the tepid economic recovery, high unemployment, and subdued inflation - and the uncertainty around fiscal policy - I believe an accommodative monetary policy is quite appropriate. We want to see continued improvement in labor markets in the near term, and monetary policy should encourage faster economic growth to achieve that objective.\nSo in my view, a strong case can be made for the Federal Reserve continuing to purchase the current $85 billion in longer-term securities a month - even after our so-called \"Operation Twist\" maturity-extension program[2] (a portion of those purchases) is completed at the end of 2012. This is a topic we will be discussing at the next FOMC meeting.[3]\nChanges in the Composition of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet\nAs a result of reaching the zero lower bound for short-term interest rates during the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has engaged in more forward guidance for monetary policy, as well as undertaking large-scale asset purchases. Both are designed to flatten the yield curve, with the intention of encouraging additional longer-term borrowing - and indeed auto loan rates and mortgage rates are well below their averages through the business cycle. Today I will discuss the large-scale asset-purchase program.\nMany have focused on the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, but it is equally important to consider the changes in the composition of the balance sheet. Particularly notable is the movement to longer-duration Treasury securities and to mortgage-backed securities. Keep in mind, however, that this change in the composition of assets has not increased the credit risk taken by the Federal Reserve, as open market operations are limited to assets with government guarantees.\nFigure 1 shows the assets held by the Federal Reserve in December 2007 and then at the end of November 2012. The balance sheet changed from under $1 trillion at the end of 2007 to close to $3 trillion in 2012. Equally striking has been the change in the composition of Federal Reserve assets. At the end of 2007, nearly two-thirds of the assets were shorter-term (maturing in 5 years or less) Treasury securities and almost one-half of the securities had a maturity of less than one year. By 2012, the composition had changed. As a result of Operation Twist, the balance sheet has become more heavily weighted toward long-duration Treasury securities. In addition, the balance sheet now also includes approximately $880 billion in mortgage-backed securities maturing in more than 10 years.\nFigure 2 provides the same information, but shows how the asset mix has changed over time. The initial expansion of the balance sheet was the result of our crisis-related emergency lending programs. As those emergency programs were wound down, asset purchases resulted in a significant expansion of long-duration Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. More recently, Operation Twist has resulted in our selling the shorter-term Treasury securities so that most of the securities on the balance sheet are mortgage-backed securities or Treasury securities with more than five years to maturity.\nConsidering a Reserves-Focused Monetary Policy\nSome observers have advocated for maintaining a short-duration Treasury portfolio - arguing that monetary policy would be sufficiently expansionary by adding bank reserves, and thus there was no need to extend the duration of assets. In this view, since policy primarily works through bank reserves, purchasing assets that minimized risks - including interest-rate risk - to the Federal Reserve would be preferred. Short-term Treasury securities have no credit risk and also would carry minimal interest rate risk. Furthermore, in this view another benefit is that the balance sheet could quickly shrink by not replacing the short-term securities as they mature.\nBut in my view a reserves-focused monetary policy poses several problems. First, there is little impact on market interest rates, since exchanging Treasury bills that carry a low interest rate for bank reserves that carry a low interest rate will have little in the way of interest rate effects. Furthermore, the banking sector would be forced to hold more low-interest reserves at a time when capital is scarce and many banks are seeking to shrink rather than expand their own balance sheet. Thus, when interest rates are already at the zero lower bound, a short-maturity reserves-focused policy will not have much impact on inflation or employment.\nIn fact, Figure 3 shows that a rapid increase in excess reserves in both the United States and Japan appears to have had little effect on inflation in both countries. While inflation in the United States has been close to 2 percent, Japan has continued to have a problem with deflation, despite significant increases in excess reserves.\nFurthermore, the increase in bank reserves has not caused a large increase in bank lending, as shown in Figure 4. In Japan, real bank loans are still below where they were two decades ago. In the United States, despite some growth recently, real bank lending remains below levels attained prior to the recession. It is noteworthy that in Japan, policy has generally leaned toward a significant amount of shorter-duration securities - although more recently there have been greater purchases of longer-duration assets.\nSpread-Focused Monetary Policy\nIn contrast to reserves-focused monetary policy, spread-focused monetary policy seeks to lower the cost of funds to households and firms by purchasing longer-duration assets. This policy, like the purchase of short-term Treasury securities, increases reserves. However, the transmission mechanism is not primarily through excess reserves, but rather focuses on altering the cost of longer-term borrowing.\nCentral bank purchases of long-term Treasury securities flatten the yield curve and cause other medium- and long-term rates, including those on autos and houses, to decline. Similarly, the purchase of mortgage-backed securities causes rates to decline for MBS but also for other longer-duration assets. By reducing the borrowing cost of these purchases, demand for cars and houses should be stimulated. By altering interest rates faced by firms and households, as well as expanding the amount of reserves, the transmission of monetary policy is likely to be much more effective given that the economy has already reached the lower bound for short-term interest rates.\nAdmittedly, spread-focused monetary policy carries some risk for a country's monetary authority. Because the duration of assets is much longer, the balance sheet will not automatically shrink as rapidly when purchases are discontinued. Furthermore, if the plan is fully effective and quickly restores the economy to more normal financial conditions - including higher market interest rates - then the market value of the central bank's portfolio of low-yielding securities will inevitably decrease.\nPotential Advantages of Large-Scale MBS Purchases\nBoth long-term Treasury securities and mortgage rates have continued to fall as the Federal Reserve has purchased longer-term securities,[4] as Figure 5 highlights.\nA common way of describing the mechanism through which the central bank's purchase of longer-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities affects interest rates is that such purchases \"remove duration\" from the marketplace - driving up prices for assets with longer duration and thus pushing down yields, and resulting in a reduction in longer-term rates generally. This view takes MBS and Treasuries to be fairly close substitutes, and assumes that duration is the most important attribute that investors seek in choosing among investment alternatives. Since the mortgage-backed securities purchased have government guarantees, both Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities do not have default risk.\nDespite these similarities, however, there may be several reasons for a central bank to prefer large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Some of these reasons involve loosening the assumption that assets are close substitutes and that duration is the key channel through which central bank purchases have effects.\nFirst, mortgage rates may be more responsive to a purchase of MBS than purchases of similar amounts of Treasury securities if mortgages are less-than-perfect substitutes for Treasuries, in part because investors have quite specific preferences for mortgage securities - what financial economists call \"market segmentation.\" Under market segmentation - which is consistent with the fact that the spread between Treasury and MBS securities varies over time rather than remaining constant - purchases of MBS may have a larger impact on mortgage rates than purchases of Treasury securities. Particularly at a time when housing prices are beginning to rise in many markets, making mortgage rates attractive may encourage potential home buyers to not delay their purchase decision.\nSecond, the ability to refinance mortgages with no prepayment penalty makes the securities quite different from Treasury securities in several respects - perhaps one of the key reasons that investors see them as imperfect substitutes. From the perspective of a central bank purchasing the securities, many mortgages will be repaid early (before maturity) even if interest rates rise. Individuals move for a variety of reasons including changes in employment, a need to purchase a larger home, or a desire to downsize once children leave the home. As a result, while many people may take on a 30-year mortgage, most people will retire the mortgage well before its 30-year maturity.\nTo that end, Figure 6 provides the percent of homeowners that have been in their homes for at least 10 or 20 years, in 2000 and in 2010. Over both horizons, roughly half the homeowners had been in their homes for at least 10 years, and roughly one-quarter had been in their homes for at least 20 years. Thus, even if rates were to rise, a significant percentage of mortgages would likely retire, providing a much shorter duration than for longer-term Treasury securities of a similar maturity.[5], [6]\nHowever, the downside of being able to retire the mortgage without prepayment penalty is that the pass-through of lower mortgage costs from the investor to the homeowner can be less than one-for-one. Changes in the propensity to retire mortgages will influence the price of mortgages, and the extent to which a lower wholesale mortgage rate will be passed through to borrowers. This may be particularly true for high-rate mortgages that reflect the desire to avoid paying points or closing costs, or that reflect the credit worthiness of the borrower - since both may reflect a higher propensity to retire the mortgage should circumstances change.\nThird, Treasury markets are highly liquid, so that the liquidity premium is still relatively small for seasoned issues. As a result, Treasury securities are often preferred during times of crises because investors can easily exit their positions should they need to raise funds. The mortgage-backed securities market is less liquid, particularly for seasoned issues. Thus during times of stress, the functioning of the mortgage market may be impaired, providing an opportunity for a central bank purchase program to improve market functioning as well as change the relative price of securities by introducing a new large-scale buyer. The crisis events of 2008 provide an example.\nFinally, there may be capacity constraints in only buying MBS securities or only buying Treasury securities. Because of potential capacity constraints and the fact that the degree of substitutability may be situational, a strong case can be made for purchasing both MBS and Treasury securities - with the proportions depending on the circumstances.\nThus if the purpose is to improve market functioning, or to provide focused stimulus to an interest-sensitive sector in order to stimulate aggregate demand, it may be that MBS purchases are preferable to Treasury security purchases.[7]\nAlso, even though the impact on mortgage markets may be particularly favorable at certain times, MBS purchases are likely to have an impact beyond the mortgage market. Figure 7 shows that mortgage rates have fallen during large asset purchase programs, but Figure 8 shows that corporate rates also have declined, and Figure 9 shows that prices on assets such as stocks have generally risen during this time period, despite significant economic uncertainty.\nHence, given the effectiveness of this policy and the relatively high unemployment rate and inflation[8] that is running below our 2 percent target, I fully support the policy decisions to provide stimulus through asset purchases - and I believe that including MBS purchases in the first and third asset-purchase programs have contributed to a stronger economic outcome than we would have seen in the absence of these approaches.\nWhile asset prices do seem to have been affected by the purchase programs, the ultimate goal is to stimulate further economic growth. Thus it is heartening that despite the economic uncertainties, households seem more confident in the economic future and are again purchasing long-term assets such as houses. As Figure 10 shows, housing starts have been increasing, as have housing prices in many markets. Accommodative monetary policy has provided an important support to an economy still suffering from the impact of the financial crisis and the continued fiscal uncertainty here and abroad.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that many factors influence the pass-through of monetary policy to interest rates and output. This conference is highlighting many of the challenges to obtaining a full pass through to the mortgage rates faced by households. Nonetheless, long-term rates - including mortgage rates - do appear to have reacted to actions undertaken by the Fed.\nI hope that as a result of the work of those at this conference, we can achieve an even better appreciation for additional steps that could be taken so that more households can benefit from stimulative monetary policy designed to encourage faster economic growth.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Babson College's Stephen D. Cutler Center for Investments and Finance Wellesley, Massachusetts\nIntroduction\nThe Economic Outlook\nPoint #1: The Effect of Unconventional Policy\nPoint #2: The Inflation Outlook\nPoint #3: The Implications for Asset Purchase Policies\nConcluding Observations\nI'm very pleased to be with you today at Babson, a school known for doing a great job of preparing graduates to face the challenges of the economic landscape. Regardless of your area of concentration at Babson, the outlook for the economy is relevant to your studies and, of course, your pursuit of future employment.\nThis year and last, we all experienced real-life frights around Halloween, thanks to severe and unusual storms. I'm happy that Hurricane Sandy did not prevent us from getting together today at Babson, but I know our thoughts are with those in our region and down the Eastern Seaboard who were so significantly affected by the storm - and who continue the clean-up and recovery process.\nToday I plan to highlight three main points about the economic outlook. I always like to emphasize that my remarks represent my views, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or at the Board of Governors.\nA first point is this: while it is still early to gauge the full impact of the Federal Reserve's September monetary policy committee decision to begin an open-ended mortgage-backed security purchase program,[1] the program has so far worked as expected. The initial response in financial markets was larger than many expected. Given that our conventional monetary tool, the fed funds rate, has hit its lower bound of zero, we have turned to unconventional monetary policy. By that I mean policy that attempts to affect long-term interest rates directly, via asset purchases,[2] rather than indirectly by setting the short-term interest rate, as in conventional policy.\nUnconventional policy has affected financial markets much like movements of conventional policy would have. Our use of unconventional policy tools has led to lower longer-term interest rates; higher equity prices; and, in a peripheral by-product of lower U.S. rates, exchange-rate effects.\nBy further easing financial conditions, the Fed's actions appear to be providing additional stimulus to the household sector - as witnessed recently by higher consumer confidence, and increases in purchases of interest-sensitive items such as new homes and cars. Certainly, concerns about such issues as the looming \"fiscal cliff\" in the U.S. and slow growth in many developed countries do appear to be depressing business spending. Still, our actions are likely to spur faster economic growth than we would have had without this additional stimulus - and, as you know, economic growth has been painfully slow.\nMy second point is that the increased quantity of bank reserves that resulted from these unconventional monetary policy actions have not resulted in inflation above our 2 percent target. If you look over a longer period such as from 2000 to the present, total PCE[3] inflation has averaged 2.2 percent and core PCE inflation[4] has averaged 1.9 percent - in either case very close to the 2 percent target announced at the beginning of this year. The fact that we continue to undershoot our inflation target while unemployment remains high is, in my view, a very strong rationale for maintaining a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.\nMy third point is that in addition to stable prices, the Federal Reserve is charged with attaining maximum sustainable employment - what we call our dual mandate, and this has implications for asset-purchase policies (and when to stop them). The statement issued after our last policy meeting highlighted that we expect to continue the asset purchase program until the economy experiences significant improvement in labor market conditions. How forcefully and how long to pursue asset purchases is complicated - by the uncertainty surrounding the effects of unconventional policies; by the usual difficulty in assessing progress toward our dual mandate (given the sometimes noisy signals of both inflationary pressure and labor market conditions); and by the reality that the amount of stimulus provided by our asset purchases depends in part on market participants' assessment of the likely size of the asset purchase program.[5]\nThe last complication is the result of the open-ended asset purchase program, since it does not entail a fixed amount or duration of purchases; in this respect it is more like conventional policy in the past. In fact, the decision of when to stop easing during a recovery is a complicated matter even in more normal times, when pursuing conventional monetary policy through changes in the federal funds rate. Importantly, the economic conditions associated with the last easing action during a recovery are highly dependent on the extent of inflationary pressures at the time.\nGiven that the current inflation rate is quite low and is expected to stay low for several years, we have the flexibility to push for more improvement in labor markets than if inflation were not so subdued. My own personal assessment is that as long as inflation and inflation expectations are expected to remain well-behaved in the medium term, we should continue to forcefully pursue asset purchases at least until the national unemployment rate falls below 7.25 percent and then assess the situation.\nI think of this number as a threshold, not as a trigger - and the distinction is important. I think of a trigger as a set of conditions that necessarily imply a change in policy. A threshold, unlike a trigger, does not necessarily precipitate a change in policy. Instead, I think of my proposed threshold as follows. Once the unemployment rate declines to this level, we would undertake a full assessment of labor market conditions and inflationary pressures to determine whether further asset purchases are consistent with the desired trajectory for reaching our inflation and unemployment mandates in the medium term. Thus, a threshold precipitates a discussion and a more thorough assessment of appropriate policy, versus a trigger which starts a change in policy. As an example, suppose we reach one's threshold unemployment rate but at that time the economy is slowing, and no further improvement in the unemployment rate is expected in the short to medium term. This hypothetical situation would not necessarily imply a change in policy stance, especially if inflation was projected to remain below target.\nLet me say also that an unemployment rate of 7.25 sounds high, but achieving an unemployment rate of 7.25 percent would require real GDP growth of roughly 3 percent for a year. That would be growth that is a full percentage point faster than the economy's so-called \"potential\" rate of growth, making this a challenge to achieve.\nAnd as I noted, this is a threshold, not a trigger - at the 7.25 percent threshold the assessment of continued asset purchases would commence. It is worth noting that a variety of factors outside the realm of monetary policy (for example demographics) affect how low unemployment can get without igniting inflationary pressures.[6] But my own personal view is that if inflationary pressures remain muted, then labor market conditions would need to be more like 6.5 percent unemployment to warrant the federal funds rate being lifted off the zero bound.\nThe Economic Outlook\nWith that preview, let me say a bit about the economic context and outlook. We are in the third year of the recovery, and the economy has averaged close to 2 percent growth over that time, which is faster than many other advanced economies but too slow to return the nation to anything like full employment anytime soon.\nTo promote faster growth, with the hope of speeding up improvement in labor markets, the Federal Reserve announced additional monetary accommodation at our September 2012 policy meeting.[7] Three key aspects of the announcement were the continuation of our approach to exchanging short-term securities for long-term securities through December (the maturity extension program), the plan to purchase $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month until significant improvement in labor markets is achieved, and the indication that short-term rates are expected to remain exceptionally low through mid-2015.\nNow I would like to say a bit more about each of my three main points - the effect of unconventional policy, the inflation outlook, and the dual mandate and its implications for asset purchase policies.\nPoint #1: The Effect of Unconventional Policy\nGiven both the July statement of the policy committee, and Chairman Bernanke's August speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, there was a good deal of anticipation in financial markets that more forceful policy action would be taken.[8] Both were interpreted as indicating a likelihood of further action.\nAs Figure 1 shows, many financial markets began moving well before the September announcement - and by the time of the actual announcement stock prices had risen, mortgage rates had fallen, corporate bond rates had fallen, and exchange rates had declined modestly (a peripheral by-product of lower U.S. rates). Such movements in financial markets are quite consistent with the normal reaction to conventional monetary policy announcements.\nThe effect of policy on longer-term rates seems in turn to be having a positive impact on the economy. To affect growth in the economy, financial market movements need to encourage firms and households to adjust their behavior. Of course, while it remains too early to fully assess the effect of our September action, households appear to be reacting to the easing in financial conditions. Figure 2 shows the four-week moving average of mortgage loan applications. One line reflects the refinance index, which has clearly been trending up recently. Even more encouraging has been the increase in the purchase index. The drop in mortgage rates at this time has the potential to be particularly effective given that housing prices in some regions of the country are beginning to rise. That, coupled with the risk that rates will rise once the purchase program is over, provides incentives not to defer purchase decisions.\nFigure 3 shows that this increased activity is beginning to generate new home construction, as housing starts have been trending up recently. This is consistent with the more qualitative anecdotes I hear from bankers around New England - that they are seeing, and are willing to lend to, strong construction firms that are selling new homes once they are built.\nThere are, of course, other channels that transmit the Fed's action to the economy. Unconventional monetary policy actions have produced strength in several interest-rate-sensitive sectors since they began in earnest - building on the earlier moves to quickly make policy accommodative as the financial crisis and recession unfolded, and to keep policy accommodative in light of a very tepid recovery. Figure 4 shows that auto loan rates at commercial banks also have been declining. The low cost of financing cars, along with positive wealth effects from increases in housing prices and stock prices, have helped to stimulate more robust auto sales - as you can see in Figure 5.\nFigure 6 shows that consumer durables have been stronger in this recovery than during the previous two recoveries. This is despite a very weak housing market which presumably limited many durable goods purchases commonly associated with home buying. Despite this significant \"headwind,\" I think we can say that the accommodative stance of monetary policy and indeed the use of unconventional monetary policy have helped make interest-sensitive consumer durable purchases more affordable.\nWhile the household sector has been responding to monetary policy actions, the response by businesses has been more muted. Firms appear to be deferring decisions until they have better clarity on the U.S. fiscal situation and on the likely path of international economic conditions. However, a continued household sector rebound is likely to improve demand and business conditions, encouraging more business investment - particularly once some of these downside risks and uncertainties are resolved.\nPoint #2: The Inflation Outlook\nOne of the concerns voiced about unconventional monetary policy is that expanding the Federal Reserve's balance sheet - injecting large quantities of reserves into the banking system - could be inflationary. Let's look to the data to assess this concern.\nFigure 7 provides a measure of inflation - changes in the total personal consumption expenditure price index for the period since 2000. The average of year-over-year changes in the PCE price index has been 2.2 percent, quite close to our 2 percent target. However, it has been quite variable over the period, with PCE inflation significantly exceeding 3 percent during some periods and actually turning negative in the midst of the Great Recession. This volatility is partly attributed to periods of food and energy shocks, where price movements have tended to be sharp but temporary.\nFigure 8 provides the changes in the personal consumption expenditure price index removing these volatile food and energy components. To be sure, the Fed is concerned about inflation including these components, as food and energy constitute an important share of essential household expenditures for people. But temporary movements in these components can obscure the underlying trend in overall inflation, so it can be useful to look at the inflation rate taking out food and energy. Over this period, the core PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.9 percent, which is slightly below our 2 percent target for total PCE inflation. And you can see that the core inflation measure has been far less volatile, remaining in a range between 1 and 3 percent.\nFigure 9 shows both PCE and Core PCE inflation expressed as quarterly changes at annual rates. Over the past 12 years there have been a large number of quarters in which inflation has exceeded 2 percent - thus 2 percent has never been a \"ceiling\" for inflation. The distribution of quarterly core PCE inflation shows many fewer extreme observations, but nonetheless has exhibited a fairly broad range of outcomes. So while recent history has seen an underlying rate of inflation that is relatively stable around our target, I would suggest that attempting to hold actual inflation in lockstep with our 2 percent target over short timeframes is probably not realistic.\nBeyond the U.S. situation, I would also point to Japan's experience as instructive. As I have pointed out many times, despite having an expanded balance sheet for an extended period, the Japanese continue to struggle with a deflation problem rather than an inflation problem. [9]\nPoint #3: The Implications for Asset Purchase Policies\nThe Fed's recently announced, unconventional asset purchase policies do seem to be having the desired effects, and the inflation rate remains below our 2 percent target. However, this policy action included the announcement that asset purchases will continue until the outlook for the labor market improves substantially. In other words, the policy action is open-ended versus time-bound. Should the economy experience another shock - say from a U.S. \"fiscal cliff\" situation or a shock from abroad, then we could lengthen the period of purchases or increase the amounts (or both). Similarly, favorable shocks would mean that we would purchase fewer securities.\nThe open-ended approach is particularly useful to convey that monetary policy will serve as an \"automatic stabilizer\" should shocks occur - one hopes at least mitigating possible shocks that could buffet the economy. I say \"mitigating\" because monetary policy would not necessarily be able to fully and immediately offset large shocks.\nAs with conventional monetary policy, decisions about the ideal timing for ending unconventional monetary stimulus require balancing a variety of considerations. Figure 10 shows the economic conditions at the end of the easing cycle for the last three recessions. The end of the easing cycle in 1992 started despite weak labor markets, in part because of the high inflation rate at the time. The end of the easing cycle in 2001 occurred when the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.1 percent, in part because inflation was only 1.9 percent at the time.\nThe figure highlights that ending a cycle of easing during a recovery is highly dependent on a variety of economic factors. With lower inflation rates, it is possible to maintain the easing until the labor market shows more significant improvement. This would be consistent with a balanced approach to both elements of the Fed's dual mandate.\nThe variables actually considered by policymakers are much broader than the variables reflected in Figure 10. No single variable perfectly captures the underlying rate of inflation, as the sharp differences between core and total PCE indicate. Similarly, no single variable perfectly captures conditions in the labor market - for example, unemployment rates can fall because workers become discouraged and leave the labor force, or because of a rapid expansion in hiring.\nEven if there were single variables that fully captured labor market conditions and inflationary pressures, the future path of those variables would depend on a wide range of factors. Most importantly, and consistent with the definition of a threshold discussed earlier, an unemployment rate of 7.25 percent when growth is expected to be below 2 percent is very different from the same rate when growth is expected to be 4 percent or higher. In the first case, one might expect labor market conditions to deteriorate in future quarters. In the second, one would normally expect to see further significant improvement in labor market conditions.\nFurthermore, because we are far from our normal policies, we must acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of these policies, as well as our ability to execute a graceful exit from unconventional policy (that is, to return to conventional federal funds rate policy, and to reduce our large balance sheet to a size more consistent with a normally-functioning economy). Given the lack of historical experience in exiting such a large balance sheet, the possibility of unintended consequences should not be dismissed. We are very attuned to these concerns and are working to address them.\nDespite the challenge to communicating in simple terms the likely exit strategy, I will say that my own preference would be to continue asset purchases until we had at least reached an unemployment rate of 7.25 percent, given the low rates of inflation we have been experiencing and are likely to be experiencing over the medium term - however, I will say again that this is a threshold, not a trigger. Assuming that inflation and inflation expectations remain well-behaved, at that point the discussion should center on whether overall labor market conditions are consistent with \"substantial improvement\" - for example, whether the lower unemployment rate reflects job creation rather than reductions in the labor force as discouraged workers stop seeking jobs; whether we are seeing sustained, robust payroll employment growth; and whether we envision continued substantial improvement in labor markets for some quarters to come. Under those conditions, I would stop asset purchases.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, let me reiterate that household spending patterns are consistent with some improvement in the economy, and appear to be responding (as desired) to monetary policy accommodation. Nonetheless, abrupt fiscal austerity or adverse shocks from abroad could still overwhelm the nascent positives. Hurricane Sandy's effects could exact a toll on the fourth-quarter performance of the economy. In general, potential downside risks make an open-ended monetary policy particularly attractive, because policy can recalibrate in response to such shocks without starting up new programs.\nCertainly I hope that these risks will subside, and we will quickly see more improvement in the economy - leading to a substantial improvement in labor markets and an early end to our asset purchase program.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you at Babson, and I would be happy to field a few questions from the students and faculty here today.",

            "content": "The Community Development Advisory Council's 2012 Regional Convening\nIntroduction\nThe Importance of Mid-Sized Cities\nResurgent Cities\nThe \"Softer Side\" of Development\nGood morning and thank you for being part of this conference focused on New England's mid-sized cities. The issues and opportunities facing these cities have probably not received enough attention from the full spectrum of policymakers. Today's conference highlights some topics on which the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston plans to focus over the next several years.\nToday I would like to summarize just why it is so important that there be increased attention to mid-sized cities. Allow me to give you a short preview and then cover these points in a bit more detail, and with a close look at some key data.\nAs always, I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nI first want to describe the importance of these cities. New England's mid-sized cities - with populations between 75,000 and 200,000 people - taken together have a population roughly similar to that of Greater Boston,[1] which represents New England's largest and most economically vibrant urban area.\nHowever, the mid-sized cities differ in important ways from Boston. They have not seen the same degree of economic vibrancy as residents in Greater Boston, but they do encompass an important source of future growth, in a couple of ways. One, they frequently serve as an entry point for new immigrants, and two, they have on average a younger population than the rest of New England.\nSecond, I want to highlight today the recent economic trends in these cities. Certainly these cities have struggled over the past several decades. Their manufacturing base has shrunk, and many have yet to replace lost jobs with new and innovative sectors. As more middle-class families have moved away, these cities face greater challenges in helping their residents acquire the skills and job market opportunities they need to escape from poverty. While all of these mid-sized cities have struggled and continue to struggle to overcome serious obstacles, the economic data indicate that some have done better than others in turning around their economies. It is this revitalization - relative resurgence (using indicators such as median family income, poverty rates, and population growth) - that we all want to see replicated in those cities that are having difficulties reengineering themselves.\nFinally I want to emphasize that I think these cities can indeed become resurgent cities. The Boston Federal Reserve Bank staff has done some thoughtful research in this area, and has been actively engaged with people like you, in this room, to consider how to generate more revitalization in cities in New England. This conference and our future work in this area will, we hope, be of assistance. At the Bank we will continue to look at ways that we can help - through quantitative and qualitative research, outreach, information gathering and dissemination, and our ability to convene stakeholders. I hope that together with people like you, gathered here today, we can see more concentrated focus on New England's mid-sized cities, and more achievement.\nThe Importance of Mid-Sized Cities\nLet me say a bit more about the importance of mid-sized cities. Figure 1 tells us about the aggregate population of the New England's mid-sized cities compared to the region as a whole and to Greater Boston. The cities between 75,000 and 200,000 people [2] have, taken together, an aggregate population of 2.2 million people - just a little smaller than the 2.3 million people living in the greater Boston area. So, taken together, roughly a third of all New Englanders (about 4.5 million people) live in either the Greater Boston metropolitan area or in one of New England's mid-sized cities.\nIn Massachusetts, legislation defined \"gateway cities\" as those between 35,000 and 250,000 people that also fall below the statewide average for income and education.[3] These 24 cities as a group account for 1.7 million people. Together, the population in the Greater Boston metropolitan area plus the gateway cities account for almost two-thirds of the population of Massachusetts.\nFigure 2 shows that for New England and Massachusetts, the mid-sized cities are a major entry point for foreign-born residents. While only about 13 percent of the U.S. population is foreign-born, New England as a whole has an even lower share of foreign-born residents (only about 12 percent). However, when looking at New England mid-sized cities and the Massachusetts gateway cities, much greater shares of residents are foreign-born - about 21 percent, or more than one in five residents. In a region of the country experiencing relatively slow population growth, immigrants are an important potential source of growth in the supply of laborFigure 3 shows that these cities have populations that are on net younger than the state and region. The figure shows the shares of the population below 15 years of age and 65 years of age and older. For Massachusetts and New England around 18 percent of the population is below 15 years of age, but New England's mid-sized cities and Massachusetts gateway cities have a bit larger share of their population under 15 years of age. The mid-sized cities also have a somewhat lower percentage of their population over 65 years of age relative to New England as a whole, and the same is true for the gateway cities relative to MassachusettsThe younger overall population and the influx of foreign-born residents into our region's mid-sized cities can be an important source of potential economic growth. However, there are some significant impediments to these resources being fully utilized, and that will impact whether these mid-sized cities prosper and become sources of strength in the regional economy.\nFor example, Figure 4 shows differences in poverty rates. New England's mid-sized cities have a much higher percentage of the population in poverty compared to New England more generally. The picture is similar in Massachusetts: the gateway cities have much higher rates of poverty than the state as a whole. These higher poverty rates are a serious impediment if they reflect, or perpetuate, residents of mid-sized cities being less likely to obtain the skills necessary to be gainfully employed in today's economy.\nTo that end, Figure 5 shows that educational attainment varies greatly across the region. While New England and Massachusetts have much higher educational attainment than the rest of the country, that educational attainment is uneven across the region. While 46 percent of the population in Greater Boston [4] has a bachelor's degree or above, the mid-sized cities in New England have a much lower 24.5 percent of their population with a bachelor's degree or above. The figure is even lower for the Massachusetts gateway cities, which have only 22.7 percent of the population with a bachelor's degree or above - less than half the rate of the Greater Boston area.\nIf mid-sized cities are to serve as a potential source of growth for New England's economy, it is important that the work force be able to acquire the skills and opportunities necessary to succeed. Work force development efforts, and initiatives that provide strong educational opportunities for all residents of our mid-sized cities - including new immigrants and their children - are likely to be a key necessity if these cities are to flourish.\nResurgent Cities\nIn recent research covering not only New England, but also the mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and upper South, my Boston Fed colleagues Yolanda Kodrzycki and Ana Patricia Muñoz have worked to identify key factors that set cities apart - in particular, what factors make some cities relatively resurgent while other cities do not make similar improvements.\nTheir research shows that even the relatively resurgent cities (those cities that outperformed their peers) have had difficulty improving at the same rate as the country as a whole. Figure 6 reflects median family income in the resurgent cities and in other cities,[5] as a share of U.S. median family income, over the last 50 years or so. While the median family income in cities that were not considered resurgent was only a little above 60 percent of the median family income of the nation - and declining - the median family income in the relatively resurgent cities was a little above 80 percent of the median family income of the nation, and still declining although at a lower rate. This highlights some of the challenges facing even the cities that are making progress.\nFigure 7 shows that educational attainment does seem to be a key factor. Educational attainment was significantly better in the resurgent cities than in those cities that were not considered resurgent.[6]\nSeparately, I would note that many of New England's mid-sized cities are along coasts. This provides certain opportunities to the extent that they have port facilities, but also provides opportunities to attract tourists and new residents. Both Providence and New Haven show stronger growth in median household income relative to the U.S. than other mid-sized cities since 2000, as Figure 8 shows.\nProvidence, New Haven, and Worcester were the three New England cities classified as resurgent by Kodrzycki and Muñoz. These three cities all have a strong academic presence in their cities, as well as serving as major medical centers.\nIndeed, I would note that many of these mid-sized cities, including many that are not yet resurgent, are at the crossroads of transportation hubs, or have become regional medical centers, or have educational institutions as \"anchor tenants\" in their cities. Many mid-sized cities have not yet fully leveraged these potential attributes to attract industries and promote growth. Increasingly, medical centers and universities have been shown to be potential development hubs. Worcester has benefited from its focus on the life sciences. Cities with colleges and universities that find ways to use those resources to foster development are likely to be among the cities that better succeed over time.\nThe \"Softer Side\" of Development\nOne of the interesting findings in the work of I mentioned by Yolanda Kodrzycki and Ana Patricia Muñoz is that one of the main characteristics of the resurgent cities is the presence of collaborative civic leadership. Whether catalyzed by leaders in the private sector, public sector, or non-profit sector, it seems that the resurgent cities have developed a vision for progress that has the shared support of the entire community and a variety of leaders.\nFrequently the cities that have lost important sectors of employment - for example the loss of manufacturing jobs in many New England cities - also lose some of the cohesion in their communities. Charitable and civic organizations benefit from companies contributing to leadership in the community, so the loss of major firms when a sector declines is anything but positive. Civic cohesion and collaboration across political lines can also be impacted. And changing demographics in cities can make it more challenging - but no less important - to achieve effective collaboration.\nClearly, a collaborative vision for a community cannot be imposed from the outside. It requires residents to engage and find ways to leverage the city's positive attributes for the benefit of all citizens.\nWe hope that this conference serves as a basis for more positive work in this area. Let me bring up Figure 9, which lists the cities I have been speaking about this morning. We expect that the mid-sized city issues I've touched on will be a focus of our community outreach over the next several years, with a particular attention on collaborative civic leadership. I look forward to hearing the ideas of participants, and the suggestions you have on how the Boston Fed can help.\nTogether and with a lot of thoughtful, persistent work I am certain we can build on the strengths and resources in our region's mid-sized cities, to see their more rapid development.\nThank you.\nFigure 9\nNew England Mid-Sized Cities, Massachusetts Gateway Cities and Springfield Peers Nationwide\nNew England Mid-Sized Cities Massachusetts Gateway Cities Springfield and Nationwide Peers\nBridgeport, CT\nDanbury, CT\nHartford, CT\nNew Haven, CT\nNorwalk, CT\nStamford, CT\nWaterbury, CT\nBrockton, MA\nFall River, MA\nLawrence, MA\nLowell, MA\nLynn, MA\nNew Bedford, MA\nSpringfield, MA\nWorcester, MA\nManchester, NH\nNashua, NH\nCranston, RI\nProvidence, RI\nWarwick, RI\nBarnstable\nBrockton\nChelsea\nChicopee\nEverett\nFall River\nFitchburg\nHaverhill\nHolyoke\nLawrence\nLeominster\nLowell\nLynn\nMalden\nMethuen\nNew Bedford\nPittsfield\nQuincy\nRevere\nSalem\nSpringfield\nTaunton\nWestfield\nWorcester\nResurgent Cities\nEvansville, IN\nFort Wayne, IN\nGrand Rapids, MI\nGreensboro, NC\nJersey City, NJ\nNew Haven, CT\nPeoria, IL\nProvidence, RI\nWinston-Salem, NC\nWorcester, MA\nOther Cities\nAkron, OH\nAllentown, PA\nBridgeport, CT\nDayton, OH\nErie, PA\nFlint, MI\nGary, IN\nHartford, CT\nPaterson, NJ\nRochester, NY\nRockford, IL\nSouth Bend, IN\nSpringfield, MA\nSyracuse, NY\nWaterbury, CT\nYoungstown, OH",

            "content": "South Shore Chamber of Commerce Quincy, Massachusetts\nIntroduction\nAvoiding a Stagnation\nCauses of Slow Growth in the United States\nCosts of a Slow Recovery\nWhat Should Monetary Policymakers Do?\nRecent Actions\nThe Initial Impact of Policy Actions\nConcluding Observations\nGood morning and thank you for the opportunity to be with you at the South Shore Chamber of Commerce.\nAs always, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nI know it's still early morning, but allow me to start with an observation about economists, historians, and the word \"Great.\" Historians tend to use \"Great\" to reflect success, particularly military success that results in territorial expansion - think Alexander the Great or Peter the Great. In economics, \"Great\" is used quite differently. It's usually applied to difficult episodes with serious economic consequences - think of the Great Depression or the so-called Great Recession. Often such an episode involves economic policymaking - fiscal, monetary, or otherwise - that contributes to the situation or fails to alleviate it.\nI have titled this talk \"Acting to Avoid a Great Stagnation\" and let me be clear, I do believe the Federal Reserve is taking appropriate and forceful action to help the U.S. avoid a prolonged economic stagnation.\nLet me explain the terms. In my view a Great Stagnation - in current times or any other - would be a long episode that generally includes a willingness among policymakers to accept as inevitable, and decline to resist, far-less-than-optimal outcomes. Such outcomes could include higher unemployment, with the potential result that high unemployment could become entrenched as a more permanent feature of the economic landscape.[1]\nWhat I am highlighting is the importance and appropriateness of taking the policy actions that are necessary to improve economic conditions much more quickly - so the period of very slow recovery that we have been experiencing of late does not persist and become a Great Stagnation or in fact a \"Great\" anything.\nUnfortunately, the global economy is experiencing a slowdown, and that slowdown is one of the significant impediments to faster growth in the domestic economy. Failure to react to this slowdown would risk a situation where difficult conditions prevail for long enough to become \"Great\" in the economist's sense. This could occur if policymakers of all sorts - monetary, fiscal, economic, and financial - were to adopt a stance of only reacting to large negative shocks, while accepting (and declining to act against) a status quo of substantial underutilization of resources, for an extended period of time.\nThis sort of scenario would be particularly tragic in the job market, and I would note that over the course of this year there has been no meaningful improvement in the unacceptably high level of the U.S. unemployment rate. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has called this a \"grave concern\" and I fully agree with him.\nLast week the group charged with monetary policymaking in the U.S., the FOMC, took additional monetary policy actions to promote faster economic growth. I fully support the policy actions. Let me say a bit about them. First, the FOMC noted that it anticipates that low short-term rates are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015. This guidance makes clear that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time, likely even after labor markets improve from their current subdued state, in order to promote a robust and sustainable recovery.\nSecond, given the desire to increase policy accommodation even while the traditional policy instrument (the federal funds rate) is at the zero lower bound, the FOMC announced plans to buy $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities a month - until such time as there is substantial ongoing improvement in labor markets. The more open-ended nature of the action - intending to continue such purchases until labor markets have improved - is an important change. Of course, the Fed will do so in the context of price stability (which is the other half of the Fed's \"dual mandate,\" along with maximum sustainable employment) - and hand in hand with a careful ongoing assessment of the program's costs and efficacy.\nOf course policy actions such as these are unconventional, and do entail risks. However, in my view the risks involved in pursuing these policies are considerably smaller and more manageable than the risk of allowing the economy to stagnate for another year or more.\nThe U.S. has seen a series of \"false starts\" during this recovery. After earlier periods of policy accommodation the economy has improved, but that improvement has not been sustained. These false starts have been interrupted by both natural and man-made disasters, here and abroad. As a consequence of these interruptions, the recovery has been painfully slow by historical standards - resulting in our current highly-elevated unemployment rate and an inflation rate below our objective.\nAbsent further policy action, most economists expect several more years of weak labor markets and low inflation. As a consequence, it was time for the Fed to announce stimulus that will continue until the U.S. achieves both faster economic growth and lower unemployment, no matter the unanticipated interruptions.\nToday I would like to walk through my analysis of the economic situation in more detail. In doing so I hope it will become clear why I have strongly supported the kind of forceful action that the FOMC took last week. In my view, these policies are essential to achieving a strong sustainable recovery that is resilient, despite the inevitable disruptions. Let me add that I am only discussing monetary policy, not fiscal policy, since fiscal policy, though powerful, is not in the Fed's jurisdiction.\nAvoiding a Stagnation\nFigure 1 provides a powerful real-world example of the potential for a Great Stagnation - the experience of Japan after their financial crisis, which began in 1990. While this period is sometimes called the \"Lost Decade,\" that is actually a misnomer - since the period of stagnant growth has lasted over two decades.\nThere are many factors contributing to a Great Stagnation in Japan, including a very slow realization of the need to recapitalize banks, and a population whose average age is rapidly rising (which changes the composition of economic activity in a country), and a substantial slowdown in population growth. Still, it is striking that there was a dramatic change in the growth of real GDP in Japan coinciding with the start of their financial crisis.[2]\nThe muted policy response to the slower growth that began during the financial crisis is partly responsible for the fact that Japanese growth never returned to its pre-crisis rate, or to where output would have been had the crisis not occurred (the path illustrated by the trend line, based on growth over the 1980-1990 period).\nFigure 2 shows the level of U.S. GDP since 1980. Note that we too have a noticeable break in the growth rate of GDP at the advent of the recent financial crisis. However, unlike the Japanese, it appears that we have resumed the pre-crisis growth rate. But we have not returned the economy back to its original growth path, the only time we have failed to do so in all ten of our other post-war recessions - including the severe recession in 1982.\nFailing to return quickly to the original trend line is much more serious than a graph can convey. It implies a significant cumulative loss in goods and services that should have been produced (measured as the sum of the difference between those two lines), which in turn implies a significant shortfall in employment relative to full employment.\nAs a result, the goal of monetary and fiscal policy should be to return the economy back to the original trend line. This means getting faster than normal growth until resources are once again fully utilized. A risk in not doing so is that we permanently reduce our trend growth rate, which is what appears to have happened in Japan.\nCauses of Slow Growth in the United States\nExploring in detail the many possible causes of slow growth in the current economy is beyond the scope of this talk. But let me just highlight some important factors. Figure 3 shows, and compares, the growth rates of real GDP and real GDP excluding residential investment (housing) and government spending. As the chart shows, there is a notable difference in the growth rates. While real GDP has grown only by 2.21 percent, real GDP excluding housing and government spending grew by 2.45 percent. Had the economy not had the headwinds from government and housing dragging growth lower - had it grown just by that higher rate of 2.45 percent over the three years of the recovery - outcomes would be somewhat better. However, normally a sector like housing would be expected to grow much more quickly than other sectors of the economy in the early stages of a recovery - given housing's interest-rate sensitivity - and thus we would expect it to provide more impetus to overall economic growth.\nTo consider the role of housing a bit more, Figure 4 shows housing starts from 2000 onward. The decline in housing starts is striking, and unlike in most other recoveries the housing sector did not participate in the initial stages of the current recovery - although there has been some improvement recently.\nHowever, I think there are some reasons to believe the recent nascent signs of a housing recovery might be durable. Since the onset of the housing bust the population has grown and per capita income has grown, while interest rates are very low and prices are more affordable. These are all positives when it comes to having potential buyers ready to purchase homes.\nThese circumstances make it an important time for policymakers to consider additional stimulus to the housing market to finally induce progress. Consider the market psychology: if home buyers feel that house prices are on the rise (as many indicators suggest), and that mortgage rates will only remain this low temporarily, we could see new home buyers come off the sidelines and commit to purchase new homes before rates rise and before house prices rise further than they have.\nAlso, Figure 5 shows growth in state and local government spending since 2000 and highlights that it has been unusually weak in this recovery. This is, in large part, a result of state and local governments pulling back in response to greatly diminished revenues - a direct consequence of the depth of the recession and the weakness of the recovery. Many states were prepared for a revenue shortfall, having accumulated \"rainy day\" funds, but the long downturn sapped those funds. Since nationally, the sum of state and local government spending is larger than federal spending [3], the net impact has been that government-sector spending has been a significant drag on growth during the recovery.\nFigure 6 highlights another force dragging on the U.S. recovery, the global economic slowdown. Many advanced economies experienced a deeper recession (as measured by output) than did the United States, and countries such as the U.K., France, and Japan have real GDP levels indexed below where they were at the end of 2007, an even weaker rebound than in the United States. Furthermore, in the last several quarters several of the advanced economies in Europe have actually been in decline as they have slashed their government spending.\nCosts of a Slow Recovery\nA slow recovery can have significant costs. Allow me to show you some charts that are compelling - acknowledging, of course, that charts cannot convey the human toll of the situation they depict.\nFigure 7 shows the ratio of employment to population, which has remained very flat during the recovery. This is consistent with the growth in GDP being only about 2 percent - which is enough to keep up with the growth in productivity and the labor force but not leading to the employment of a larger percent of the population. By the way, while there have been some demographic shifts within the workforce that might explain some decline in the employment-to-population ratio, they do not explain the trend in Figure 7 ; indeed, a very similar pattern emerges when looking at the employment-to-population ratio for particular age groups.\nFigure 8 shows one of the painful and unusual features of this recession and recovery, the very elevated percentage of the unemployed who have been out of work for more than six months. Unlike the deep recession in 1982, in which there was a quick recovery and as a result a relatively small and short-lived increase in long-duration unemployment, the last recession and long, weak recovery have resulted in substantially more people suffering long spells of unemployment. Long periods of unemployment frequently deplete the savings of the unemployed, make re-employment harder (as employers may be tentative about hiring those who have been unemployed for long periods of time), and may lead to skills becoming less than current. These problems highlight why it is important to generate faster growth to avoid what some call labor market \"scarring\" - where long-duration unemployment becomes ingrained into our labor market.\nWhat Should Monetary Policymakers Do?\nThe Great Stagnation in Japan did lead to a monetary policy response from the Japanese central bank. The Bank of Japan eased rates until they hit the zero lower bound, and then as Figure 9 shows, began to gradually expand the assets of the central bank.\nHowever, there were key differences from the policy actions we have taken at the Federal Reserve. The Bank of Japan only gradually expanded the assets on its balance sheet, and only after a delay of a number of years. Many of its purchases were of short-term securities, which had little impact on already-low short-term rates. This is in contrast to the impact that the U.S. Federal Reserve's purchases of longer-duration assets have had on longer-term rates, which remain well above zero and thus have room to decline.\nFinally, the Japanese central bank may in my view have prematurely stopped the growth in their balance sheet, considering the weakness in the Japanese economy at the time. As a result, the Japanese economy has remained stagnant and despite having an expanded balance sheet for an extended period, the Japanese continue to struggle with a deflation problem rather than an inflation problem, as the bottom chart on Figure 9 shows.\nTurning to the U.S., the differences in policy are quite striking. There was a rapid expansion of the Fed's balance sheet (see Figure 10), as well as a fiscal stimulus. This may be why we have not experienced a significant decline in the trend growth rate in the economy, seen in an earlier chart. There has also been a focus on bringing long-term interest rates down, and more recently on utilizing monetary policy communication strategies to convey that rates will likely remain low until the recovery and labor markets show a more sustained improvement.\nTo reiterate, a key difference is that we didn't hesitate (by years) to take significant actions in the U.S. And when we took actions, they were forceful. And going forward, we also don't want to make the mistake of retreating at the first, early signs of improvement. Japan's experience suggests one must continue until improvement is sustainable and will persist.\nHowever, despite these differences there is an important similarity between our situation and Japan's, as well. Just as Japan has not experienced inflation despite a rapid expansion of their balance sheet, our measure of inflation (the personal consumption expenditure deflator) is currently only 1.3 percent through July despite our balance sheet expanding significantly four years ago (see the bottom chart on Figure 10).\nRecent Actions\nLast Thursday the FOMC announced several new policies, summarized in the next two slides. The Fed announced a number of important policy changes.\nFirst, in addition to exchanging (as previously announced) $45 billion of short-term Treasury securities for an equal amount of long-term Treasury bonds through the maturity extension program running through December, the Fed will purchase $40 billion a month in agency mortgage backed securities (MBS). These purchases of MBS should place downward pressure on U.S. mortgage rates, which should support the housing market by lowering borrowing costs and providing additional support for house-prices to appreciate from depressed levels. The housing market should be stronger than if these actions were not taken.\nSecond, the purchases of agency MBS will likely affect the yields on other, similar long-term assets, such as Treasury bonds and corporate bonds. Bonds of similar maturity, duration and risk characteristics are viewed as substitutes for MBS by many investors. Removing some of the MBS from private circulation will create a scarcity of long-maturity, lower-risk securities. This shortage will lower both MBS and other long-term interest rates in the marketplace, with effects that are qualitatively similar to the effects we have when we lower the federal funds rate (something we cannot do now, as it is at the zero lower bound). As a consequence, our policy will have effects on a broad array of economic activity beyond the direct effects on residential investment.\nThird, I would note that the plan to purchase MBS securities is open-ended. As the FOMC indicated in its statement last week, the MBS purchases and potentially the use of other tools will continue until there has been improvement in labor markets. This means the policy actions are being conditioned on an economic outcome rather than a set timeframe. This should provide market participants confidence that the Federal Reserve will do what it takes to improve economic outcomes.\nFourth, highly accommodative policy will continue for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. This means that we will ensure the economy is truly strengthening before raising interest rates. Highly accommodative policy is currently likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.\nThe Initial Impact of Policy Actions\nThe table shown in Figure 11 provides some estimates of the financial impacts of the Fed's recent policy announcement. Such impacts are difficult to measure with any precision, given anticipation about our possible actions built into markets, and the reality that other events can occur coincident with the action.\nStill, for reference the first column provides the financial market response when the FOMC announcement was made. The second column extends the period to Thursday and Friday as financial market participants had more time to analyze the policy change and Chairman Bernanke's press conference explaining the announcement. The third column begins the financial response at the Chairman's August speech at the Jackson Hole conference, which was widely viewed as increasing the likelihood of a more forceful easing, though the specifics were not known. The final column dates the event from the prior FOMC meeting, when most observers interpreted the statement as making further forceful action more likely.\nWhile this table shows a range of impacts, I would say in sum that regardless of the event window chosen, stock prices are up substantially, mortgage rates are lower, and exchange rates are lower. On the latter I would point out that our efforts to lower long rates are focused on stimulating domestic demand, but at the same time lower long-term rates affect demand for U.S. assets, resulting in a modest change in the exchange rate - and this is likely to provide some support for export-oriented industries.\nAll of these impacts are very consistent with what we would expect of the monetary transmission \"channels\" of purchasing mortgage backed securities and providing additional forward guidance on policy. In fact, they are also quite consistent with the transmission channel that we expect when conducting \"normal\" - i.e. federal funds rate - monetary policy when we are not constrained by the zero lower bound.\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum, the actions taken by the Federal Reserve last week provide significant additional support to the economic recovery. They should result in stronger economic growth, and return us to full employment more quickly than would be the case absent the policies.\nHowever, monetary policy is not a panacea. Appropriate fiscal policies domestically, and improvement in the global economy could both provide significant positive effects, and shorten the time needed for unconventional monetary policy actions like those we have announced. In addition, it is important to note that significant fiscal policy mistakes, such as an unlikely failure to address the looming \"fiscal cliff\" in the U.S., would have effects on economic growth that would be difficult to fully offset with monetary policy.\nIt is my firm belief that the monetary policy actions taken last week should contribute to a faster economic recovery and a more rapid improvement in labor markets than we would have seen in their absence. However, I want to be careful not to appear to promise too much, as there are limits to the effects of monetary policy. Even with these actions, and assuming no additional negative shocks domestically or internationally, it will still be several years before we are likely to return to full employment.\nWhile that is not an especially upbeat sentiment on which to end my remarks, I think it underlines the importance of our taking action. A very challenging economic climate confronts us all, but I am very pleased that monetary policymakers in the U.S. are proving willing to take difficult actions like these rather than accept the possibility of a long, slow recovery turning into a stagnation that someday earns the dubious title of \"Great.\" Japan's experience is a sobering real-world reminder of why forceful and timely action is appropriate.\nThank you.",

            "content": "The Sasin Bangkok Forum on \"Asia in Transformation\" Bangkok, Thailand\nThe Economic Outlook\nBanking Interconnectedness\nWhat about Asia?\nConcluding Observations\nIt is a great pleasure to have been invited to participate in this session on financial crises and the future of global and Asian banking. I am particularly honored to be sharing the podium with Professor Takatoshi Ito, whose research interests have paralleled my own in studying the impact of banking problems in Japan; and Dr. Prasarn Trairatvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand and thus a colleague in central banking.\nAs always, I should note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nThe important role that financial institutions play in macroeconomic stability - or instability - has been reaffirmed in recent years. Large global banks amplified economic problems in 2007 and 2008, and contributed to the pervasiveness and severity of the recession experienced around the world. Since that time, many banks have taken the opportunity to improve their capital ratios and reduce their risk, and regulators have been focused on achieving a more stable financial system, not just on supervision of individual institutions. [1]\nIndeed, global banks can provide some significant benefits because they are less susceptible to local economic problems, can introduce state-of-the-art technology and risk management tools, and provide highly competitive rates for firms to finance global trade. Despite enhanced risk-management strategies and the attention many global banks have given to improving their financial resilience, these banks still have the potential to adversely impact [2] global financial stability and economic outcomes - through their capacity to rapidly amplify and transmit significant financial shocks across sovereign and continental borders. So the banks are certainly worthy of the additional study and attention they are now receiving.\nToday I plan to briefly cover three related topics. First, I would like to discuss the economic outlook, with particular attention to recent economic trends in the United States. Second, I will examine the interconnectedness of global financial institutions. Third, I will briefly review how intertwined banking markets showed themselves to be in 2007-2008 - with an eye to what we might expect should we experience a significant financial shock emanating, for example, from Europe.\nThe Economic Outlook\nBefore talking about these banking issues, I think it is important to provide some economic context to our discussion. In the U.S., the 2007-2009 recession led to significant excess capacity, particularly in the labor market. Although the unemployment rate has declined since it reached its peak in October of 2009, significant excess capacity remains.\nRecent data from both the United States and China are consistent with a slowdown in economic growth, and it looks like Europe is in a recession - with some European countries experiencing sharply negative growth. Based on recent incoming data, many economists have been downgrading their forecasts for the United States. Consistent with this trend, members of the Federal Open Market Committee - which sets monetary policy in the United States - recently released (in June) forecasts for the U.S. economy which show deterioration from the April economic forecast.\nThe projections shown in Figure 1 represent the central tendency of the forecasts provided by the Fed Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The three highest and three lowest forecasts are dropped to provide the central tendency. As the figure indicates, the central tendency has shifted, and now reflects an expectation that economic growth will be positive but quite weak. Consistent with that forecast, the FOMC participants now expect little improvement over the remainder of the year in the unemployment rate from its current level of 8.2 percent. In terms of inflation, the expectation is that personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation will be well below our target of 2 percent - with lower oil and commodity prices, a stronger dollar, and very subdued labor costs all contributing to the lower inflation estimate.\nDespite this rather gloomy collective forecast, I actually have been more pessimistic than my colleagues. My forecast for GDP is below the central tendency, my forecast for unemployment is above the central tendency, and my forecast for inflation is at the bottom of the range of the central tendency. My pessimism is rooted in an expectation of weakness in investment, net exports, and government spending. That weakness is driven in part by concerns about economic and financial conditions in Europe, combined with restrained state and federal government spending as the U.S. (like many other countries) grapples with large budget deficits.\nIn particular, my discussions with bankers, exporters, and business managers indicate more restraint by firms in investing in capital, and in hiring employees, as the firms wait for some of the economic uncertainty to be resolved. However, a quick resolution for European sovereign debt concerns and banking problems may remain elusive, [3] and the same for the large deficit problems in many countries. This suggests that slow growth is likely to continue for quite some time.\nFigure 2 shows business fixed investment in the United States during the most recent four quarters. As you can see, with concerns over Europe heating up in the last two quarters, business fixed investment has slowed. Firms have become more tentative, which I expect will, unfortunately, continue. One reason for my pessimism is the recent weakness in orders for capital goods, for example aircraft.\nIndicating just how weak employment has been, Figure 3 compares the monthly change in U.S. employment during the most recent and past three recoveries. As you can see, compared to the average of the last three recoveries, employment data have come in quite weak. Employment growth is slower now - in the third year of recovery - than it has been at the same point in any of the previous three recoveries. In fact, just in the past three months employment growth in the U.S. has slowed fairly noticeably. Admittedly, the rate of growth is just one facet of the employment situation - employment-level comparisons are important, and currently sobering. I will turn to that a bit later, but for now will just observe that these growth rate indicators are not a positive sign. Apparently, firms have become more tentative in the face of growing global economic uncertainties. The slowdown in employment growth not only hinders our ability to get to full employment, but also weakens the consumer side of the economy even more, going forward. This suggests a self-fulfilling dynamic at work as concern over a potentially significant slowdown in the future reduces current growth, as firms invest less capital and hire fewer workers than they would in the absence of these uncertainties.\nBanking Interconnectedness\nGiven my concerns that economic growth will disappoint, what are the implications for global banking? I would highlight first the high degree of interconnectedness between and among global banks, particularly among U.S. and European banks. In New England, where I reside, three of the five largest banks active in the region are foreign - from the U.K., Canada, and Spain. This is not just a New England feature, as foreign and in particular European banks are very active in both retail and wholesale markets throughout the United States.\nFigure 4 lists the ten largest foreign banking organizations in the United States by total U.S. assets. Five are European banks, three are Canadian, and two are Japanese. Several of the largest banking organizations have subsidiaries that have substantial retail franchises in the United States. In addition, the total assets of branches and agencies of three of the banks exceed $100 billion, likely indicating very significant \"wholesale\" operations, since most branches and agencies have virtually no retail deposit accounts in the United States because they cannot be FDIC insured.\nWhile several Japanese banks have had a significant presence in the United States, their role has diminished over the past 15 years. And no other Asian banks are among the largest banks operating in the U.S.\nFigure 5 presents the assets of the ten largest U.S. broker-dealers owned by foreign banking organizations. The chart shows that European firms have a very significant presence in the United States. The six largest foreign-owned broker-dealers are all European, and all have assets over $100 billion. These foreign-owned broker-dealers provide a variety of market-making and underwriting activity. This means that many European banks are highly interconnected with the U.S. financial system. Again, with the exception of one Japanese bank, the Asian bank presence in the U.S. is not nearly as significant as the European presence.\nFigure 6 plots some broad stock indices for the U.S., Europe, China, and Japan. The indices for the U.S. and Europe move very closely together throughout the crisis period - and while they continue to move closely together, more recently the European index has drifted lower. In contrast, while all the stock indices experienced sharp declines in the fall of 2008, over time the Asian indices are generally not as tightly connected with those of the U.S. and Europe.\nFigure 7 plots the 26-week trailing correlation of U.S. and European stock index returns over the last six years. The chart shows a very high and consistent correlation between the stock indices, indicating a very close link between U.S. and European markets. Figure 8 plots the 26-week trailing correlation of the returns of U.S. and European bank stocks. They too show a high degree of correlation, which has remained relatively stable. Given the close trade and financial ties between the U.S. and Europe, this may not be surprising.\nEuropean stocks were badly impacted by the financial shock from the U.S. during the last financial crisis. Were there to be a serious financial shock from Europe, these correlations suggest it is quite likely that it would have a large impact on financial stocks and the broader stock market in the United States. Such stock price declines could impact households and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, and problems in Europe could potentially cause a more significant retrenchment by European financial institutions operating in the United States. [4]\nWhat about Asia?\nAs I mentioned earlier, historically Asian banks have not been as integrated with the United States as European banks. While Asian banks have certainly been impacted by the global slowdown and reduction in international trade, their lesser degree of interconnectedness compared to European banks means one might not expect to see as tight a link to financial problems emanating from the United States for Asian banks.\nFigure 9 and 10 show the correlations between U.S. large (global) bank stock returns and those of Japan and China. During the early stages of the financial crisis in 2007, there was a very low correlation between bank stock returns in the United States and Asia. However, that correlation has risen over time, although it still remains below the correlation between U.S. and European global banks.\nFigures 11 and 12 show the correlations between European bank stock returns and those of global banks in Japan and China. They also have been rising over time. These rising stock return correlations may in part reflect a rising degree of interconnectedness between Asian financial institutions and their U.S. and European counterparts over the last six years.\nThe Bank for International Settlements provides data that highlight why the correlations may be increasing. Figure 13 shows that U.S. and U.K. banks have been increasing their presence in Asia and that other European banks have significant exposures as well. [5], [6]\nTurning to exposures to Europe, Figure 14 shows that U.S. banks have increased their claims[7] in Europe. This raises the possibility that the correlation between returns in the U.S. and Europe could be nearly as tight in the event of a European disruption as they proved to be during the U.S. financial crisis. Only Japan and Taiwan currently provide data on foreign claims in Europe, but they also are at relatively high levels. It should be noted that both in this graph and the previous, the conversion of two investment banks into bank holding companies causes a significant break in the U.S. series in the first quarter of 2009 - most noticeable on Figure 14 where there is a sharp increase in that period. Nonetheless, even after accounting for that break, the trend is the same, and the level of exposure is quite high.\nIn sum, while Asian banks did not have a high correlation with U.S. and European bank stock returns during 2007 and early 2008, Asian banks are likely to be more impacted now should a significant shock occur in Europe. European bank presence in Asia has been rising, and Japan and Taiwan have relatively large claims in Europe.[8] In short, I would say that as interconnectedness increases globally, it will be difficult for any one region to insulate itself from financial strains or crises elsewhere in the world.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that recent data have been consistent with a slowdown in economic activity in many parts of the world. This likely reflects a widespread concern that global trade may be disrupted if there is an international financial shock, and that businesses are postponing hiring and investment decisions until the global outlook is more certain.\nWhile a large financial shock would impact the global economy, global banks have the potential to amplify that shock. While Asian global banks' stock returns were not highly correlated with those of U.S. and European global banks in the last crisis, the correlation has been on the rise over the past six years. Beyond the obvious trade impact if problems were to get worse in Europe, the concern is increased due to financial markets and global banks becoming more interconnected.\nFigure 15 compares employment from its pre-recession peak in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. While U.S. employment has been gradually increasing during the recovery, it remains well below the pre-recession peak. While the declines in Europe and Japan were not as dramatic, there has been little improvement overall in the employment situation during the recovery. Given global employment and fiscal challenges, the global economy remains quite vulnerable to financial shocks. This vulnerability highlights why it is particularly important at this time to reduce the probability, and mitigate the severity, of any potential financial shock.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\nFigure 1\nEconomic Projections of FOMC Participants\nVariable APRIL FOMC Central Tendency (Percent) JUNE FOMC Central Tendency (Percent)\nUnemployment Rate (2012:Q4) 7.8 to 8.0 8.0 to 8.2\nReal GDP Growth (2011:Q4 - 2012:Q4) 2.4 to 2.9 1.9 to 2.4\nPCE Inflation (2011:Q4 - 2012:Q4) 1.9 to 2.0 1.2 to 1.7\nCore PCE Inflation (2011:Q4 - 2012:Q4) 1.8 to 2.0 1.7 to 2.0\nNote: The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable\nSource: Federal Reserve Board\nFigure 4\nAssets of the Ten Largest Foreign Banking Operations in the U.S.\nAs of December 31, 2011\nBanking Organization Home Country Total U.S. Banking Assets Branches and Agencies Banking Subsidiaries\nNumber\nAssets\nMillions of Dollars\nNumber\nAssets\nMillons of Dollars\nNumber\nAssets\nMillons of Dollars\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank Canada 4 250,131 2 47,698 2 202,433\nDeutsche Bank AG Germany 5 233,605 1 181,679 4 51,926\nHSBC Holdings PLC United Kingdom 4 215,207 1 5,815 3 209,391\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc Japan 11 206,546 8 116,345 3 90,201\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland Group United Kingdom 6 206,261 4 67,004 2 139,258\nBank of Montreal Canada 6 163,515 2 66,013 4 97,502\nThe Bank of Nova Scotia Canada 5 162,224 4 155,483 1 6,740\nBNP Paribas France 8 158,401 6 80,163 2 78,239\nBanco Santander, S.A.

            "content": "Conference sponsored by the Dutch Central Bank, the European Banking Center at Tilberg University, and the University of Kansas School of Business; in affiliation with the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking\nThe Social Costs of Financial Structures with Inadequate Capital\nMoney Market Mutual Funds Sponsored by Banking Organizations\nBroker-Dealer Financing\nConcluding Observations\nIt is a great pleasure to be invited to peak at the Dutch Central Bank and to be introduced by Klaas Knot. I had the pleasure of working with Klaas on a variety of issues related to the Basel Accord, and also had the opportunity to spend some time as a visiting scholar at the Dutch Central Bank, which provided a wonderful opportunity to interact with Klaas and his colleagues on a variety of research topics. I am happy for the opportunity to discuss how problems in financial markets and at financial intermediaries can spill over into the real economy, especially at a central bank that has had a longstanding interest in these issues.\nAs always, I should note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nSince the severe financial stresses of 2008, a variety of actions have been taken to strengthen the financial infrastructure and make banks more resilient in the face of adverse shocks. While many banks have improved their capital and liquidity positions since 2008, we still see in the headlines of newspapers around the world that financial stability remains very much an issue.\nIn some ways, central bankers must approach the issue of financial stability much like a structural engineer. Where are the potential stresses in the system? Under what circumstances could those stresses be particularly problematic? Most importantly, what remedial actions could reduce the possibility of an unstable outcome?\nToday I want to highlight an area where remedial action is still required. My goal is to focus more attention on financial structures that by design or reality [1] reduce or avoid capital charges – what is often called engaging in “capital arbitrage.” Such structures are vulnerable to stresses that can have destabilizing effects on financial markets and the broader economy. After some introductory comments about financial structures with inadequate capital, I will touch on two specific areas that merit consideration – money market mutual funds sponsored by banking organizations, and broker-dealer financing.\nThe Social Costs of Financial Structures with Inadequate Capital\nHolding little or no capital for risky activities can, during good times, generate significant profits; even in relatively low-margin businesses. However, during times of stress, the power of leverage works in reverse, amplifying the negative impact of risky activities and necessitating substantial capital and liquidity at a time when both are in short supply.\nThese problems become compounded in episodes when the inadequacy of capital becomes apparent in the marketplace. Investors who normally fund these structures, very often via short-term lending, flee – and they also flee financial institutions that are perceived to stand behind these structures (sponsoring institutions, which I will discuss in a moment). In this way, the capital arbitrage that motivated the risky structures could contribute to a liquidity strain on what has come to be known as the shadow banking system, and could stress the financial institutions that were integral to its creation. The reason we care about this is that such an episode often produces instability in important channels for funding real economic activity – so these Wall Street concerns can have Main Street impacts. [2]\nStructured investment vehicles or “SIVs” illustrated this dynamic very well. Financial institutions created SIVs as off-balance-sheet structures that were financed with short-term liabilities but frequently invested in longer-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities. [3] The associated credit and interest-rate risk became apparent, as losses from these assets rose. Investors were no longer willing to purchase the short-term paper issued by these structures. Consequently, many financial institutions, as a result of implicit or explicit guarantees, were forced to bring these assets onto their balance sheet – where they were often subject to more significant capital requirements. This led to substantial losses, balance sheet expansion, and a shortage of capital – all of which hindered the meeting of funding needs in the real economy.\nFortunately, the riskiest and most opaque structures of this sort have largely disappeared from the marketplace. But problematic structures still remain.\nRuns on complex securitizations, prime money market mutual funds, and investment banks all contributed to the severity of the 2008 crisis. Compounding the problem, the investment bank structures were built on an assumption that runs were unlikely as long as lenders held collateral against their loans. In the depths of the crisis, however, lenders realized that relying on collateral could leave them with securities that they did not wish to hold – or in some cases that they were not even legally allowed to hold. [4] When large losses on subprime mortgage assets and complex products amplified uncertainty about the value of collateral, investors ran – even though they held collateralized positions.\nDespite the lessons provided by the crisis, there remain a variety of financial structures that are “capital efficient” from the perspective of market participants, but in my view continue to be susceptible to strains on short-term funding during times of financial market stress or crisis.\nI will argue today that one way to address these structures is to make them the focus of stress tests that result in meaningful decisions about capital adequacy. Continuing the structural engineer analogy, the stress tests can be helpful much in the way that structural engineers test the resilience of different designs against modeled events like earthquakes and storms. Banking organizations that sponsor so-called capital-efficient structures should conduct stress tests that include a focus on whether these structures will require support during periods of severe market or idiosyncratic stress, and what the impact would be on the organization at that time. This might lead financial institutions to be more attentive to these undercapitalized structures, consistent with institutions focusing on the amount of capital required to survive stressed conditions – rather than the capital needed strictly to satisfy regulatory requirements.\nBy using stress tests to identify the possible capital and liquidity demands from these structures during a crisis, the institution’s management, board of directors, and regulators can better determine the appropriateness of the structures and the associated capital and liquidity – and whether these structures are likely to be beneficial to the organization at all times, or only during good times.\nMoney Market Mutual Funds Sponsored by Banking Organizations\nAs an example, I want to highlight money market mutual fund sponsors in the United States. Specifically, I will discuss the possibility of using stress tests to illuminate the impact of various scenarios on fund sponsors, many of which are banks or financial institutions.\nMy primary focus will be on prime money market mutual funds, with approximately $1.41 trillion in total assets as of May 31. [5] Prime funds invest in a variety of securities that carry more credit risk than traditional U.S. Treasury securities. [6] Money market mutual funds allow investors to potentially earn a higher return on short-term investments in part because – unlike banks – money market mutual funds are not required to hold capital. As a result, they often pay a competitive rate relative to bank deposits, and they provide investors many features similar to traditional bank deposits – for example, immediate availability of funds as well as a fixed net asset value that does not fluctuate when the value of assets held by the money fund changes.\nSo money market mutual funds provide investors with an investment vehicle with features like bank deposits – but the funds do not hold capital. The problem is that a financial intermediary – which has no capital, but takes credit risk, and provides under normal circumstances [7] immediately available funds at a fixed net asset value – may be inviting trouble. Such a fund can be susceptible if the credit risk of the assets it invests in were to rise, causing investors to become concerned about the fund’s ability to sell its assets, meet redemption demands, and maintain a stable net asset value. Consequently, the implicit expectation of a bank-deposit-like investment can unravel, and the incentives to redeem could be strong.\nAs Figure 1 shows, when the Reserve Primary Fund could no longer provide a fixed net asset value to investors in the wake of the Lehman Brothers failure, investors ran not only from the Reserve Primary Fund, but also from prime money market mutual funds in general. The top panel shows the outflows in the form of the daily changes in prime fund assets. It is particularly easy for investors to exit prime money market mutual funds, especially when they can easily redeem shares [8] from a prime fund and invest the proceeds in a government-securities-only fund, even within the same fund family.\nAs is clear in Figure 1, the large outflow of funds from prime money market mutual funds was accompanied to a notable degree by an inflow of funds to government-only money market mutual funds. This is shown in the bottom panel on the figure.\nWhile the funds may remain in the same fund family with this shift, investors who do not exit from the prime money market mutual fund could be financially impacted, [9] and the prime fund might need to engage in a fire sale of assets to meet investor demands. Furthermore, firms counting on money market mutual funds to provide funding (for example by buying their debt – their commercial paper) can suddenly find that the primary purchasers of their paper are no longer active in the market. [10]\nFacing all this in 2008, as well as the damage to credit flows and eventually economic activity in general, the U.S. Treasury responded to the run on prime money market mutual funds by providing insurance, and the Federal Reserve created a lending facility designed to provide liquidity to money market mutual funds. [11] Questions remain as to whether support could or would be possible today, given changes ushered in by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nOur concerns should be amplified by the fact that many prime funds are sponsored by depository institutions or their affiliates. Figure 2 shows the breakdown of prime money market mutual funds (by percent of assets and by number of funds) by category of sponsor. Just under half the assets are held in funds sponsored by an asset manager not affiliated with a depository institution. But domestic (U.S.) bank holding companies, foreign bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies (in other words companies affiliated with depository institutions) combined serve as the sponsoring organizations for a bit more than half the prime fund assets, and more than half of the number of funds.\nWhile SEC regulations restrict the credit risk and maturity risk of prime money market mutual fund investments, these funds nonetheless can and do invest in risky assets. An example is provided by the number and value of Dexia obligations held by money market mutual funds at the end of 2010, less than one year before the Belgian and French governments needed to bail out the bank.\nAs Figure 3 shows, a large number of money market mutual funds with various types of sponsors held Dexia paper at the beginning of the year in which Dexia failed. However, funds sponsored by banks or bank affiliates were over-weighted relative to funds sponsored by asset management firms not affiliated with a bank, both in the number of funds invested in Dexia and the value of Dexia assets.\nParticularly notable is the number of foreign-bank-sponsored money market mutual funds with exposure to Dexia. While money funds unloaded their Dexia holdings before the government bailout, there was a noteworthy willingness to hold the obligations of a troubled large financial intermediary that had widely known problems – perhaps because many expected it to receive government support in the event of distress. This is similar to what happened with the Lehman failure – when such expectations turned out to be quite wrong.\nAs recent studies have highlighted, it is quite common for money market mutual funds that have impaired assets to obtain support from their sponsors. [12] Whether this is a cash infusion or a purchase at face value of an impaired asset, [13] this support can represent draws on capital [14] at times when the sponsoring organization is facing other capital pressures.\nFigure 4 shows support-related losses by fund sponsors, using data provided by Moody’s and broken down by sponsor type. Moody’s data capture losses attributed to money market mutual funds that are disclosed on the sponsoring company’s financial statements. [15] Note that depository institution sponsors had significant losses during 2008, a time when many depository institutions were already facing significant capital and liquidity pressures.\nWhile most of the losses were during stressful times, even during non-stressful times there are some losses. Figure 5 sums the losses recognized over the five-year period of 2007 to 2011. The degree of sponsor support is substantial. Support has been quite large and particularly prevalent for prime money market mutual funds which have depository institution or depository institution affiliated sponsors. Over this period, Moody’s reports almost $9 billion in losses associated with money market mutual funds by depository institution or depository institution affiliated sponsors.\nThe SEC has been working on reform proposals that would provide several measures to reduce the risk of stresses during times of financial market crisis and provide some capital support. [16] I am very supportive of the current push within the SEC for additional reforms, which have the potential of mitigating many of the concerns I am sharing today. As the primary regulator of money funds, the SEC is in a position to adopt rules that would address the vulnerabilities of those funds more comprehensively, effectively, and efficiently than other approaches. However, at this time it is unclear what the final proposal will be, or whether the SEC’s final proposal will be adopted.\nIn the absence of such reforms for all money market mutual funds, an alternative for funds with depository institution or depository institution affiliated sponsors would be to include likely money market mutual fund support in the sponsor’s stress tests. Based on the historical experience of their money market funds, the historical experience of similar funds, and their money market funds’ exposures, sponsors could calculate the likely capital support needed from the organization in a stress scenario.\nAgain, this is an admittedly partial approach, in the absence of more comprehensive reforms that I hope will occur. But this approach would at least make more banking organizations more resilient (it would not be just money market mutual fund structures that would need capital – any financial structure that broke down during stress would need more capital) but it would also make clearer to money market mutual fund investors that banks had capital that could support funds during stressful periods. It would thus make clear that money market mutual funds with well capitalized sponsors are likely to be less risky than those that do not have well capitalized sponsors.\nSimilarly, other financial products that circumvent standard capital requirements – such as non 2a-7 “money market like” funds, stable value wrap products, and asset-backed commercial paper – could lead investors to expect that the sponsor holds capital for the support that these products could need in times of stress. While some firms are likely to argue they would not provide support for so-called capital efficient products, the high frequency of support of money market mutual funds and other off-balance-sheet items during the crisis makes such claims dubious.\nIn fact, this support might be encouraged by regulators during a crisis, in order to avoid broader problems of financial instability. U.S. banking regulators have [17] tacitly acknowledged that bank holding companies may provide such support, subject to limitations identified in Figure 6. [18]\nBroker-Dealer Financing\nAllow me now to turn to a second area for consideration. What we call broker-dealer financing became particularly problematic during the financial crisis. With the failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman, it became apparent that broker-dealers, like traditional depository institutions, could be vulnerable to stresses during times of crisis.\nFor depository institutions, of course, concerns over the potential for runs have led to significant regulations to reduce their likelihood. During the Great Depression, runs on banks created banking panics that resulted in large losses for depositors and a significant reduction in credit – and those difficult episodes led to a variety of regulations to make runs on banks less likely. The creation of deposit insurance reduced the incentive for insured depositors to run during periods of financial stress, and mitigated the sharp reduction in credit availability that accompanies large deposit outflows from banks. In addition, in the U.S. (and some other countries) depository institutions have access to the central bank’s “lender of last resort” credit facilities, which are intended to provide liquidity but not protection from insolvency. Deposit insurance and the lender of last resort function assist banks in providing one of their fundamental services – transforming short-term deposits into longer-term assets, since the risk of a sudden need to liquidate assets to meet unexpected outflows of deposits is greatly diminished.\nBroker-dealers in the United States have not had the benefit of similar regulatory protections. They do not typically have access to central bank lending, and they do not have insurance that reduces the risk of unexpected outflows. Instead, broker-dealers rely on collateralized arrangements that allow them to be market makers, under the assumption that wholesale creditors will be comfortable providing funds as long as there is sufficient collateral backing them. In addition, banks that are part of larger bank holding companies are subject to Section 23 A and B restrictions designed to protect the deposit insurance fund from providing support to non-bank affiliates, including broker-dealers.\nFigure 7 details the direct access that broker-dealers have to central bank credit in various jurisdictions as well as constraints to indirect access through affiliated banks. It shows the differences across countries in providing liquidity to broker-dealers from the central bank or from bank affiliates. In both Switzerland and Japan, broker-dealers do have access to liquidity facilities at the central bank. However, it is not unusual to place limitations on the ability of bank affiliates to provide liquidity to their broker dealer affiliates as countries seek to avoid or limit having deposit insurance funds exposed to non-bank affiliate activities.\nFigure 8 summarizes the average composition of the balance sheets of large bank holding companies with high and low concentrations of broker-dealer activities. The figure highlights the very different asset-liability mix, on average, of bank holding companies that have sizeable broker-dealer operations compared to those that do not. A traditional depository institution has loans as the primary asset class, and core deposits as the primary liability category. The loans and certain securities held can serve as collateral for potential discount window borrowings, and deposit insurance limits the incentive for insured depositors to run.\nIn contrast, bank holding companies with a relatively high concentration of broker-dealer activity tend to hold more assets that are liquid and invest in highly marketable securities that can be refinanced through repurchase agreements – since broker-dealer operations cannot be funded by insured deposits. In short, you see greater use of short-term, non-deposit funding sources at the bank holding companies with high concentrations of broker-dealer activity.\nDuring the financial crisis in 2008, the difficulty in maintaining collateralized funding prompted the introduction of a primary dealer credit facility at the Federal Reserve. This facility provided a way for broker-dealers to obtain short-term funding for their marketable securities because they otherwise did not have direct access to the Fed’s discount window.\nGiven the potential liquidity challenges to broker-dealer financing during periods of great stress, many broker-dealers have bolstered their regulatory capital and adjusted the composition of their balance sheet. Figure 9 shows that bank holding companies with large broker-dealer affiliates have been increasing their Tier 1 common equity capital ratios and holding more Tier 1 common equity capital than bank holding companies with less of a concentration in broker-dealer activities (although they have also been increasing their Tier 1 common equity capital). Figure 10 shows that the improvement in capital is less dramatic when using a leverage ratio measure of capital that does not reflect a shift to lower risk-weighted assets.\nMarkets are sensitive to the differences in these risk profiles. Figure 11 shows how stock prices of bank holding companies were impacted during three elevated stress periods – the fall of 2008, the fall of 2011, and the first part of this year. The chart shows that during stress periods, bank holding companies with a low concentration in broker-dealer activities had less stock price response to the stress periods than institutions with greater concentrations in broker-dealer activities.\nOne way to assess the increased market sensitivity of bank holding companies might be to model in stress tests how a sudden shortage of liquidity might impact broker-dealer operations, and determine the capital implications. Potentially, broker-dealers could be structured in such a way that liquidity facilities would not be necessary for broker-dealers during times of financial stress.\nHowever, if a stress test highlights the benefits to those firms of having additional capital or more liquid assets, it should also take into account the costs involved. Firms might be less willing to make markets in less liquid assets or might shrink their balance sheets to meet higher capital requirements, and thus reduce market-making activities in potentially important sectors of financial markets.\nAn alternative would be to develop a framework where, under certain conditions, liquidity facilities would be regularly made available for broker-dealers during periods of high stress. This arrangement would recognize that, like more traditional depositories, broker-dealers are subject to illiquidity in markets, and their reaction to that illiquidity can exacerbate the problem.\nFrom a public policy perspective, the rationale for promoting market functioning during times of stress is that liquidity strains and other stresses at market makers, like the matter of runs on depositories, can have a broader impact on the overall economy. However, more analytical work needs to be done to better understand broker-dealer activities during times of stress, as well as the potential costs and benefits of alternatives for addressing the potential for stresses at broker-dealers. [19] At a minimum, stress tests that focus on the behavior of broker-dealers and their counterparties during times of stress should be undertaken and their implications well understood.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would note that a major innovation that resulted from the financial crisis was increased attention to stress tests. The stress tests provide an opportunity for banking organization management teams, boards of directors, investors, and regulators to better understand the impact of stressful financial conditions. Increasing the focus of stress tests beyond safety and soundness of individual institutions to more systemic concerns and implications — such as how markets and institutions behave during periods of stress — is an under-researched area that deserves more attention. These are the relatively early stages of understanding how best to conduct stress tests, and what the implications of those tests should be for financial institutions. This is, and will continue to be, an iterative process.\nI have highlighted two areas where more work needs to be done. The first is to provide more focus on financial structures that were designed to be “capital efficient.” Such structures can be major stress points in the financial infrastructure. Using stress tests to better understand the implications of undercapitalized financial structures will take time, but needs to be better integrated into frameworks for managing and supervising institutions. Money market mutual funds with bank or bank affiliated sponsors provide one example, especially because there has been a pattern of support for money market mutual funds without an explicit recognition that such funds can be a capital drain during times of stress.\nA second area that deserves more attention is the behavior and resilience of broker-dealer arrangements during times of financial stress. While the role of depositories and their susceptibility to runs has received much attention, I believe more work needs to be done on the implications of potential crisis-related stresses at broker-dealers that do not have access to liquidity facilities. Utilizing stress tests to better understand vulnerabilities should help inform us about ways to enhance financial stability.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. I look forward to our continued progress on these important issues of financial stability – which, as we have learned, can impact the real economy and all its participants.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "The Institute of International Finance Spring Membership Meeting Copenhagen, Denmark\nI have been asked to briefly discuss the risks to the economic and financial outlook.[1] In some sense, this is much easier than the jobs assigned to other panelists tasked with forecasting the outlook for either financial markets or the real economy. At a time when some of the risk scenarios are increasingly seeping into relevance, forecasting the most likely outcome can be quite difficult.\nRisks that one year ago were viewed as so-called \"tail-risk events\" are increasingly being integrated into many peoples' base forecasts. This shift highlights that risks are once again on the rise, and that uncertainty about some of the challenges facing the global economy is already impacting the economic behavior of households and businesses.\nSuch uncertainty is leading to a degree of risk aversion that becomes apparent when we look at 10-year government bond rates in the U.S., U.K., and Germany (Figure 1). In all three countries, 10-year government bond rates are well below the inflation targets of their respective central banks. The fact that 10-year government bonds are trading at well below 2 percent indicates that perceived risks are leaving investors willing to purchase an asset that would provide a negative real return for 10 years (assuming that central banks are successful in hitting their inflation targets). For investors to view this pricing as reasonable implies that rising inflation is not a prime concern of financial market participants. It seems investors believe that central banks are more likely to undershoot their inflation targets than overshoot them, and that policymakers need to be particularly attentive to the downside risks of their economic and financial outlooks - and examine how best to mitigate these risks.\nSome analysts have focused on direct exposures of financial institutions to a particular geographic location as a measure of current risk exposures. I would say that such measures do not capture the true risks. For example, in 2008 signs of potential disruption in financial intermediation activity and liquidity were a much better gauge of the financial and economic risks building up in the system than were measures of direct exposure to sub-prime U.S. mortgages. While it took many months for sub-prime credit losses to materialize, sources of short-term funding dried up well in advance, providing a timelier indicator of underlying stresses than measures of credit exposure. This episode highlights the risk that remains today to any institution that relies heavily on shortterm funding to finance its business, and suggests that monitoring stresses in short-term funding markets may provide better early indications of troubles to come.\nIn 2008, many financial institutions learned that strategies of capital arbitrage, often in the form of holding assets off-balance sheet to avoid capital charges, were profitable during good times but were recipes for disaster during times of financial stress. Those structures quickly lost the confidence of counterparties who had been funding them, and thus became a significant problem to financial institutions. Fortunately, some of the most egregious structures, like certain structured investment vehicles (SIVs), have been wound down.\nFurthermore, many financial institutions have taken measures over the past several years to bolster capital and liquidity. However, we - banks and regulators - need to understand better how funding models and investment structures are likely to behave under severe stress. Our best way to learn more about that is through ongoing stress tests. Such tests should focus on undercapitalized structures, or structures that are sufficiently opaque or risky that they are likely to require significant capital or liquidity at a time when they are particularly expensive.\nFinancial institutions and their regulators must make continued progress in reducing the institutions' sensitivity to rapid changes in risk preferences, and the consequences of such shifts for funding the assets of many institutions. In recent years and recent weeks, such shifts have pulled funders out of many risky investments and into the lowest-risk financial vehicles - most often the sovereign debt of the safest countries. This dynamic lies behind the recent surge in demand for U.S., U.K., and German bonds. The financial system remains quite vulnerable to this rapid shrinkage of funding sources.\nA second significant risk is that a failure to decisively resolve banking problems could cause collateral damage to the global economy. Historically, Japan is probably the leading example of how the failure to aggressively address banking problems can yield serious collateral damage. A protracted period of deleveraging of bank balance sheets, coupled with a persistent pattern of allocating capital to defer the realization of unavoidable losses, can cause an extended period of significantly misallocated resources. Such misallocation hoards scarce funds in inefficient investments and siphons them away from profitable and productive new investment opportunities. The combination of a banking system in denial, with business and households that are constrained by deleveraging and risk-avoidance, helps explain why recessions that are accompanied by financial crises are often deeper and slower to recover.\nThe global economy remains at risk. The longer the risks I have highlighted remain unaddressed, the more that investors, financial institutions, households, and businesses will shift what they considered tail risks into their expected outcomes. In this way, concerns about the possibility of future problems cause a substantial reduction in current economic growth. Policymakers and financial institutions need to continue to improve the robustness of the financial system in order to minimize the impact of this uncertainty.\nThank you for inviting me to join this panel today.",

            "content": "The Worcester Regional Research Bureau's 27th Annual Meeting Worcester, Massachusetts\nRecent Economic Data\nLabor Markets\nConcluding Observations\nI would like to thank Ralph Crowley, both for his kind introduction and for his service as chair of the Boston Fed's New England Advisory Council - a group that plays a valued role, providing us with perspectives on business conditions facing small and medium-sized companies around New England. Advisory councils like the one Ralph chairs provide information and perspectives that help us at the Fed interpret trends in the economic data.\nI have been in your city a number of times in recent years, but the last time I gave a speech in Worcester specifically on the economic outlook, like today, it was at the Worcester Economic Club in May of 2009. The nation was really still in the midst of the financial crisis then, so it is wonderful to be speaking with you at a somewhat more favorable time.\nWe have had 11 consecutive quarters of positive growth in gross domestic product (GDP) since the economic recovery began, and the unemployment rate nationally has declined from a peak of 10 percent to 8.1 percent in April. However, the economic recovery and the improvement in the unemployment rate continue to be frustratingly slow. My outlook, unfortunately, is for growth right around its \"potential\" rate of between two and two-and-a-half percent - which implies no significant improvement in labor markets over the course of this year. Of course I would add that all the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nAnd even this modest pace of growth is contingent on some fairly significant assumptions - that Europe will be able to muddle through its current problems, and that in the United States the government will be able to reach agreements to avoid a so-called \"fiscal cliff\" looming at the end of this year. Under current law, at the end of 2012 certain factors - including the expiration of unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut, revisions to the Alternative Minimum Tax, the expiration of the so-called \"Bush tax cuts,\" and sequestration (automatic spending cuts) associated with the Budget Control Act of 2011 - would together restrain growth by a significant fraction of GDP.[1]\nRecent Economic Data\nI would note that there has been some positive news contained in recent economic data. Figure 1 shows the improvements in two components of real GDP that are linked to households. Consumption grew 2.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, a rate that is faster than the previous three quarters and faster than the 2.2 percent growth of the overall economy. Similarly, residential investment grew 19.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, faster than the previous three quarters - and obviously well above the rate of growth in the overall economy.[2]\nThinking optimistically, the improvement in residential investment may finally be signaling that the housing sector will not continue to be a source of significant restraint on economic growth. However, my enthusiasm for a housing recovery is still moderated - by the evidence of challenges in obtaining housing finance, by the number of borrowers who owe more than their house is worth, and by the still very elevated level of home foreclosures.\nIndeed, as Figure 2 shows, housing prices across the country are moving together, and are likely being restrained by similar headwinds, rather than principally reflecting regional trends. I would expect that as the housing sector improves along with the national economy, regional differences would become prevalent and we would see a weaker correlation of housing prices across different regions of the country than we see to the far right in Figure 2.\nAnd while some sectors of the economy are improving, some significant headwinds remain. Figure 3 shows two of them. Government spending has been declining,[3] which regardless of your political views means, in the short term, less aggregate demand and less growth in the economy. And without further action by Congress to avoid the \"fiscal cliff\" that I mentioned earlier, national fiscal policy has the potential to be a much bigger headwind to faster growth in the coming year.\nBusiness investment has also been slowing. While business investment was a source of strength in the early stages of the recovery, companies have slowed investment spending more recently. To the extent that concerns over a possible worsening of future European economic problems and a possible U.S. fiscal contraction make U.S. businesses more tentative, these worries about the future can impede a more rapid recovery now.\nThis is a particularly difficult time to forecast the economy, given that significant political decisions can influence economic actions. To highlight why we should be humble about our forecasting abilities, we need only look at the size of revisions to the GDP numbers shown in Figure 4. The chart highlights the significant uncertainty associated with measures of recent economic growth. The blue dashed line plots the advance estimates of real GDP growth. The data are revised in subsequent months as more information becomes available, for example additional data on foreign trade and inventories. However, even those estimates can be significantly revised - see the red, green, and blue marks on the chart - once tax data and other information become available to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. As the chart shows, it is not uncommon for the revised data to differ from the preliminary estimates of GDP by as much as a percentage point.\nGiven the difficulty in measuring even the recent past, it should not be too surprising that estimates of the future are even more problematic. For example, economic forecasters need to make assumptions about the fiscal measures likely to be taken by European countries, some of which are facing elections with quite stark policy choices represented by the candidates on the ballot. And forecasters need to make assumptions about fiscal policy in the United States, even though it goes without saying that political choices made up and down the ballot by the U.S. electorate in the fall could lead to quite different policies.\nSince economists have no particular expertise in forecasting political results, they make estimates based on modeling likely outcomes - which often assume only modest divergence from the recent past. Despite the uncertainty inherent in them, these economic forecasts are an important aspect of how monetary policy is set.\nAt the Fed, we are now producing and publicly disclosing the estimates of real GDP growth, unemployment, and PCE[4] inflation rates produced by the FOMC participants[5] in a Summary of Economic Projections. The central tendency[6] of the FOMC participants' estimated forecasts, and my own current forecast, are provided in Figure 5.\nYou can see that my own forecasts are a little more pessimistic than the central tendency of the participants at the April FOMC meeting. I am expecting growth of only 2.3 percent for the full year, I'm sorry to say; and unfortunately no improvement in the current U.S. unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. As you can see, I also expect both total PCE inflation and core PCE inflation to be below 2 percent for 2012. My forecast of relative weakness in the economy reflects concern that the uncertainty about both Europe and the U.S. federal \"fiscal cliff\" will restrain spending by households and businesses - but it also assumes that Europe and our own fiscal situation achieve a \"muddling through.\"\nI would, however, highlight the uncertainty and downside risks to my forecast. One downside risk is that European problems could become a much greater restraint on growth this year. Another downside risk is that Middle East problems could cause an oil supply shock that negatively affects economic growth. And another is that much greater fiscal austerity could result from a potential failure to reach budget agreements.\nGiven my expectations of only modest growth, no improvement in the unemployment rate, an inflation forecast below 2 percent, and significant downside risks to the forecast, I believe monetary policy should remain accommodative at this time and indeed that we should be looking for ways that monetary policy can foster more rapid growth, to bring down the unemployment rate more quickly. I believe further monetary policy accommodation is both appropriate and necessary. The U.S., like many other countries, needs to facilitate a more rapid recovery, and monetary policy is one important tool with the potential still for encouraging faster growth.\nLabor Markets\nNow I'd like to focus in on labor markets. I remain especially concerned about the ongoing weakness there. While most observers are concerned about labor market conditions, views differ on why unemployment remains so persistently and painfully high. Some believe there are structural reasons like shortages of specific skills, or labor shortages in specific geographic regions. If this argument were true, then the more stimulative monetary policy I am proposing might not be wise.\nBut I will present some analysis today that argues that most of the problem is in a lack of aggregate demand - in the parlance of economists, it is cyclical more than structural. This is not to dismiss entirely some structural components of the current high unemployment rate. Certainly there are situations where the skills of people who had lost jobs were not well aligned with the skill sets needed in some sectors that are hiring, such as advanced manufacturing and health care. But I believe the evidence shows the bulk of the problem is cyclical. Furthermore, my desire to stimulate more growth now is partly to prevent the structural problem from becoming more severe because the economy did not re-employ workers more quickly.\nFigure 6 highlights that all census regions experienced a significant decline in employment during the recent recession, and also that there is surprisingly little regional variation during this modest recovery. The lines move together at the extreme right of the chart, versus the earlier periods depicted on the rest of the chart. While recessions tend to impact all regions of the country simultaneously, recoveries are normally more varied across regions. Differences in industrial composition and idiosyncratic variation cause regions to diverge as the recovery progresses.\nOne reason for the current similarity across regions is that two weak sectors, state and local government spending and residential investment, remain much weaker than is usual for this stage of a recovery, and have been impacting all regions of the country. The similarity across regions also highlights that inadequate demand - rather than regional employment shortages in faster growing areas - is driving employment patterns.\nFigure 7 further illustrates this point. Nationally, the unemployment rate is 8.1 percent, well above the unemployment rate in December 2007 before the onset of the recession. In fact, all census regions have much higher unemployment rates than they did before the onset of the recession, and no region today has an unemployment rate that I would see as consistent with full employment. Again, the state of affairs we see today is not consistent with serious bottlenecks created by rapid growth in certain regions preventing further progress in labor markets.\nFigure 8 illustrates in rather stark terms how unusual this recovery has been. In the previous three recoveries the previous peak in employment was reached within two years of the start of the recovery. In the current recovery, which has already exceeded two years in length, employment still remains more than 3 percent lower than the peak prior to the recession. This is partly because the recovery has been slow, and partly because the employment decline was so large.\nFigure 9 shows the current recovery and also shows employment when the construction and government sectors are excluded (the dashed lines). These two sectors have been unusually weak in this recovery - but even when these sectors are excluded, employment is nowhere close to its previous peak. This highlights that employment weakness is not tied just to problems in specific sectors of the economy.\nFigure 10 shows employment growth across industries. This recession was unusual in how pervasive the decline was across industries, reflecting a very sharp drop in overall demand as businesses significantly retrenched, given the severity of the downturn. Moreover, during the recovery the pattern has been similar across industries - with a modest pickup in employment across industries but no industry standing out as having comparably rapid growth. Again this seems more reflective of inadequate demand rather than structural impediments to growth, such as major industries being unable to find sufficient workers.\nAnd if firms were having difficulty hiring, one would expect to see wages and salaries rising in their industries. Figure 11 highlights that wages and salaries have been growing only slowly, and in most industries it is below two percent - consistent with weak labor demand in general. The tight bunching of wage and salary growth at low levels in the recent period shown to the right of the chart does not give evidence that certain industries are bidding up wages and salaries because of difficulty finding workers.\nThese employment and wage patterns are consistent with a very modest recovery in most industries and most regions of the country. Growth has been only modest nationally, and I believe we need substantially more growth if we want to achieve full employment within a reasonable period of time.\nConcluding Observations\nThe economy continues to recover, albeit at only a modest pace. I do not expect growth to pick up significantly, and therein do not expect marked improvement in the very weak labor markets.\nThe Federal Reserve is charged by Congress with what is known as our \"dual mandate\" - using monetary policy to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable employment over a reasonable horizon. The unemployment rate is well above what I expect it to be over the long run, and it is expected to remain uncomfortably high for what I consider far too long. And PCE inflation is likely to be below 2 percent this year and for some time to come.\nGiven the poor current conditions and my forecast for continued weakness - and the evidence that suggests the problem is one of aggregate demand rather than structural unemployment - I believe monetary policy needs to be more stimulative if we hope to meet both elements of the dual mandate in a reasonable time frame. And should some of the downside risks that I have emphasized materialize, such as a significant disruption from abroad, more aggressive actions would certainly be warranted.\nI thank you again for inviting me to discuss the economy, and policy, with you.",

            "content": "Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's 2012 Financial Markets Conference (\"Financial Reform: The Devil's in the Details\")\nI want to thank President Dennis Lockhart and the staff at the Atlanta Fed for putting together a very topical and engaging conference, and for inviting me to take part on this panel. A session on money market mutual funds is particularly relevant, given the changes enacted in 2010 and the additional proposals that the SEC has been developing.\nOf course, I want to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nThe focus of my remarks today will be financial stability. Both the financial crisis in 2008 and the more recent sovereign debt problems in Europe underscored the significance of money market fund flows to short-term credit markets, and the potential for disruptions in those flows and markets to create broader economic difficulties. I will leave it to other panelists to focus on the impact of recently implemented and proposed regulations on individual funds or suppliers of short-term funds. Instead I will look at potential reforms in the context of whether they promote financial stability.\nMoney market funds serve as important intermediaries between investors who want low-risk, highly liquid investments, and banks and corporations that have short-term borrowing needs. Money market funds are a key buyer of the short-term debt instruments issued by banks and corporations - commercial paper, bank certificates of deposit, and repurchase agreements.\nGiven the importance of short-term credit markets to both investors and businesses, any disruptions to those credit markets represent a potential financial stability issue of both domestic and global significance. I would add that in discussions about ways that financial problems could, potentially, be amplified into a financial crisis, I hear money market funds often brought up.\nMy comments today are going to focus on prime money market funds, as opposed to government funds or tax-free funds. Prime funds hold a mix of short-term debt instruments including commercial paper and large certificates of deposit, as well as Treasury and agency securities.[1] Prime funds played a critical role in the amplification of financial problems in recent years.\nTo summarize, my key points today will be the following:\nSome prime funds have taken on significant credit risk – at times incurring losses that necessitated the support of the parent or sponsor[2] of the fund, and in one case substantial government support.\nIn my view the assumption of significant credit risk is not appropriate for intermediaries that have no capital and implicitly promise a fixed net asset value (NAV).[3]\nWithout additional reforms, this structural problem could trigger or amplify future financial stability problems. Issues of potential financial instability were not fully resolved by the 2010 reforms, although those reforms were important steps forward.\nFragilities related to money market funds could be significantly mitigated by proposed SEC reforms and, potentially, by monitoring and reducing the credit risk taken by prime funds.\nPrime Money Market Funds and Credit Risk\nThe amount of credit risk taken by some money market funds was highlighted during the financial crisis by the loss associated with the $785 million of Lehman securities held by the Reserve Primary Fund. The loss led to the Reserve Primary Fund \"breaking the buck,\" and this violation of the \"as good as bank deposits\" implicit promise led in turn to a run on many other prime money market funds as investors became concerned that other funds would not be able to maintain a fixed net asset value. Ultimately, the crisis prompted the U.S. Treasury to provide emergency insurance, and the Federal Reserve to provide emergency liquidity.[4]\nIt is very important to note that credit losses at prime money market funds have not been limited to those of the Reserve Primary Fund, or related only to the failure of Lehman Brothers. Figure 1 provides examples of other securities that were held by money market funds when their issuers defaulted over the 2007 to 2008 time frame.\nAs Chairman Schapiro of the SEC has recently noted, the \"SEC staff provided no-action assurances that allowed more than 100 money market funds to enter into capital support agreements with their [sponsors] in 2007-2008.\" [5] In addition to many sponsor guarantees, no less than 47 distinct funds received direct support via a cash contribution or an outright purchase of distressed securities at above-market prices - and some funds received direct support more than once. Based on our review of SEC no-action letters and publicly available financial statements, direct support during the time period from 2007 to 2010[6] was at least $3.2 billion.\nFigure 2 provides data on sponsor support. There are a number of cases between 2007 and 2010 where identified sponsor support exceeded one percent of assets under management (nine in total - four cases between 1 and 2 percent of assets under management, two cases between 2 and 3 percent, and three cases over 3 percent).[7] In fact, in one instance the dollar amount of support exceeded the amount of the Reserve Primary Fund's Lehman exposure.\nThese data highlight that a number of money market funds were taking credit risk that was significant given their mandate and structural limitations, but unlike the Reserve Primary Fund they had a sponsor that was willing and able to provide support.[8] In the absence of the support of sponsors, many of these money market funds would have been unable to maintain the fixed NAV.\nGoing forward, one cannot necessarily assume that sponsors will choose to provide financial support; and also, to the extent that the sponsor is a regulated financial institution that requires regulatory approval to provide support, approval of such support is not guaranteed. I would suggest that the ability to assume excessive credit risk under these conditions reflects a potential flaw in the design of money market funds that still needs to be addressed.\nThe credit risk taken by some money market funds is still significant, even after the financial problems experienced from 2007 to 2010 and the recent SEC reforms. As recently as the fall of 2011, a sponsor provided support to a fund as a result of its holding of downgraded Eksportfinans paper.\nOne of the challenges in addressing the credit risk of money market funds is that Tier 1 securities that are supposed to reflect relatively low credit risk to money market funds in reality encompass a broad range of credit quality, including some securities with significant credit risk. This is shown in Figure 3, which examines the credit risk of prime funds - classifying their holdings by the credit default swap (CDS) spread of the issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider of the holdings. A CDS provides insurance against default risk, and the CDS spread is a measure of how costly it would be to get insurance against possible default of a security.\nAs a benchmark, the current five-year CDS spread for U.S. government securities is approximately 30 basis points. As the figure shows, as of September 30 of last year 23 percent of the prime holdings had an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS quote of between 200 and 300 basis points. Note that the issuers, sponsors, or liquidity providers of 4.5 percent of the holdings had CDS quotes in excess of 400 basis points.[9] This highlights that credit markets are assigning a significant chance that some money market fund investments that current regulation deem permissible could in fact default. And, obviously, that the credit risk embedded in many prime money market mutual funds is substantially greater than the credit risk in U.S. government-only funds.\nThe 2008 run on money market funds that began with problems at a single fund (the Reserve Primary Fund) highlights the importance of understanding the credit risk of individual funds, not just the average credit risk of the industry. An individual fund that does not have a sponsor that is willing or able to provide support if the fund experiences a credit loss can cause a significant run for the whole industry.\nFigure 4 contrasts the credit risk exposure of two money market funds at a point in time in the fall of last year. It provides an indication of the within-industry variation in credit risk. Each of these funds held some high-risk securities - although Fund 1 more so than Fund 2 - illustrating the problem of holdings that bear more than the \"minimal credit risk\" required by the SEC's rule 2a-7.[10] At that point in time last year, Fund 1 had 23 percent of its assets in securities that had a credit default swap spread over 400, which for context is more than 10 times the current rate for U.S. government securities.[11]\nSuch within-industry variation matters because the average exposure of money market funds could look just fine, but if a highly exposed fund suffered a substantial credit loss it could potentially trigger a run like the one experienced in 2008.\nA significant source of the credit risk in many prime money market funds over the past year has been the large exposure to European banks. Figure 5 shows the exposure of the industry to financial institutions in France, Italy, and Spain. While these exposures were substantially reduced as the risks became more apparent, I have to question whether investors in money market funds would have been willing to directly hold such large exposures in foreign financial institutions, and whether such investments were consistent with the perceptions of very low credit risk that many investors expect to be associated with prime money market funds.[12]\nFigure 6 shows that while the exposure to Europe declined significantly through December 2011, 36 percent of prime money market fund assets[13] remain in Europe (granted, generally in the stronger countries). So, when considering the so-called \"tail\" risk from unexpected problems in Europe, money market funds remain an important potential transmission channel to the United States.\nA good example of this potential risk is the exposure that many money market funds had to Dexia, a bank that required the support of the French and Belgian governments in the fall of 2011. Figure 7 shows that in the spring of 2011, over 60 funds had exposure to Dexia.[14] As the five-year credit default swap spread for Dexia rose, most money market funds substantially reduced their holdings. However, given the very high CDS spreads on Dexia, the extent to which money funds were willing to hold it at all is striking.\nDespite the experience of the Reserve Primary Fund during 2008, a number of money market funds held securities that posed significant credit risk during the 2011 period of European problems. While there were significant outflows,[15] no losses or runs occurred - but in my view this should provide us little solace. We should care not only about the realized losses, but also about the potential losses associated with risk exposures. From a public policy perspective, we should in short care that significant risks were taken even though the potential bad outcome did not occur.\nThe willingness of multiple money market funds to take excessive credit risk even after the 2010 reforms suggests that money market funds, absent some changes, still pose some risks to financial stability. Simply put, my view is that taking large credit risks is incompatible with being an intermediary that has no capital and implicitly promises a fixed net asset value.\nPotential Additional Actions\nWhile the 2010 reforms improved the liquidity and credit risk of money market funds, I believe the data I have presented today suggest that more substantial initiatives are needed to reduce the risks to financial stability.\nOne possible way to mitigate the risks is to no longer transact at a fixed net asset value. This has several possible benefits, but also potential drawbacks.\nAs with other mutual funds, a floating NAV would highlight that the underlying asset values do fluctuate, and that the investor is taking some risk. By observing movements in the NAV, investors would have regular reminders that investments in money market funds are not riskless, and that absent sponsor or government support the fund cannot guarantee that it will always be able to return an investor's money dollar for dollar.\nFurthermore, a money market fund that takes credit risk simply cannot guarantee that it will on its own pay a fixed net asset value. Should a large credit loss occur, the fixed net asset value will not be able to be maintained unless the sponsor is willing and able to provide financial support.\nStill, there are two potential negatives to a floating rate NAV. First, it transforms the product from a near-substitute for bank deposits into an asset with a fluctuating price. Those fluctuations in price, and the taxable gains or losses that result, would make money market funds less attractive as a transaction account for many investors - in part due to the taxable gains or losses. Second, it only partially prevents runs, because as soon as investors become concerned about credit losses, there is a strong incentive to get out of the fund early. The first investor to leave the fund (to redeem) avoids the large drops in valuation and loss of liquidity that typically accompany a run.\nWhile the incentive to run is not eliminated by a floating NAV, it is certainly less than for a fund with a fixed NAV that risks \"breaking the buck.\" [16] Interestingly, floating NAV funds are used in Europe.\nIn sum, a move to a floating NAV would more accurately reflect the fundamental nature of the product actually offered, rather than making implicit promises to investors that cannot always be kept during stressful times.\nAnother alternative would be to require money market funds to hold capital, and to impose a cost on redemptions. An appropriate redemption policy could substantially reduce the incentives to run. With appropriately calibrated capital and redemption policies, the incentive to run (and thus the inability to fully pay investors) would be greatly reduced.\nTo digress for a moment, it is important to distinguish between solvency issues and liquidity problems. Slowing down redemptions would assist in situations where there is underlying value but a drying up of liquidity may lead to losses from \"fire sale\" prices.\nThese remedies also raise potential concerns and have costs. In general any reforms that, in the language of economists, would \"internalize the costs\" associated with systemic risk would to some degree make money market funds less attractive for investors.\nRaising capital in a low interest rate environment would be challenging and, depending on how it is raised, would impact returns to sponsors or investors. A change in redemption practices would pose a potential risk to investors that would make the money market fund less attractive relative to other products. But despite these concerns, appropriately calibrated capital and redemption policies would reduce the risk that investors would not be able to get full value on their redemptions or that runs would occur.\nBeyond the two alternatives I have discussed, there may be additional ways to address these issues. There may be opportunities for SEC policymaking and monitoring to inhibit funds from taking on excessive credit risk. As I have shown today, the extent of credit risk taken by some money market funds is shown by the number of times sponsors have needed to provide support and by the makeup of underlying assets in certain funds. The SEC limitations placed on credit risk are currently too broad to avoid significant credit risk exposure and there may be ways to use market information[17] to determine if assets in the funds are inconsistent with the intent to limit significant credit risk exposures at money market funds.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I believe the approaches I have mentioned today could significantly mitigate financial stability concerns around money market funds. Of course, none of the proposals eliminate the risk entirely, and none are costless. Neither are they mutually exclusive - elements could be adopted in some combination.\nEveryone knows the SEC is working very hard on this, and could have a proposal for reforms out in the coming months. I strongly commend their efforts to arrive at reforms that reduce the risks surrounding money market funds.\nThe bottom line, in my view, is that the status quo is not acceptable. As I have shown today, a number of money market funds took significant credit risk that ultimately led to them needing sponsor support in the period from 2007 to 2010. Substantial government support was required after the Reserve Primary Fund experienced losses. Moreover, a significant number of money market funds continued to take substantial credit risk during the recent European financial problems. So, I must conclude that reforms enacted to date do not seem to sufficiently limit money market funds' ability to assume excessive credit risks.\nA money market fund with a fixed net asset value set by an intermediary with no capital that takes on credit risk will, eventually, result in the failure to meet obligations in the absence of outside support by either a sponsor or government. Funds need to be structured so that neither sponsor support nor government support is likely or necessary, even during times of stress.\nI realize the industry is opposed to measures that would decrease the attractiveness of funds but in the end a stronger industry could result, beyond the financial stability improvements that are my main focus. But all in all I believe the risks to the stability of the financial system that underpins the economy are too great not to take the actions that will make the industry, and our financial system, more stable.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.",

            "content": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research London, England\nGood evening. I would like to thank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research for hosting this event. Given the economic and financial shocks that have buffeted the global economy in recent years, I think it is particularly important to share perspectives across the Atlantic - on the economic outlook, but also on the risks to both the outlook and financial stability.\nI am honored to be sharing the stage with Adam Posen. I have long admired Adam's academic work and policy perspectives, and I am looking forward to discussions with Adam and his colleagues at the Bank of England over the next several days.\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nToday I would like to begin with a discussion of emerging economic trends in the United States, and then move into a discussion about opportunities to bolster stability in our financial infrastructure. My theme throughout is the need to avoid complacency.\nRecently released statistics are consistent with improved financial market conditions and continued - albeit painfully slow - progress in labor markets. At the same time, the spending data have been very weak. How should we reconcile these differences?\nFocusing only on financial and labor market conditions, one might conclude that the recovery is undeniably gaining traction - and that spending will improve as higher personal income and wealth contribute to a reinforcing cycle that propels us toward full employment in the U.S. Alternatively, focusing only on the weak spending data might lead one to conclude that the improvements in labor markets and financial conditions are going to prove temporary, because the recent improvements are probably unsustainable if the U.S. economy continues to grow at only a 2 percent rate.\nIt may take several quarters before we know which of these two perspectives is actually better reflective of the U.S. economy today.\nBeyond discussing the economic outlook in the United States, I would like to make a few observations on financial markets. I'll state my firm view that the actions taken by central banks around the world - for example, engaging in foreign exchange swap line agreements and using less traditional monetary policy tools - have been both appropriate and necessary.\nHowever, many of these actions were ultimately necessary because supervisory and regulatory frameworks were not sufficiently macro-prudential. By macro-prudential I am referring to a focus on risks, vulnerabilities, or dependencies that potentially could affect the financial system as a whole - versus just the safety and soundness of individual institutions. Ideally, central banks should not need to take actions to support continued financial intermediation, because financial institutions should be sufficiently resilient to ensure that even unusual financial-market stress would not impair effective intermediation. Recent events have highlighted that we remain far from achieving that goal.\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nWith that preview, let me begin with some thoughts on the U.S. economic outlook.\nThere have been positive trends in some recent economic data. U.S. financial market conditions are clearly improving. Some of the recent improvements reflect the moderation or removal of some significant, imminent, downside \"tail\" risks. At least for now, Europe seems to have avoided the risk of a so-called \"Lehman moment\" - a risk that had seriously concerned investors.\nThe S,P 500 has risen roughly 9 percent since the beginning of the year, as shown in Figure 1. Risk gauges, such as spreads on bonds and credit default swaps (CDSs), have improved. Bond issuance has been strong. U.S. financial markets have gathered steam and reflect increased optimism about likely economic outcomes.\nHowever, my enthusiasm is tempered by the challenges still facing Europe.\nForward-looking financial markets seem to be pricing in improved economic outcomes, and there are some brightening signs, to be sure. Figure 1 shows that auto sales in the United States have rebounded nicely, and consumer sentiment has improved significantly since last August. In addition, payroll employment in the U.S. has been growing at a rate of 245,000 jobs a month over the past three months. This should mean more disposable income, which coupled with increasing household wealth (fueled by stock market gains), should be consistent with an improved outlook for spending.\nHowever, when we focus solely on the incoming spending data, the outlook appears less robust. Since the start of the recovery, what we call real final sales - that is, domestically produced goods and services (net of inventories, which can swing significantly from quarter to quarter) - have been growing at only 1.7 percent, as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, my forecast for the first quarter of this year would be for real final sales to grow at roughly 2 percent, only slightly better than the average during the U.S. recovery to date.\nFigure 3 highlights two distinctive features of this recovery - unusually weak residential investment, despite very low interest rates; and an extended decline in state and local government spending.\nThe health of the U.S. housing market has been hampered by significant declines in housing prices, very elevated foreclosures, and a large inventory of vacant homes. As a result, residential investment - which normally grows quite rapidly during a recovery - has not provided its customary overall boost to the economic recovery. While some tentative signs of an improving housing sector have emerged, for the reasons I just mentioned it is likely to be subdued relative to historical experience.\nAlso, state and local government spending has been unusually weak during this recovery. The severity of the recession, combined with the fall in home values that are the basis for many local government tax revenues, have forced substantial cuts in state and local spending. It is worth noting that in the U.S., state and local government spending accounts for a larger share of GDP than does federal government spending: 11.7 percent of GDP, compared to 8.0 percent for federal spending.\nState and local budgets will remain under stress as governments face increasing demands on their resources, such as addressing significant shortfalls in certain areas (for example employee pensions). At the same time, federal government spending is expected to be cut significantly, making government spending as a component of GDP a challenging aspect of the economic outlook in the United States.\nSo, despite some good production data and the optimism seen in financial markets, the spending data are consistent with real U.S. GDP growth over the course of 2012 of only 2.5 percent - which unfortunately is only fast enough to make modest headway at reducing the unemployment in our labor market.\nGiven the very modest recovery to date, it is surprising that the unemployment rate, depicted in the recent downward trend in the line in Figure 4, has shown as much improvement as it has. The current unemployment rate of 8.3 percent represents a decline from 9.1 percent over the past six months, despite only modest growth in spending.\nHowever, while the unemployment rate has declined, there has not been much improvement in the important ratio of employment to population, shown in Figure 5.\nOf course aggregate employment-to-population ratios are impacted by demographic changes - for example the aging of the \"baby boom\" generation in the U.S. To explore the role that recent demographic changes might have played on the movement of the employment-to-population series, Figure 6 shows the same concept for particular age cohorts that are less likely to be impacted by demographics over the short term. The employment-to-population ratio in age groups where the attachment to working should not have changed shows a pattern very similar to that of the ratio as a whole.\nSo part of the decline in the unemployment rate is resulting from workers leaving the labor force. Furthermore, only in recent months has the employment-to-population ratio improved and the payroll employment growth clearly exceeded the normal growth rate of the labor force. So the U.S. remains well below the employment levels that would be viewed as consistent with the maximum sustainable employment aspect of the Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate.\nThe other element of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate is inflation. Figure 7 charts two primary measures of inflation - total personal consumption expenditure inflation, and core personal consumption expenditure inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy categories). Core PCE inflation - again excluding food and energy - has remained below the Federal Reserve target of 2 percent throughout the recovery. Total PCE inflation, including food and energy, is slightly above 2 percent, but has diverged from core prices when commodity prices such as oil have spiked up or declined substantially. As the figure shows, however, the more volatile total measure tends over time to revert to the level of core inflation.\nWith the recent spike in oil prices, it is likely that total PCE inflation will rise further, but this increase is likely to be temporary, reflecting volatile oil price movements. For 2013 my own forecast is for both total PCE and core PCE inflation to be below 2 percent, although this forecast assumes that Middle East tensions do not result in another sharp spike in oil prices.\nAnother potential inflationary concern has been raised by the swelling of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet that occurred as we purchased assets to advance monetary policy goals. But Figure 8 shows that commercial real estate lending is still declining - and while commercial and industrial lending has increased, it has yet to return to its level at the beginning of the recession. What this means it that by and large, the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet has not turned into a significant increase in the supply of money, because banks have not been lending out their holdings of excess reserves. So the expansion of reserves that occurred in 2008 as the Fed expanded its balance sheet has not been inflationary, given the subdued bank lending environment.\nIndeed, bank lending has been quite modest despite a relatively rapid improvement in bank capital ratios in the United States. This should give some European analysts pause, as the experience in the U.S. (as well as the earlier Japanese experience) suggests that the constraints on bank lending due to the recent financial problems in Europe may be more long-lasting than some are expecting.\nIn summary, while recent financial-market and labor-market data in the U.S. have been encouraging, spending data remain disappointing. Like many forecasters, I expect higher real GDP growth as the year progresses. But I would caution that I and many others held a similar view at the beginning of 2010 and 2011.\nIf real GDP does not grow more rapidly and unemployment remains at its current unacceptably high level, monetary policy may need to be more accommodative. The U.S. unemployment rate remains well above a level that could be considered full employment, while we are likely to undershoot our inflation targets. Together these factors provide room for flexibility in the response of monetary policy as we receive additional information on current economic conditions.\nChallenges in Bank Funding\nDespite the improvements we are seeing in the U.S. economy, a number of significant risks and challenges remain. One involves geo-political risks, which have already caused oil prices to rise more than most non-energy commodity prices. Any further significant increase in energy prices would be an additional impediment to faster growth. Another involves the unsustainable budget deficits that many countries, including the United States, currently have. The challenge, I believe, is that greater fiscal responsibility must be implemented in a way that does not threaten tentative economic recoveries. A third risk is the continued fragility in our financial infrastructure - a situation that can substantially amplify other economic problems. It is this third risk that I would like to touch upon today.\nThe economic slowdown that began in the United States several years ago went from being a mild event led by housing-related problems to being a much more severe and long-lasting economic downturn. This was, in part, because of the architecture of the financial sector.[1] Today I would like to highlight one particular potential structural flaw in the financial architecture - the dependence on short-term funding.\nThis past financial crisis was a primer on vulnerabilities to short-term funding. Specifically, wholesale funding utilized by large global banks dried up during the financial crisis. As large banks sought to reduce their exposure to counterparties of concern, the term of loans made in the marketplace decreased, and the cost of short-term credit spiked.\nAnd many of the problems were occurring outside of traditional depository institutions. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were investment banks, not commercial banks. As counterparties dramatically reduced both unsecured and secured lending to these two entities, funding was no longer available and the firms failed.\nSimilarly, money market mutual funds with exposures to investment banks in many cases required support from parent or sponsoring entities. And one fund without parental support - the Reserve Primary Fund - sustained a credit loss that would ultimately lead to its liquidation. This led to a run on prime funds, which in turn further impaired short-term credit markets.\nAs Figure 9 shows, the money market mutual fund industry held $3.5 trillion in assets under management in mid September 2008. Prime funds, which hold a mix of Treasury and agency securities and other short-term debt instruments (including commercial paper and large certificates of deposit), held nearly 60 percent of industry assets, or $2.1 trillion.\nWhen the Reserve Primary Fund \"broke the buck,\" outflows from prime funds totaled roughly $500 billion over a four-week period. Although much of the outflow went into government money market mutual funds (which hold only Treasury and agency securities, and repurchase agreements backed by such securities), these inflows did little to ease the strains being felt in the corporate funding markets resulting from the exit from prime funds.[2]\nU.S. money market funds are thought of and marketed as highly liquid, low-risk investments with many of the same characteristics as traditional bank deposits. As a result, money market fund investors and money market fund managers should be highly sensitive to changes in underlying risks. The crisis in autumn of 2008 taught us that safeguarding against runs on financial entities like money market funds - entities that do not have a large, stable, core deposit base and do not have ordinary access to the central bank's \"lender of last resort\" function - was and is important, unfinished work if we are to have a more stable financial system.\nA number of significant reforms are being contemplated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reduce the risks surrounding money market funds. But even with significant reforms such as these - reforms, by the way, that I am highly supportive of and will say more about at a conference in Atlanta in two weeks - money market funds will continue to be a potentially unstable source of U.S. dollar funding. From a financial stability perspective, we need to recognize the possibility of a deterioration in the ability or willingness of the money market funds to keep providing a dependable source of funds to counterparties (for example, the issuers of commercial paper that the funds purchase). This could occur as a result of a change in the risk profile of those counterparties.\nWholesale funding issues also played an important role in recent European banking problems. Some European banks were too dependent on wholesale funding, particularly funding coming from U.S. money market funds.\nFigure 10 shows the European exposure of U.S. prime money market funds over the past year. Given the changes in the risk profile of some banks, as a result of increases in sovereign debt risk, money market funds have sought to reduce what was their large risk exposure to European financial institutions. Most money market funds in the beginning of 2011 had already dramatically reduced exposure to peripheral financial institutions. Over the second half of last year there was a very significant decline in exposure to euro-zone financial institutions. (In addition, remaining exposure was shortened in tenor, meaning time to maturity). Figure 10 highlights the declines across Europe and Figure 11 shows the decline over the course of 2011 more specifically by certain countries.\nBecause U.S. money market funds had been a significant source of short-term funds for European institutions, money funds' move away from short-term European debt resulted in a significant shortage of dollar funds available to these institutions. I will show you some market indicators of these shortages in a moment.\nNo money market fund encountered a problem meeting investor redemptions during the European sovereign debt crisis.[3] But even without such a problem, money market funds still had an impact on the availability of credit to financial institutions for which the perception of risk had changed.\nProblems with financial stability do not require a failure to create a significant disruption in the flow of credit. In light of the incentives facing money market funds, financial institutions that rely heavily on them for funding put themselves in a position where a short-term change in perceived risk can create significant funding problems. And as we have seen repeatedly over the past several years, funding problems at one institution can quickly spread to the financial system as a whole.\nFigure 12 highlights that funding challenges for European banks were developing as money market funds reduced their European exposures. The rise in the LIBOR to OIS spread.[4] indicates that financial institutions became more concerned about lending to each other as money market funding declined. Similarly, the sharp rise in the rates on the 3-month euro-dollar foreign exchange swap indicates the pressure exerted by reduced dollar funding from the money market funds on European financial institutions' funding.\nIn short, the rational reaction of money market funds to perceived changes in risk - reducing European exposure - led to various funding pressures. The issues eventually were addressed by central bank actions that significantly expanded liquidity, both through foreign exchange swaps and through European Central Bank (ECB) term lending to European institutions. While these actions have been very important for stabilizing financial markets, I believe we need to get to the point of having a more resilient financial infrastructure that does not require central bank interventions during times of stress.\nFor financial institutions and supervisors this implies thinking more carefully about stress scenarios, and specifically about whether critical funding will evaporate when it is needed most. While Basel Capital Accord proposals will help in this respect, I would strongly suggest that stress-testing scenarios assess how well risk-sensitive sources of short-term funding will hold up in an environment of heightened risk. This liquidity-focused assessment would be an important complement to current stress testing, and a prudent aspect of risk management.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would re-emphasize that financial-market and economic conditions have been improving since the start of the year. Central banks have played an important role in encouraging more economic growth. In the United States, accommodative monetary policy has been essential to improving financial conditions, but growth remains disappointingly slow to date, and significant downside risks remain. Should growth slow down more than is expected, more policy accommodation could be advisable.\nEven if growth should improve more than expected in the U.S., the country will likely remain far from what anyone would consider full employment - so in my view policy accommodation should only be removed once it is clear that the Fed's dual mandate can be achieved within a reasonable period of time.\nAs with monetary policy, work remains to be done to improve financial stability. Today I have highlighted one area that deserves more attention - ensuring that we reduce the risk of disruptions to credit flows that result from wholesale short-term funding problems, and that require central bank intervention.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.",

            "content": "Connecticut Business, Industry Association and MetroHartford Alliance Economic Summit, Outlook 2012\nI appreciate the invitation to speak today at the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. It strikes me that the timing of this gathering is particularly appropriate, in that discussions of the economy - at least over the last few years - have not fueled any holiday cheer, but have been relevant to hopeful New Year's resolutions.\nWhen I joined you at this event two years ago, I reviewed some of the patterns we see in labor markets, and in particular industries, during early stages of recoveries. I noted the forces making it likely that gains in employment would be slow in this recovery. I wish I could say I was too pessimistic that day, but as we all know the recovery has been painfully slow.\nToday, after a brief overview of some recent economic trends I would like to focus on some key financial data. In particular, I want to highlight a distinctive feature of the recent recession and the anemic recovery - the fact that financial-market problems had a disproportionate effect on the length and severity of the recession and have been a complicating factor in the lack of strength in the recovery.\nI would like to walk you through a number of charts that lay out the situation - particularly as it relates to small business financing. My \"punch line\" is that as challenging as the financial headwinds to recovery have been, there are still policy options to consider and explore that could make a difference, and I will mention a few possibilities.\nOf course I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nFirst, I'll touch on the economic trends. I would say the economic data have been improving somewhat, relative to what we were seeing in the summer. Various supply shocks that buffeted the world economy in the first half of 2011 are receding, as are the increases in a variety of commodity prices. In part, these reversals reflect expected economic weakness in other parts of the world.\nAs Figure 1 shows, a number of prices that were increasing in the first half of 2011 (in blue) have moderated more recently (in red) - particularly energy prices and others closely tied to energy, like airline fares, and also food and beverage prices. In addition to these data, I see no evidence of significant acceleration in labor costs - as a result of weakness in labor markets - and also see reversals in a number of important commodity price increases. As a result, I personally expect that inflation is likely to be below 2 percent not only in 2012 but also over the next several years.\nWhile the difficult conditions in labor markets are a reason inflation has been well contained, the very weak job growth the country has experienced is of course itself a critical problem. Figure 2 highlights the fact that many people are working part-time but would prefer to work full time. The percent rose quickly during the recession (the shaded portion of the chart) and has stayed high. While these workers are currently employed, this chart suggests that demand in the economy is not sufficiently strong for firms to employ more workers full time. Labor demand simply remains too weak.\nWith inflation expected to remain below 2 percent, and unemployment and underemployment so high, I believe it is important for the Federal Reserve to continue considering ways to promote stronger growth and hasten what is a painfully long, slow recovery and adjustment time in the economy.\nAs a case in point, Figure 3 shows that households are now spending a lower percentage of their disposable income on debt-service payments, compared to just before the onset of the recession when the ratio peaked at about 14 percent. While some of this decline reflects unfortunate trends, such as defaults on mortgages, it also reflects the very low interest-rate environment - which gives households an opportunity to improve their relative financial condition[1] (the net of their assets and liabilities) as less money is spent on interest payments for mortgages and credit cards.\nAs an aside, I have emphasized in other talks that I think more can be done to facilitate this process of adjustment - including tweaks to Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) mortgage programs and, potentially, expanding the purchase of mortgages by the Federal Reserve to keep mortgage rates low during a time of great difficulty in housing markets.\nIn sum, I would say that the monetary policy actions already taken by the Federal Reserve are allowing firms and households to speed up the adjustment process, and as such are laying the foundation for a stronger economy.\nEmployment Patterns\nNow I'd like to share some additional perspectives, informed by data. Figure 4 shows the path of employment from its peak prior to the last four recessions. You see that in the most recent recession and recovery, the decline from peak employment was more severe and more lasting than in the previous three. Although we have experienced some modest improvement in employment recently, we are nowhere near a return to the peak level of employment, which had occurred in the prior three recoveries by this point in time. The current recovery's slow employment growth is, it goes without saying, worth examining in more detail.\nFigure 5 shows the net change in private sector employment, in thousands of jobs, taking into account the size of the firm where the job gains or losses occurred. A close look makes apparent that there are some significant differences over time. In the 2001 recession the biggest employment declines were at the largest firms (shown in the green sections of each bar). During the recovery from the 2001 recession, firms with less than 50 employees bounced back relatively quickly (the blue sections of each bar). But the 2001 experience contrasts sharply with the recent recession, when the net decline was much more severe across all three firm-size categories.\nParticularly striking, however, is how much of a decline occurred for the smallest firms employing less than 50 employees. Not only was the recession particularly severe for small-firm employment, but employment growth during the recovery been slow at small firms.\nIn short, the experience of small firms is an important factor in the decline in overall employment during the most recent recession - and in the tepid employment growth in the recovery.\nFigure 6 highlights that in any dynamic recovery an economy experiences large flows of job gains and losses - but in this recovery the smallest and largest firms (on the extreme left and right of the chart) account for the most significant net job decline. The only significant net gain (those slivers of green above the zero bound) is found in the mid-sized firm categories - those with more than 50 but less than 1,000 employees.\nThis pattern is quite different from the recovery that occurred after the 2001 recession, as shown in Figure 7 (the red bars). During that recovery, small firms (on the left side of the chart) were an important source of net job gains, while larger firms (in the center and to the right) continued to be major sources of net job losses - consistent with the overall slow improvement in employment during that recovery. In contrast, during this recovery (the blue bars) the smallest firms have produced net job losses. The largest firms have also accounted for job losses, but to a lesser degree compared to the prior recovery.\nOne of the distinctive features of this recession has been the substantial decline in household net worth, particularly resulting from the decline in real estate values. During recessions that include sizable job losses, some people use difficult labor markets as their impetus to start a small business. Such efforts have often been financed through home equity loans, which tend to be the lowest-cost type of financing available, especially compared to the much more expensive use of credit cards.\nHowever, the ability to start a small business in this way has been severely hampered by the decline in house values and the tightening of credit standards. These factors have made the traditional sources of entrepreneurial financing much less readily available.\nIn addition, some of the states that saw the most dramatic declines in real estate values have also seen particularly high unemployment rates. As Figure 8 shows, the so-called \"sand states\" such as California, Nevada, and Florida have unemployment rates much higher than the U.S. average, and have also experienced sharp declines in residential real estate values - declines much larger than the U.S. average. As a result, unemployed workers in these states are unlikely to have home equity available for financing a startup small business that could provide alternate employment.\nIn sum, these data suggest a very concerning dynamic. My sense is that in areas where high levels of unemployment might otherwise lead individuals to use home-equity financing or credit cards to start a business, today many find access to such forms of credit impeded by impaired credit scores and the disappearance of home equity, given depressed home values.\nPatterns in Bank Financing\nFigure 9 shows how the composition of business loans (at commercial and savings banks) has changed over the past decade. There has been a significant increase in large commercial real estate loans, while small commercial and industrial (C,I) loans and small commercial real estate loans are now accounting for a lower share of the total. Relative to ten years ago, small-business loans account for a smaller percentage of overall business loans.\nOver the past year we have seen only moderate growth in gross domestic product (GDP), and some hiring from the larger mid-sized firms. Figure 10 shows that lending data are consistent with this pattern. Large C,I loans have recently been increasing, and large commercial real estate loans have remained relatively flat, but small C,I and small commercial real estate loans have declined.\nTo me, the pattern is even more striking when you break up the composition of loans by the size of the bank, as shown in Figure 11. While small-business lending (in blue) has decreased across all bank sizes, the decline has been particularly striking at the larger banks, shown on the left, where you see a substantial decline in small business loans. Banks of all sizes have increased their lending for large business loans (in red), with the biggest percentage increase occurring at the smallest banks. In part this reflects the fact that many of the smaller banks remain very well capitalized, and some mid-sized firms have decided to shift their banking relationships from large banks to more community-based banks (as more community-based banks compete for that business).\nFigure 12 shows the creation of new establishments. Given what I have described so far, it is unfortunate but not surprising that the \"birth rate\" of new establishments declined sharply and remains below historical levels. Starting businesses with financing from home equity or credit cards has become more difficult, and getting small business loans without some form of collateral remains quite challenging. While demand for small business credit from qualified seekers surely plays a role, my sense is that at least one reason for slow job creation in this tepid recovery may be that obtaining financing for new firms has become more difficult. And this suggests one reason why recoveries after financial crises are particularly slow.\nImpact on the Outlook and Policymaking\nRecently the economic data has been somewhat more positive concerning the fourth quarter, but most forecasters do not, unfortunately, expect that momentum to carry through 2012. Most forecasters expect that economic growth in 2012 will be between 2 to 3 percent, with the outlook gradually improving over the course of the year. Unfortunately, my own forecast is quite similar, which is consistent with only a very gradual improvement in labor markets.\nAllow me to briefly summarize my thinking.\nRecessions accompanied by significant financial problems tend to be more severe downturns, followed by relatively slow recoveries. One reason for a slow recovery is that the financial condition of households and firms - their \"balance sheets,\" given their liabilities and assets - take time to recover, and credit for borrowers with financial impairments becomes more difficult to obtain. This is currently reflected in both lingering problems with residential real estate and with the difficulties related to small business creation that I've described today.\nLet me touch briefly on residential real estate. It continues to be impacted by high foreclosures, falling housing prices in some areas, and tightened credit standards. I have noted in prior talks that residential real estate tends to grow rapidly in the early stages of a recovery, but not this time. Policymakers have pursued a variety of fiscal and monetary approaches to help with a housing recovery, and there have been recent suggestions around what more can be done.[2]\nIn terms of monetary policy, actions the Fed has taken to reduce long-term interest rates are supportive of housing, and the Fed's purchases of mortgage-backed securities provided an even more targeted approach to stimulating housing. Further purchases of mortgage-backed securities would in my view help provide a more rapid recovery in housing, by reducing the costs of refinancing or purchasing new homes. Of course, these Fed actions would be even more effective if accompanied by fiscal policies designed to speed the recovery in housing.\nAs I have highlighted today, some of the slow employment growth we see is associated with a less robust small business sector. The charts I shared show that loan originations to small businesses have been quite weak, and that smaller firms have not pushed the improvement in employment that we saw after the last recession. (I would note that these points are amplified and more formally addressed in a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston working paper by Duygan-Bump, Levkov, and Montoriol-Garriga.[3]).\nThis is a very serious challenge to the recovery and to the economy. As such, policymakers must in my opinion explore all possible remedies, and weigh the costs and benefits of each.\nWhile many of the problems in this sector reflect impaired financials for many small businesses, and inadequate demand for products, I would add that credit availability for creating or expanding small businesses can be quite a challenge. Again, monetary policies that push down longer-term rates can be helpful, and that would be particularly true if there could be a targeted approach to improve small business financing. As with housing, such monetary policies would be most effective if pursued in conjunction with fiscal policies targeted to improving conditions for small business.\nActions taken to date highlight that these problems are not easy to resolve. This, to my thinking, only underlines the need to look for creative policy solutions targeted to both housing and small business.\nIn addition to these tangible problems, there remain of course significant downside risks that are likely to make households and businesses cautious. Problems with a slowing European economy, and sovereign and banking issues in Europe, remain downside risks. Excessive fiscal austerity here or abroad also has the potential for near term downside risk. Finally, recent uncertainty in the Middle East highlights the ever-present risk of potential oil shocks. Of course monetary policy has no direct influence on any of these risks. But they highlight the importance of finding ways to hasten the pace of economic growth and job creation at this point in time.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I know I don't need to tell you that we continue to have a slow recovery. We all know, as well, that issues of some concern exist in Europe and elsewhere. I would reiterate that one reason for the tepid pace of recovery is that financial problems and restraints continue to have lingering effects on the economy.\nToday I have focused on one of those lingering problems, the impairment of household financial condition that has made new business formation particularly difficult. Given the low inflation rate and weak labor markets that are both likely to persist this year, I believe the Federal Reserve should continue to explore ways to promote more rapid recovery through stronger growth.\nThe Federal Reserve has a variety of tools to consider as we try to promote faster economic growth - including communicating in different ways the likely future path of the economy and the implications for interest-rate policy (as was mentioned in FOMC minutes released this week), and considering additional large-scale asset purchases.\nIn addition, I believe that policymakers can and should continue to look at ways to better target fiscal and monetary policy to address the housing and small business financing problems we are seeing in this recovery. I believe that the continuing difficulties compel us to think creatively and proactively about ways to return the economy to full employment. I hope today I have stimulated some thinking about the possible policy remedies.\nThank you for having me join you today, and despite these challenging economic times let me extend my best wishes for the coming year to each of you and to every New Englander.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Boston Economic Club Boston, MA\nI would like to thank Chip Case for inviting me to address the Boston Economic Club. Over the years Chip has been a visiting scholar at the Boston Fed and has provided wonderful insights into developments in real estate markets. As you all know, Chip is one of the country's leading experts on real estate - an area that has been the focus of much attention and a lot of difficulties over the last few years.\nNormally when giving a talk I try to focus on an important element of the economic outlook, or an important policy action the Federal Reserve has recently taken - and I use data to explain the issue and its relevance.\nToday, however, I am going to take a different tack. I still want to use data - never fear - but for a somewhat different reason.\nAs you know, ever since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has been lauded by some for its bold actions and criticized by others. This comes with the territory of being the nation's central bank. Certainly much of the criticism stems from an economy that is very difficult for many citizens. And importantly, some of the criticism is deserved - and we at the Fed truly try to learn when we do fall short.\nBut some of the criticism stems from what I'll call some \"common misconceptions\" or assumptions about the Fed.[1]Today I would like to offer a plainspoken defense to some of those common misconceptions. A defense rooted in facts and numbers, to be sure - my rhetorical skills may not win over Fed critics, but the facts and numbers may help them and others understand how the Fed actually operates.\nLet me acknowledge, of course, that as important and illuminating as they are, facts and data do not capture the emotion and the frustration of these challenging economic times. At the Fed we appreciate the widespread frustration stemming from the financial crisis, the recession, and the anemic recovery. But to go forward and tangibly improve things, we must use facts to guide our work, and must do a better job of sharing key facts and the data that underlie how and why the Fed takes the steps it does.\nLet me add as I always do that my comments reflect my perspectives, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Fed's Board of Governors.\nIn recent years the U.S. central bank has taken unusual steps to combat a threatening financial crisis, a severe recession, and a disappointing recovery. By no means were we perfect, but we acted in the public's interest and I'm very supportive of the strong steps taken. I would point out that the U.S. experience in the 1920s and 1930s, and Japan's experience in recent decades, show the even more dramatic economic pain that comes when central banks and national governments act less than forcefully, or declare the crisis over too soon.\nHowever, the extraordinary steps the Fed has taken over the last four years have led to some misconceptions and mistaken assumptions. Central banking and monetary policy are not easy to explain, but the Fed could have done a better job of it. But at the end of the day we've seen the creation of certain misconceptions, not supported by facts, about the U.S. central bank as an institution. The best way to address a misconception is to offer up the facts. So today I plan to address some of the misconceived assumptions about the Federal Reserve and our actions.\nIt is not surprising the Federal Reserve and other central banks have received an unusual amount of attention of late. We are experiencing historic times, and an unusual confluence of events. We experienced a global financial crisis which underlined the fact that financial markets and financial institutions have a significant impact on the real economy and all of its participants. We have seen in dramatic fashion how increased global interconnectedness, despite its benefits, allows problems to quickly move across national borders. As a case in point, witness the reactions of our own U.S. financial markets to actions occurring, or not occurring, in Greece - a country of less than 11 million people, roughly the size of Ohio - and other countries. Add to this the fact that, both here and abroad, fiscal problems have increasingly limited the response we would normally expect in a severe economic downturn and a painfully slow recovery.\nThese events, taken together, have made forecasting the future path of the economy quite challenging - and should instill humility about predicting the future, or how future shocks could impact the domestic or world economy.\nIn response to the crises, the Federal Reserve has been forceful in trying to promote growth and thus reduce the unemployment rate, while achieving core inflation rates close to 2 percent. Other central banks have too. Central banks[2] have attempted to fight the crisis and downturn by dramatically increasing their balance sheets (see Figure 1), buying non-traditional assets, and pushing short and long-term rates to new lows to try to create conditions that stimulate economic activity.\nUnfortunately, the creative and forceful response of many central banks to a bad economic situation has not often been matched by fiscal policymakers and international officials. Central banks cannot address these economic problems on their own. They can mitigate some of the problems by reducing the cost of credit to individuals and businesses. And make no mistake, while the scale of the problem is great, that should not dissuade us from actions that make even just \"a dent.\" For instance, an action that reduces the unemployment rate by half a percent does not bring us close to full employment, and does not solve the country's problems, but nonetheless would perhaps create roughly 750,000 jobs that may not have been created in the absence of the action.\nFederal Reserve actions alone cannot solve all the problems affecting the domestic and world economy. But the Fed can carefully weigh the costs and benefits of actions, and where actions can move us closer to better economic outcomes without substantial costs, it can and should take action. In fact, that's exactly what the Fed has been doing, and that is exactly what it should be doing - consistent with the dual mandate given to us by Congress, to do what we can to achieve maximum sustainable employment consistent with stable prices.\nWith that introduction, allow me now to discuss four common misconceptions about the Fed. To give you an overview, the four assumptions or misconceptions are as follows:\nThe Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight\nThe Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization\n\"Printing money\" has caused serious inflation\nRates are already low so further monetary policy actions will have no impact on the economy\nThere are of course a number of other issues we could discuss, but I think these are important and involve plenty for us to cover today.\nCommon Misconception 1:\nThe Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight\nIn recent years there have been those advocating that the Federal Reserve should be audited. They are right in that the Fed should be audited - but they are mistaken in believing that the Fed is not. In truth the Fed is a heavily audited organization subject to substantial oversight. This is entirely appropriate given the sensitivity of what central banks do, and the need to do it without reproach.\nIn truth,\nall twelve Federal Reserve Banks employ professional internal auditors;\nan outside audit firm, Deloitte & Touche, audits our financial statements;\nthe Federal Reserve's Inspector General, created by Congress, audits our activities;\nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office audits our actions, and\nCongress, which created the Federal Reserve System, provides significant oversight regarding Fed actions, as demonstrated by frequent requests to testify before committees – and by legislation over the years that has altered our role.[3]\nBut as one who loves data and facts, let me say a bit more to be quite specific on this matter.\nWe produce an annual report that includes audited financial statements and a letter from me as CEO attesting to effective internal controls, based on the work of our internal audit and risk-management teams. We include a letter from Deloitte , Touche attesting that we have maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are also audited by the Office of Inspector General, created by Congress to provide independent oversight over the Federal Reserve - with the power to do investigations, inspections, audits, and reports. The Inspector General reports to Congress semi-annually - the most recent report covers activities through March and is available on the web.[4]\nIn Figure 2, I list some of the reports by the Inspector General over the past year, all of which are available on the Board's web site. As you can see, the reports cover a wide range of topics.\nWe are also audited by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which conducts audits, investigations, inspections, and reports on behalf of Congress. These reports are publicly available on the GAO web site. Figure 3 shows some of the GAO reports done in the past year regarding a wide variety of Federal Reserve activities. As with the Inspector General reports, one GAO report covers the operations of the Fed's emergency liquidity facilities, including the one run at the Boston Fed on behalf of the System.[5]\nAnd we have direct oversight by Congress, which requests testimony on a wide range of topics.Figure 4 lists some of the recent Congressional testimony provided by the Fed's Governors, all of which are available on the Board website. For the sake of brevity this figure does not include the testimony of staff other than Governors. Naturally, Congressional hearings include extensive questioning concerning our actions and policies.\nWe are an entity created by Congress. Congress can and does change our roles and responsibilities over time. A good example is the Dodd-Frank legislation which increased our responsibilities in some areas (like savings and loan holding company supervision) and curtailed our role in others (such as lending in \"emergency and exigent\" circumstances).\nSo in sum we are a heavily audited and supervised organization.\nHowever, I suspect that some who argue for more audits of the Federal Reserve may actually be advocating for the politicization of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve was designed by Congress to be a non-partisan organization that conducts monetary policy in the public interest free of political influence. Good monetary policy in the public's long-run interest can involve unpopular decisions in the short run - such as the Volcker-era effort to rein in inflation using very high interest rates. Central banks in developed countries have become independent of legislative bodies and the chief executive precisely because monetary policy has been shown to result in better economic outcomes (e.g., growth, and price stability) when it is not influenced by partisan politics.\nI strongly believe that officials in the Federal Reserve conduct policy without regard to partisan politics, and to the best of their abilities try to administer monetary policy in the national interest. This is a hallmark of our organization and should not change.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that the Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight. The fact is that the Fed is widely audited, and is subject to robust oversight - which is as it should be.[6]\nCommon Misconception 2:\nThe Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization\nWhen I first joined the Federal Reserve 25 years ago, the lack of transparency was a very valid criticism of the Fed and most other central banks. However, the fact is that much has changed in the last 25 years - and particularly in recent years.\nLet me admit that in the midst of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 one could fairly say that we did not spend sufficient time explaining to the public the unique and extraordinary actions being taken. All I can say is that in the midst of the crisis there was a focus on solutions, and given the severity of the situation, this resulted in our spending less time communicating well about what we were doing and why. Though no excuse, reacting to a crisis in real time effectively requires something else \"give\" - and we were frankly so preoccupied with extinguishing the fire we did not explain as well as we should have what we were doing and why. At the Fed we have tried since to explain precisely what we did and why, but we are still some distance from being understood, or fully trusted for that matter.\nI think the Fed has learned from this. I would argue that at this point our organization has shifted a great deal compared to two years ago, and at this point we are quite transparent and getting better at it in time.\nWhen I started at the Fed there was no explicit mention of our federal funds target after Federal Open Market Committee meetings, no minutes of the meetings, and no transcript released with a five-year lag. The minutes we provide now are quite detailed, providing a summary of staff presentations, discussion of the views of all participants regarding the outlook for the economy, and discussion of the debate around the policy recommendation.\nIn addition, we have started providing economic projections after each scheduled two-day meeting - currently four times a year. This provides a summary of the forecasts by the twelve Reserve Bank presidents and the Governors (currently there are five); on variables related to inflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of GDP. We provide both the range of forecasts and the central tendency of the forecasts. And the Fed is continuing to review its communications practices to ensure accountability and increase public understanding.\nAlso, after the four two-day FOMC meetings the Chairman now conducts a press conference. He fully describes recent policy decisions and the forecasts of the participants in the FOMC meeting, and answers questions posed by members of the press.\nAnd the Federal Reserve has also been communicating more directly with the public. The Chairman has participated in a variety of what for central bankers are less traditional opportunities, from \"60 Minutes\" to various town hall style meetings, including one last week with soldiers and their families on base in Texas.\nThe role of the Reserve Bank presidents has also evolved. Figure 5 lists the speeches I have given this year that like today's include a published text, charts, and an invitation to members of the media. The text and slides of this speech are available to anyone on our public web site. When we can, we make video summaries available as well. We \"tweet\" some of the main points. [7]And at the end of the speech I will be answering whatever questions you would like to raise.\nI also give a variety of informal talks that generally provide condensed versions of some of my previous public speeches. In addition, I have from time to time had interviews with members of the media working in print, radio, and TV. And I am not alone in this respect. My peers have similarly been trying to communicate more about actions we are taking on a range of issues, from monetary policy to supervisory policy to financial stability. We do not always agree on policy matters and this in itself is an indicator of transparency.\nAlso, there are some areas in which the Federal Reserve is now being more transparent - in part with the encouragement of Congress. The emergency facility loans we made during the crisis are listed on our web site, and information on \"Discount Window\" loans to banks are provided with a lag.\nThe reason for this lag is straightforward - not secret for secrecy's sake. As a lender of last resort concerned about financial stability and the continuation of lending during times of financial turbulence, you want institutions that are in generally sound financial condition to turn to the central bank when there is a temporary shortage of liquidity in the banking system - in other words when they have liquidity but not solvency problems. In the parlance of monetary policymaking, this prevents interest rates from rising significantly during a financial disruption. [8]\nHowever, immediate disclosure might cause financial institutions to view loans from the Fed as stigmatized, possibly raising concerns with depositors and investors, and further contributing to liquidity problems. The Dodd-Frank legislation wrestled with this issue and came up with what I view as a reasonable solution - disclosure of Discount Window loans after two years.\nSo I fully acknowledge that the Federal Reserve has not always been very transparent - but feel very comfortable attesting that there has been a rather dramatic change over the last two decades, and in particular over the last few years. While we at the Fed continue to examine ways to better explain and describe monetary policy and other aspects of central banking, I would suggest that there are now regular opportunities to hear from Federal Reserve officials directly or via the press, and I am glad that Fed officials are now much more publicly discussing policy actions.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that the Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization. The fact is that we are quite an open central bank - much better than we used to be - and are improving in this area even as we speak.\nCommon Misconception 3:\n\"Printing money\" has caused serious inflation\nFigure 6 highlights that both bank reserves and the total assets of the Federal Reserve have grown substantially during the crisis, recession, and anemic recovery - with the most rapid expansion occurring in the fall of 2008. The asset expansion is broken out in more detail in Figure 7. In the wake of the failure of Lehman Brothers and the freezing up of short-term credit markets, the Federal Reserve established a variety of emergency liquidity facilities. Something that is frequently overlooked is that over time all the loans were paid back with interest and the facilities have been closed. The size of the Fed's balance sheet has still continued to grow, as a result of our large-scale purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities - policy actions we took given the weak economy and our primary policy rate hitting the lower bound of near zero.\nHowever, while the most rapid growth in reserves occurred three years ago, Figure 8 shows that over the three-year period ending last quarter the U.S. has experienced the lowest average inflation rate of any such period over the past thirty years. Over the past three years, total personal consumption expenditures (PCE [9]) inflation has averaged only 1.2 percent.\nFigure 9 shows that in only two of the five most recent three-year periods has total PCE inflation been above 2 percent - and these two periods were ones where food and energy shocks occurred.\nWe have indeed expanded our balance sheet - some call that \"printing money\" - but it is a misconception that it has resulted in significant inflation.\nThe reason why this is so is shown in Figure 10, which depicts loan growth at commercial banks over the same three-year periods. Anemic loan growth in the credit crunch era of the early 1990s is one outlier on the chart, and the negative growth in the most recent three-year period is another. In the recent period banks have become more risk averse, and have focused (appropriately) on rebuilding their capital - while many borrowers have had their borrowing capacity weakened by the difficult business conditions of a severe recession and slow recovery. The end result is curtailed lending. Bank reserves are not going to be inflationary when bank lending is not expanding. [10]\nLet me be quick to stress that inflation would be serious and detrimental at higher levels. I am not suggesting otherwise. I am just pointing out some facts that suggest it is currently very restrained.\nIndeed, other market indicators show little evidence of concern over inflation. The 10- year U.S. Treasury bond has fallen to around 2 percent, as shown in Figure 11. Similarly, other countries where the central banks have expanded their balance sheets to fight the anemic economic conditions also have very low 10-year government bond rates. Evidently investors are not expecting large increases in inflation, or they would demand much higher rates to purchase long-term securities.\nAs everyone knows, high unemployment goes hand in hand with wages and salaries growing very slowly, at least for most jobs. Given the current conditions in the job market, there is little upward pressure on wages and salaries - and this means that there is little reason to expect significant inflationary pressures as higher labor costs push up higher end prices. I would add that while measures of money such as M2[11] have grown rapidly of late, much of that growth reflects investor risk aversion - investors moved funds to bank accounts during the debt ceiling discussion in August and in light of the European problems that have emerged more recently.\nFinally, I would note that one country where the central bank expanded its balance sheet significantly, some time ago, is Japan. The Japanese central bank began expanding its balance sheet more than a decade ago but rather than experiencing rapid inflation, they have been concerned with deflation, as shown in Figure 12. Deflation - which is not my forecast at this point, let me say - can be extremely difficult to overcome, as consumers expect products will be cheaper in the future, wages and salaries decline, and debtors face high real interest rates.\nMake no mistake, the Federal Reserve will need to remove its current policy accommodation as the economy improves. The current level of bank reserves would not be appropriate if we were at full employment - such accommodation would indeed be inflationary in that situation. However, that is not the situation the country is in now, and I fully expect we will remove accommodation appropriately as the economy improves.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that \"printing money\" has caused serious inflation. The fact is that inflation has remained extremely restrained during this period of accommodative monetary policy necessitated by economic conditions.\nCommon Misconception 4:\nRates are already low so further monetary policy actions will have no impact on the economy\nThe empirical evidence shows that Fed purchases of Treasury and MBS securities did cause market interest rates to fall. While rates can be impacted by a variety of factors - for example if the economy were to show signs of rapid growth you would expect rates to rise - 10-year rates now are much lower than they were before we undertook our actions.\nIt is unlikely that lower rates would have no impact on the economy. Such an assumption would be quite a leap of faith, because in general further lowering rates would:\nimpact home purchases – because lower rates can have a big impact on cash flow of consumers;\nimpact consumer durables like cars – because auto-loan rates are one of the largest payments many people make each month;\nimpact investment – because lower rates improve the potential benefit (the net present value) of investment projects;\nimpact exchange rates and foreign trade – as suggested by the complaints heard from some trading partners when the Fed has previously lowered rates;\nimpact inflation expectations, which impact real interest rates – given the evidence that one-year inflation expectations did rise when the Fed announced its purchase program last year.\nResearchers at the Boston Fed have conducted statistical tests to determine if the reaction to long-term interest rates is different after the crisis, and whether there is empirical evidence that lower interest rates would indeed have no impact. Research by my colleague Giovanni Olivei has found that prior to the crisis our statistical model of the economy would imply that a sustained decline in the 10-year Treasury rate of 100 basis points would lead to a cumulative increase in real GDP over two years of approximately 2.5 percent.\nWith the reduction in interest sensitivity in housing more recently, the model would imply that a sustained decline in the 10-year Treasury rate of 100 basis points would now lead to a cumulative increase in real GDP over two years of approximately 2 percent - as shown in Figure 13. [12] Concerns with falling prices, high unemployment, and limited access to credit have likely all contributed to this lower - but clearly non-zero - response to lower rates in housing markets. [13] The assertion that our rate actions simply will have no impact is not supported by our statistical work.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that rates are already low so further monetary policy actions will have no impact on the economy. In fact, statistical analysis suggests the opposite.\nConcluding Observations\nWe continue to experience unusual turbulence in financial markets. We had significant financial shocks that impacted the real economy during the crisis and recession, and we remain at risk that financial shocks here or abroad could still impact our economy.\nThe Federal Reserve, like other central banks, has taken strong action to mitigate the impact and avoid worse outcomes for the economy. As stated at the outset of my talk, the Fed's actions have mitigated problems but we alone cannot quickly restore full employment. That will take time and appropriate actions by international policymakers, U.S. fiscal policymakers, and monetary policymakers.\nThank you for indulging me today as I discussed some common misconceptions about the Federal Reserve. In sum, I believe the facts show that the Fed remains an organization with significant oversight, which has substantially increased its transparency, and continues to pursue actions consistent with our Congressional mandate to work to the best of our ability to achieve maximum employment consistent with stable prices, in the national interest.\nThank you, and I would be happy to take a few questions now.",

            "content": "New England Board of Higher Education's \"New England Works\" Summit on Bridging Higher Education and the Workforce Boston, Massachusetts\nIt is a great pleasure to be with you today. I want to welcome all of you to the Boston Fed and especially commend all the educators in the room for the work that you do. I benefited immeasurably from my experience at Colby College as an undergraduate and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in graduate school. I am pleased now to have the opportunity to \"give back\" to both schools, in that I serve on an advisory committee for the economics department at Madison, and on Colby College's Board of Trustees. These experiences give me a window into some of the daunting challenges that you face, particularly in the current economic environment.\nToday I want to spend a few minutes discussing the nexus between what you do as educators and what I do as a central banker. Like a central banker should, let me first note that my comments represent my perspectives, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. Returning to that nexus between what you and I do, at first glance it might seem as if there is not much commonality. A case in point - generally when setting monetary policy, we assume we have little impact on demographic variables including the educational attainment of the workforce.[Footnote 1] Not that such variables are unimportant, by any stretch, because we all know that the educational characteristics of the workforce play an important role in the dynamics of an economy. A well-educated work force is likely to be more productive, and highly skilled workers tend to have much lower unemployment rates in economic downturns.\nOn the other hand, as senior officials at colleges and universities, you likely view macroeconomic conditions as something you have little control over. You focus instead on key matters like educating students, worrying about raising funds for the endowments that are a key ingredient to financial aid, and affording new and engaging educational programs. So while you might take them as \"given,\" the recent recession has only highlighted how economic conditions affect how you go about educating students.\nI would like to suggest, however, that what educators do matters to the Fed and what the Fed does matters to educators. I'll touch briefly on some of the reasons why.\nAs you all probably know, the monthly U.S. employment report was released last Friday. The unemployment rate is now 9.0 percent - a rate that remains stubbornly, and unacceptably, high. The Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions to improve the growth rate in the economy. But economic \"headwinds\" - stemming from the previous financial crisis and concerns about possible future financial shocks - have meant that despite Federal Reserve actions, economic growth has been lethargic and job growth has been too slow to make significant inroads into reducing the unemployment rate.\nHowever, underlying the average unemployment statistics are a vast range of circumstances, depending on educational attainment.\nToday I want to discuss some of those statistics and propose that as you and your peers are making admissions, financial aid, and retention-program decisions at your schools, you are powerfully shaping the outcomes for individuals - and society more generally. I also want to emphasize that institutions represented in this room play an important role in economic development in the communities in which you are located. There are important synergies between communities and schools of higher education. Schools are important anchors for their communities. They provide good and stable jobs for people in the area, and businesses that support the academic community benefit as well. They also bring in highly motivated students, some of whom choose to use their education to form businesses in the communities where they were educated. And of course the schools benefits, in many ways, from their communities.\nEducational Attainment and the Work Force\nIt is stating the obvious, but educational attainment is one of the defining characteristics of a workforce. Particularly in New England we tend to have highly skilled and highly educated workers.\nI would like to take just a moment to show how educational attainment is important not only to individuals, but also to the communities they inhabit. In the current economic environment, the variation in unemployment by educational attainment is particularly striking.\nTo begin, let me draw your attention to Figure 1. As a result of a long and severe recession, the unemployment rate has gone up dramatically for people in all categories of educational attainment, but no one will be surprised to hear that the levels of unemployment are dramatically different depending on educational attainment. Those with no high school diploma are experiencing more than three times the unemployment rate of those with at least a bachelor's degree. While the current unemployment rate is 9.0 percent percent, for those with at least a college education it is only 4.4 percent.\nIt is important to note that while the level of unemployment has varied by educational attainment, Figure 1 is not supportive of what economists call a \"structural\" unemployment explanation for persistently high unemployment - such as when there are lots of open jobs that cannot be filled because the available workers have the wrong skill sets for those positions. As you may know, evidence of a change in the structural level of unemployment has been a matter of significant debate among economists and policymakers. Figure 1 might provide some evidence that structural unemployment was a problem if, for example, unemployment had risen dramatically for lower-skilled workers but there was a shortage of highly skilled workers (that is, their unemployment rate had fallen).\nStimulating an economy where most of the unemployment is structural would place additional demand on high-skilled jobs - causing rapid increases in compensation for those workers without generating improvement in the overall unemployment rate, as the supply of highly educated workers would be slow to respond.\nBut we see quite the opposite right now, because people at all levels of educational attainment have experienced a substantial increase in unemployment, as shown in Figure 2. In fact, if one compares the percentage increase in unemployment by category of educational attainment, it is striking what a high percentage increase in unemployment has occurred in each category. This is consistent not with the \"mismatch\" dynamic of structural unemployment but with a story of weak demand throughout the economy.\nOn this subject I would recommend a recent paper by economists Bob Triest and Bill Dickens, presented last month at the Boston Fed's annual economic conference. They provide important evidence on employment flows - evidence that is consistent with most of the unemployment being driven by inadequate demand, rather than structural problems.[Footnote 2]\nA look at the compensation data in Figure 3 provides additional evidence that structural unemployment cannot explain the persistently high unemployment rate. If most of the current unemployment were structural, we would expect to see compensation increasing as employers bid for scarce high-skilled workers. But as the figure shows, compensation growth has slowed, and remains quite low relative to compensation over the past 30 years.\nSimilarly, Figure 4 shows there has been no great divergence in compensation trends across occupations. If a skills mismatch existed, one would expect wages in the sectors where supply is short to be accelerating, while wages would be declining in sectors where there was excess labor supply. We do not see this happening. Growth in compensation for management and professionals - presumably a higher skilled occupational category - has not shown evidence of sharp acceleration relative to occupations that one would presume have somewhat lower skill requirements, such as work in natural resources, construction, and maintenance.\nIn fact, Figure 5 presents the increase in labor costs over the past nine quarters (since the beginning of the recovery) by occupation, and it does not show dramatically different growth in compensation by job type. In fact, management and professional occupations have seen compensation grow less than workers in natural resources, construction, and maintenance over these nine quarters of recovery.\nThis is just some of the evidence that suggests why the notion of rising structural unemployment cannot explain the high aggregate unemployment rate we are unfortunately experiencing. This distinction is very important to the policy response. Of course, for individuals it should be noted that employment prospects are significantly improved with educational attainment.\nBut educational attainment affects far more than just employment prospects. The left-hand chart in Figure 6 shows the relationship between median household income and educational attainment. While the median income of all households is approximately $50,000, there are substantial differences based on educational attainment. Those with no high school diploma have less than half the median income, and those with just a high school diploma (no college experience) have about three-quarters of the median income. And those with professional degrees have more than twice the median income.\nAnd the right panel of the figure shows that growth in median income over the past two decades also varies substantially by educational attainment. For example, those with only a high school education have experienced a significant decline in median real income where the most rapid growth has been for those that have received doctorate or master's degrees.\nFigure 7 shows that educational attainment also translates into significant differences in net worth. Those with college degrees have more than triple the net worth of those that do not. Over the last two decades, those with college degrees have had a significant increase in their real net worth - while in contrast, those with no high school diploma have substantially less net worth, and their real net worth has declined over the past two decades. Of course, the causation can work in both directions here, especially with regard to inherited net worth - that is, parental wealth makes it easier to afford higher education.\nThe Implications\nFigure 8 shows that the U.S. workforce is becoming more educated. There has been a substantial increase in the number of people in the workforce that have a bachelor's degree or higher. Given the employment, income, and net worth differentials shown in earlier charts, it is not surprising that an increasing number of high school students are realizing that higher educational attainment is in their interest.\nHowever, underlying this positive trend are sharp differences across racial categories.Figure 9 shows that educational attainment differs substantially by race. While Asian individuals have been particularly successful in obtaining college degrees, African-Americans and Hispanics in the labor force significantly lag in educational attainment. This lack of education makes it much more difficult for them to maximize their potential, given the evolving work-force needs in the US economy.\nI think there are a number of potential implications for educational leaders from this analysis. As you consider whom to admit, how much of an endowment to spend to provide financial aid, whether financial aid should be in the form of grants or loans, and how those scarce funds should be allocated, I would urge you to keep in mind that you are making choices that are not only important for individuals but for society more generally. And I would urge public policymakers to keep similar notions in mind when they consider budgetary investments in public and community institutions.\nIndeed, income and net worth differences are highly related to educational attainment, as I have shown. Insuring that children have adequate preparation, from early childhood education through high school, is critically important. And it is critical that those whose families have limited financial means are not shut out from the opportunities an education provides. In short, finding ways to encourage greater educational attainment - particularly for low and moderate income families and those racial groups that have traditionally been underrepresented - will be an important determinant of the quality of the U.S. work force and the income distribution in our country.\nSimilarly, many of your institutions are in cities that have been hard hit by the economic downturn and tepid recovery, making it even more important - to a macroeconomic policymaker - that you reach out to affected communities, and view your institutions as anchors of community economic development. Certainly the location of this conference, in Boston, highlights the tangible benefits that can accrue to a community when it has great colleges, and college leaders that take the development of their communities seriously.\nFinally, I am pleased to note that many schools have become better at bridging their students to the working world. I would strongly encourage using alumni networks and other resources to provide students with internship opportunities. A vibrant New England needs a vibrant work force, and internships can be an important way for communities to attract and retain top talent.\nHelping the region attract and retain talented college students is one reason the Boston Fed partnered with the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce to provide a better clearinghouse for college internships in the Boston area. I would encourage your institutions' career offices to direct students looking for internship opportunities to the web site that has been set up.[Footnote 3] We and our partners hope it will continue to grow and provide many opportunities in the greater Boston area over time.\nI have described the Boston Fed's research that highlights the important role that education plays in our regional development. Let me touch briefly on other policy work that we do and describe what is currently a major concern to us. At the Boston Fed it is central to our mission to explore ways that U.S. monetary policy - entrusted by Congress to the Federal Reserve System - can promote maximum employment with stable prices. My own forecast is that inflation is likely to be below 2 percent over the next several years, in part because of the very weak labor markets. Given the very weak labor market conditions and the low expected inflation rate, the Federal Reserve should in my view continue to take action to aggressively try to reduce the stubbornly high U.S. unemployment rate.\nBut clearly the Federal Reserve cannot do it alone. Given the sobering macroeconomic situation, it is important that fiscal policy, controlled by the federal government and the states, do its part. It is also important for international policy makers to take actions that provide more stable world markets. But at the same time, in my view the Federal Reserve should continue to use the tools at its disposal to boost demand in the economy. And at the same time, we would do well to work on addressing any impediments to students getting the employment opportunities that will serve them, their communities, and the macroeconomy.\nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today, and to take a few minutes to explore the nexus between higher education and the macroeconomy. Thank you for having me.",

            "content": "Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 56th Economic Conference: The Long-Term Effects of the Great Recession Boston, Massachusetts\nI'd like to reiterate the welcome to conference participants that I offered yesterday. Thank you for being here to take part in this conference on the long-term effects of what many have come to call, sadly, the \"Great Recession.\" I hope that the ideas and analysis exchanged at this conference will help alleviate the effects of this downturn and the slow recovery, as well as help prevent future problems from causing so much hardship for so many.\nI should mention that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nAs I - and others - have noted many times, a key lesson from the recent downturn and prior financial crises is that problems in financial institutions and financial markets can and do spill over to the real economy, very significantly. Policymakers must worry about the financial system and markets because problems there can disrupt the financial intermediation on which market economies depend.[Footnote 1] When this happens the economy suffers, and the economic prospects of its participants.\nGiven the severity of the recession that followed the recent financial crisis, it is crucial that our financial infrastructure becomes resilient enough so that financial intermediation can continue, regardless of a shock, without extraordinary intervention from the public sector (the government and, ultimately, taxpayers). During 2007 and 2008, the U.S. Congress, Treasury department, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve all took extraordinary actions to avoid a more-severe financial crisis and more damage to economic prospects. Despite this unprecedented public-policy response, the recession was long and severe and the recovery continues to be much slower than we would like. And the United States was not unique in this respect. Many foreign governments and foreign central banks also took unprecedented action to try to alleviate the effects of the financial crisis in their countries.\nParticularly noteworthy is how many large global financial intermediaries experienced severe distress. These institutions play a vital role in the credit flows and financial intermediation that underpin the global economy. They span national borders and presumably have the ability to be better diversified across products and geographic locations than smaller institutions or intermediaries doing business in just one country.\nBut because these global intermediaries are key players in many countries and in many financial markets, and because they are highly interconnected with other financial institutions, they also serve as particularly efficient conductors or transmitters of shocks in one area to the wider global financial system. Unfortunately, such was the case with the major shock caused by residential real estate problems in the U.S. More recently it appears to be the case with the sovereign debt problems in Europe.\nAs you know, there have been significant legislative and regulatory responses to the financial crisis that emerged in 2007. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank legislation made significant changes to frameworks for addressing systemically important financial institutions, among other things. Internationally, many of the impending Basel III rules are similarly intended to address some of the lessons of the financial crisis.\nI am very supportive of these efforts, but I suspect they can be strengthened and improved. Indeed some countries, such as the U.K. and Switzerland, are fairly far along in establishing standards that are higher than those required by Basel III. But in my view some significant challenges remain to be addressed if we are to have a global banking system in which no institution is \"too big to fail\" given the collateral damage its disorderly demise would cause to economies and citizens.\nBefore the new domestic and international rules could be fully implemented, the world has once again been buffeted by financial shocks, this time emanating in Europe. And once again large financial intermediaries, despite all the positive roles they play in facilitating global commerce, have been efficient in transmitting or conducting the shocks. As a result the world economy has slowed, and stock prices of large financial intermediaries have fallen significantly.\nOnce again, governments have started to intervene to mitigate global banking problems, which in turn may stress the debt burden of those governments, and could ultimately undermine the credit ratings of some countries. While the full impact of sovereign debt problems and their impact on large financial intermediaries will not be known for some time, it is apparent that the financial intermediaries encompass some vulnerabilities for the world financial system and the global economy.\nConsidering the Large Financial Intermediaries\nGiven the key role that large financial intermediaries played in the crisis of 2007 and 2008, as well as their role in the problems that have arisen more recently, it is important to understand why financial intermediaries contribute vulnerabilities to the global financial system. So I'd like to provide some background on the large intermediaries and their potential for conducting shocks around the global economy.\nFigure 1 explores bank size relative to the size of the home country, specifically the asset size of the largest bank in each country as a share of GDP.[Footnote 2] When financial intermediaries become large relative to the GDP of the home country, several potential challenges exist.[Footnote 3] First, a large institution could essentially be \"too big to save.\" Should a global bank become insolvent and the home country need to recapitalize it - so that it can continue its crucial role in financial intermediation within the economy - then the sheer scale of the required equity capital could strain a country trying to raise sufficient funds to provide the equity.\nConsider a hypothetical example. A troubled two trillion dollar bank located in a country whose GDP is also two trillion dollars would in all likelihood put the country in a position of needing to issue government debt to finance an equity infusion. If the government recapitalized the bank with 10 percent more capital, the nation's debt to GDP ratio would increase by 10 percent. If multiple banks failed at the same time, the national debt to GDP ratio would rise even further. Thus while government rescue of a bank may stem an individual institution's crisis, it can precipitate sovereign debt concerns.\nIreland's recent experience is instructive. The Irish banks were not among the world's largest financial intermediaries, but they were large relative to the size of their home country's economy. Prior to its banking crisis, Ireland was a country with a relatively low debt to GDP, but became a country with a high debt to GDP ratio - largely as a result of providing emergency equity support for its troubled banking sector.\nNow I would like to direct your attention to Figure 2, which shows the pricing on sovereign credit default swaps for a number of countries. Credit default swap (CDS) rates for many countries are now very high by historical standards - meaning the cost of insuring against a sovereign default has risen appreciably. While I know that thin trading in credit default swaps for individual entities necessitates caution in their interpretation, the overall trend is clear. A country needing to recapitalize one or more of its financial intermediaries faces further fiscal strain - potentially at a precarious time, when investors have already become more cautious about trends in the country's debt to GDP levels.\nAnother potential problem arises when investors have little confidence in a particular global bank or the home government. In this case, simply recapitalizing the bank may not be sufficient to address concerns, and additional financial support by the country may be necessary. For example if depositors rapidly withdraw their deposits from a troubled bank, the home country may need to support deposit holders in addition to providing equity (capital) - particularly in countries where deposit insurance regimes are not robust, or payment of depositors' claims is not timely.\nWhat's more, a failure to support the liabilities of a troubled bank (in this case the deposits) would potentially destabilize other banks in the country, even those with relatively healthy balance sheets. Compared to simply infusing capital, supporting liabilities could require much larger expenditures by the home country and thus the home country would need to contribute substantial additional funds.\nYet another issue concerns the reliance of large financial intermediaries on so-called wholesale financing arrangements. As you know, retail depositors are frequently covered (to varying degrees) by deposit insurance, so in countries with credible deposit insurance frameworks, retail depositors covered by insurance are less likely to \"run.\" In contrast, however, wholesale funds - such as very large certificates of deposit, and commercial paper - tend to move out of troubled banks relatively quickly. Thus banks that depend heavily on wholesale funding can potentially experience a fairly sudden liquidity crisis. Such crises force governments to make quick decisions about providing support - decisions that have important economic ramifications for their countries.\nDiscussing these concerns is not an esoteric exercise. Figure 3 shows the average credit default swap spreads for largest financial intermediaries, in groups of five.[Footnote 4] As I just mentioned, one needs to use caution in reading too much into credit default swap rates - but they do indicate that similar to credit default swap spreads on countries, financial firms around the world have seen a marked increase in CDS spreads. The cost of insuring against default has gone up substantially relative to the beginning of the financial crisis. Suffice to say for many banks, the rates remain quite elevated at present.\nFigure 4 shows stock price declines at the largest bank by country (and for countries with more than one bank in the top 20 in assets, the declines are averaged). Bank stock prices have declined substantially since the beginning of the year. Many large financial intermediaries have experienced significant declines and market prices already reflect concerns with financial intermediaries outside and inside Europe. Figure 5 provides stock-price data on the largest institutions in Europe and the U.S., again in groups of five, including the average change from the peak to the current level, and from the end of 2010 to the current level for each group of banks.\nOutstanding Issues Related to Large Financial Intermediaries\nThe Basel III capital accord is designed to reduce the risk that large financial intermediaries will become troubled and require government intervention. While there are a variety of proposed requirements in Basel III, two major initiatives include potentially raising capital requirements for systemically important institutions - to reduce the probability they become insolvent - and improving the ability of large financial intermediaries to withstand liquidity shocks. These are important and necessary improvements, and the overall accord is an important step in the right direction. Yet some important outstanding issues remain to be addressed. I would like to mention some key ones, which of course are more interrelated than stand-alone.\n1. Resolution of large financial intermediaries\nThe first outstanding issue involves the challenge of resolving a failing international financial institution. Different countries have very different bankruptcy frameworks and resolution arrangements, and these differences can significantly impact who gets payment in a restructuring. These differences remain a major impediment to orderly resolution.[Footnote 5]\nAs seen in Figure 6, related to absolute priority in liquidation, there are significant differences across countries, particularly related to the treatment of secured creditors and employee claims. These differences mean that the place where funds \"reside\" in a global organization will determine which creditors get paid. Knowing this, there is the potential for the organization in danger of failure to shift funds (prior to closure) to countries where the treatment of particular classes of creditors is favorable to the organization.\nA disorderly failure of a global financial institution can be extremely damaging. Creditors may not know which jurisdictions hold valuable assets. They may be unclear on the prevailing bankruptcy rules, how these rules affect their positions, or how long their funds will be tied up. The situation surrounding the failure of Lehmann Brothers is quite relevant here. Three years after the bankruptcy, significant litigation continues. Some creditors were impacted by the movement of funds in the final days before bankruptcy, and many creditors still do not know the amount they will receive or the timeframe in which they will be paid.\nThe failure of several Icelandic banks also highlights the problem. While small by international standards, the troubled banks were large relative to the size of the Icelandic economy. Uncertainty about whether depositor claims (particularly foreign depositors' claims) would be satisfied - and by whom - highlights the difficulties that can emerge when even relatively small institutions fail.\nSuch uncertainty could provide depositors and creditors with a strong incentive to remove funds from a troubled global financial institution. This may mean that large financial intermediaries could be particularly susceptible to the rapid withdrawal of deposits due to uncertainty surrounding resolution. Needless to say, this is particularly problematic at a time of financial stress.\nIdeally, international agreements would govern cross-border claims on global institutions. However, as the table highlights, differences in national views on which creditors should get the highest priority make obtaining an international agreement quite elusive, at least any time soon. There are fundamental legal and cultural differences in national insolvency and resolution regimes - including differences in insolvency criteria; which parties can initiate an insolvency proceeding; whether the debtor or an administrator is in charge; the time for payment of claims; set-off and preference rules; and others.\nWhile a uniform approach to creditor hierarchy would arguably enhance financial institution resolution and financial stability efforts globally, the likelihood of harmonizing the array of entrenched national creditor hierarchies would seem to be unlikely in the near term. Moreover, these differences are unique and important to individual countries. Consequently, interim or alternative measures seem appropriate. But I hope I have helped illuminate a key challenge that could make an orderly failure of a large institution potentially elusive.\n2. Wholesale financing of large financial intermediaries\nA second outstanding issue involves large financial intermediaries' reliance on wholesale funding arrangements. Many large financial intermediaries raise funds across international borders, so the location of their creditors may well differ from the location of their assets. This situation is quite prevalent among many large European banks that have raised funds in the short-term credit markets for commercial paper and jumbo certificates of deposit, in order to fund longer-term assets either in the United States or elsewhere in their global operations.[Footnote 6]\nBut this practice of raising short-term dollar liabilities to fund longer-term dollar assets can make the financial institution less stable if global creditors come to feel less certain about the institution's prospects (or the prospects of a class of institutions). In fact,Figure 7 shows that the cost of raising dollar liabilities through the use of foreign exchange swaps has increased substantially this year - an indicator of creditor concern about such institutions.\nThis reliance on wholesale liabilities - compared to retail liabilities like deposits that usually enjoy deposit insurance - makes a large financial intermediary more susceptible to liquidity pressures. This is precisely why the new Basel III requirements devote significant attention to the liquidity and funding strategies of large financial intermediaries.\nAdditionally, during periods of distress there is a natural incentive for regulators in a given country to \"ring fence\" some operations of a global bank within their borders - in other words to prevent any bank assets from leaving the country in order to maximize funding available to meet their liabilities to domestic creditors. Such a policy could make it difficult for large financial intermediaries to continue funding - particularly wholesale funding - across national borders.\nAs long as the sources and uses of funds in such situations differ because of national borders and related regulatory and legal requirements, the ability to resolve a global bank will be complicated, giving rise to concerns about the risks of broad financial contagion. I would add that if we are to avoid future crises and the need for extraordinary government intervention in crises, then the issue of over-reliance on wholesale funding will need to be addressed.\n3. Protection of home country operations\nA third lingering issue concerns the protection of home country operations. An alternative being explored in the United Kingdom and in Switzerland - areas with global financial intermediaries that are large relative to their economies - is whether in some circumstances the public sector will only support the domestic operations of their banks. By ring-fencing responsibilities, the home country government will be better able to forestall a crisis in their country. However, other countries could be adversely affected if subsidiaries and branches in their jurisdiction must \"fend for themselves.\"\nAgain, the Icelandic example highlights the problem of small countries supporting large financial intermediaries, and whether the home country and its regulatory authority and taxpayers can be expected to be willing and able to serve as a source of strength should the bank be in danger of failing, or fail. It is exactly these concerns that have caused some countries to require that all branches of foreign banks operating within their borders be supported by capital (sometimes referred to as full subsidiarization).\nThe benefits of creating a subsidiary with deposit insurance and access to the Federal Home Loan Bank system would likely change the nature of their U.S. operations. By requiring capital against all assets in the country, financial firms are more likely to depend on a more stable mix of liabilities - including retail deposits, wholesale funding, and term debt - rather than just wholesale deposits. And the capital in the country would provide additional protection to meet domestic claims should the global parent become troubled. Alternatively, the domestic operations would be more readily salable, which could potentially reduce the spread of difficulties and limit the disruption of crucial financial intermediation. However, this solution also comes at a cost - as risk management, liquidity management, capital management and regulatory requirements become more costly to the parent, since all financial operations in a country are now subject to the regulatory requirements of that host country.\n4. Reluctance to be proactive in retaining and raising additional capital\nA fourth outstanding issue involves the reluctance of bank management or regulators to be proactive in retaining and raising additional capital for an institution or for groups of institutions. Basel III provides new restrictions on the ability of banks to pay dividends as their capital becomes depleted. However, book and regulatory capital measures tend to be lagging indicators of the financial strength of the bank. Some financial intermediaries have experienced large declines in share prices and large increases in the pricing on credit default swaps, but still continue to pay dividends or buy back shares.\nGiven the support of governments to large financial intermediaries around the world in 2008, a more proactive approach to retaining capital within organizations during times of stress is in my view warranted - a view I have expressed a number of times in various talks. If taxpayer funds in a country may be used to bolster a bank due to its critical role as a financial intermediary in the country's economy, that step should not manifest itself in paying scarce funds to equity holders.\nMoving to a structure where an institution's dividends are deferred during times of financial stress would greatly facilitate the increase of capital buffers at times when investors are concerned with a given bank's financial performance. Using easily observable financial triggers, such as very substantial declines in a firm's stock price, to pause share repurchases and dividends would provide no additional information about the institution's financial strength - but would allow it to build up capital during times of stress.\nThe amount of necessary government support for large financial institutions globally should provide a strong incentive for the capital requirement aspects of Basel III. In fact, it is notable that proposals in both the U.K. and Switzerland are calling for significantly higher capital requirements than in Basel III, to reduce the need for future interventions by those governments.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, during 2008, governments around the world were forced to intervene to protect the global financial system. The Dodd-Frank legislation provided significant regulatory tools to address the \"too big to fail\" problem. However, three years after the failure of Lehmann Brothers, there remain significant impediments to avoiding the need for government intervention to protect large financial intermediaries. Everyone knows that some large European financial institutions have of late encountered problems. So it is critical that we focus on strengthening the financial architecture, so that the struggles of one institution or a group of them no longer poses risks to the broader global economy.\nSignificant challenges remain to be addressed if we are to have a global banking system where no bank is too big to fail given the collateral damage it would cause to economies and citizens. I hope that this conference and others like it will be part of the important process of addressing these outstanding issues and challenges.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Global Interdependence Center's Conference on Capital Markets in the Post Crisis Environment Stockholm, Sweden\nI am very happy to be with you for this substantive conference on capital markets in the \"post-crisis\" environment. It is vital for policymakers and practitioners to study and apply the recent lessons of financial interdependence, given the obvious effects on public wellbeing. So I am glad to be able to join you in these discussions. And I commend the Global Interdependence Center for organizing this event, and others like it.\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). That is a standard disclaimer for Fed officials, but I really do mean it. My comments should not be construed as official Fed perspectives or policy, but rather one person's carefully considered perspectives, based on much study. Let me also mention that my charts, and the analysis I will share with you today, are all built on publicly available data.\nMy intent today is to offer up some constructive observations that I believe will help us move towards greater financial stability, to the benefit of all. We need to create a more stable financial infrastructure and I believe we can, in a thoughtful manner.\nFor the second time in four years, problems with financial institutions have captured the attention not only of economists, but also the mainstream press and the public at large. Given the importance of credit to economic performance, we should reflect on why our financial system seems so susceptible to shocks, and on how we can strengthen its resilience so government intervention is no longer necessitated by such shocks. My hope is that bankers and central bankers can once again be relegated from the front pages of our newspapers to the business sections.\nYesterday I had an opportunity to participate in an economic outlook forum and discuss some of the challenges in the real economy - specifically in housing - that we are trying to address in the United States. Today I'd like to shift somewhat from the real economy directly, and focus on more underlying financial-market challenges.\nIt goes without saying that this is an important time to be discussing financial markets. Global financial markets are being buffeted by concerns about the challenges facing various financial institutions, in part as a result of issues with fiscal imbalances in a number of countries. This heightened uncertainty is occurring despite the aggressive monetary policy actions taken in response to the recent recession - actions that at first blush would seemingly mitigate some of these challenges.\nConsistent with our mandate, the Federal Reserve acted aggressively when financial disruptions emerged and the economy faltered. After cutting the federal funds rate essentially as far as possible, the Fed took less traditional policy actions, again to pursue our mandate. Figure 1 shows that bank reserves in the United States have increased dramatically. We have increased the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, providing over a trillion dollars in additional bank reserves - yet even so, dollar funding markets have experienced strains.\nFigure 2 highlights that interbank markets are showing more strains as the spread between the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the overnight index swap rate has widened. This is happening even though most banks are loath to post higher rates for fear of signaling financial challenges.\nAlso reflective of the current strain is Figure 3, which essentially shows the cost of utilizing derivatives contracts to secure dollar funding. It shows the spread between the 3-month dollar cash rate implied by a 3-month euro-dollar FX swap, and 3-month dollar LIBOR. Under normal conditions the line should be quite close to zero, but during periods of dollar funding problems, the spread can widen. As the chart shows, the spread is now at the widest it has been in the past several years.\nSo how can there be a shortage of dollar funding at a time when there are so many bank reserves? One answer lies in the structure of short-term funding markets - a structure that has evolved to a state that is, unfortunately, particularly sensitive to liquidity shocks.\nToday I will highlight that the structure of the U.S. money market mutual fund (MMMF) industry[Footnote 1] -- and the practice of many financial institutions to fund long-term dollar assets with short-term dollar liabilities - have both helped make the global financial system susceptible to liquidity shocks and (relatedly) to changes in the perceived credit risk of market participants.\nI will first discuss the role that MMMFs play in providing short-term funding, including serving as an important source of short-term financing for European banks. I will highlight that the current structure makes MMMFs particularly susceptible to credit shocks that can turn into liquidity problems for the whole industry - and will suggest some ways that the industry could be made more resilient.\nAnd I will then turn to the practice among some European banks of funding long-term dollar assets with short-term paper purchased by MMMFs. This too, has proved to be a structure that makes short-term credit markets susceptible to liquidity shocks.\nI will conclude with some general observations about the current stresses in financial markets.\nThe Role of Money Market Mutual Funds in Short-Term Credit Markets\nMMMFs are mutual funds that provide investors the ability to invest in a diversified set of short-term credit-market instruments. Because MMMFs generally invest in highly liquid, high quality, short-term credit instruments they are not required to alter their net value to reflect small movements in underlying asset values. The resulting stable (versus floating) net asset value makes the investments attractive to investors looking for a transactional account that generally has paid a somewhat higher return than comparable bank products.\nLike other mutual funds, MMMFs are not required to hold any capital as protection against adverse movements in the value of the assets they hold. This absence of capital, together with the stable net asset value, results in a structure that despite its appeal in other ways is prone to shareholder \"runs\" during times of financial stresses.\nMMMFs have been viewed as appealingly safe investment vehicles for investors seeking highly liquid investment opportunities. As a condition of transacting at a stable net asset value, the MMMFs, which are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are required to maintain significant liquidity ratios and are limited in the duration and credit ratings of the financial instruments they can hold.[Footnote 2], [Footnote 3]\nMMMFs are critical players in short-term credit markets. They have been very significant buyers of commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. MMMFs have provided an important source of financing for organizations dependent on wholesale financing, including branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the U.S. - I will discuss them in a moment - and others that issue short-term credit instruments to finance longer-term dollar-denominated assets.\nAs Figure 4 illustrates, MMMFs are sizeable participants in financial markets with about $2.5 trillion of assets under management. They grew rapidly for much of the last decade, but encountered significant problems in the wake of the failure of Lehman Brothers. One MMMF, the Reserve Primary Fund, had a position in Lehman Brothers and was unable to maintain a fixed net asset value (\"broke the buck\" ) after Lehman failed and the value of its commercial paper plummeted. This led to rapid withdrawals from many MMMFs (a \"run\" ) as investors became concerned that other MMMFs would not be able to maintain their stable net asset value.\nIn response to the rapid withdrawals, the U.S. Treasury announced a temporary insurance program for MMMFs. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston administered on behalf of the Federal Reserve System a lending facility that was designed to address the short-term liquidity needs of MMMFs and help stabilize short-term credit markets that were disrupted by the rapid liquidation of investments by many MMMFs. [Footnote 4], [Footnote 5] These efforts proved successful at restoring stability and avoiding further harm, and all of the loans were repaid with interest.[Footnote 6]\nSince then, balances at MMMFs have gradually declined - by more than a trillion dollars from their peak - over the past three years in response to the historically low interest rate environment and corresponding returns.\nFigure 5 shows the three major categories of MMMFs, determined by the assets in which they invest. The prime money market funds are the largest category, with approximately $1.5 trillion in assets. The prime funds have the most flexibility in investing and are allowed to hold commercial paper, jumbo CDs,[Footnote 7] and asset-backed commercial paper as well as government-backed securities. The second largest category, with approximately $850 million in assets, involves MMMFs that invest in U.S. Treasury and agency securities. These funds have lower credit risk, but also generate lower returns. The smallest category involves MMMFs that provide tax-free returns to investors.\nAt the time of the Lehman Brothers failure, prime MMMFs that had credit-sensitive investors and exposure to large financial institutions experienced the largest and most rapid redemptions. [Footnote 8] Many investor outflows from prime funds were redirected to MMMFs that were government-only funds.\nMMMFs have substantially increased their liquidity over the last year. In part this reflects a tightening of liquidity requirements by the SEC, but it also reflects the realization among MMMF managers that during times of significant liquidity risk, they need to maintain a more defensive posture. As Figure 6 shows, prime funds have been increasing their holdings of short-maturity assets of late - in part, one assumes, as a result of the debt ceiling concerns in the U.S. and the funding worries related to governments and financial institutions in Europe.\nSince MMMFs have increased liquidity in an environment of very low returns on short-term credit instruments, their returns to investors have been squeezed further. Figure 7 illustrates the impact on MMMF returns. The first line in the table provides the average yields for the five highest yielding MMMFs, and the second line provides the average yields for the next five highest yielding funds. The table highlights that while the gross yield averages about 40 basis points for the five highest yielding MMMFs, investors are only getting a net yield of only five basis points.\nMMMFs have purchased a large amount of foreign-bank securities. But as Figure 8 shows, most MMMFs have been reducing their exposure to European banks that the market may see as posing more significant credit risks. Some of the reductions have been quite dramatic, and MMMFs are no longer holding short-term credit instruments issued by institutions headquartered in the most financially strained countries. They have greatly reduced the size of their overall exposure, and have also significantly reduced the maturity they are willing to hold.\nHowever, one of the challenges for the MMMF industry is that, just as in the fall of 2008, a very few aggressive MMMFs - maybe even one - could under certain circumstances encounter trouble that ends up ratcheting up redemption requests across the industry.\nNo one wants to see a repeat of 2008, nor should we. The industry and all participants can get to a better place. For example, an examination of the publicly available monthly reports on portfolio holdings of MMMFs highlights that a few MMMFs hold financial paper that has not been downgraded but nonetheless is seen by the market as posing more credit risk than could seem appropriate for entities that are allowed to maintain a fixed net asset value.\nMMMFs have been required to provide a monthly report of holdings and have increased their liquidity. Still, we are passing the three-year anniversary of the failure of Lehman and the run on the MMMFs and it remains important to explore the ways that the industry, which plays a pivotal role in short-term credit markets, can address its susceptibility to a credit shock that could in turn be transmitted to short-term financial markets. I am not saying anything that has not been expressed before, but want to highlight the opportunities we all have to move thoughtfully but expeditiously to a more stable place.\nGiven all this, I believe a more proactive regulatory approach may be necessary. While the monthly reporting has been helpful, given the very short maturity of many of the assets, I believe the reporting should be more frequent to avoid the possibility of \"window dressing\" at the end of the month. Also, reducing a fund's maximum permissible exposure to any one firm could reduce the potential loss that would occur from a credit event involving only one counterparty. Consideration might also be given to whether the assets of riskier firms (for example those with very high market credit default swaps (\"CDS\" ) prices are appropriate investments for MMMFs, which are expected to maintain a low risk profile.\nThere have been a variety of proposals recommending more substantial changes in this arena. However, three years after a systemically significant episode, no one proposal has been settled on.\nMy own preferred approach would be to require MMMFs to have a meaningful capital-like buffer that exceeds, for example, their single-issuer concentration exposure limits - perhaps on the order of 2 to 3 percent - that, if violated, automatically leads to a fund's conversion to a floating net asset value. Examples of how to structure such a buffer include having the MMMF's sponsor directly fund the creation of the buffer, or creating a separate class of loss-absorbing shares that could be marketed to investors willing to bear some risk in exchange for a higher return than that provided by the stable value shares. If in some appropriate period of time a satisfactory plan for such a capital buffer is not produced and accepted, then those prime funds would be required to float their net asset value.\nAll in all, though, given the systemic importance of the MMMF industry, it is critical that one way or another we make the industry less susceptible to credit shocks and liquidity runs. While many in the MMMF industry have been reducing their exposure to troubled financial institutions, some continue to take what some observers might consider outsized credit risks. The experience of 2008 showed the potential for a MMMF's problems to precipitate redemptions that are ultimately destabilizing to short-term credit markets, and contribute to economic difficulties. I am certainly not predicting any such outcome but noting that policymakers, market participants, and the industry can and should make steady progress on these matters.\nForeign Branches and Agencies in the United States\nThe consideration of MMMFs is intertwined with another issue of systemic risk that I would like to discuss - the dependence, to a large degree, of foreign branches and agencies in the U.S. on short-term wholesale funding.\nLet me first note that while I will raise some concerns in this arena, we are beginning to address them within the existing statutory framework. However, over time other structural remedies may be warranted and possible.\nUnlike domestic banks or foreign bank subsidiaries in the U.S., foreign branches and agencies are not allowed to have U.S. deposit insurance and thus cannot rely on insured retail deposits as a funding source. In addition, foreign banks are ineligible for membership in, and receiving secured funds from, the Federal Home Loan banks - which have been an important source of liquidity for many domestic banks. As a result, they are especially reliant on wholesale funding - that is, raising funds by issuing jumbo certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements; all of which during times of stress are less stable than typical retail deposit accounts.[Footnote 9]\nParenthetically, I would note that foreign branches are not required to directly hold any capital with their U.S. operations. I will say more on this in a moment.\nWhile wholesale funding is an important part of a bank's liability structure, an excessive reliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance long-term assets can be problematic. In particular, in situations where wholesale financing is not available, foreign branches can find it difficult to raise required dollar funding and the foreign parent may not be able to fill the funding gap effectively. This is one of the reasons why foreign banks were among the most aggressive users of the Fed's liquidity facilities and Discount Window in the wake of the run on MMMFs in the fall of 2008.\nForeign branches and agencies utilize wholesale dollar deposits for two main purposes. First, they use the short-term wholesale deposits to fund longer-term U.S. dollar bank loans and securities holdings. They frequently fund large corporate borrowing needs. Second, the branches are often used to raise dollar funding for their global parent. Thus, branches frequently provide longer-term funding to their parent to fund dollar assets the parent is holding outside of the branch.\nI will say a fair amount about foreign branches today, so I want to stress that the focus stems from the important and useful function that they serve as a source of finance in our global economy.\nFigure 9 provides the major components of foreign branch assets. These are principally loans and leases and securities holdings such as high-grade corporate securities. In addition, you can see that foreign banks have been attempting to increase their liquidity in case their access to wholesale funding becomes constrained - as reflected in the sharp increase in cash and bank reserves.\nFigure 10 provides the major components of foreign branch liabilities. Roughly 75 percent of branch liabilities are generated by jumbo deposits, commercial paper and other borrowing, including financing through repurchase agreements. One of the primary sources of these funds are the MMMFs.\nUsing shorter-term wholesale funding (in branches) to fund longer-term assets held by the branch or the parent proved problematic in the fall of 2008. The investor run on money market funds forced the funds to stop acquiring new (and \"rolling over\" existing) jumbo deposits and commercial paper, causing a serious funding problem for the issuing entities. Short-term credit markets became severely stressed, requiring significant government intervention to restore liquidity to the market.\nConcerns over problems in Europe are once again posing a problem for the strategy of short-term wholesale funding of longer-term U.S. dollar assets. Despite the large supply of bank reserves I mentioned earlier, a reduction in MMMF financing has once again resulted in a problem for wholesale dollar funding. The recent announcement of several central banks that they would provide longer-term dollar financing has once again highlighted that short-term credit markets are, in my own opinion, overly dependent on structures that are highly sensitive to credit and liquidity conditions. Over time it will be important to get to a place where adequate funding flows do not require official intervention during times of stress.\nAs with MMMFs, a greater focus on financial stability should cause a re-evaluation of structures with no direct capital and a clear reliance on rolling over short-term liabilities to fund longer-term assets. The foreign branch system is important because of the role it plays in U.S. credit markets and also because of the dollar funding it facilitates for foreign banks, facilitating global commerce. However, it does suffer from some of the same problems as the money market funds.\nThere are a number ways to try to reduce these liquidity problems associated with the current branch structure. Clearly this issue requires much careful thought and analysis, so what I'll suggest today should be viewed only as examples of possible approaches that could be taken.\nOne supervisory approach could be to preserve the current branch structure but take steps to reduce funding risks in various ways.[Footnote 10] It may be advisable to require greater liquidity from global parents. And I would note that several of the Basel III Capital Accord's liquidity measures will make reliance on wholesale funding less attractive.[Footnote 11]\nSecondly, regulatory approaches that have been taken in some countries require foreign branches to hold capital, or require all bank operations to be under a separate holding company structure with capital to support the entirety of domestic operations in the country. Requiring capital for all domestic operations of foreign banks has costs.[Footnote 12] But it is one option, worthy of study.\nBoth of these approaches would in all likelihood cause firms to reconsider whether a more stable funding model - for example a more stable mix of funds including wholesale, insured, and longer-term debt - could be superior to purely wholesale funding.\nWhile we should actively consider a variety of options, my personal preference would be to move towards all foreign banking operations requiring some form of bank capital. This approach could reduce the liquidity crises that have occurred episodically, and could also address the possibility that as some banks have become large relative to the size of their countries, it could be difficult for parents to back up branches during a crisis.\nAll in all, I would suggest that the financial stability issues raised in 2008, and which have become increasingly prevalent of late, require a reexamination of issues that influence the stability of short-term credit markets.\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum and in conclusion, short-term credit markets have become increasingly susceptible to rapid shifts in sentiment - shifts that can create global liquidity problems. The structure of MMMFs, even with improvements that make them less at risk of runs, can still cause problems - for example if MMMFs move assets quickly out of certain segments of wholesale funding markets. This could happen because of increased credit concerns on the part of either money-market investors or money-market managers.\nAnd foreign banks that have become dependent on MMMFs and other sources of wholesale funding are another concern. As in 2008, now in 2011 we are seeing dollar shortages as MMMFs shun some financial institutions with various exposures to troubles in Europe - a situation that is having a negative impact on short-term credit markets.\nAll in all, the global banking system currently remains more vulnerable than it should and could be. And more than just the liquidity structure is problematic. Some global banks appear to have lost the confidence of more than the MMMFs. Share prices have fallen dramatically for some bank stocks, and credit default swap prices for some global banks are at elevated levels.\nBank supervisors worldwide may do more to utilize these market signals when deciding whether banks should be allowed to issue dividends or make share repurchases. Using market triggers as well as capital triggers to prevent capital from leaving the banking system (or to bolster it as necessary) during times of stress should be revisited. Should market assessments be wrong, banks would only have deferred dividends or share repurchases. They could be resumed at a higher level once the problems are resolved. Furthermore, using publicly observed signals to trigger a cessation of dividends may have less of a market impact than dividend reductions based on management judgment.[Footnote 13]\nAllowing dividends and share repurchases to occur when the risk of a crisis is high allows scarce capital to leave the banking system at a time when it is most needed. Such a policy risks that taxpayers, debt holders, and the economy will suffer should bank capital be insufficient to weather the crisis.\nIf market triggers were hit and bank supervisors became concerned about credit availability from the financial system, in certain circumstances they could choose to suspend dividends and stock repurchases for all systemically important banks. This would retain capital in the banking system and allow the stronger banks to continue their important role as financial intermediaries at a time when some of their peers are constrained by their financial problems. While Basel III has proposed dividend reductions as capital becomes depleted, I suspect that is likely to be too late, given the slow pace at which accounting losses are realized.\nIt has become clear that financial stability is too central to the performance of economies not to explore options for moving forward and reducing instability. We need to move constructively and prudently to a better place, and I believe we can and should.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Economic Outlook Seminar Stockholm, Sweden\nIt is a great pleasure to be in Sweden to participate in today's session on the current economic outlook and tomorrow's conference on capital markets in the post-crisis environment. It is vital that policymakers and practitioners study and apply the recent lessons of the global economy and financial interdependence, so I am glad to be able to join you in these discussions.\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nOn a personal note, I should mention that my grandfather John Johanson left Sweden at the age of six, changing his name to Rosengren and joining his father - who was deploying what he had learned as a gardener in Sweden to open greenhouses in America. My relatives were able to take what they had learned in Sweden and apply it - with perhaps some variation - in the United States. In a similar way, there is much to consider about the economic experience in Europe and the U.S. over the past four years. What is similar? What is different? And what can be learned and applied?\nThe window into these broader questions that I would like to use today is housing. One of the hallmarks of the recent financial crisis, and subsequent economic disruption, has been the very significant role played by unusually large movements in residential real estate values, within and across countries.\nGiven our setting today, let me start by comparing U.S. and Swedish home price movements since 1995, shown in Figure 1. In the U.S., house prices increased steadily and reached a peak in 2006, before beginning an unprecedented decline - not just in selected regions of the country, but nationally - resulting in aggregate declines of more than 30 percent. In contrast, Swedish real estate prices increased even more substantially, and have not experienced any substantial decline. Indeed, they continued to rise after the global financial crisis.\nWhile the U.S. housing price decline was a nationwide phenomenon, there were relatively more severe declines in some parts of the country, such as the so-called \"sand states\" of Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and California. Figure 2 shows the home price declines in various metropolitan areas (a subset of those included in the S,P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite index) and the lines drop furthest and fastest for the metro areas in Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and California.\nAs I talk with economists from countries whose housing values have risen markedly but not experienced sharp declines, I have been struck by two things. First, they are often confident that national (versus regional) house-price reductions are unlikely. And secondly, most assume that a decline in house prices would have a measured impact on the economy should that in fact occur. But the experience of Japan in recent decades and the U.S. more recently[Footnote 1] should provide some caution - given that the economic retrenchment that followed these significant declines in home values exceeded most people's expectations.\nWhile sustained rapid increases in house prices are frequently followed by significant declines, I am certainly not predicting price declines in any country, given my limited knowledge of market characteristics. But I do recommend a thoughtful consideration of the recent U.S. experience, given its severity and the fact that it was not foreseen. Indeed, while residential investment [Footnote 2] now comprises only 2.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the U.S., our housing problems have had a tremendously disproportionate impact on economic performance and on the recovery of growth and employment.\nI would like to discuss some of the reasons for that disproportionate impact today. By way of preview, let me mention that I plan to highlight the following points.\nFirst, while housing is a small component of U.S. GDP, it is also quite volatile. Historically, an outsized proportion of U.S. economic growth in the first two years of a recovery from a recession is generated by residential investment. The sector is very responsive to monetary policy[Footnote 3] since the ability to purchase a home can be quite sensitive to the interest rate and the resulting cost of financing.\nSecond, the characteristics of a country's mortgage-finance market determine the impact that will come from a change in the rates directly influenced by monetary policy. In the U.S., most homes are financed by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, so a fall in long-term interest rates really only affects existing home owners to the extent they refinance. As a result, the U.S. gets less effect from the movement of short-term, monetary policy interest rates compared to countries where the primary mortgage financing instruments are floating-rate loans. In countries with this institutional feature, both new and existing home buyers get more immediate boosts from lower short-term rates. Figure 3 helps to illustrate this by showing the greater responsiveness of U.S. adjustable-rate mortgage rates to the target federal funds rate, versus 30-year fixed-rate loans.\nThird, many U.S. financial institutions have significant exposure to real estate, either through direct lending or through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, declines in real estate prices can have a substantial impact on the capital of financial institutions, which impacts their ability to finance not only the housing sector, but also other sectors of the economy.[Footnote 4]\nFourth, falling home prices have not only impaired the capital of many financial institutions, but in a very real sense have disrupted the transmission of monetary policy. This is because falling home prices have brought about a situation where the availability of credit is more important in many cases than the cost of credit. Borrowers may not qualify for lower rates - in other words, the credit might not be available to them - because their household balance sheet is weaker than prior to the recession, because the collateral values of homes and commercial real estate have fallen, and because lender perception of risks inherent in the economy and in collateral valuations has risen - all at a time when lenders' capital has been depleted.\nFifth, I will argue that changes in some housing policies in the U.S. could make it less difficult for monetary policy to affect the economy when housing prices have fallen.\nI will also discuss the actions taken last week at the FOMC to promote a faster recovery in the housing sector and the economy more broadly. I am very supportive of these actions.\nLet me stress that I know housing markets have critical institutional features that differ greatly across countries - including financing arrangements, mortgage insurance, the role of government, tax treatment, mortgage servicing, and borrower liability in foreclosure. This makes it difficult to generalize from the U.S. experience.\nWhat may be transferable, however, is the observation that sharp declines in housing prices can have additional negative effects, with broad implications for macroeconomic outcomes and monetary policy - broader, perhaps, than may be assumed and incorporated into most statistical models of the economy. I don't intend to talk about whether housing prices will fall, but rather want to emphasize that when they do fall the effect on the economy is often much greater than many people expect.\nLet me pause to mention at the outset that a number of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve are studying and speaking about these important issues. Most recently Elizabeth Duke, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors and herself a former banker, spoke at the Board's Policy Forum on the Housing Market Going Forward and I recommend her address to you.[Footnote 5] I share Governor Duke's view that in the U.S. we \"currently have a housing market that is so severely out of balance that it is hampering our economic recovery.\" I may not be as convinced as she is about one possible remedy - that banks may be suitable landlords upon converting foreclosed properties to rentals - but I recommend absorbing her perspectives on things that can be done in the near term to help the housing market stabilize and rebalance.[Footnote 6]\nAlso, colleagues at the Boston Fed including Paul Willen and Chris Foote have done a great deal of empirical work on these issues, and are exploring the key institutional characteristics of the housing market that play important roles in the current problems. Among other things, they are working on estimates of the macroeconomic effects of possible refinancing plans.\nThe Role of Housing in the Slow U.S. Recovery\nThe decline in housing prices has created a multitude of difficulties for the U.S. economic recovery. I would like to provide some evidence of the problem, and discuss its origins.\nThe housing sector in the U.S. played a major role in the recent financial crisis, and in making the recovery from the resulting recession so anemic. In the U.S. we had seen regional declines in home prices during previous recessions, but had not seen a national decline in house prices in the post-war era. So for most lenders, investors, and homeowners, the sustained and substantial decline in home prices was not anticipated. Even sophisticated investors had placed only a very small probability on such a correlated decline. A key lesson from the past several years is that homes are not riskless investments - and that highly rated, regionally-diversified mortgage securities do not necessarily carry low risk.\nAs mentioned earlier, even though residential investment is a small share of GDP (today only 2.2 percent), it is quite interest-sensitive - it can decline quite dramatically as interest rates rise, and expand quickly when interest rates are relatively low. So it has been a disproportionally important part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.\nIn the current situation, however, U.S. mortgage rates are quite low but residential investment has not been the engine of growth that it normally is in economic recoveries. As shown in Figure 4, exports have been a source of strength in the first two years of the U.S. recovery, and business fixed investment has grown at approximately the same rate in this recovery as in the previous three. Yet the household sector has been particularly weak. Consumption, which accounts for approximately 70 percent of U.S. GDP, has grown only about half as much in the first two years of the recovery as it did in the previous three recoveries. And the shortfall for residential investment is even more striking. In the previous three recoveries, residential investment grew over 30 percent on average in the first years of the recovery - but has actually decreased in the first two years of this recovery.\nFigure 5 explores this pattern further by showing the contributions to total GDP growth that residential investment has provided in the first and second years of recent recoveries. In the past three recoveries, residential investment on average contributed more than 20 percent of GDP growth in the first year and 10 percent of growth in the second. So in the typical recovery, residential investment contributes much more to growth in the first two years of the recovery than would be expected given its share of GDP. This reflects the fact that interest rates generally fall during a recession and the initial stages of a recovery - and residential investment is usually quite responsive to interest rates.\nIn this recovery, residential investment was only a small share of the growth in the first year of the recovery and declined in the second year. So the unusually slow recovery is, in part, due to the uncharacteristically muted response of residential investment to very low interest rates.\nMore than one observer has commented that we are seeing a different pattern this time that equates almost to a \"negative feedback loop.\" High unemployment leads to risk aversion, which decreases demand for new housing. But without construction activity we are not seeing the typical uptick in housing-related jobs.\nHaving said a bit about residential investment and the slow recovery, I would like to now touch on other problems that stem from the decline in housing prices. Because residential investment is not the only facet of the economy that is affected by the drop in home values.\nIndeed, the decline in housing prices has contributed to a sharp decline in household wealth. In fact, Figure 6 shows (in both dollar and percent terms) that there was a significant decline in household net worth from 2005 to 2009, and that it particularly impacted racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S.[Footnote 7] These insights are drawn from a Pew Research Center study that used data from the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation.[Footnote 8]\nTo explore this a bit more, Figure 7 shows that while homes are an important component of net worth for Americans regardless of racial and ethnic group, African American and Hispanic households are particularly reliant on home values as a share of their wealth (between 50 and 60 percent, versus between 30 and 40 percent for White and Asian households in the U.S.). While stock prices have increased substantially from their crisis lows, those households whose primary source of wealth is their home have been disproportionately affected by the decline in house prices. And intuitively, households whose net worth has been significantly impacted are likely to reduce their consumption levels by more than households whose net worth has recovered.\nFigure 8 shows the erosion in home equity for U.S. households, again in both dollar and percent terms. Home equity is not only a source of funds to finance consumer purchases, but also frequently serves as a source of funds for individuals starting new businesses. With the decline in home equity, many entrepreneurs do not have that route available to finance start-ups or to expand existing small businesses.\nThe weak housing sector also has an impact on employment. Figure 9 shows that far fewer jobs have been created in the first two years of this recovery (the left bar in each pair) than in previous recoveries (the right bar in the pair). In fact, construction jobs have continued to decline during the first two years of this recovery - we have lost over a half a million construction jobs since the recovery began. While construction employment is typically volatile during a recovery, on average the sector adds roughly 150,000 jobs.\nIndeed, Figure 10 shows that employment in construction has declined by 9 percent in the first two years of this recovery compared to growth over 4 percent during the previous three recoveries. And weak construction employment and activity also reduces the demand for labor in sectors that support construction.\nFigure 11 highlights that the rate of mortgage delinquency in the U.S. has been much greater during this recession than in previous ones. Despite two years of recovery (albeit a very slow one), the mortgage delinquency rate remains well above the peak level seen over the previous 30 years. And Figure 12 shows that with significant foreclosures and a weak economy, both the housing vacancy rate and the rental vacancy rate remain quite high by historical standards.\nSo the problems in housing have greatly complicated the recovery in the U.S. Not only has residential investment been unusually weak, but \"to add insult to injury\" consumption, business formation, and employment have also been affected by problems in the housing sector.\nHousing's Impacts on the Policy Response\nMonetary policy in the U.S., entrusted to the Federal Reserve by Congress, has responded aggressively to both the severe recession and the weak recovery. Short-term interest rates were cut essentially to zero.\nHitting the so-called \"zero lower bound\" has certainly brought challenges to the ability of monetary policy to stimulate the economy. However, once the zero lower bound was reached, the Federal Reserve used a variety of tools to try to push down longer-term interest rates, as merited by economic conditions. Our efforts have included asset purchases both traditional (Treasury securities) and nontraditional (mortgage-backed securities). We have also altered our communications strategy. At the August FOMC meeting we announced that the Fed expects to maintain short-term interest rates (the target range for the federal funds rate) near the zero bound at least through mid-2013 unless there is a significant improvement in economic conditions relative to our forecast, and as long as the inflation outlook remains subdued.[Footnote 9] At the September FOMC meeting we announced a plan to extend the maturity of our holdings of securities and reinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The recent actions have helped lower long-term interest rates significantly, which is intended to promote growth in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing.\nFigure 13 shows that in the U.S. the 10-year Treasury rate, and 30-year mortgage rates, have reached historically low levels. Figure 14 illustrates that the combination of low rates and falling house prices significantly improved the affordability of homes.[Footnote 10] In addition, Figure 15 shows that both population and household formation in the U.S. have continued to rise over the past five years.[Footnote 11]\nThe problem is, while many households have been able to refinance and some new home buyers have taken advantage of the improved affordability of houses, falling home prices have made many unable to refinance, and many unable or unwilling to purchase a home. While the housing market would have been more severely impacted (and housing prices fallen more substantially) had the Federal Reserve not eased monetary policy aggressively, the impact of our policies on the economy has clearly been impaired by falling housing prices.\nMonetary policy would have had a greater impact if households were able to respond to the lower interest rates as if house prices had not fallen. The data can help one gauge the scope of the potential. The widely followed CoreLogic estimate is that as of the second quarter, 10.9 million, or 22.5 percent, of all mortgaged residential properties had negative equity, where the debt exceeds the value of the house.[Footnote 12] These so-called upside-down homeowners typically have a much harder time refinancing than owners with positive equity.\nAlong these lines, CoreLogic estimates that about three-quarters of owners with negative equity are paying \"above-market\" interest rates, which the company defines as rates above 5.1 percent.[Footnote 13] By contrast, slightly more than half of positive-equity owners are paying above-market rates. All in all, CoreLogic estimates that there are about 28 million borrowers who are paying above-market rates and thus might potentially benefit from a refinance.[Footnote 14]\nThere are several proposals that attempt to facilitate refinancing for homeowners who have been negatively impacted by the drop in housing prices. These proposals do face hurdles, including how to address private mortgage insurance and second liens. However, a program that made it possible for many homeowners to refinance, even if they were upside down, would likely provide significant reductions in mortgage payments to individuals who are likely to have a relatively high propensity to consume. Clearly getting more money into the hands of homeowners who would spend it could help to fuel GDP growth. This would reduce one of the impediments to a more significant effect from the monetary policy actions taken to date.\nI hasten to add that there is already a government program to allow underwater borrowers to refinance, the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). This program allows underwater borrowers with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans to refinance at lower rates. Unfortunately, the program has helped fewer borrowers than was originally hoped. Fed Governor Betsy Duke outlined some of the potential reasons why, in the talk I mentioned earlier. They include loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs) that raise interest rates for many borrowers and thereby reduce the benefit of refinancing; originator worries about \"buybacks\" forced on them by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; junior lien-holder resistance to re-subordinating their loans; and mortgage insurance policies.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is now investigating whether there are ways to enhance the program to benefit more borrowers.[Footnote 15] As this work proceeds, I hope the FHFA considers dropping or reducing LLPAs in cases when a GSE loan is refinanced into another GSE loan. Such a refinance actually reduces the GSE's credit risk (they already guarantee the existing mortgage and the homeowner will be able to take advantage of lower rates, freeing up cash flow).\nA second potential way to help resuscitate the housing sector would be to facilitate the reduction in the number of vacant homes.[Footnote 16] One way to do this would be to help responsible investors purchase vacant homes and then convert them into rental properties. Today, a majority of investor deals are financed with cash, which suggests that there is room for improvement in the financing of investor properties.\nA step in the right direction is a new loan product from Fannie Mae that allows a cash-out refinance of properties purchased with cash within the past six months, helping to \"recycle\" investor dollars through the market. But more could be done. Two possibilities include allowing investors to access FHA 203(k) purchase-rehab loans and increasing the cap on the number of Freddie Mac loans that are available to a single investor. In short, improving access to credit for responsible investors to purchase and improve properties would not only help provide affordable rental housing. It would also help to boost housing demand and limit some of the collateral problems from the large supply of vacant homes.[Footnote 17]\nA third way to help today's housing market would be to provide as much certainty as possible regarding future government policy in this area. The GSEs are likely to play a different role in the new system.[Footnote 18] The uncertainty has real effects on how well our current system works. A case in point concerns GSE repurchase requests on delinquent loans.[Footnote 19]\nFinally, I would like to be able to guarantee that the United States will never again suffer a significant house-price decline. But instead I can suggest some improvements that could make the housing market of the future more robust in the face of disruptive shocks. One suggestion concerns speeding up[Footnote 20] the resolution of delinquent mortgages that have no hope of becoming current again. The government's Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternative program (HAFA) is intended to speed the resolution of troubled homeownerships by offering monetary incentives to borrowers and servicers who agree to short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. But like the larger HAMP program, take-up rates for HAFA have been disappointing.[Footnote 21]\nThe ultimate solution may be to rethink the foreclosure process from the start, and economic theory could play a role here.[Footnote 22] By influencing the costs and benefits of non-foreclosure transfers, a new system of ownership transfer might better align the incentives of borrowers and lenders, while still protecting the legitimate property rights of homeowners. If so, society as a whole would benefit.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would reiterate that problems in the housing sector of the U.S. economy have been a major impediment to recovery. As you know, we took significant actions last week at the FOMC to promote a faster recovery in the housing sector and the economy more broadly.[Footnote 23]\nI am very supportive of the actions, which were designed to promote stronger growth and reduce unemployment rates, consistent with our dual mandate, by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and helping make financial conditions more accommodative. The actions announced last week involve extending the average maturity of our holdings of securities, by selling $400 billion of Treasury securities with maturities of less than three years, and purchasing $400 billion in securities with maturities of from six to thirty years. I would highlight that 29 percent of the securities being purchased are in the maturity range over 20 years.\nThe FOMC also announced that to support conditions in mortgage markets we will now reinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities, rather than purchasing Treasury securities.\nThere was a substantial market reaction to the announcement. Thirty-year Treasury yields declined by 18 basis points and thirty-year mortgage rates declined by 22 basis points that day - and fell further the following day.\nPictured in Figure 16 is the spread between the 30-year mortgage yield (a wholesale yield) and the 10-year Treasury yield. The spread illustrates in part what the Fed's actions are addressing - the upward movement in the spread since mid 2011 - and the market's reaction, a 17-basis-point drop in the spread, following the Fed's announcement. Since some of this action had been anticipated and already reflected in market prices, I view this as a very significant decline.\nWhile there are a variety of impacts that lower long-term Treasury and mortgage yields can have, certainly one is encouraging more refinancing and home purchases than would happen in the absence of action. In my own view, the Federal Reserve should continue to closely monitor spreads between mortgage and Treasury yields and consider taking action if that spread widens significantly, as it had recently.\nWhile the housing sector and the economy would have been weaker in the absence of the Fed's actions to lower rates, I believe it is equally important to examine housing policies that might be changed to reduce the impediments to monetary policy and more generally help facilitate recovery. There should be strong encouragement for the GSEs to focus on the housing recovery so home buyers and those that already have loans can fully benefit from the lower interest rates generated by our monetary policy action. Given that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently under conservatorship by the U.S. government, I believe they should play a larger role in achieving the public policy goals inherent in addressing these housing-market problems.\nWhile monetary policy cannot fully offset the many problems stemming from the recession, it can certainly mitigate some of the effects. A policy action that, for instance, reduces the unemployment rate by half a percent over time will not return the economy to full employment, of course, but will still mean 750,000 jobs that would not have been created in the absence of the action. Of course, carefully weighing the potential costs of additional action with the expected potential benefits involves a high degree of uncertainty, given we have not operated at the zero bound with falling housing prices in the post-war period. However, with unemployment at 9.1 percent and with inflation in the medium term expected to remain below 2 percent, monetary and fiscal policies should be focused on returning the economy to full employment.\nGiven what I have laid out today, let me close with this. We need to recognize the urgency of the situation and the broader economic implications of housing's continued struggles. All parties in these markets should redouble their efforts, given the broader economic effects and their painful toll.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Collaboration and Leadership in Smaller Industrial Cities Clark University Worcester, Massachusetts\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today in Worcester as we discuss the opportunities and challenges facing New England's smaller industrial cities.[Footnote 1] At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, we are very pleased to be collaborating with our co-sponsors in organizing this forum -the Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise, MassINC, and the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston.\nI would like to briefly frame the economic context that prevails as we gather today. I think the economic backdrop only underscores the importance of a practical and constructive forum like this one, and the need for collaboration and leadership - which are themes of particular focus at this event.\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nThe deep recession and slow recovery have had a significant impact on New England's cities. At the same time, we should note that our experience of late in New England has been less severe than that of the nation. The unemployment rate for New England in May, the latest month we have a regional number for, was 7.9 percent - high, but well below the 9.1 percent rate for the nation as a whole in May (a number that climbed to 9.2 percent in June). Many of our cities, particularly in the northern half of New England, have unemployment rates well below the national average. Also, many cities in New England did not experience the extremes of boom and bust in residential real estate that plagued some cities elsewhere in the country.\nAs the economy continues its slow recovery, there are significant opportunities but also daunting challenges facing our cities. But before discussing those opportunities and challenges, I would like to briefly describe the national economic outlook.\nThe National Economic Outlook\nAs we consider the national outlook, I would note that some have referred to the first half of this year as a \"slow patch\" in the recovery. I am not sure that phrase is quite right, however - the notion of a slow patch suggests strong growth that has been temporarily interrupted by some sort of headwind or shock, like natural disasters or extreme weather that crimps economic activity. I would instead describe the past two years as a consistently weak recovery, interrupted by a period of stronger growth. Let me add that a weak recovery like we have seen is, unfortunately, typical of recoveries after a financial crisis.[Footnote 2]\nFigure 1 shows growth in what we call real final sales, which represents the goods and services produced in the economy, not including inventories. If one assumes that the economy needs to grow faster than 2.5 percent - an estimate of what economists call its potential - to yield much improvement in the unemployment rate, you see that we have had only one strong quarter in this recovery (the fourth quarter of 2010).\nAlso, Figure 2 shows that consumers have been particularly tentative during the recovery. The only quarter in which we saw consumption growth in excess of 2.5 percent during this recovery was that same fourth quarter of 2010.\nIn short, the only quarter of strong economic growth so far in this recovery has been the one containing the holiday season at the end of last year. With housing activity and government spending likely to continue to be unusually weak for a recovery, we need to see consumer and business confidence improve so that consumption and investment can offset the weaker growth in other components of gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe first half of this year saw the economic recovery impacted by the tragic destruction in Japan, which disrupted manufacturing supply chains, as well as weather issues ranging from severe winter conditions to damaging floods. The result is that growth in the first half of this year is likely to be roughly 2 percent.\nAs the effects of these problems fade, we do expect a rebound in purchases of consumer durables to yield stronger growth in the third quarter. I expect economic growth over the second half of this year to average somewhere in the range of 3.0 to 3.5 percent. While this represents an improvement from the first half, it is still quite slow given the amount of slack in the economy, and slower than I had expected at the beginning of this year.\nWhile we are seeing some positive economic signs such as equipment and software spending, and growth in exports, the employment report issued last Friday was dismal. The national unemployment rate rose slightly (a tenth of a percent) to 9.2 percent in June. And net job growth was very weak over the last two months - job growth averaged only 21,500 over the two-month period of May and June.[Footnote 3] The employment-to-population ratio fell to 58.2 percent, matching the 28 year low that we have hit a few times in this recovery.[Footnote 4]\nNot surprisingly, with so much painful slack in the labor market we are not seeing any significant wage pressure - average hourly earnings fell slightly this month and have increased only 1.9 percent over the past year - which is consistent with a continued low inflation rate in the medium term. As Figure 3 highlights, wages are not likely to place much upward pressure on inflation since compensation is growing only slowly, given weak job markets. In addition, Figure 4 shows that many commodity prices have stabilized or retreated from their recent highs. These factors give monetary policy the leeway to remain accommodative, so as to provide the monetary conditions for improved economic growth.\nIn addition, there are significant downside risks associated with an outlook that includes only very slow improvement in the economy. The headlines from Europe continue to remind us of this. With fiscal austerity slowing down economies both here and abroad, it will in my view be important to maintain sufficiently accommodative U.S. monetary policy so that national labor market conditions can improve.\nOpportunities and Challenges for New England’s Mid-Sized Cities\nSo the national outlook is for a continued slow recovery, which of course factors into the opportunities and challenges for New England's mid-sized cities we have come together to discuss today.\nAlso, with widespread pressure for fiscal austerity not only impacting Federal budgets but also budgets at the state and local level, I think we should acknowledge the acute challenges that cities face in prioritizing expenditures to ensure that program cuts do not impair the ability of their communities to prosper over the long term.\nAs we think about their opportunities and challenges, I think it is useful to highlight some of the trends in New England's mid-sized cities relative to New England as a whole, and the nation. For example, Figure 5 highlights the differences in the populations of our mid-sized cities and the rest of the region and the country with respect to age, at roughly decade intervals. The most recent data suggest that New England as a whole now has a greater portion of people over 65 and a smaller portion of people under 15, and age 15 to 24, than the U.S. However, the residents of the region's small and mid-sized cities are on average younger than the rest of New England - with a smaller share of people over 65 and a larger share of people 15 to 24 than both the region and the nation. As for the portion of people under 15, these cities exceed the region and are basically on par with the nation.\nIn exploring these trends and characteristics, I would like to offer a few possibilities - in the interest of generating discussion today.\nFirst, it may be that younger workers \"just starting out\" are especially receptive to training for jobs in a growing sector. So this younger profile of our mid-sized cities, and the fact that they are often the site of medical facilities serving the surrounding communities, together highlight a potential opportunity. Many of the mid-sized cities may be able to build on their medical-services base. While medical employers require highly skilled doctors and nurses, they also hire a variety of other employees in positions that often require only an associate's or bachelor's degree. Indeed, our analysis suggests that the number of jobs in the healthcare industry as a percent of total jobs is much higher for these mid-sized New England cities than it is for the region as a whole, or for the nation.[Footnote 5]\nWorcester is a particularly good example of this, being home to hospitals, the University of Massachusetts medical school, and medical research firms. Other cities in the region have major medical facilities with spillover benefits to the broader community, including Providence (with Brown medical school and partner hospitals), New Haven (with Yale school of medicine and Yale-New Haven Hospital), greater Hartford (with the University of Connecticut Health Center in the Hartford suburb of Farmington), and Springfield (with Baystate Medical Center).\nTurning to educational characteristics in these cities, Figure 6 shows the percent of the population with a bachelor's degree or higher, and with some college education or an associate's degree - again at roughly decade intervals. New England has a much higher percentage of college graduates than the nation as a whole, but a smaller percentage of people with some college education or an associate's degree. In contrast, the mid-sized cities have a smaller percentage than New England or the U.S of people with a bachelor's degree or higher, or some college education or an associate's degree. The trend is up in these cities, however, over time.\nThis is particularly significant when we note that the unemployment experience over the past decade has been quite different when segmented by educational attainment, as shown in Figure 7. This is particularly true over the past several years, when the unemployment rates by educational attainment have widened significantly from where they were 10 years ago.\nAll this may suggest that community colleges can and should play a larger role in many of our mid-sized cities. Community colleges in New England have played less of a role in workforce development than in some parts of the country, where there is a very close connection between employers (and potential employers) and the curricula developed and offered at community colleges. As we think about future developments in our mid-sized cities, it is important that leaders at community colleges and local business leaders work together in the ongoing development of specialized curricula that will meet the evolving needs of local employers.\nFigure 8 shows that mid-sized cities in New England are increasingly diverse. Mid-sized New England cities have a much higher proportion of individuals who were born outside of the U.S. than the rest of New England or the country, and this has intensified over recent decades. These cities also have a much higher percentage of individuals who are not proficient English speakers. This highlights a potential impediment to getting higher education or some jobs.\nThe availability of English classes remains extremely important, and increasingly so. The same is true for providing greater access to government programs for those with limited English. For example, a working paper by the Bank's Ana Patricia Muñoz shows that small business entrepreneurship programs often do not target Latino populations.[Footnote 6] State and Federal programs designed to help fund or provide technical assistance to small businesses may need to increasingly tailor some of their programs to fit the needs of local populations.\nHowever, despite these challenges I believe that the diversity in our mid-sized cities can also be a decided advantage. Let me show another chart, Figure 9 which instead of foreign born and limited English speakers simply indicates the portion of the population that is Hispanic, and the portion that is African American. You see again that while New England as a whole may be less diverse than the rest of the nation, our mid-sized cities are more diverse -- and increasingly so over the decades. Finding ways for businesses to reach diverse populations is likely to become increasingly important as the country as a whole becomes more diverse, and as technology allows even small companies to reach markets in other countries. A product or service developed by or for a diverse population in Worcester or Hartford or another mid-sized city may be a first step toward accessing diverse markets in the U.S., or even globally.\nMoreover, developing successful entrepreneurs within a diverse population could of course be a source of local economic development. The Muñoz paper finds Latino businesses starting up in many of New England's mid-sized cities, and this can be a source of future job growth if some of these businesses can grow.\nFinally and importantly, I would observe that while New England has fared better than the rest of the country during the recession and the early stages of the recovery, the same is not true for our mid-sized cities, as shown in Figure 10. Unemployment rates are much higher in the mid-sized cities than they are in New England or the country as a whole, in contrast to 10 years ago when the unemployment rates in the region's mid-sized cities were below the national average.\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, our mid-sized cities are on average younger, proportionally less advanced in education, and more diverse than the rest of New England. This provides both opportunities and challenges, as I have noted.\nAs many of these cities are regional centers, further developing their activities as medical and educational centers will be important, particularly given their younger population compared to New England as a whole.\nA theme for this conference is the need to build collaborative leadership. Leaders in government will need to work collaboratively with leaders in education, the sciences, and businesses more generally, and find ways to take advantage of some of the differences we see in our mid-sized cities.\nI think we all know this, and the challenge is in finding the best ways to do so, to everyone's benefit. It is our hope that this forum will be one avenue for supporting and advancing that collaboration.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Keynote Remarks at the Stanford Finance Forum Graduate School of Business, Stanford University\nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today. I would especially like to thank Darrell Duffie for inviting me to Stanford to talk about financial stability. I am glad to be here to take part in this very constructive forum.\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nThe topic of financial stability is receiving increased attention in both academic and non-academic settings, as we all try to incorporate lessons from the financial crisis. The challenge of incorporating the lessons of the crisis is made more difficult, in part, because there is no one clear definition of financial stability (and instability).\nInterestingly, while the Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial stability, the term is never actually defined in the legislation. Perhaps the absence of a definition in the legislation reflects the reality that the concept is defined quite differently by different people. I should note that the new Financial Services Oversight Committee (FSOC) created by the Dodd-Frank legislation has been exploring defining the term.[Footnote 1]\nThe Dodd-Frank legislation seems primarily focused on addressing the failure of large financial institutions and payments systems, which was certainly a gap that warrants attention. However, a large interconnected failure is only one of several ways that a systemic problem can emerge. I believe the examples I will discuss today highlight the importance of focusing on systemic issues and not just the potential for large bank failures being disruptive.\nOthers - including some academics, politicians, and financial analysts - have argued that the pursuit of financial stability should address a variety of things such as volatility in financial markets, clustered failures of financial institutions, or asset bubbles (while at the early stages of their development). So it is important to clarify the definition.\nThe reason this is so important is that clarity of definition will help us frame the policy response - and identify what problems we will seek to solve and, equally importantly, what problems we will not. Knowing these parameters is in turn critical to identifying the needed supervisory and regulatory tools.\nSo, for the purposes of this talk I will provide my own definition of financial stability - one that I suspect can be helpful to the policy discussion - and then discuss how I would apply this definition, with some examples.\nFinancial stability reflects the ability of the financial system to consistently supply the credit intermediation and payment services that are needed in the real economy if it is to continue on its growth path.\nFinancial instability occurs when problems (or concerns about potential problems) within institutions, markets, payments systems, or the financial system in general significantly impair the supply of credit intermediation services - so as to substantially impact the expected path of real economic activity.\nTo summarize and perhaps simplify a bit further, my definition of financial instability has three key elements: problems in the financial system, impairment of intermediation (or the supply of it), and a substantial impact on the real economy.\nClearly the central theme is financial or credit intermediation services (and their supporting the real economy). So allow me to briefly define the critical role of financial institutions in such intermediation - a topic that has been central to much macroeconomic research over the course of the last 25 years, my own included.[Footnote 2]\nFinancial intermediation’s critical role in stability\nFinancial intermediaries like banks provide a critical function in the economy in that they essentially match borrowers and lenders - taking funds provided by depositors or investors, and lending those funds to individuals and firms that run businesses and employ people in the real economy, and thus have opportunities for higher potential returns.\nDepositors generally need frequent access to their funds, while the individuals and firms who borrow often want to use the funds for significant periods of time. So there is a so-called \"maturity transformation\" at work, from short maturity for depositors to longer maturity for borrowers. Also, while depositors want a nearly risk-free repository for their funds, borrowers' investment opportunities almost always entail credit risk. In this way financial intermediaries also perform a \"risk transformation\" - where firms with opportunities for higher potential returns obtain funds from investors and depositors looking for shorter-term, safer investments.\nThe financial intermediary must have expertise in identifying creditworthy investment opportunities, monitoring the investments, and obtaining the benefits of diversification. In normal times, the financial intermediary can provide depositors or investors access to their funds with little or no notice, because the intermediary draws its funds from a diversified set of depositors (with varied financial needs) who are unlikely - again, in normal economic times - to all demand their funds at the same time.\nSo financial intermediation is a vital service for a well-functioning economy, allowing the funds from many depositors to be pooled and channeled to riskier and longer-term investment projects that support real economic activity.\nThe opposite is also true - disruption of intermediation can have significant macroeconomic consequences. In their widely read book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff highlight that recoveries from crises in which financial intermediation has been badly disrupted can take much longer, and be more uneven, than recoveries from crises in which intermediation has not been impacted.\nImplicit in the definitions I have suggested is the notion that if individual financial institutions - or even groups of institutions - fail, but intermediation services are not significantly impaired, then financial stability is not compromised. This could happen, for example, if intermediation services were highly substitutable so that borrowers could switch to alternate intermediaries at little cost.\nAlso important is what is not included in my definition. For instance, there is no mention of asset bubbles. While asset bubbles likely were involved in the recent crisis, we should recognize that not all asset bubbles result in a disruption of financial intermediation. Asset bubbles would only impact financial stability as I'm defining it if key intermediaries use significant leverage to purchase the asset that's experiencing a bubble, and as a result are seriously compromised if the bubble bursts.[Footnote 3] In such a situation they might face balance sheet constraints that could significantly impair the availability of intermediation services and thus the future path of the economy.\nSo, not all asset bubbles reflect financial instability, but some do - if they affect institutions involved in vital financial intermediation for the real economy. In this way the topic of asset bubbles helps to illustrate how the definition of financial instability is important as we seek to understand the problems we are trying to mitigate, and the tools that are most appropriate for doing so. And another way the definition matters is that holding regulators and supervisors accountable only makes sense if there is a clear understanding of their responsibilities.\nThe rest of my remarks today provide some examples of how my definition of financial stability (and of instability) could be applied - and the implications.\nSome significant events may not yield financial instability\nI would first like to share a few examples that would not meet my definition for affecting financial stability or creating financial instability.\nMy first example involves silver prices. As I'm sure you know, the recent movement of silver prices has been quite dramatic. Figure 1 shows silver prices and is characterized by two dramatic movements. The first reflects an attempt to corner the silver market some years ago, when prices rose to nearly $45 per troy ounce before the popping of the bubble - followed by a nearly 75 percent decline. The second dramatic move is the rapid increase in silver prices from $17.65 per troy ounce in July of last year to $44.90 in late April of this year. Figure 2 focuses in on just this recent phase. Since hitting that peak, silver prices fell by just over 25 percent to $33.42 on May 17. As of last week silver was trading up slightly, at $36.14 an ounce.\nWhile this dramatic movement in silver's price highlights the risk and volatility to investing in commodities, it does not meet my definition of financial instability. Price volatility is very different than financial instability. Silver is a relatively small market, and leveraged financial intermediaries do not have an especially significant exposure to silver. So despite the dramatic price decline, there has been no trace of impairment in financial intermediation. So I would not view this as an instance of financial instability, as I define it, and would see no need to alter policy to respond to the price movements.\nMy second example involves the large numbers of failures of savings and loan institutions from the early 1980s to the early 1990s, as shown in Figure 3. A combination of poor supervision and poor management led savings and loans to be caught first in an adverse interest rate environment - they were borrowing short and lending long at a time of rapidly rising interest rates. As a result their capital became depleted, and many savings and loans increased their risk by taking on commercial real estate activities - resulting in widespread failures, and in some cases, quite dramatic losses. These losses were a significant problem for the deposit insurance fund.\nBut while this was a costly situation, did it constitute financial instability?\nUsing my definition, it did not. Savings and loan institutions were not the sole providers of credit to housing market participants. Many commercial banks were willing and able to lend to potential home buyers. In addition, securitization of mortgages had made it easier for borrowers to get financing regardless of the intermediary initiating the loan. I would point to Figure 4, which shows the spread between 10 year Treasury securities and 30 year mortgages with savings and loans failures in the background. There is no sharp break in credit pricing during that period, nor were there widespread complaints at the time of inability to obtain home mortgages. So, despite the large number of financial institutions that failed, there was not a severe disruption in the intermediation of mortgage credit, at least in the aggregate.\nMy third example involves the dramatic increase in \"dot com\" stock prices during the late 1990s, as shown in Figure 5. Stock prices rose rapidly for companies associated with the emerging commercialization of the internet. As you know, many of the companies had no clearly established revenue stream, leading many analysts to become concerned about a bubble. And in fact, the stock prices of many of those companies did fall dramatically.\nWhile the rapid decline of dot-com stock prices did result in a drop in wealth for those invested in the stocks, it did not have a significant impact on financial intermediation services - because generally speaking, banks and other key sources of intermediation were not directly exposed to dot-com stocks in a significant way. A shock to wealth can have a macroeconomic impact, but that can be addressed with traditional monetary policy. While there was a macroeconomic impact from the decline in the stock prices, the episode would not meet my definition of financial instability because it did not impair intermediation - in other words, it did not affect the ability of the financial system to provide credit.\nExamples of financial instability (and possible causes)\nI have been arguing here that there are examples of serious financial problems and dislocations that I would not consider examples of financial instability, as I define it. But there are, unfortunately, examples of financial instability that occurred recently, during the financial crisis and recession.\nAs I mentioned in my introduction, the Dodd-Frank legislation seems primarily focused on addressing the failure of large financial institutions and payments systems - which certainly warrants attention. But a large interconnected failure is only one of several ways that a systemic problem can emerge. The first example I would offer involves the experience of money market mutual funds (MMMFs) during the financial crisis, and it demonstrates that even a small financial intermediary can create financial instability.\nAs of August 2008 MMMFs had $3.5 trillion of assets, and funds had been flowing into MMMFs, as a result of problems at a variety of banks and other factors. But Figure 6 shows the daily change in money market fund assets in prime funds in the latter portion of 2008, and notes some of the key events of that era.\nIn the wake of the failure of Lehman Brothers, a relatively small MMMF called the Reserve Primary Fund experienced very substantial outflows due to investor concerns about its credit exposure to Lehman. While money market funds are highly regulated by the SEC and are supposed to hold high-quality liquid assets, investors were concerned that losses from Lehman would cause the Reserve Fund to \"break the buck\" (that is, redeem shares for less than one dollar).\nThe problems at the Reserve Fund not only caused funds to flow out of that fund, but also triggered large withdrawals from other money market mutual funds as well, as shown in the figure. Over the course of the week, over $300 billion was withdrawn from prime MMMFs, forcing the funds to try to quickly sell assets to meet redemption requests.\nNote that there are three major types of money market funds, as shown in Figure 7- funds that invest in tax-exempt securities, funds that invest in government securities, and prime money market funds that purchase a wide variety of debt instruments. It was the prime money market funds that posed the most severe problem during the crisis - and which still pose a problem today (as I will discuss in a moment). While some of the assets in the prime funds, such as Treasury securities, could be readily sold, others such as asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) were not easily sold given the prevailing harsh market conditions.\nThe rapid withdrawal of funds from prime money market funds not only represented a crisis of confidence, but also began seriously disrupting credit markets where MMMFs were the major buyers.[Footnote 4] Interest spreads on asset-backed commercial paper, shown in the top panel of Figure 8, rose dramatically. The bottom panel shows that asset-backed commercial paper could only be issued in very short maturities. The percent of issued paper maturing in one to four days leapt from roughly half to over 90 percent.\nIn response to these short-term credit disruptions, the U.S. Treasury announced a plan to insure MMMF shares,[Footnote 5] and the Federal Reserve System announced an asset-backed commercial paper MMMF liquidity facility. The facility, operated for the System by the Boston Fed, allowed money market funds to sell asset-backed commercial paper to banks - the MMMFs could use the sale proceeds to meet redemption requests - and the asset-backed commercial paper was pledged by the banks to the Fed as part of a loan from the Fed, which was ultimately paid back with interest. In addition, over time other facilities were created to address disruptions in short-term credit markets.\nThe money market problems that disrupted short-term credit markets highlighted that financial instability could be created by even a small money market fund if its problems created doubts about other funds' ability to redeem investors' funds at stable net asset value. In a situation like this, we should note, the weakest link in the financial stability chain might be small, rather than large, financial intermediaries. This problem with promising stable asset values despite some credit risk was what in this example impaired financial intermediaries (the MMMFs), seriously disrupted short-term credit markets, and had a large impact on the ability of firms to acquire short-term debt financing.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has tightened requirements on money market funds.[Footnote 6] While this represents an important step forward, I will digress for a moment on this issue as it relates to our topic today, financial stability. Despite the regulatory changes that have occurred, MMMFs still remain vulnerable to an unexpected credit shock that could cause investors to doubt the ability to redeem at a stable net asset value. I am certainly not predicting such an outcome, but I believe we all do well to recognize and address this vulnerability.\nI do think it would be particularly prudent to address this issue now, as money market mutual funds have the potential to be impacted should there be unexpected international financial problems emanating from Europe. Consider that many (but not all) MMMF's have sizeable exposures to European banks, by virtue of holding the banks' short-term debt. This means some MMMFs are potentially sensitive to a disruption in the European banking system, should one arise from the fiscal and sovereign-debt problems we are seeing in some European countries.\nConversely, I would note that European banks are reliant on the MMMFs - which are a major source of their dollar-funding needs. This latter point is worth noting as we carefully and responsibly examine this set of issues - because it means, for instance, that a regulatory change that reduced the debt holdings of European banks by prime money market funds could (as an unintended consequence) necessitate corresponding changes in European dollar-funding strategies.\nWhile there have been various proposals to address this issue - for instance allowing the asset values of the funds to float, or requiring capital be set aside in the event of a credit shock, or requiring a source of strength from a parent company or an insurance contract - no one solution has been settled on that would cure the type of problem that occurred with the Reserve Primary Fund in the last financial crisis.\nSo in my view, any solution needs to address the potential impact of unexpected credit losses, the risk that investors might rapidly withdraw their funds to avoid any loss, and the operational convenience that MMMFs provide as a transactions account vehicle.[Footnote 7] Despite these challenges, the set of issues surrounding MMMFs is in sum a vulnerability that needs to be addressed. Forums like this one serve an important role in allowing us to underline issues like this that need focused and constructive attention.\nFinancial instability may occur without the failure of a financial intermediary\nReturning to my examples I would say that another vulnerability is the risk that common, widely-held exposures could cause intermediation services to be cut simultaneously, even without a failure of any large intermediary. For example, if banks experience a common shock to collateral values or experience similar credit losses, banks that are capital-constrained may shrink their lending in an effort to satisfy binding capital-to-assets ratios. (As a reminder, loans are assets on a bank's balance sheet).\nThis type of problem is illustrated by the difference in the lending behavior during the recent crisis and downturn of banks with strong supervisory ratings, and those with weak supervisory ratings. Figure 9 shows that commercial and savings banks with weak supervisory ratings shrank lending during the first year of the recession. Banks experiencing large losses are often reluctant to raise additional capital - either because it could signal financial problems or be perceived as an attempt to avoid diluting existing shareholders. Instead, firms that choose not to raise additional capital often satisfy capital-to-assets requirements by shrinking their assets, and more importantly for the real economy, reducing their willingness to lend.\nIf this behavior is widespread, it can significantly reduce credit intermediation. Earlier in my career I studied this dynamic with my colleague Joe Peek, and our research found such behavior during the credit crunch period in the United States during the 1990 recession[Footnote 8] and during the Japanese banking crisis.[Footnote 9] This dynamic forms one explanation for why recessions that are accompanied by problems at financial intermediaries tend to be deeper recessions, followed by slower recoveries (again, the point that Reinehart and Rogoff discuss).\nIndeed, a look at the last three recessions suggests significant tightening of credit and slow recoveries. While I mentioned earlier that the mortgages issued by savings and loan institutions were easily substitutable, the same cannot be said of commercial lending. Figure 10 shows the declines in commercial loans in relation to the last three recessions. The headwinds in monetary policy that became a concern in the 1990s primarily reflected reduced business lending, as commercial banks became capital constrained as a result of large commercial real estate losses.Figure 11 shows the rise in the net percent of loan officers reporting tighter lending standards in relation to the recessions, as well.\nAll this leads to something of a conundrum. Higher capital requirements (higher ratios of capital to assets) can reduce the probability of an institution's failure - but a lower risk of banks' insolvency does not necessarily prevent a credit crunch.\nA potential solution, being advocated in Basel III proposals, could be requiring banks to hold a buffer above the minimum capital requirements, which can be drawn down during times of credit crunches - but with the expectation that the capital would not be rebuilt by shrinking the institution's loan portfolio. However, for credit crunches to be avoided this source of capital needs to be set apart as something of a \"shock absorber,\" and not be viewed as just a higher capital ratio that incents reduced financial intermediation when the buffer is breached.\nFinancial instability when a large, interconnected intermediary fails\nMy third example of instability involves the failure of Lehman Brothers, which in my view highlighted the importance of understanding the interconnection of financial firms. Interconnectedness occurs in a variety of ways:\nThe most direct way involves those who have an immediate credit exposure to the firm. As an example, the failure of a large financial firm could create a credit loss that could generate runs on money market funds broadly – a linkage that was probably not sufficiently appreciated prior to the financial crisis.\nA second form of interconnectedness involves the opaqueness of financial firms, which makes it difficult to determine counterparty exposure or whether similar exposures exist at other financial firms. During the crisis, investors started retreating from financial firms generally, as shown in the substantial widening of the liBOR/OIS spread (Figure 12) as banks became suspicious of counterparty exposure to even some of the largest global financial intermediaries.\nA third manifestation of interconnectedness involves the criticality of firms that are significant market makers, because when they experience troubles broader intermediation services can be impacted.\nA fourth form of interconnectedness involves the increasing global nature of large financial intermediaries, which greatly complicates resolutions of such firms should they fail. The incentive for host countries to “ring fence” liquidity and capital, and the legal uncertainty surrounding global failures, together provide incentives that might not be compatible with orderly resolutions.\nWhile the role of interconnectedness is much better appreciated now than prior to the crisis, it is still very difficult to get good \"measures\" of it. Academics and regulators need to spend more time understanding what data might be useful, and how it can be readily ascertained and updated.\nAssuming interconnectedness can be measured, it is important to understand how that information will be used. For example, should highly interconnected firms have higher capital requirements, to reduce the probability that they become insolvent? Should banks be required to disclose measures of interconnectedness to bank supervisors - or in public statements? And what role can stress tests play in understanding how a failure of a large firm impacts other firms?\nConcluding observations\nIn conclusion I would just emphasize that financial stability was not clearly identified as the responsibility of any particular regulatory authority prior to the financial crisis. Under the Dodd-Frank legislation a group of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, is now tasked with providing financial stability oversight. However, as I noted at the outset, financial stability was never defined in the legislation. This leaves some ambiguity on how broadly or narrowly financial stability should be defined.\nIn this talk I have tried to provide a relatively simple definition of financial stability and instability, and have provided some examples of how the definition could be used in various circumstances. The examples of potential financial instability emanating from money market mutual funds and commercial banks highlight, in my view, that much work remains to be done if we want to significantly reduce the likelihood of impairment of critical financial intermediation services - the sort of impairment that could substantially impact economic activity.\nI know we all want to work to make progress in this area, and I hope my remarks today help advance the cause.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Financial Stability Institute, Bank for International Settlements\nGood morning. I would like to thank Josef Tosovsky and the Financial Stability Institute for inviting me to speak today on financial stability and on regulatory and supervisory priorities in the United States. I would also like to thank Sergey Ignatiev and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation for hosting this very important event. [Footnote 1]\nI think it is crucial that we continue to share perspectives on financial stability and related issues.[Note] Clearly the events of the past four years have heightened our awareness of how interconnected our economies, our financial institutions, and our financial markets have become. When large global financial intermediaries become troubled, it impacts not just home country borrowers and, potentially, taxpayers; but increasingly can also have collateral impacts on host countries and their financial markets.\nMuch has been learned in the United States over the past four years about gaps in our regulatory and supervisory framework. One response to the gaps revealed during the financial crisis was the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. It ushered in significant changes and also required numerous studies to be undertaken, and new regulations to be considered and promulgated. Much of this work is still in process.\nSome of the most significant aspects of the Dodd-Frank legislation involve seeking greater clarity in the resolution procedures for complex financial holding companies that experience difficulties; creating a Financial Stability Oversight Council; establishing a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intended to address gaps in consumer protection; and increasing regulatory powers over, and focus on, systemically important financial institutions.\nA second major change resulting from the financial crisis has been a reappraisal of the quantity and quality of capital needed to avoid a reoccurrence. This matter is clearly critical to the Basel III discussions taking place here over the next two days; but, I would note, has already been the focus of two supervisory exercises conducted in the United States.\nAs I will describe in more detail in a moment, during a financial crisis investors focus on how much \"core\" or \"pure\" capital exists in an organization to absorb immediate and near-term losses.[Footnote 2] Some of the broader definitions of capital include elements that are not actually readily available to absorb losses. Capital meeting the broader definitions was largely ignored by investors during the intense phases of the crisis, leading to significant financial runs and liquidity problems at institutions whose capital, using the broader definitions, actually satisfied existing regulatory standards. As conditions deteriorated, market focus shifted from the relative strength implied by regulatory capital ratios to the vulnerabilities associated with deteriorating measures of \"pure\" capital. This led to greater uncertainty and ultimately to liquidity stresses.\nThe experience in the United States during the crisis is instructive as we think about where we should focus our attention in terms of bank capital, as well as in terms of supervision. On the latter, I would note that stress testing has proved to be an important supervisory tool in the United States for judging the quality and quantity of capital.\nBefore delving into the details, I'd like to give you a preview of my main points:\nFirst, I would like to discuss capital and the financial crisis, and will suggest that many U.S. financial institutions did not have the quality or quantity of capital needed to withstand the shocks we recently experienced.The focus in Basel III on improving the quantity and quality of capital at financial institutions – particularly systemically important financial institutions – is critically important.\nSecond, I will suggest that we should be particularly focused on narrow definitions of capital, which are what investors focused on during the financial crisis.\nThird, I will suggest that stress tests are an important supervisory tool that should be used for prudential and macroprudential [Footnote 3] supervision as well as for management’s own capital planning efforts.The rapid recapitalization of many financial institutions in the United States greatly benefitted from the attention during supervisory exercises (including stress tests) on the quantity and quality of capital.I will also discuss the evaluation of discretionary capital distributions (such as increasing dividends, and stock buybacks).\nCapital and the Financial Crisis\nI think it is instructive to look at the capital ratios of two of the very large banking organizations that encountered problems and were acquired during the financial crisis.\nWachovia was one of the four largest banking organizations in the United States, with total assets in 2008 exceeding $700 billion. As a result of large exposure to subprime mortgages, partially as a result of an acquisition of a large California thrift, investors became concerned about the solvency of Wachovia. A loss of confidence in Wachovia led depositors, funders, and investors -\nthose on the liability side of the bank's balance sheet - to withdraw, pressuring the institution to sell itself. After a short bidding war between Wells Fargo and Citigroup, Wells Fargo prevailed and acquired Wachovia at the end of 2008.\nWashington Mutual or \"WaMu\" was the largest savings and loan holding company in the United States, with assets over $300 billion. WaMu had grown rapidly, with a large exposure to residential real estate and a large concentration of both variable rate and subprime mortgages. Large depositors became concerned about the solvency of WaMu in September 2008 and began rapidly withdrawing funds. The institution failed later that month (on September 25) and was acquired by JP Morgan Chase.\nFigure 1 provides the capital ratios reported in the last financial filing for both Wachovia and Washington Mutual. The most narrow definition of capital,[Footnote 4] tangible common equity, is a measure of capital widely used by investors (and increasingly so during the crisis) because it focuses on the \"core\" capital readily available to cushion the bank against losses. The tangible capital measure - specifically the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets - was a bit above 2 percent for Wachovia and about 3 percent for WaMu,[Footnote 5] providing only a small cushion against the losses accumulating from their subprime exposures.\nThe regulatory capital ratios use broader definitions of capital, relative to risk-weighted assets. To be considered adequately capitalized, a bank needs to have at least 4 percent Tier 1 risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets, and at least 8 percent total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets. To be well capitalized a bank needs to have at least 6 percent Tier 1 risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and at least 10 percent total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets.[Footnote 6] Figure 1 shows that under these definitions both banks were well capitalized in their final quarter - despite the fact that more narrow definitions of capital indicated only a very small capital buffer.\nFigure 2 plots the capital ratios for the period leading up to the \"run\" on Wachovia. The broader definitions of capital - Tier 1 and total risk-based capital - were actually rising in the period when holders of Wachovia's liabilities were becoming concerned, and thus the broader definitions of capital were not particularly informative. The more narrow definitions of capital - Tier 1 common and tangible common equity - were both declining fairly substantially.\nIn retrospect, the quality and quantity of capital was not sufficient for the kind of financial shocks experienced in the United States in the crisis. Under the Basel III proposals there is much more attention being given to the quality and quantity of capital. My own view is that this heightened focus is appropriate, and that the particular capital that truly serves as a cushion against losses during periods of stress should be regulators' primary focus.\nFigure 3 highlights that since the worst phase of the crisis, 15 large U.S. banking organizations that have reported continuously through the crisis have made significant progress in improving both the quality and quantity of their capital. The most narrow capital definition on the chart - the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets - has risen from a little over 2 percent to almost 6 percent. This reflects both significant raising of external capital as well as dramatic declines in dividends and stock buybacks during the crisis and the early period of recovery. Both of these dynamics have had a significant positive impact on the institutions' ability to withstand potential future stresses.\nFigure 4 illustrates the amount and composition of capital - the numerators of the various capital ratios - at the 15 large banking organizations over a four-year period. You can see that there has been an appreciable amount of common equity raised by this group of large banks.\nThe improvement in the quality and quantity of capital is quite striking. An important aspect of this recapitalization has been the supervisory use of stress tests to determine the adequacy of capital, and also in evaluating discretionary capital distributions (such as increased dividend payouts). The supervisory use of the stress tests is relatively new. It is worth noting and discussing the fact that it is not just capital regulation, but also supervision, that has been a driver of the recapitalization process.\nStress Tests and Improving the Quantity and Quality of Capital\nNow I would like to delve a bit deeper into the role that stress testing has played in encouraging more rapid recapitalization of U.S. banks, during the financial crisis and the early stages of the economic recovery. The U.S. stress test exercise was conducted from February to April of 2009 - a period of significant financial turmoil, when many private-sector analysts and academic observers had raised concerns about the financial condition of the U.S. banking industry. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (\"SCAP\" ) was designed to provide a rigorous assessment and, in doing so, to ensure that banks had sufficient capital to sustain additional losses and still continue providing critical credit intermediation should economic conditions deteriorate further.\nThe SCAP exercise was conducted with the 19 largest U.S. domiciled bank holding companies. Each bank holding company was provided a baseline economic scenario and a more stressful scenario. The scenarios were based on publicly available private forecasts and provided the assumed path for real GDP, unemployment, and house prices over the next two years. Using these assumptions, the banks were asked to provide detailed portfolio information so that projections could be made on losses in a variety of loan and security categories, potential trading losses for firms with large trading operations, pre-provision net revenue, and the allowance for loan losses - allowing for estimates of capital positions under each scenario.\nThe stress tests were interactive, and were quite resource intensive for both the banks and the supervisors. The banks' submissions were compared to a detailed portfolio analysis done by bank supervisors, and to statistical models intended to capture how key variables were likely to be affected by stressful conditions.\nWhile individual business-line stress tests had been done by bank supervisors, a comprehensive stress test of all the largest banks at the same time using the same scenarios was new. While conducting the tests simultaneously for all 19 banks was challenging and resource intensive, the exercise provided supervisors the ability to make comparisons across institutions using the same underlying assumptions, and allowed the same core supervisory staff to be involved in assessments across institutions. Where banks were outliers relative to peers, supervisors could ask for more detailed information to determine if these differences were justified, based on analysis of comparable data. In addition, the stress tests were forward looking, so that the evolution of performance and results over the next two years could be compared across institutions. This provided a rigorous, data-driven assessment. It also highlighted where institutions needed to do additional work relative to peers to improve their risk management practices.\nThe banks were evaluated on whether, over the two-year period under stress assumptions, they were likely to be able to maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent and a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 4 percent. It is worth noting that for most banks it was the Tier 1 common capital ratio that was most binding, and was the capital definition that best reflected the ability to absorb losses. Of the 19 banks, nine were sufficiently capitalized to meet the minimum capital ratios under stress conditions, while ten had a combined capital shortfall of $75 billion.\nThe banks with a capital shortfall were expected to provide detailed capital plans that included raising additional capital - by measures such as restricting payouts, raising new equity, selling assets, or utilizing capital available from the U.S. Treasury. Banks both with and without shortfalls aggressively sold assets and raised additional capital, resulting in a very significant recapitalization of the 19 banks over a relatively short period of time - as is apparent in the figures shown earlier.\nStress Testing and Discretionary Capital Distributions\nNow I would like to mention the role of other stress testing in decisions to pursue, and approve, the resumption of discretionary capital distributions. The SCAP was designed to estimate how banks would perform under stress conditions. However, the economic assumptions and the impact of those economic assumptions on financial institutions were by definition educated estimates of potential outcomes. By the end of 2010, many banks were noting that they had substantially recapitalized and in some cases were now well above regulatory minimums - and thus would like to resume or increase stock buybacks or dividend payments.\nTo evaluate the requests by banks to increase dividend payments, U.S. bank supervisors pursued an exercise known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), and stress testing was one component of that broader exercise. While the stress testing element was only part of the CCAR review, it was an important input into evaluating banks' capital planning. The assessment was conducted between November 2010 and March 2011. Once again the largest 19 U.S. domiciled bank holding companies were asked to participate, using a baseline scenario, their own stress scenario, and a supervisor-provided stress scenario (a set of macroeconomic assumptions consistent with an economic downturn).\nA critical benchmark was whether banks could meet a 5 percent Tier 1 common capital ratio under stress conditions over the next two years, assuming they paid dividends or carried out the stock buybacks as they proposed. Additional capital measures were examined, including the ability to satisfy over time the new Basel III capital ratios and changes in capital required by the Dodd-Frank legislation. Bank holding companies were required to provide information on their capital adequacy processes and capital distribution policies, and supervisors assessed them.\nConducting the analysis for all of these institutions simultaneously gave supervisors a good benchmark as to how the financial institutions were performing relative to a stress scenario. In addition to providing a method for evaluating capital assessments, the stress test that was one component of the broader CCAR provided an opportunity to determine how financial institutions had refined their ability to conduct stress tests and incorporated lessons learned from the SCAP. In that vein, these types of capital assessments are likely to be an important tool in understanding the capital planning process in the future.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion I would note that the financial crisis highlighted that financial institutions did not have the quality or quantity of capital they needed. In particular, the broader measures of capital were largely ignored during the crisis by many investors as they worried about the \"core\" capital immediately available to absorb losses. Thus the emphasis in Basel III on improving the quality and quantity of capital is an important regulatory response to the financial crisis. Clearly we need to focus on the narrow definitions of capital - that which can readily absorb losses.\nThe United States has also improved its supervision framework based on lessons learned during the crisis. One of the major additions to the supervisory \"toolkit\" was the use of stress tests - in the SCAP and then as an important component of the broader CCAR exercise.\nThe supervisory and regulatory responses have provided strong encouragement for U.S. financial institutions to improve their capital ratios, particularly those ratios most appropriate for absorbing losses during stressful economic periods. Through retention of earnings, asset sales, and new equity issuances, U.S. banks have substantially improved their capital ratios since the crisis period.\nThe severe disruptions and economic dislocations that occurred during the financial crisis - affecting not just institutions, but individuals throughout the national and global economy - highlight the critical need to maintain a well-capitalized and resilient financial sector. Bank regulation and bank supervision - not to mention management practices within financial institutions - all need to continue to evolve to ensure that during periods of economic or financial distress, organizations remain well capitalized so their role in credit intermediation is not disrupted.\nI hope the analysis and observations I have shared today can assist with a process of learning, evolving, and improving that will prevent future disruptions.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Remarks to the Massachusetts Chapter of NAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate Development Association\nI would like to thank David Begelfer and his colleagues at NAIOP Massachusetts for inviting me to join you today to discuss the economy and monetary policy.\nI am happy that financial markets and the economy have made significant progress since the depths of the financial crisis, but I am far less happy that the recovery to date has been so undesirably slow and anemic. In my reading of economic history this is, unfortunately, typical of economic downturns that are accompanied by severe financial disruptions.\nThe debate I'd like to focus on today is the one over the likely impact of recent increases in the prices of food and energy, and how monetary policy should respond.. [Note] The Fed's policy stance, as you know, is currently very accommodative - a stance that I believe is appropriate given the tentative recovery and still-high unemployment. But with food and energy prices rising, some observers think the Fed should shift its stance to less accommodation - slowing economic growth now to ensure we don't have undesirably high inflation in the future - even though current measures of core inflation (that is, inflation omitting volatile food and energy prices) remain low by historical standards.\nAs the recovery continues - albeit slowly - several events have occurred that further complicate the outlook for inflation and real economic activity. Political upheaval in the Middle East has contributed to sharply higher oil prices. Severe weather has reduced harvests from Russia to Australia, causing higher prices for many agricultural products. And Japan's tragic earthquake and tsunami caused not only terrible loss of life, but also disruption to a supply chain that is increasingly global.\nSo today I would like to discuss how monetary policy should react when the economy is buffeted by a series of these so-called \"supply shocks.\" I'd like to just highlight my major points before getting into the data and analysis that underpin my perspective.\nFirst, I want to explain that while I will be making distinctions in this talk between so-called \"core\" and overall or total measures of inflation, we at the Federal Reserve look at all prices, including food and energy prices, when developing U.S. monetary policy. While we often use core measures as a guide to where overall inflation is most likely to go, our goal is to stabilize overall inflation.\nAllow me to preview one of my conclusions. Because my analysis suggests that recent food and oil price increases have their roots in concerns about wheat harvests in Russia and oil production in Libya and the like, I do not believe that monetary policy is the appropriate tool to respond to these disruptions. While many observers see food and energy prices rising and assume the Fed should tighten policy - raise the cost of money and credit - to head off inflation, I would suggest taking a step back and recognizing that tighter U.S. monetary policy will do nothing to stabilize Libyan oil production, reduce uncertainty about political stability in the rest of the Middle East, or increase the wheat harvest in Russia.\nIn fact, tightening monetary policy solely in response to contractionary supply shocks would likely make the impact of the shocks worse for households and businesses. To see why this is so, it is important to keep in mind how supply shocks affect the economy.\nFirst, supply shocks can lead to increases in food and energy prices that slow economic growth. For example, because a person's need to drive may not be very flexible, spending on gas consumes a bigger portion of their budget. So an oil shock tends to force consumers to reduce their spending on other goods and services as they absorb higher oil costs. [Footnote 1]\nSecond, while the prices of goods directly affected by the supply disruption increase, other prices in the marketplace may be unaffected - at least initially. If the supply shock involves food or energy, this dynamic causes measures of total inflation to rise, but does not have a large impact on what economists call core inflation - which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors. But in the longer-run, the impact of the supply shock on the prices of other goods will depend importantly on how inflation expectations respond to the shock. If people expect that food and energy prices will stabilize - in other words, that the price shock will be temporary - and do not believe that the central bank will allow any long-run effect on inflation, then the disruption to total inflation will likely be temporary and the total inflation rate will eventually converge with the lower core inflation rate. Since 1986, this has largely been what happened when we experienced these types of supply shocks - as I'll illustrate in a moment with some charts.\nAlternatively, if expectations of inflation do rise in response to the supply shock, then (nominal) wages and salaries across the economy will be pressured to increase over time to keep pace. If that happens, the supply shock could affect prices throughout the economy - not just those that that were part of the initial supply shock. In this case, the core rate of inflation rises to converge with the higher measure of total inflation. This was the U.S. experience in the 1970s, for reasons I'll discuss in a moment.\nWe at the Fed need to very closely monitor the data to make sure that inflation remains contained. And we will. But as I believe I will demonstrate this morning, the most likely result is that these supply shocks cause slower growth in the near term while having only a modest effect on longer-term inflation rates - which has been the U.S. experience since 1986.\nUnemployment remains quite elevated, at 8.8 percent, and I anticipate a slower return to full employment than we would have experienced absent these supply shocks. With the core inflation rate over the prior year at a little above 1 percent, I anticipate only a gradual return of core and total inflation rates to something like our consensus \"stable\" rate of about 2 percent, over the medium term.\nIf the economic data continue to support this outlook then the current, accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and can remain in place and continue to support economic growth - so that we continue to make progress toward our goals of returning to full employment and a sustainable long-run inflation rate - the two elements of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate from Congress.\nThe Impact of Recent Supply Shocks\nNow that you know my basic take on this key - and current - economic debate, allow me to flesh out my perspective with the supporting data and analysis. The full impact of the recent shocks to supply that I mentioned at the outset will likely emerge over time. But clearly there have been significant increases in a variety of food and energy prices. As Figure 1 illustrates, the recent turmoil in the Middle East has contributed to a significant increase in oil prices, which have risen to over $100 a barrel. This is well above the average of nearly $80 a barrel experienced over 2010, but at the same time still well below the peak of $146 a barrel that occurred in mid July, 2008.\nThe recent volatility in oil prices, as the chart shows, is quite striking. Sharp increases have been followed by sharp decreases. This is one reason we may not want to overreact to price changes - they could be transitory.\nFigure 2 shows the movements in oil prices - their percent change from a year earlier, in the top line - relative to the change in compensation (the lower line), since 2000. Oil prices have risen recently, but based on the history captured in this chart, one would not expect much of a response in wages and salaries. This, of course, is one reason why consumers feel worse off after an oil supply shock. Prices at gas stations in Massachusetts are now around $4.00 a gallon, yet most people's need to drive cars has not changed much if at all. So income available for buying other goods and services has been squeezed by the increase in oil prices. [Footnote 2]\nSome softness in measures of consumer confidence suggests that consumers tend to be less confident about the future when oil prices rise. If consumers pull back spending as a result of a supply shock, it has the potential to be a drag on the economy. The Boston Fed's statistical modeling suggests that a $20 increase in the price of a barrel of oil will shave roughly four-tenths of a percentage point off the rate of economic growth over two years, and cause the unemployment rate to be roughly two-tenths of a percentage point higher than it would be absent the oil shock. While this is certainly not enough to completely stop the recovery, it does imply a slowing down of its pace.\nOil is not the only commodity to experience price increases of late. A variety of agricultural prices have also increased. For example, Figure 3 shows the movement of wheat prices over the last decade. Droughts in Russia, flooding in Australia, and increased demand in emerging markets have all placed upward pressure on wheat prices.\nAs with oil prices, higher food prices appear to be responding to supply and demand features of this market - and these types of price changes cannot be offset by monetary policy. It goes without saying that monetary policy cannot alter the supply of oil from volatile parts of the world, nor weather conditions in countries that are major exporters of agricultural products. Monetary policy can have a role in insuring that relative price changes do not alter inflation expectations. Rising inflation expectations could make it difficult to achieve a moderate and acceptable inflation rate over the medium term.\nHistorical Experience with Supply Shocks\nSupply shocks are not unique to this period. However, the evidence shows that the economic impact of supply shocks on inflation has changed over time - actually quite dramatically. Figure 4 shows the inflation rate (total inflation and core, which again excludes food and energy) since 1970. What is striking is the way the behavior of the two series differed in the 1970 to 1985 period versus the period from 1986 to the present. The interplay of core and total inflation is very, very different in the more recent period than it was in the former.\nI realize that delving into topics like total and core inflation can seem a bit abstract. So let me bring in something a bit straightforward - energy prices and inflation. Figure 5 shows the profound effect that energy prices had in the 1970s on core inflation. In the 1970s the lines move up and down together as core inflation increased with energy prices. That is why my earlier chart shows core and total inflation moving so closely in that era. But since 1986, dramatic movements in energy prices have not affected core prices.\nMy next two figures look at each period separately. Figure 6 shows that for much of that earlier period, inflation rates were much higher than they are currently. From 1970 to 1985, inflation was quite volatile - with total inflation (measured by the all-items Consumer Price Index or CPI) peaking at almost 15 percent, in 1980. The key observation is that during this period, increases in core inflation tended to follow increases in total inflation (which includes food and energy). The oil and food price increases \"pulled\" core inflation.\nIn contrast, Figure 7 shows the total and core inflation rates since 1986. During this period, inflation has been lower and less volatile. And unlike in the earlier period, core inflation does not follow or gravitate to the level of total inflation. Total inflation jumps up and down as food and energy prices live up to their reputation for volatility. The spikes are tough on households, to be sure. But importantly, total inflation eventually gravitates to the core measure that excludes food and energy. Core inflation stays \"moored.\"\nFigure 8 represents another way to use the available data to explore this relationship. It too shows that the increases in total inflation in recent years have generally been temporary. For each quarter from 1998 to 2010, the figure plots the difference between total inflation and core inflation at the time, and the total inflation rate two years later. What it shows is that when there is a supply shock such that total inflation (including food and energy) exceeds core inflation, two years later total inflation tends to be lower - when supply shocks such as oil prices drive up total inflation relative to core, the total tends to come back down toward the core inflation rate.\nFigure 9 performs similar analysis but focuses on the future core inflation rate, instead of the total. It shows no strong relationship. When total and core inflation diverge, core inflation tends to stay put. In other words, in recent years, when something like an oil shock causes total inflation to diverge from core, there was no consistent implication for the future core inflation rate. The shock to total inflation did not become embedded in core inflation.\nWhy is all this important? If supply shocks tend to have a transitory impact on headline inflation, and do not pass through to any meaningful extent into core inflation, then monetary policy need not respond to the price increases caused by the supply shock. Currently, we have experienced sharply higher food and energy prices. If the relationship we document over the last 13 years continues, we should expect the impact on inflation to be transitory - and that total inflation will converge back to core inflation, which remains well below 2 percent.\nTo digress, it is likely the case that supply shocks have become transitory because of the way in which monetary policy has tended to respond. So, as long as monetary policy behaves about as it has in recent years, then there is no reason to expect supply shocks to have lasting effects.\nSo is Fed policy behaving as it has since the mid 1980s? Interestingly, although Fed policy is perceived as exceptionally accommodative, because of hitting the zero lower bound the federal funds rate is actually higher - has come down less - than would be expected if the Fed behaved as it has over the last 25 years. The current level of the funds rate suggest that we have been less accommodative in recent years given that interest-rate reductions (policy easing) ran into at the zero lower bound. [Footnote 3]\nWhy the Different Reaction to Supply Shocks Over Time?\nBut how confident should we be that the relationship we have experienced over the past 25 years - little response in medium term inflation rates to supply shocks - will continue? The answer is rooted in why we are seeing different reactions to supply shocks - in other words a different interplay of total and core inflation - now versus in the past.\nThere are a variety of reasons why medium-term inflation has not been significantly influenced by short-run supply shocks in recent years. In my view the reasons include the increased role of services in the economy, the importance of labor costs in such an economy, the reduced share of oil consumption relative to GDP, and as I mentioned earlier the improved conduct of monetary policy versus the 1960s and 1970s. [Footnote 4]\nFigure 10 shows that the service sector has grown from a little over 60 percent of private sector employment in 1970 to a little over 80 percent in 2010. As the economy has come to emphasize services versus manufacturing, it may be that commodities (and thus their prices) have become somewhat less important to the production of goods and services. And goods prices are more volatile than services prices, and more likely to be priced like commodities.\nFigure 11 shows the per capita consumption of oil declining in the United States. Conservation measures by consumers and businesses have made the economy less dependent on oil than in the 1970s. While oil remains a very important commodity, the trend towards reducing dependence on oil provides greater insulation from oil-induced supply shocks.\nFigure 12 shows the U.S. share of world oil consumption (in blue) ticking down, but also clearly shows (in red) the steady climb in the share consumed by three of the so-called emerging-market economies - China, India, and Brazil. Figure 13 shows the growth in oil consumption in those three countries, in the upper three lines. Both charts depict quite strikingly the heightened demand for oil emanating from emerging markets.\nReturning to the U.S. and inflation concerns, Figure 14 shows that the growth rate of employee compensation has generally been declining over the past two decades. With compensation slowing and productivity increasing, many firms have been profitable and able to withstand increases in commodity prices without passing such costs on to final prices. This fits with the observation that higher food and energy prices have not tended to have much of an impact on prices in situations where food and energy are not direct costs of doing business.\nFigure 15 shows two measures of inflation expectations, plotted alongside oil price movements. The red line shows what professional forecasters expected inflation to average over the next 10 years, at various points in time. Their expectations have declined somewhat over the past 20 years, but what is striking is the relative stability of their inflation expectations. In addition, there was no significant reaction to the oil price shock that we experienced in 2008. The chart also shows a second measure of inflation expectations - the University of Michigan Survey (the green line), which asks respondents about their expectations for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years.[Footnote 5] Again these expectations are not very responsive to movements in oil prices, and have remained quite stable over the past two decades.\nIt is worth noting that countries can be affected quite differently by supply shocks. As Figure 16 shows, the importance of food in the \"basket\" of goods purchased by consumers can vary greatly by country. In less developed countries, food is a very significant component of overall purchases by consumers. In a developed country such as the United States, food is a much smaller share of overall purchases. Thus the impact of a food-supply shock on the overall inflation rate and on other important economic variables such as wages and total imports can vary widely by country. Given the different impacts of supply shocks, it is not surprising that monetary policy is likely to react differently to a supply shock such as food, depending on the unique characteristics of the particular country.\nFigure 17 shows that in the United States, the importance of food as a component of inflation measures has been declining over time. And, despite improvements in energy conservation that have lowered the per capita consumption of oil, higher energy prices have contributed to recent increases in the importance of energy in the consumer price index. The fact that food and energy prices have been quite volatile recently, but remain a relatively small part of the entire basket of goods, helps to explain why core inflation rates have not been particularly responsive to food and energy shocks.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I recognize that recent supply shocks have caused pressures on many household budgets, and have led some analysts and observers to become concerned about potential long-term inflationary impacts. However, I think the evidence shows that over the past 25 years most supply shocks have been transitory - and have had no long-lasting imprint on longer term inflation, or on inflation expectations.\nNonetheless, recent historical trends do not always continue, so it is important to monitor inflation dynamics very closely to make sure that this pattern is continuing in the incoming data. In particular, I will look intently at whether there is any evidence that the expectations of underlying inflation have changed. To date, expectations seem quite stable and show no evidence of diverging from the recent past. I am committed to responding decisively, and as forcefully as necessary, to ensure that long-term inflation expectations remain stable and that food and energy price increases are not passing through to other prices. . [Footnote 6]\nGiven the important role of labor costs in a developed, services-focused economy such as the United States, it is important to closely monitor trends in labor markets. Currently, wages and salaries are reflecting heightened unemployment, and show no evidence that potential inflation concerns are placing upward pressure on wages and salaries.\nCore inflation rates tend to be a reasonable predictor of inflation in the intermediate term. Core inflation remains well below my long-run target for inflation. This gives us flexibility to focus on accommodative monetary policy doing what it can to promote more rapid growth in the economy. As Figure 18 illustrates, the percent of the adult population that is employed now is quite low in relation to recent history, and has shown only a slight improvement over the course of the recovery.\nSo with significant slack in labor markets, stable inflation expectations, and core inflation well below our longer run target, there is currently no reason to slow the economy down with tighter monetary policy. Until we make more progress on both elements of the Federal Reserve's mandate - employment and inflation - the current, accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate.\nNote\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Remarks at the Boston University conference on The State of Financial Reform (panel on Lessons Learned from the Global Financial Meltdown) Boston, Massachusetts\nEveryone knows that the past three years have been a particularly difficult period for global financial market stability and for the global economy. The financial crisis clearly showed the dramatic impact that financial problems can have on the real economy. And in spite of a fair amount of focus on financial stability prior to the crisis, events highlighted that the private and public sectors both here and abroad were not fully prepared for the kinds of financial shocks we experienced.\nToday I'd like to discuss the role of what I call \"financial myths\" in creating financial crises. By financial myths I mean the beliefs, held by most market participants and by regulators, that certain outcomes are so unlikely to occur that they can basically be ignored - essentially that low probability events, based on historical experience, can be reclassified as zero probability events. When these sorts of widespread assumptions - these financial myths - turn out to be wrong, most financial-market participants find themselves poorly positioned for the resulting shocks. The result is insolvency of groups of firms and substantial uncertainty - uncertainty about the exposure of many firms to direct losses, or to indirect losses created by their counterparty exposure to other firms that suffer direct losses.\nThese so-called financial myths are not unique to this time period, or to this country. I would like to briefly mention two among the numerous examples from recent history - examples where financial myths were important in helping to create a potential crisis. The first example involves the assumption of many in Japan that real estate prices could not fall in the late 1980s. The second involves the assumption, in the late 1990s, that the Internet had completely changed how we should think about company valuation.\nI will then briefly mention four financial myths that played critical roles in the recent financial crisis. These include the following assumptions:\nthat a diversified portfolio of US real estate had little risk of falling in value;\nthat Triple-A rated securities based on mortgages were so well protected by the structure of the securitization that they posed little risk even if real estate prices did fall;\nthat the evolution of many financial institutions to an “originate to distribute” model of lending and securitization meant there was little risk exposure to declining real estate prices; and,\nthat there was little risk of a “run” on organizations like investment banks that relied on short-term, collateralized borrowing.\nThen to conclude I'd like to briefly mention what we can and must do to reduce the risks resulting from these sorts of financial myths, going forward. I believe that financial stability will, in the future, be better served as we implement some of the protections afforded by the Dodd-Frank Act; but I also suspect that doing better at protecting against various financial myths ultimately requires a cultural change. As a discipline, risk management has been too willing to accept that historical statistical relationships will be stable. Ideally, risk management practices would lead us to ask things like \"What will happen if the historical relationship breaks down?\" and \"What assumptions would need to change for them to break down?\"\nAlso, I will touch on the fact that challenging assumptions and understanding the risk inherent in relying solely on historical experience should not be the responsibility of the risk manager alone. These things also need to be better ingrained in CEOs, members of boards of directors, and regulators. I believe we need to do a much better job of using so-called stress tests to challenge commonly held views, so that boards of directors and regulators of firms better understand the fundamental drivers of risks in organizations and in the financial system.\nFinancial Myths in Recent History\nLet me look back to the time period before the most recent crisis and share two examples of financial myths - and, unfortunately, their messy demise. And I would emphasize that these are just two of many examples of the phenomenon.\nFirst, I'll note that during the late 1980s, New England began to experience substantial declines in residential and commercial real estate prices. My research at that time at the Boston Fed was focused on how problems at financial institutions could disrupt credit availability. Interestingly, in 1989 I was visited by a variety of Japanese academics and government officials. They wanted to understand how we had missed the signs of an overheating real estate market.\nAs Figure 1 indicates, it was shall we say an interesting time for researchers from Japan to ask such a question. However, when I inquired about the rapid increase in real estate prices in their country, I always received the same answer - Japan is an island nation and had limited buildable lots, and that prevented real estate prices from declining. This view was very widely held. However, as you can see in Figure 2, that widely held financial myth was soon shattered. Unfortunately, the result of this belief was eventually the crippling of some of the world's largest financial institutions, a long period of subpar economic growth in Japan, and eventually a problematic deflation that Japan struggles with to this day.\nA second example is provided by the growth of the Internet, and in particular the growth in \"dot-com\" stock valuations, in the late 1990s. As Figure 3 shows, there was a substantial run-up in stock valuations during this period. At the time I had conversations with a variety of financial professionals in Boston who made the argument that traditional valuation measures no longer applied. The view assumed by many was that valuation of firms should be based on clicks of a computer mouse rather than earnings, either current or expected in the future.\nAs Figure 4 shows, such enthusiasm for a new way of valuing companies was short-lived. But importantly, the substantial decline in Internet-related stocks did not create a financial crisis. Many of the positions were equity financed - so, while significant wealth was lost, financial institutions and financial markets did not suffer severe repercussions. That loss in wealth helped ignite the 2001 recession, but it was a much more mild downturn than the one we have experienced of late. With the financial infrastructure not significantly damaged, the impact was much less severe than if individuals and firms had taken highly leveraged positions.\nFinancial Myths in the Recent Crisis\nNow I'd like to describe, and present some charts that illustrate, four financial myths that played a role in the recent crisis.\nMyth 1 - Diversification eliminated the risk of declines in residential real estate holdings\nDespite the experience of Japan's real estate in the 1990s, and substantial declines in real estate prices in many regions of the United States throughout history, many commentators argued that a significant, widespread housing-price decline in a country as large and varied as the United States had not happened historically and was very unlikely to occur.\nThat logic was based on what you see in Figure 5, which highlights that there had been significant declines in some regions of the country - but the declines were coincident with increases elsewhere. As Figure 6 shows, there had not been recent, sustained declines in national real estate prices. This observation, combined with the increased securitization of real estate into diversified national portfolios, gave buyers - and those rating the securitizations - confidence that the \"real estate cycle risk\" was substantially mitigated through diversification.\nBut, as Figure 7 shows, the assumption that a geographically diversified portfolio of real estate assets would avoid price declines proved wrong. While prices nationally had not experienced a substantial decline in the past, for three years the U.S. has experienced substantial and sustained declines in prices.\nSome of my colleagues point out, probably appropriately, that given the historical data the failure to anticipate nationwide house prices falling is largely understandable. It was certainly very widespread. What may be more surprising is that in the 2005 timeframe, when many were expecting house prices to slow down or flatten, there was not much by way of risk mitigation undertaken.\nMyth 2 - Triple-A mortgage securities carried little risk\nThe securitization market - that is, the market for securities based on various slices of pooled mortgages - grew dramatically over the past decade. One reason for the growth in securitization was investor interest in, and demand for, securities with little credit risk but returns above those of Treasuries.\nMany buyers of such securities felt sure of two things. First, that national real estate prices were quite unlikely to fall - in other words, our Myth 1. Second, that even in the highly unlikely event that the price of a national portfolio did fall, they would be protected by the structure of the securitization. Securitizations were structured so that any losses were first borne by lower-rated securities built from the pool of underlying mortgages. Given the structure, the assumption was that lower-valued securities would take all potential losses if borrowers defaulted. Many - but not all, of course [Footnote 1] -- assumed that home-price declines and related defaults would have to be very extreme before the highest rated, Triple-A securities were impacted. Under this assumption these securities fully deserved the Triple-A rating given by the rating agencies.\nI should note that making this assumption about Triple-A rated mortgage backed securities (MBSs) proved less problematic than making this assumption about the recombined lower tranches of mortgage-backed securities that were billed as Triple-A rated collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). [Footnote 2] But many investors focused not on the security's underlying components, merely on the ratings.\nFigure 8 shows that Triple-A securities remained at par values as the securitization boom gathered steam. However, Figure 9 shows that when the severity of the decline in house prices manifested itself, even the Triple-A rated mortgage securities collapsed in value. The combination of illiquidity, growing concerns with the real estate market, and ebbing confidence in the ratings resulted in dramatic declines in the pricing of Triple-A securities as the financial crisis worsened.[Footnote 3]\nMyth 3 - The \"originate to distribute\" model limited the balance-sheet risk of banks\nOver the decade preceding the crisis, large commercial and investment banks had become increasingly involved in securitizing mortgage assets. They argued that this provided a steady stream of fee income but generated little risk for the bank. While they packaged mortgages, they were not retaining the risk in their own portfolio - instead, the risk was taken by those that purchased the mortgage securities, particularly the lower-rated mortgage securities.\nWhat was frequently ignored by many was the rapid growth of Triple-A mortgage securities holdings elsewhere within the banks, as well as in off balance sheet structures. While these off balance sheet structures were considered separate entities, banks found the potential reputational risk of not supporting their sponsored off balance sheet risk sufficiently great that many ended up supporting these off balance sheet structures. In a sense, \"originate to distribute\" was, in practice, something more like \"originate to hold, loosely, somewhat off to the side.[Footnote 4]\"\nIn addition, risk managers, bank management, and regulators were sufficiently lulled by Myths 1 and 2 to develop their faith in Myth 3. The unfortunate result was that these banks were not as protected from falling housing prices as many had assumed, and this contributed to the substantial decline in stock prices and the need for government support for many of these large financial intermediaries.\nMyth 4 - Investment banks were not subject to runs, because their liabilities were collateralized\nThere has long been an understanding, and indeed a regulatory presumption, that banks could be subject to \"runs,\" resulting in a need for both deposit insurance and a heavily regulated environment to reduce that risk. At the same time, it had largely been presumed that investment banks were better protected against such runs. While the balance sheets of investment banks had substantial short-term liabilities, many of them were collateralized. Investment banks would buy longer-term securities but finance them with short-term borrowing (using repurchase agreements). It was assumed that because there was collateral backing up the loans, borrowers were protected and would not run.\nFinancing securities with short-term borrowing allowed investment banks to substantially expand their balance sheets, as shown in Figure 10. However, the lenders in this market were other banks, money-market funds, and hedge funds. As questions about the value of the collateral became more prominent, and the solvency and liquidity of investment banks became a greater concern, many short-term lenders abandoned the market. Figure 11 shows the dramatic change that occurred. The inability to finance large securities holdings made the traditional model of investment banking unsustainable, and this contributed to the failure of investment banks and the merger under duress, or conversion to bank holding companies, of others.\nWhat Can We Do about Financial Myths, Going Forward?\nWe plumb this history to help us understand what we can do about financial myths, going forward, and how we can avoid their damaging impact.\nAs the previous slides have shown, taking too much confidence in historical data repeating in the future can be dangerous - to the financial health of institutions and the financial system. That said, we are probably not likely to see a sea-change in the tendency for overconfidence in and reliance on recent statistical regularities.\nHowever, there are a variety of market participants that could better protect their own interests - and the financial system - if they spend more time understanding the key assumptions being made in financial modeling, and have a clearer understanding of what could happen if those assumptions were invalid. Properly done, stress testing should provide valuable information to organizations on key risk drivers. This needs to be more than feeding a handful of macroeconomic assumptions into a model. It requires an understanding of the events that could lead to that macroeconomic outcome, and what other indirect effects might be likely to occur.\nWho should be responsible for regular, thoughtful stress testing? Risk managers, CEOs, and boards of directors should all understand key risk drivers - and should consider whether a stress scenario is sufficiently severe, and whether the direct and indirect effects are reasonably captured. Rating agencies and stock analysts should be increasingly demanding better quality stress tests, and that the results be made available to them. Finally, regulators should be able to compare and contrast the quality of stress tests across organizations and hold accountable those organizations that are not keeping up with their peers.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, challenging assumptions and understanding risks should not only be the responsibility of the risk manager. These things also need to be better ingrained in CEOs, members of boards of directors, and regulators.\nOperationalizing this point is not going to be easy, but it is critical. At a fundamental level, debunking a myth requires individuals to go against strongly and widely held beliefs, to convince decision-makers, and to build consensus. For this to happen we may need significant changes in the governance of risk management at banks and other parties in the financial system. Put more plainly, we need to think about an environment where those in the position of most influence have the incentive to \"poke holes\" in myths via robust stress tests, and not the incentives to override their risk managers when the stress-test implications are not to their liking, or risk a near-term loss of clients or market share.\nConcluding Observations\nNew financial myths are regularly created. In closing, I will just speculate on where some may exist that interested parties should be exploring, now.\nThese are just two of many potential scenarios that are worth exploring. However, I would add that the recent financial crisis highlighted that unlikely events can happen, and when they do, the outcomes can be quite costly for everyone. So the need for better risk management is clear. Fortunately, the opportunity is there as well.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Remarks at the New England Mortgage Expo, hosted by the Connecticut Mortgage Bankers Association and The Warren Group\nI'd like to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak with you today. The beginning of a new year is a good time to discuss the outlook for the economy. I will also try to answer a couple of the key questions that most everyone seems to be asking about, in relation to this recovery.[Note]\nAs I'm sure you know, over the past several weeks we have been getting economic data consistent with a somewhat happier new year. A recovery that has been anemic for the past year and a half looks to be increasingly supported by private spending as 2011 begins. The Blue Chip forecast for 2011 has increased 4 tenths over the previous month, to 3.3 percent.\nAnd I am slightly more optimistic than the Blue Chip; my own forecast is for growth of 3.5 to 4.0 percent over 2011. This is certainly an improvement, but - soberingly - would still leave the unemployment rate close to 9 percent at the end of this year, a rate far above anyone's estimate of full employment.\nGiven the evidence of substantial excess capacity and a quite low core inflation rate, it is absolutely appropriate that monetary policy - and indeed fiscal policy - have been deployed in a way that encourages a more robust recovery. Going forward, it is my view that monetary policy must continue to focus on addressing both elements of the Fed's mandate - price stability, and growth supporting a return to full employment in the medium term.\nToday I am going to focus on two questions that seem to be at the forefront of most discussions of the recovery.\nThe first question is, what role will housing play in the recovery? As the most interest-sensitive component of gross domestic product (GDP), housing has traditionally been an important sector of the economy for generating recovery. I will be highlighting the fact that, despite some improvement in factors fundamental to a housing recovery, I expect housing will not provide as much support to this recovery as it has in previous ones. My sense is that residential investment, consumer durables, and services related to housing will be less robust than is usual in many recoveries, thus playing a role in what I think will be only a gradual improvement in the economy and employment.\nTo put it plainly, these housing-related headwinds are part of why I do not expect growth greater than 4 percent this year. And while 4 percent is not terrible, at that rate it will still take a very long time to get back to full employment.\nThe second key question is, how concerned should we all be about a flare-up in inflation - and aren't the measures the Fed has taken inflationary? Many have expressed concern that Federal Reserve policy actions that expanded our balance sheet dramatically will cause inflation. I firmly believe that in the short run inflation is likely to remain quite low - and that in the longer term we have the tools, and the steadfast commitment, to address inflationary pressures.\nIndeed, while monetary policy works with lags, I would note that it has been more than two years since the Fed's balance sheet expanded dramatically. Since that time, core inflation has fallen and core inflation measures using the CPI or PCE indexes are at something like 50 year lows.\nToday I will briefly address the role of the low inflation rate for the economy and policymaking. In doing so, I will discuss why inflation concerns have not materialized to date, and why I expect core inflation to remain below 2 percent over the next several years.\nQuestion 1: Housing and the Economic Recovery\nThe economic recovery officially began in the third quarter of 2009, according to the organization responsible for dating our recessions - the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Despite being a year and a half into the official recovery, the recovery period has been so tepid that there has been very little improvement in the percentage of the population employed (see Figure 1). The percent of the population employed in December was 58.3, close to the low of this cycle and below the 59.3 percent employed in July of 2009, when the recovery officially started. For context, the number was around 63 percent when the recession began. The recent stability of the employment-to-population ratio reflects the poor labor market performance of the current recovery. We are simply not generating enough jobs to reduce the number of unemployed persons. Nor are we, by the way, providing job opportunities for the so-called \"discouraged workers\" who have given up looking for work.\nWhat we call final sales - growth in GDP excluding inventory replenishment - has grown quite slowly over the past year and a half. Figure 2 shows that the growth to date has been substantially slower than during the 1982 recovery, and is tracking quite closely to the weak recovery experienced in the early 2000s. As many economists anticipated, the recovery has been tepid given the fact that it comes in the wake of a collapse in a housing bubble with resulting financial market turmoil and disruption.\nThe largest GDP component is consumption, and consumption has not grown very quickly. As Figure 3 shows, in the current recovery, growth in consumption has been much slower than in the 1982 recovery and has, unfortunately, tracked the anemic initial recovery from the 2001 recession. While the 2001 recession damaged many a household's finances, through an abrupt decline in stock-market wealth, the current recovery has been hampered by households trying to rebuild their finances given sharply diminished housing wealth in addition to declines in the value of their other investments.\nWhile there have been concerns about business fixed investment, Figure 4 shows that this component of GDP has grown quite well relative to the last two recoveries - although somewhat slower than the 1982 recovery. Despite the concern over economic uncertainty voiced by many businesses, investment has been growing.\nThe real laggard in this recovery has been housing. While housing is a relatively small component of GDP, it can be quite volatile - and often grows rapidly during an economic recovery. In addition, purchases of appliances, home furnishings, and housing-related services are impacted by slowed housing activity. Given the problems that flow from the bursting of the housing bubble, Figure 5 shows that residential fixed investment is roughly where it was at the trough of the recession - and thus not providing its more usual contribution to growth in the early stages of a recovery.\nJust how moribund the housing market has been is shown in Figure 6. Both housing starts and building permits have leveled off, but are showing no signs of a significant recovery yet.\nInterest rates are quite low by historical standards, while the equity component of household net worth is improving, as shown in Figure 7. And we have seen some positive improvement in real disposable income. Given all that, one would normally anticipate that housing would be improving.\nHowever, lower interest rates are only helpful if credit is available. Figure 8 shows that the number of purchase loans to prime borrowers has been declining, while the subprime market is dormant.[Footnote 1] The left side of Figure 9 shows the distribution of all home-purchase loans by credit score in 2006 (before the financial crisis) and in 2010.[Footnote 2] It is striking how the distribution of purchase mortgages has changed. Credit standards have tightened, as evidenced by a shift to borrowers with higher credit scores. Given what has happened to housing prices, and unemployment, lenders are presumably more cautious in lending. Far fewer loans are going to borrowers with credit scores below 625, and many more purchase loans are going to borrowers with credit scores above 750. In 2006, about 15 percent of the purchase loans were to borrowers with credit scores below 625, but by 2010, this fraction had fallen to only 3.5 percent.\nThe decline in loans to borrowers with sub-625 scores has not completely resulted from the decline in subprime lending. The right side of the figure shows the credit-score distributions among prime loans, and a similar rightward shift in the distribution is apparent. From 2006 to 2010, the share of prime purchase loans going to borrowers with sub-625 credit scores fell from 8.5 to 3.5 percent. At the same time, the share of prime purchase loans going to borrowers with scores above 750 rose from about 35 percent to about 41 percent.\nWhile I am certainly not advocating going back to the loose lending standards of, say, 2006, I think we should be aware of how changes in the distribution have implications for the housing recovery. In particular, I would suggest that current lending standards are another reason the housing sector's role in the recovery is likely to be weaker than usual.\nIn addition to the challenge of availability of credit to borrowers with low credit ratings, housing has another issue. Both the homeowner and rental vacancy rates are quite high, as shown in Figure 10 - although there has been recent improvement in these rates, and hopefully the trend is now downward. High vacancy rates, of course, place downward pressure on home prices and rental rates, and serve as another headwind to a housing recovery.\nSo again, all in all and despite some improvement in factors fundamental to a housing recovery, I expect that housing will not provide as much support to this recovery as it has in previous ones.\nBut now I'd like to turn to the second question, and perhaps leave you feeling a bit less discouraged when we're through.\nQuestion 2: Inflation, Policy, and the Economic Recovery\nA second key question involves the concerns about Fed actions stoking inflation. This question is not a distinct and separate issue from the one we just discussed - the strength of the recovery. In fact they are crucially related. If housing-related growth is not going to boost the recovery this time around, we may need policy - particularly monetary policy - to continue playing a stimulative role.\nBut it is important to look at possible costs of stimulative policy, as well as benefits. If inflation were to become a problem that would certainly fall in the costs column. But if analysis suggests that inflation is not likely to be a problem, then we can more comfortably align policy to continue supporting the recovery.\nSome observers and analysts have voiced great concern that the nascent economic recovery, combined with the actions of the Federal Reserve that have expanded its balance sheet, will lead to significant inflation. However, Figure 11 provides a variety of different measures of core inflation; core CPI, core PCE, trimmed core CPI and trimmed core PCE. It is striking how much all four series have declined. In fact many of these series are at their historical lows.\nFigure 12 shows the different measures of core inflation in the top panel, and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in the bottom panel. In the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet expanded significantly - but that period also corresponds to the emergence of disinflation (a reduction in the inflation rate) in the U.S. While monetary policy works with lags, why has the unprecedented increase in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet corresponded with continued significant disinflation? The answer is that both have been reacting to an unprecedented financial shock, which resulted in significant excess capacity in the economy.\nWhen the Federal Reserve purchases assets and expands its balance sheet, it necessarily injects more reserves into the banking system. The key question is what banks do with those reserves. Reserves held by the banking system that are not used to provide credit to businesses will have little bearing on either real spending or inflation. The 2009 line in Figure 13 shows that the expansion of bank reserves has not generated increases in lending. As with the 1991 recovery, where a credit crunch impeded expansion of bank lending, there has not been an expansion of lending during this recovery. This is particularly noticeable if we look at business lending, in Figure 14. Commercial and industrial loans are substantially lower than at the recession trough.\nOf course, those who worry about the inflationary consequences of our balance sheet may be looking to the future. As the economy improves, banks may use their reserves to rapidly expand business lending - increasing economic activity and putting upward pressure on inflation. But as Chairman Bernanke has emphasized, the Federal Reserve has at its disposal a variety of tools that will allow it to remove reserves from the banking system once economic conditions get closer to normal. Thus the fear that our large balance sheet and the large stock of reserves in the banking system will cause inflation - either now or down the road - seems misplaced to me.\nWhile we have been experiencing disinflation generally, it is not the case for all prices. As Figure 13 shows, some prices have risen rapidly. Energy prices in particular have been rising, in response to robust growth in emerging markets. But outside of energy prices, most prices have shown little increase, and in fact a number of the major categories in the CPI index have experienced declines in prices.\nTo be clear, the Fed certainly cares about increases in energy prices, for two reasons. First, higher energy prices could potentially bring about long-lasting increases in the overall inflation rate. The Fed therefore monitors energy prices closely, given our mandate to keep overall inflation low and stable. Second, rising energy prices act as a tax on households and businesses, who often find it difficult to reduce their consumption of energy in the short run.[Footnote 3]\nWith regard to the first concern, our research suggests that the lasting effect of energy prices on overall inflation has been surprisingly small in recent years. For evidence, consider the enormous surges in oil prices in mid-2008, which were followed by significant declines in core inflation, as I mentioned earlier.\nThe second concern remains, however. In sum, my primary concern about rising energy prices is not so much that they will lead to higher inflation, but that they will subtract from household income and thus weaken the economy.\nFinancial markets are also not expecting sharply higher rates of inflation. The difference between the 10 year Treasury rate and the 10 year inflation-protected Treasury security (TIPS) rate provides a measure of the expected average inflation rate over the next decade. As shown in Figure 16, the average expected inflation rate by this measure is still below what the markets expected prior to the recession and the necessary expansion of the Fed's balance sheet.\nConcluding Observations\nThankfully, we are seeing signs that the economy is experiencing a more self-sustaining recovery. However, it is important not to lose sight of how much excess capacity remains. It is likely to take at least four years to return to full employment from the current unemployment rate of 9.4 percent. It is also likely that measures of core inflation will remain well below 2 percent over the same period. This suggests that the signs of improvement we have seen so far are not worrisome, but are most welcome. A sustained period of the economy growing well above its potential - not just for a few quarters - is exactly what we need.\nThe current level of accommodation from monetary and fiscal policy is appropriate. However, once the economy has significantly improved, both fiscal and monetary policy will need to be much less accommodative. Getting this balance right will be one of the main policy challenges over the next several years. I am confident that the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet the challenge.\nFinally, I'd like to note that even with some early signs of economic improvement, a number of risks remain. As I have highlighted today, the housing market remains fragile and is not likely to contribute to economic recovery in its traditional way - and this is part of why I do not expect growth to exceed 4 percent in 2011. Furthermore, in many areas of the country the impaired balance sheets of borrowers, high foreclosures, and high vacancy rates imply a long time before local housing markets normalize. State and local governments remain significantly challenged by the aftershocks of the financial crisis and recession. And many state and local governments continue to have both short-run and long-run fiscal challenges.\nFinally, the large fiscal deficits of many governments accrued during the recession will need to be addressed. And as Figure 17 shows, financial markets are concerned that many countries will be forced to make very painful fiscal choices - in economies with already significant challenges - or risk default.\nYet while risks like these remain, the economy is in a much better place than it was one or two years ago. Fiscal and monetary policy responded aggressively, and in my view appropriately, to avoid what would have been a much more severe outcome, absent action.\nThere will be a time when these aggressive actions need to be reversed, but first we need to get the economy on a much more solid footing. Even with a relatively robust recovery, it will take several years before we attain full employment and an inflation rate close to a long-run expectation of 2 percent. Taken together there has been clear room for - and indeed an imperative for - policy actions like those the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.[Footnote 4] Going forward our focus must be on policies that return the economy to a place that meets both elements of the Fed's mandate.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce Providence, Rhode Island\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you here in Providence. Over the past 25 years or so, my family and I have followed and enjoyed the rebirth that happened in Providence - from trying some of the great downtown restaurants to occasionally taking in the WaterFire celebration.\nHowever, I have also witnessed what has happened to many Rhode Island communities over the past three years, as a result of the recession. Rhode Island has suffered to an even larger extent than the rest of New England. Despite the downtown rebirth I mentioned, unfortunately a drive today through Providence includes some empty storefronts and foreclosure signs.\nSo, it is particularly appropriate to be in Rhode Island to discuss what national monetary policy is doing to address economic problems, here and around the country. [Note]\nThere has been a great deal of attention paid to the monetary policy actions that were initiated by the Federal Reserve at the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. There has been much commentary, from a wide range of observers, on our decision to pursue large scale asset purchases. Given the intensity of the public debate, I have decided to take a somewhat different approach today than I usually do in my talks. Today I am going to do my best to answer the five questions I most often hear about these recent monetary policy actions in my conversations and meetings around New England.\n[Slide 2] Question 1 is, Why was policy changed at the November FOMC meeting?\nBefore we look at the data, I'll preview my answer. The policy change we at the Fed just announced was consistent with the central bank's mandate, given how far the national economy is from our gauges of health.\nCongress, which created the Federal Reserve in 1913, has provided significant guidance over the years on what should be our primary areas of focus. Unlike some foreign central banks that only have one target - price stability - the Federal Reserve has been tasked with pursuing the lowest possible unemployment rate consistent with price stability. So we refer to a \"dual mandate,\" meaning both maximum employment and stable prices.\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC - the presidents of the Reserve Banks and the members of the Board of Governors in Washington - all provide quarterly estimates of where we expect inflation and unemployment to be in the long-run. We can consider those long-run estimates to reflect what members see as achieving our dual mandate for price stability and maximum sustainable employment. According to past submissions, most members expect that inflation is likely to settle close to 2 percent and that the unemployment rate is likely to settle between 5 and 6 percent, in the long run.\nObviously the national economy is quite some distance from those long-run targets. And in places like Rhode Island, the gap is even larger. From a national perspective, Figure 1 highlights that the unemployment rate, which is currently 9.6 percent, has been well above that 5 to 6 percent range for some time, as a result of the long recession. Most of this unemployment likely reflects the dramatic decline in demand for goods and services that characterized the recession. With inadequate demand leading to very high unemployment rates, one would generally expect that such a large gap (in relation to the long-run target) would yield a strong bias towards more accommodative monetary policy.\nTurning to the stable prices side of our dual mandate, Figure 2 shows that core inflation has fallen quite significantly. The core consumer price index or CPI, which had been above 2 percent before the recession, is now below 1 percent. With the current amount of slack in the labor markets, it is certainly possible that inflation could fall further. Thus, on inflation we are also far from where we want and expect to be in the longer run - and we are continuing to experience disinflationary pressures. Again, such a large gap on the inflation side of our mandate should provide a strong bias towards more accommodative monetary policy.\nIn short you see unemployment close to double the mandate-consistent target, and inflation about half of what we consider consistent with price stability.\nStill, an argument against further monetary easing could be made if one thought the economy was about to take off. But are things about to turn, or turning now - as some suggest? Unfortunately, recent data have not been particularly encouraging. Figure 3 shows that GDP (shown in blue) grew by only 2 percent in the third quarter. Even less encouraging is the fact that final sales (shown in green) - which is a better measure of demand for our products, since it excludes inventory investment from the GDP number - was quite anemic in the third quarter, and indeed growth in final sales has been falling over the past four quarters. As I have noted in prior talks, we are likely to need four to five years of relatively strong growth (above \"potential\" ) to bring the unemployment rate down significantly (to a rate consistent with \"full employment\" [Footnote 1]).\nFurthermore, Figure 4 shows that the growth in final sales from the low point of the recession (shown in the dark line extending out five quarters) has been quite weak, and certainly in the weak camp among previous recessions. With these doubts as to the strength of final sales shown in the data, one has to question the likelihood that, other things equal, the economy will grow fast enough to significantly reduce the unemployment rate in an acceptable timeframe and reduce these disinflationary pressures.\nWith both employment and inflation falling short of the long-run expectations that reflect the Fed's mandate, one would expect additional accommodative monetary policy. However, with the federal funds rate close to zero, the Fed's usual policy tool could not be utilized. However, monetary policy can still be conducted. The asset-purchase policy announced at the November FOMC meeting was in my view strongly consistent with our dual mandate from Congress - in other words, the pursuit of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices.\nStill, some have argued very forcefully that we should not have taken further action. This leads to the second question.\n[Slide 7]\nQuestion 2 is, What is the likely cost of not changing monetary policy?\nAgain, as we turn to the evidence, let me sum up my answer to this important and at times overlooked question. Not changing policy risked further disinflation, a rise in the real cost of funds tantamount to monetary tightening, and risks of continued and possibly worsening pain in labor markets. Allow me to explain.\nFigure 5 highlights how severe the recession has been, in terms of output. We saw dramatic declines in GDP in the United States (the black line), but the chart shows that many other countries experienced an even more severe decline in output, and for some countries it is not clear they have reached their recession trough as yet. Particularly in Europe, where some countries have had sovereign debt problems and significant fiscal austerity, the output decline is striking.\nWhile that chart shows that in fact the impact on output was lesser in the U.S. than in many countries,Figure 6shows that the impact on labor markets here in the U.S. has been more severe than in most countries; in fact, only severely distressed Spain and Ireland have seen a bigger effect on employment. The U.S., again shown by the black line, is still well below the peak employment of prior to the onset of the recession, and the decline has been more significant than in many other countries. Firms in the U.S. moved particularly aggressively to cut jobs, particularly as the recession deepened in the aftermath of financial problems in the fall of 2008.\nFigure 7 shows one of the problems with labor markets remaining extremely weak for a protracted period. The percent of jobless workers who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more is over 40 percent. This is much higher than in recent recessions, as you can see in the shaded recession sections of the chart. In fact, it is the highest reading on record for this series.\nLong periods of unemployment can have particularly corrosive effects. Not only do people have to deplete their savings, but unfortunately long-term unemployed job-seekers can find it quite difficult to re-enter the workforce - because skills may atrophy and because hiring firms may shun those who have been unemployed for a long time.\nIn short, there are real and significant long-term costs to individuals and the economy when the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high.\nAllow me to walk you through the next couple of charts, which highlight that it can be costly to not do anything to counteract further disinflation. As those of you in this room know, many economic decisions are influenced by the real cost of borrowing. Figure 8 gives us a historical perspective, going back to 1980, comparing in the top chart the short-term federal funds rate and the inflation rate. The bottom chart shows what you get when you put the two together - the real federal funds rate resulting from the effective rate minus the change in the core CPI.\nIf we simply narrow the time frame of the chart, as in Figure 9, we see clearly that if short-term interest rates are fixed - say at about the zero bound, as now - but the inflation rate declines, then the real interest rate actually increases. You see this in the red line on the bottom chart. As a result, a decline in the inflation rate when interest rates are fixed amounts to monetary tightening. Given the state of the economy, a monetary contraction right now is both unintended and undesirable. So we want to prevent any further disinflation - not only because it gets us closer to a harmful deflationary situation, but also because it represents a monetary tightening when conditions are indicating that further accommodation is desirable.\nIf the federal funds rate was not close to zero right now, the arguments for reducing it - that is, for easing in monetary policy - would be quite strong. However, the federal funds rate is quite close to zero. And this leads us to the third question.\n[Slide 13]\nQuestion 3 is, How Different are large scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from traditional monetary policy?\nBefore we look at the data, I'll preview my answer to this question. Are large-scale asset purchases a fundamentally different policy, either in intent and mechanics? The answer is no, LSAPs are much closer to traditional monetary policy than many commentators assume. We simply move in other markets than the federal funds market. And, like traditional monetary policy actions, we're not talking about \"bailouts\" or stimulus spending or placing a debt burden on future generations. Let me explain.\nIn more normal times when the FOMC wants to ease monetary policy, we buy Treasury bills and, in paying the sellers for them[Footnote 2], we create additional bank reserves. By making more reserves available to the banking system, we ease conditions in the overnight market for funds - the federal funds market - so the primary impact of these purchases is a reduction in the federal funds rate. But more importantly for the economy, we expect the reduction in the funds rate to over time translate into declines in mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, exchange rates, and a rise in stock prices - all of which of course help stimulate economic activity.\nNow that the federal funds rate is near zero and the reserves in the system are quite large, the usual course is not an option. Instead of relying on the indirect effects of targeting a lower funds rate, we are opting to more directly affect the interest rates that have the greatest connection to real spending; by buying Treasury bonds and creating additional bank reserves. Since there are already substantial reserves in the system, the primary expected effect is lowering the long rate by purchasing a significant amount of longer-term Treasury bonds. Like conventional policy, one would expect that mortgage and corporate rates will fall, and exchange rates will be impacted, providing additional stimulus to the economy. That is in fact what has already happened, which leads to Question 4.\n[Slide 14]\nQuestion 4 is, What has been the impact of the LSAP to date?\nBefore we explore the data, I'll again share the punch line, which is that these policy actions, like more standard reductions in the federal funds rate, have basically had the expected effects and - despite some short-run volatility as we get under way - should be broadly effective and helpful to the economy going forward.\nStarting with Chairman Bernanke's Jackson Hole speech, the markets have gradually come to expect that more monetary accommodation was likely. As a result, the impact on financial markets of any easing was likely incorporated into prices prior to the actual announcement. The next set of charts highlights that the effects one might expect from a conventional monetary accommodation do indeed seem to have occurred in anticipation of this less-conventional action.[Footnote 3]\nI should note that while longer rates have been trending down as desired, there has been some recent movement up, too. Lots of things affect rates in the marketplace, but I am certain that our purchases over time will contribute to lower rates than we would otherwise be seeing.\nFigure 10 explores inflation expectations, and highlights the fact that the implied inflation rate over the next 10 years as measured by the difference between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 10-year inflation-indexed Treasury yield had fallen to well below 2 percent. As the markets began to anticipate the LSAP program, the implied inflation rate has risen to a little over 2 percent. Thus, the action seems to have convinced market participants that further disinflationary pressures in the U.S. were likely to be resisted by monetary policy.\nFigure 11 shows that corporate bond rates and mortgage rates have fallen over this period, although there has been an uptick over the last couple of days. Lower rates on these instruments will make it easier for firms to finance investments and for home buyers to purchase homes, all other things equal.\nFigure 12 shows that there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar exchange rate. While not a goal of our policies, this should stimulate exports and reduce imports. It is important to re-emphasize that in the U.S., as in any country with a flexible exchange rate system, a modest currency depreciation is the normal consequence of easing monetary policy. By lowering short- and long-term interest rates, investors will, on the margin, seek assets that provide somewhat greater returns than U.S. assets, and in the process, will lower the demand for dollars and depreciate our currency.\nWhile this is an issue that has been passionately discussed in many parts of the globe, I think it is important to note - as shown on Figure 13 - that the current trade weighted exchange rate is really not much different than what it was before the recession. Exchange rates have at times fluctuated for a variety of reasons during this period, including periods of so-called flight to quality that pushed U.S. rates down, and periods of flight from European currencies as a result of some sovereign debt issues - both of which tended to push the dollar up. At the same time, the data show that the Federal Reserve's current monetary accommodation to date has merely helped restore the dollar exchange rate to the level it was three years ago.\nFigure 14 shows that the stock market has generally risen over the last several months, despite some downward movement over the last couple of days. While this is not a targeted goal of our policy, it is an indicator that the combination of lower rates and better economic prospects are being manifested in a rise in stock prices. This increases household wealth for those who own stocks and should provide for somewhat stronger consumption, going forward.\nFigure 15 provides some rough estimates of what the impact of the LSAP easing could be, over time, using the Boston Fed's internal simulation models. While such estimates are by nature quite uncertain, we estimate that the impact could be a reduction in the unemployment rate by the end of 2012 of a little less than half a percent. This would translate into more than 700,000 additional jobs that we would not have had in the absence of this monetary policy action.\nIn short this action, like more standard reductions in the federal funds rate, has broadly speaking had the expected short-run effect and should be helpful going forward. This leads to the final question.\n[Slide 21]\nQuestion 5 is, What are the risks of the current policy?\nThe short answer is that there are - of course - some risks. We should not gloss over them, but neither should we overstate them. I am very confident that they can be managed and are worth taking.\nNormally the Federal Reserve buys primarily short-term securities. By purchasing long-term securities the Federal Reserve is in fact taking on the risk that their value will fall as interest rates rise. The reason is that as interest rates rise above the rates paid on the securities we hold, the lower-rate securities we hold will (not surprisingly) fall in value, as investors favor the higher-rate newer-issue securities. Of course, an environment in which most interest rates were rising would imply an economy where disinflation was no longer a problem, which is one of the macroeconomic outcomes the policy is indeed seeking. But in fact the Fed has a number of options and plenty of flexibility to manage the holdings in the best interests of the economy and taxpayers. We could hold instruments to maturity, or could sell securities of certain maturities. And, of course, interest income will accrue. I believe the most likely net outcome will actually be a benefit to the taxpayer, although that is not the objective of our balance sheet moves (rather, our dual mandate is).\nA second risk arises from the fact that the Treasury market is quite large - much larger than the federal funds market in which we normally operate. While relatively small purchases of securities during normal times can be sufficient to move the federal funds rate, it takes large asset purchases to have a significant impact on a market as large and deep as the Treasury bond market. As a result, this policy requires the Federal Reserve to expand its balance sheet much more than would a traditional monetary easing. Large expansions of the balance sheet can complicate exit strategy, when that becomes appropriate. While the Federal Reserve has a variety of tools designed to tighten policy, either by raising interest on excess reserves, removing reserves, or selling securities, some of these tools have not been used in the past. Naturally this makes the exact impact of various tools somewhat more uncertain than normal. Still, I am very confident of the Fed's ability and will to exit, when necessary.\nA third risk is that these measures have not been conducted in the United States, at least at the current scale. While there are many similarities with typical monetary policy and several other countries (for example Japan and the U.K.) have also been pursuing large scale asset purchases, the lack of recent U.S. historical precedent makes the possibility of unintended consequences higher than with more typical monetary policy actions.\nAnother risk is that we might be too successful in raising inflation. Thus any policy action needs to take care to make clear that the desire is to maintain well-anchored inflation expectations. But this can best be achieved by insuring that inflation does not get too high nor too low.\nFinally, some have argued that the Fed is embarking on a policy of monetizing the federal debt. I would counter that this is a temporary monetary policy action taken to return inflation and unemployment somewhat more quickly than otherwise to levels consistent with our mandate. It is a policy designed to help reduce longer term rates over a fixed period of time, not at all a policy to finance government debt indefinitely. I have noted in previous talks that it is important to provide short-term stimulus, given the current economic situation, but that long-run budget projections are not sustainable and will need to be addressed. It is important to note that large scale asset purchases do not necessarily need to use Treasury-security purchases to stimulate the economy; indeed in our first round we did so with mortgage-backed securities.\nSo all in all there are of course risks to evaluate in light of the current state of the economy and our mandate. We are aware of these risks. I fully expect that we will be able to manage them.\n[Slide 22]\nConcluding Observations\nAs I conclude I would like to reiterate that the actions taken earlier this month are consistent with the important mandates that Congress has set for the Federal Reserve in terms of employment (reflecting growth) and prices. With unemployment so high and inflation unusually low, most models indicate that further monetary accommodation is warranted. In addition, I believe the cost of having high unemployment rates for an extended period of time, or likewise further disinflation, could be quite high and potentially very damaging.\nThe recently announced LSAP program has many similarities with more typical monetary policy actions, but of course there are risks with any policy that we have not had significant experience with. Nonetheless, the initial reactions seem similar to what we would have expected from more typical monetary policy. And the Fed has the tools to minimize its own particular risks.\nIn short, these actions are likely to reduce the unemployment rate and reduce the risk of further disinflation relative to not taking action. This is exactly what I hoped would be the result of the program.\nLet me leave you with an analogy - and a seasonally appropriate one at that. This past weekend, many New Englanders woke up to a lawn full of leaves. Many took out their lawn mower intending to get to work picking up those leaves. When pulling on the starter cord, some no doubt heard the engine sputter and cough. The immediate reaction is to fiddle with the choke switch and give a little more gas to the engine. Once you get the engine started and running smoothly, you still have the task of mowing up all those leaves. But you won't make any progress unless you first get the engine operating. And so it is with monetary policy. Our economy has been faltering and sputtering, so it was necessary to take some steps to get it actually \"running.\" Of course this Fed policy will not solve the economy's problems, just as getting the motor started does not in and of itself take care of the leaves in your yard. Solving the economy's problems will take time and actions by the public and private sectors - but getting the economic engine running is the essential first step to the broader work ahead.\nThank you again for having me join you today. I hope that in the future we will gather under very different and much improved economic circumstances, and I can assure you that we at the Federal Reserve will work diligently towards that end.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment - Boston, MA\nI'd like to welcome everyone to the second day of our conference. As has been mentioned already, this is in some sense a retrospective. The first conference on monetary policy in a low inflation environment was held in Vermont in October of 1999. I would note that several speakers we will hear from today also provided comments at that gathering 10 years ago, and I am pleased to have them back in New England to see if a decade of relevant data has influenced their thinking on the topic. [Note]\n[Slide 2] At that conference, Alan Blinder was on the policy panel, a place he finds himself again today. He said at the time that it was of some interest that the conference was being held at the U.S. Federal Reserve, and not in Japan or Europe. One might attribute the location to unusually good forecasting prowess evidenced by our Research Director, Jeff Fuhrer, who was actively engaged in organizing the earlier conference as well as this one.\nThe earlier conference took place under very different economic circumstances. It was held in the midst of the period that I believe Jim Stock named \"the Great Moderation,\" reflecting the reduced volatility we were seeing in unemployment and inflation. There was a growing sense of confidence that severe business cycles had been tamed, as policymakers better understood and calibrated fiscal and monetary policy. At the time of the conference, the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent and the core inflation rate was 2.1 percent.[Footnote 1]\nDespite the propitious economic environment at the time, I will say that participants at the conference said quite clearly that monetary policy in a low inflation environment would be quite challenging.\n[Slide 3] Perhaps the best summary of this concern was provided those ten years ago by Kazuo Ueda, who is on the policy panel again this time. His summary of policy when the zero bound was hit was that \"it will be a lot more painful than you can possibly imagine.\" Unfortunately, his comments have been accurate and prophetic - and quoted rather prominently of late.\nPerhaps, as well, they were more true in Japan than anywhere else in the world. At the time of our first conference on this topic, many participants were expecting the Japanese deflation to be quickly eradicated and the country to be \"on the mend.\" Now, more than a decade later, Japan continues to combat deflation with its policy still running up against the zero lower bound.\nOther participants at the earlier conference for the most part viewed Japan as an anomaly, and seemed to think that the likelihood of others ending up in Japan's predicament was quite low. Unfortunately, that probability seems to have shifted, and we now face a world where Japan, Europe, and the U.S. are challenged by the need to conduct monetary policy with short-term interest rates close to zero.\nAll in all, there was some disagreement over how effective alternate policies could be, but there was a sense that there was little reason not to try them, should circumstances merit it.\n[Slide 4] Figure 1 highlights just how different this so-called Great Recession has been. The chart shows the percent employment change from the peak of employment in post-war recessions. The scale of the job loss during this recession, shown by the black line, is sobering.\n[Slide 5] Another feature of this Great Recession involves the significant difficulties within financial institutions and financial markets, and the contributions of those difficulties to the economic downturn. While at the earlier conference there was due concern about the banking and financial systems, I think it fair to say that the role that financial institutions and markets can play in aggravating the business cycle was not fully appreciated. A challenge that remains is how best to incorporate financial market developments in our economic models, as much of the modeling only rather poorly captures the role of financial intermediation.\n[Slide 6] It goes without saying that the circumstances surrounding this conference are very different than those of ten years ago. Unfortunately at today's conference, unlike ten years ago, we find unemployment at 9.6 percent, core CPI inflation well below 2 percent, and short-term interest rates bound by zero. Japan is still fighting deflation. So the problems faced by policymakers in the United States and abroad are no longer just matters of academic debate.\nToday I would like to briefly discuss how we should, in my opinion, interpret some of the data and experience we have seen since that prior conference. In particular, I would like to draw some observations from the Japanese experience, and from the Federal Reserve's Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) Program.\nThe Case of Japan\nFirst, while the Japanese stock market and real estate markets peaked in 1990, and were substantially off their peak prices in the middle of the 1990s, the core inflation rate remained low but definitely positive (as shown in Figure 2).  While every such situation is unique, the conditions in Japan that moved a low-inflation environment to one of actually falling prices were monetary and fiscal tightening, and also deferring the process of addressing significant problems in the financial sector. \n[Slide 8] Second, it is worth noting that Japan and Europe and the United States are facing substantial challenges in monetary policymaking, in part because of lingering financial problems.  Because the transmission of monetary policy occurs through the banking system, impaired banking systems and financial markets greatly complicate the conduct of monetary policy. \nThird, the fact that Japan is still battling deflation highlights how pernicious deflation can be, and how difficult it is to counteract once it has been firmly established.\n[Slide 7] Japan is the one industrialized country that has faced the zero bound and deflation problem for well over a decade. I would note several points we can draw from Japan's battle with deflation.\n[Slide 9] It is important to note that Japan has significantly altered monetary and fiscal policy to try to address its deflation problems. For fiscal policy, as shown in Figure 3, Japan has more than tripled its debt-to-GDP ratio since the early 1990s, as the government has tried to ignite the economy with more expansionary fiscal policy.\n[Slide 10] Similarly, the Bank of Japan has more than tripled the size of its balance sheet since 1990, to try to combat deflation - as shown in Figure 4.\n[Slide 11] These expansionary monetary and fiscal policies no doubt prevented deflation from being a much more severe problem than it nonetheless has been. Concerns expressed at our earlier conference, and many economic models, highlighted a risk of a strong deflationary spiral, given the significant slack in the Japanese economy. Thankfully, policy did prevent this severe outcome. However, it was not sufficient to prevent a low but persistent degree of deflation. This experience may indicate that a gradual response may not be as effective as a more active response to arrest deflationary pressures - before they become embedded in thinking that can affect household and business spending.\nFrom a policy perspective I take several lessons from the Japanese experience. First, should deflation occur, it can be quite difficult to overcome. Second, insuring against the risk of deflation may be much cheaper than waiting until it has occurred and then trying to address it. Finally, financially fragile economies may be particularly vulnerable to negative impacts from premature austerity measures.\nMonetary Policy Lessons from the LSAP Program\n[Slide 12] Now I would like to touch on some lessons for monetary policy from the LSAP program. As you know, after reaching the zero lower bound in rate-setting and seeing continued problems in economic outcomes, the Federal Reserve made a policy decision to purchase large quantities of government-backed securities in the secondary market, in its Large Scale Asset Purchase or \"LSAP\" program. Because such programs are relatively new phenomena in the United States, it was difficult to predict with precision how the economy would react.[Footnote 2] Without good historical experience to rely on, and because we are operating at the zero bound for the first time in post-war history, it is important to use the evidence we have to draw out a better understanding of LSAP programs and related channels.\nThere are many potential impediments to accurately measuring the effects of the LSAP program. First, it is difficult to isolate the impact of the program from other relevant changes such as shifts in fiscal policy, changes in policies of major trading partners, or developments in supervisory or regulatory policies that can have an impact on financial markets. Second, these programs have been operating when many economic and financial variables are outside their normal ranges. Thus, the impact of the program may differ depending on economic and financial conditions prevalent during their operation. Third, to the extent that policy changes are anticipated, the effect of a policy change may be difficult to measure with any degree of certainty.\n[Slide 13] Despite these challenges, many researchers have begun to evaluate the policy channels that are impacted by an LSAP program.[Footnote 3] While there is much work to be done, and the sample of U.S. experience is fairly limited, allow me to provide my own take on the evidence that is currently available.\n[Slide 14] Figure 5 shows the impact on mortgage rates of the announcements of the LSAP program - when it was first announced and at the March FOMC meeting when the parameters of the initial program were detailed.\nSince the initial program focused on purchases of mortgage securities, one might expect the largest impact to be on mortgage rates. Mortgage rates that had been trading at 6 percent prior to the announcements declined to roughly 5 percent. Empirical event studies that try to correct for possible confounding events tend to find an impact on mortgage rates in the range of 25 to 100 basis points. Thus, I think the empirical evidence supports the view that an LSAP program can influence the market rate of the asset being purchased. Certainly the impact may be influenced by the economic and financial conditions at the time of the announcement and purchase. The scale of the program should be sensitive to the prevailing conditions, and the size of the program would need to vary to accomplish a particular interest rate outcome.\n[Slide 15] An LSAP program will be most effective if it not only influences the rates on assets being purchased, but also influences rates on other assets with similar characteristics. For example, purchases of mortgage securities are likely to influence the price and yield of other long-term securities that may also be held by investors looking for long-term assets. As the rate on MBS securities falls, some investors will look to buy these other assets, and the increased demand will bid up their prices and push down their rates.\n[Slide 16] Indeed, as Figure 6 highlights, other long-term rates did fall with the LSAP announcements. Both long-term Treasury and corporate bond rates fell with the announcements. Several studies have concluded that the cross-correlation is relatively high, indicating that a broader array of long-term rates will be influenced by an LSAP program. Thus, the precise focus of the program's asset buy may be less critical than the broader fact that the central bank is purchasing long-duration securities, and that rates on all long-duration securities will be impacted by the program. Lower long-term rates should stimulate demand for assets influenced by the cost of borrowing long - such as investments by businesses, and home and car purchases by consumers.\n[Slide 17] Another channel that LSAPs may influence involves conveying the likelihood that short-term rates will remain low. While the Federal Reserve has used language referencing \"an extended period\" in the FOMC minutes for some time, the markets interpretation of that period is likely to be influenced by actions taken.\n[Slide 18] Indeed, as Figure 7 shows, prior to the LSAP program announcements the three-year Treasury rate had been trading above 2 percent. Since the announcements, the three-year Treasury rate has been below 2 percent - and more recently has been trading closer to the rate on shorter-term Treasuries. As of Wednesday of this week, the one-year Treasury was trading at 0.22 percent, the two-year was trading at 0.37 percent, and the three-year was trading at 0.57 percent. This compression of rates is consistent with market participants anticipating that low rates are likely to continue for quite some time. Of course, not only Treasury securities are influenced by expectations of policy; rates on other securities of short to medium term are likely to be lower as well.\n[Slide 19] Another area that is potentially impacted by an LSAP is foreign exchange. This is a mechanism that received significant attention at our earlier conference.\n[Slide 20] Since exchange rates are determined by a variety of policies, both here and abroad, the empirical relationship may be difficult to detect. This is particularly true for the dollar exchange rate, where the precautionary demand for dollars can cause large movements in the exchange rate as investors look to park funds in dollars during periods of economic turbulence. Nonetheless, one might think that the exchange rate would be influenced by policies to reduce domestic interest rates as investors move funds to countries yielding a higher return. As Figure 8 highlights, the relationship with the LSAP and exchange rates is not visually compelling, but nonetheless this is a channel worth studying and better understanding.\n[Slide 21] Another potential channel involves bank lending. As large corporations issue long-term debt at attractively low rates, they become less dependent on loans or lines of credits from banks. As larger firms move to capital markets for financing, it should free up bank balance sheets to allow a focus on those firms that really depend on banks for financing. The strength of this channel needs to be explored more thoroughly.\nConcluding Observations\n[Slide 22] This conference, more than 10 years after our earlier conference on the topic, has benefitted from the additional experience that countries around the world have had, in the interim, with monetary policy in a low inflation environment. I would summarize by saying that clearly, conducting monetary policy in a low inflation environment is difficult - and particularly so when that low inflation environment also includes wrenching financial difficulties and stubbornly high unemployment rates. At our earlier conference there was probably too little appreciation of the potential challenges, and too low a weight placed on how a low inflation environment could be hampered by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.\nWhile it may be too early to draw firm conclusions about monetary policy at the zero bound for short-term interest rates, I would like to draw some tentative conclusions.\nFirst, a policy of gradually adjusting monetary and fiscal policy, as conducted in Japan after deflation first occurred, may not be as effective as an active policy response taken before deflation has become embedded in the economy.  Of course, it should depend on the given situation and incoming data.\nSecond, while monetary policy may have difficulty fully offsetting a severe shock when the zero bound is hit, there are still important channels for monetary policy to use to mitigate the negative shocks. \nThird, it is not a coincidence that in Japan, the United States, and Europe these economic problems have been encountered in conjunction with banking and financial market problems.  Analysis of monetary policy with the zero bound needs to more richly capture the aspects of the financial sector that are major contributors to economic difficulties.\nFinally, we all recognize that conducting unconventional monetary and fiscal policy at the zero bound requires political will.  This of course must be factored into any analysis of policy options.\nThank you, and I look forward to the rest of today's discussion on this crucial topic.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "\"Rethinking Central Banking\" Conference Washington, D.C.\nThank you for inviting me to offer a few observations on some design and implementation issues we all face with regard to macroprudential supervisory policies. [Note]\nPerhaps a positive offshoot of the recent severe financial crisis is that it has galvanized policymakers to expedite work on macroprudential supervision and regulation. The sense of urgency has helped regulators make significant progress on increasing bank capital buffers and has sharpened the focus on liquidity risk. These efforts are important, and should improve the strength and resiliency of the financial system when fully implemented.\n[Slide 2] Over the last year I have sometimes made a comparison between new and needed financial regulations and the regulations developed in the 1800s to prevent the \"great fires\" that had plagued many major cities. One thing that greatly reduced the risk of such fires was the development and enforcement of tough new building codes. This meant using building materials that were less flammable, and raising structures that made it far less likely that a building would catch fire - or that would suppress the spread of a fire, should it nonetheless occur. In many respects I see enhanced capital and liquidity rules as equivalent changes in our financial system, which should make financial institutions far less susceptible to \"financial firestorms.\"\nAnother aspect of the solution to great fires was the move to hiring professional fire fighters with adequate equipment and sufficient access to water to quickly respond to a fire. This reduced the risk that if a fire occurred, it would spread in some catastrophic way.\nThe importance of response time is highlighted in the questions that get asked when you take out fire insurance on your house. They ask how close you are to the nearest fire station, and how close you are to a fire hydrant. The questions are important because the answers impact the extent of the damage a fire can cause. They also impact the likelihood that a fire at a neighbor's house could spread and impact your home.\nResponse time is also critically important in financial regulation and in limiting financial damage. Today I am going to briefly discuss one type of financial \"first response\" - the ability to retain capital in the banking system by cutting bank dividends when problems first emerge.\nGiven the evidence in the data, I will highlight the fact that in relation to dividends, bank management and supervisors responded quite slowly in the United States during the financial crisis. I will suggest that macroprudential supervision should include early detection of problems, and in a troubled banking system the reduction of dividends to retain capital.\nThe Timing of Dividend Reductions\nFigure 1 shows that in August 2007, as the financial crisis emerged, banks became willing to lend to each other at one-month maturity only at rates dramatically different from the previous year. While the increase in August 2007 looks a bit less spectacular than the spike that followed the events of the fall of 2008, it was nonetheless a dramatic change. The economic implications of emerging financial problems contributed to the significant response in monetary policy.\nBut as Figure 2 highlights, the 2007 events did not lead to similarly significant changes in supervisory policy. The dividends on common stock declared by the largest banking organizations (the 19 SCAP [Footnote 1] participants and others) actually increased in the fourth quarter of 2007, and did not show dramatic reductions until after the financial crisis hit a crescendo in the fall of 2008.\nFigure 3 puts in perspective the cumulative cash dividends of the largest banks by comparing them to the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) funds they received.\n[Slide 6] This suggests that if dividends had been halted at the SCAP banks once the LIBOR rate rose, nearly $80 billion would have been retained as capital. This represents close to 50 percent of the CPP funds used to recapitalize these banks in the fall of 2008. Clearly a proactive approach to dividend retention could have substantially reduced the need for an emergency infusion of public funds.\nFinancial Indicators of Emerging Problems\nRegulatory dividend policy was focused on the ability of banks to pay dividends out of earnings. However, earnings declines occurred later than the financial market responses to emerging problems. In addition, banks' management and boards of directors rarely are proactive in reducing dividends, because of concerns that it will signal that they are experiencing more severe financial problems than their peers. With earnings somewhat slow to react to emerging problems, and boards reluctant to signal problems, most of the large banks were very slow to react to the crisis with reduced dividends.\nSimilarly, banks' supervisory ratings were also slow to react, as shown in Figure 4. The measure of the share of assets in so-called \"problem\" banks [Footnote 2] - the blue line - responds only with a delay. A similar pattern emerges if one looks at the percentage of bank assets in the three lowest supervisory ratings (CAMELS ratings of 3, 4, or 5), although it captures a much higher percentage of total bank assets. In contrast, the credit default swap spread for the four largest U.S. banking organizations - the green line - began to climb in the fall of 2007 and continued to climb throughout 2008 and into 2009. I should note that we use the four largest banks simply because of the availability of historical credit default swap data, but our modeling suggests this is representative for the largest banks more generally.\nFigure 5 shows that a similar pattern emerges if one uses the market capitalization relative to assets of the four largest banking organizations. [Footnote 3] Like the credit default swaps, the measure (the green line) began to decline significantly in the fall of 2007 and continued to decline through 2008 and into 2009. Again this financial indicator of bank health moved far more quickly than regulatory ratings (see the blue line) or dividend reductions.\nFigure 6 highlights another issue - that as financial markets took a bleaker view of banks' financial prospects (in the top chart), banks had begun to tighten credit standards (in the bottom chart). By the end of 2007, credit standards had tightened substantially, relative to where they were in the beginning of that year. Banks seek to maintain reasonable capital-to-assets ratios and loans are, of course, assets for banks. If capital is eventually reduced due to loan write-downs, and banks reduce lending to maintain capital-to-asset ratios, the \"collateral damage\" to those who would like to borrow from \"supply-constrained\" banking institutions can impose a significant cost to the economy more broadly. So the impact of only slowly reducing dividends, rather than retaining capital in the banking system, extends well beyond losses to stockholders and potentially taxpayers.\nPolicy Implications\n[Slide 10] Even from the perspective of microprudential supervision, more proactive dividend reduction would have ameliorated some of the costs of the financial crisis. Rather than basing regulatory dividend policy on accounting constructs that tend to be slow moving and backward looking, regulatory policy should prompt supervisors to look forward and thus more proactively seek reductions in dividends in appropriate circumstances. In particular, given the financial-market signals of impending problems that I have highlighted today, I believe that supervisors need in such circumstances to be more proactive in seeking capital retention through reduced dividends at banking organizations.\n[Slide 11] Of course, signaling problems can make it difficult for supervisors to mandate reductions at individual institutions. When a wide variety of indicators suggest potential problems in the banking sector, signaling problems could be avoided if, hypothetically, all banks were required to reduce dividends - or all banks with outsized exposures. For example, banks with large real estate exposures in loans and securities could in such a situation be required to reduce dividends before accounting losses were realized. Such a policy might very well reduce the credit-availability problems that have unfortunately been a hallmark of this financial crisis.\nIn retrospect, empirical analysis suggests that bank management and supervisors had an opportunity to retain capital once problems became identifiable, but before the full extent of the crisis emerged in the fall of 2008. In the spirit of learning and applying lessons, one must consider whether this dynamic could repeat itself - or indeed is repeating itself. For example, in some parts of the world today, sovereign risk exposure seems problematic and elevated credit default swaps and low stock market valuations have not prevented some banks from continuing to pay dividends.\nIn sum, I suggest that more aggressive policy may not only reduce potential taxpayer exposure to the banking sector, but also insulate the broader economy from the sorts of loan-supply shocks that can provide significant headwinds to an economic recovery.\nThank you.",

            "content": "The Forecasters Club of New York\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today at the Forecaster's Club.[Note] Working at the Fed over the last 25 years has given me a healthy regard for the challenges you face every day as you attempt to divine the future path of the economy. Even during the best of times it is not easy, but this has been a particularly challenging time in forecasting. It has proven to be very difficult to incorporate the effects of the financial system into models of the economy - in part because the financial sector may have a significant impact on economic forecasts only during the rare occasions when the sector is badly disrupted.\nWhile financial markets and financial institutions are now in far better shape than two years ago, the collateral damage on the economy from the financial shocks has been severe. The damage has, unfortunately, followed the pattern established in the aftermath of previous significant financial disruptions, which tend to cause an extended period of subpar economic growth. [Footnote 1]\nThese days, as in past recoveries, it is not uncommon to hear some observers say that there is little that policymakers can or should do. This is not my perspective, and I want to use this opportunity to share some of the analytical and empirical underpinnings for my views.\nWhile these topics are getting a lot of attention of late - understandably - many of us have been researching them for some time. And I would just like to reiterate that I take an empirical, data-driven approach to policymaking responsibilities - a fact I believe my talk today will demonstrate.\nWhile certainly the economic problems we are facing are daunting, I do not see them as insurmountable. In fact, although the economy is far from where we would like it to be, we are in a far better place than we were two years ago, when financial markets and economic activity were in the process of \"seizing up.\" The stock market is well off its lows, interest spreads have narrowed, and the economy has had four quarters of positive, if anemic, growth.\nAnd it was policy - monetary policy and fiscal policy, and to some degree supervisory policy - that played a critical role in the improvements we have seen over the past two years. We have a long way to go, but it would have been much longer but for a number of parties making difficult but appropriate policy decisions.\nHowever, while we have seen positive growth over the past year, it has been slow. We have seen some increases in employment, but there has not been any significant reduction in the high percentage of workers who are unemployed. And, while financial market conditions have improved dramatically, credit availability remains an issue for many individuals and businesses. In short, policymaking has been effective at stabilizing the economy, but the recovery remains far too weak to restore what we consider full employment with the speed I would like to see.\nToday I would like to touch on a number of issues, including some of the recently hypothesized impediments to a more robust recovery. I would also like to explore some of the options for generating a more robust recovery - options that policymakers need to consider and debate, thoughtfully and analytically, as we go forward.\nAllow me to preview my punch line. I've called this talk \"How Should Monetary Policy Respond to a Slow Recovery?\" My answer to that question is: vigorously, creatively, thoughtfully, and persistently, as long as we have options at our disposal. And we do have options, despite having pushed short-term rates to the zero lower bound.\nDislocations in the Labor Market?\nSome hypothesize that a more robust recovery is impeded by dislocations in the labor market. Indeed, history shows that even with a relatively mild recession there can be significant dislocations. The 2001 recession provides a good example. As Figure 1 shows, information technology and manufacturing were two industries that saw significant declines in employment in that downturn. The end of the \"dot-com\" euphoria and structural shifts in the manufacturing sector caused those two industries to be disproportionately affected, while we had only modest declines in the cyclical construction industry, and increases in employment in several industries. Similarly, the 1990 recession had a decline in employment of more than 5 percent in only the construction industry, when overbuilding in several regions of the country led to a significant readjustment in construction-industry employment.\nIn fact, in each of the three previous recessions there was a decline of 5 percent or more in no more than two industry categories - as the figure shows - with many industries experiencing little or no net job loss over the course of the recession. Structural shifts across industries are not uncommon in recessions - and also, some structural dislocation seems inevitable as it will always take some time for capital and labor to flow to those industries with the greatest opportunities.\nIn rather stark contrast, the most recent recession is far less a reflection of dislocation in a few industries but rather reflects a general decline in almost all industries. As the chart on the far right shows, in this recession there has been a peak to trough loss of employment of 5 percent or greater in construction, manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, transportation, information technology, financial activities, and professional and business services. To me, this does not suggest that the driver is structural change in the economy increasing job mismatches - although no doubt some of that exists - but instead I see here a widespread decline in demand across most industries.\nNot surprisingly, given this far-reaching decline in labor demand, job vacancies are remarkably low. Not only are they low, but they are also well below the experience in most recent recessions, making small movements in job-vacancy rates particularly difficult to interpret. For example, economists and forecasters are estimating Beveridge curves (plotting the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment)[Footnote 2] well outside historical experience, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about recent movements.\nFigure 2 highlights that job mismatches are not the primary problem. The bottom chart shows that the percentage of small businesses with one or more hard-to-fill jobs open is near the low point for the series over nearly 25 years. According to survey data, businesses are having no problem finding skilled workers for what were considered hard-to-fill vacancies. This is consistent with my ongoing discussions with representatives of businesses, who generally report no difficulty finding qualified workers even for quite specialized positions.\nHowever, as the top chart on the figure shows, most small businesses are not expecting to increase employment. When I talk with representatives of businesses, the primary reason they give for this is they are not seeing sufficient demand for their products. If they were confident that demand would pick up, they would - and easily could - hire additional workers.\nBalance Sheet Adjustments?\nAnother impediment to a more robust recovery could well be balance sheet adjustments by financial and nonfinancial firms, and households. To explore this, let's examine this cycle in some more detail. Figure 3 splits the time since the onset of the recession into three periods:\nThe first period runs from the beginning of the recession in December 2007 through August 2008.  Up to that point, the recession looked quite similar in depth and duration to previous recessions.  The only sector with a very substantial decline in employment was the construction industry. \nThe second period is from August 2008 through June 2009.  After the large financial shocks that occurred in September and October of 2008, there were large and widespread declines in employment across a wide variety of industries.  Both the disruption of credit and concerns that we could see an extremely severe contraction caused most businesses to become far more cautious. \nThe final period, from June 2009 to the present, encompasses the recovery to date.  This recovery has been quite slow, with continued sharp declines in construction activity.  In fact, the first year of the recovery has an employment pattern similar to shallow recessions, indicating just how weak the recovery has been so far. \nMost forecasts of employment and unemployment during this period did not anticipate the severe turn of events. Figure 4 provides the Blue Chip forecast for unemployment at the beginning of the first two periods in the charts we just saw - and the actual unemployment experience. In December 2007, few saw cause for great alarm. The expectation was that unemployment would remain stable near 5 percent, when in fact what actually happened was a marked increase in the unemployment rate.\nIn part, the forecasts were off because many of the financial disruptions that were already evident were not well captured in econometric models. Also, recessions are notoriously difficult to predict, and most models struggle to capture turning points.\nThe second chart on Figure 4 shows that even in August 2008, many forecasts did not predict great difficulties. For the most part, the unemployment rate was expected to remain near 6 percent, when in reality it rose to over 9 percent. Thus, one month before the worst of the financial crisis emerged, there was little expectation of a significant financial shock or the major impact that it would have on the overall economy.\nFortunately, the Federal Reserve had already begun to ease - and continued to ease quite dramatically - despite most forecasts predicting a more benign outcome. We had already reduced the federal funds rate very substantially by August, and as a result of the financial crisis eventually pushed the federal funds rate essentially to its lower bound of zero. Thus, during much of this period monetary policy was quite proactive. While it could not offset the effects of the severe problems emerging in the economy, the policy stance was more responsive than if it had been in synch with most private forecasts at the time. This policymaking was key to avoiding far worse outcomes.\nFigure 5 looks at the forecasts for unemployment at the end of this year over the span of time I referred to as the recovery period. At the beginning of 2010, the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent. As the figure shows, there has been a consistent view that the recovery would be weak and make only limited progress on reducing unemployment. While through April the forecasts were getting more optimistic about labor market trends, since then forecasters have been raising their forecasts for unemployment. Regrettably, I have to concur with the view expressed in these forecasts - that the unemployment rate is likely to be very close to the very elevated level at the beginning of the year.\nFigure 6 provides some context for that pessimism. While two of the past four quarters had growth (in blue) above estimates of potential, the expansion in what we call \"final sales\" (in red) has been below potential. Since by definition the difference between GDP and final sales reflects inventories, we need final sales to pick up - especially as temporary stimulus from inventories, and government, subsides. Unfortunately, there is little evidence in the data of that happening, with growth in the second half of 2010 likely to be in the vicinity of 2 percent.\nThe bottom graph on Figure 6 shows the change in the employment-to-population ratio (in green). While there was employment growth in the first half of 2010, it has only resulted in a slight improvement in the employment-to-population ratio.\nWith that background, let me note that one challenge in getting the economy to grow faster has been the desire of households and businesses to essentially \"rebuild\" their balance sheets in the wake of this so-called \"Great Recession.\" Figure 7highlights that the personal savings rate has risen, and Figure 8 shows that households have increased their holdings of cash and securities. While rebuilding wealth and remaining more liquid are natural reactions to recent conditions - and positive in a long-term sense - the fact is they portend rather modest increases in consumption in the near term, until consumers become more confident about their prospects.\nFigure 9 highlight that businesses and banks have also been increasing their holdings of cash and securities. While this is natural, such behavior will likely keep growth in business fixed investment rather restrained.\nThe Policy Response\nSo how should monetary policy react to a very anemic recovery? The usual monetary policy response to slow growth in nominal GDP would be to continue reducing the federal funds rate, and during the past two slow recoveries that is what the Federal Reserve did. As I have already highlighted, by central bank standards we moved rather quickly to recognize the severity of the problem in this downturn, and responded with monetary accommodation. However, since the end of 2008 the federal funds rate has been bounded by zero, which has eliminated the ability to decrease short-term interest rates.\nA simple Taylor Rule calculation, shown in Figure 10, relates movements in the federal funds rate to deviations in inflation and unemployment from their targets. The far right section of the chart highlights that given the very low level of inflation and the very high level of the unemployment rate, the Fed would have continued to reduce the funds rate over the past two years, but for the zero lower bound.\nConstrained by the zero bound, the Federal Reserve utilized less conventional policies - as shown in Figure 11. Most of these approaches had never been tried in the United States prior to the crisis. New policies outside of historical experience necessarily involve some uncertainty about their impact. We were fortunate that Chairman Bernanke and the Federal Open Market Committee had the courage to undertake unconventional policies in the \"teeth\" of a crisis. It is easy - and I dare say commonplace - to underestimate the economic disruption that would likely have arisen if we at the Fed had stuck to our \" comfort zone.\"\nIt is easy with hindsight to see the financial meltdown as an historic economic crisis, one that galvanized officials to push out the boundaries of policymaking and take action. But in my view, current economic conditions - an unemployment rate near 10 percent, sluggish growth, and undesirably low inflation - together constitute a serious economic problem. While it's clear to everyone why a high unemployment rate is a problem, one of the reasons we worry about a too-low rate of inflation is that the closer to zero the inflation rate gets, the greater the risk it could fall into a harmful deflation.\nAs I said earlier, we do have options, despite having pushed short-term rates to the zero lower bound. One of the challenges is that with unconventional policies, costs can be apparent but benefits more indirect, and harder to track.\nThe Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchases - primarily purchases of mortgage-backed securities - arguably had multiple effects, including maintaining market function in the mortgage markets. But in my view their primary impact on the economy was achieved by reducing mortgage rates. Rates had been around 6 percent prior to the change in policy, and moved closer to 5 percent as our purchases began to accumulate, as shown in Figure 12. It also appears that by \"removing duration\" from the market, other long-term rates were also reduced in response to our purchases.\nOf course, none of this is easy or without complications. There are concerns about things like creating distortions in credit allocation, complicating exit strategies when they become appropriate, and exposing the Federal Reserve to interest-rate risk. Those issues are important to recognize, and to work to mitigate. At the same time, we cannot take lightly how far off the mark unemployment and inflation seem to be.\nNow I'd like to make a few observations on Fed purchases of Treasury securities.\nFirst, the positives: Purchases of long-term Treasury securities are likely to push down long-term interest rates on Treasury bonds, but also are likely to reduce rates on other long-term securities. Some have argued that it would be difficult to reduce Treasury rates further, but Figure 13 highlights, importantly, that U.S. Treasury rates are still well above the zero bound, roughly equivalent to rates in Germany, and well above long-term rates in Japan.\nNow some concerns: While purchases of Treasury securities have the advantage of not directly \"allocating credit\" to a particular industry, they have the disadvantage of only indirectly affecting the private borrowing rates that more directly affect private investment spending. In addition, Treasury purchases raise for some a concern that the Fed intends to monetize the federal debt, using monetary policy to accommodate the financing of fiscal policy. I can assure you that we have no desire or intention whatsoever to do so.\nWhile lower long-term rates are likely the primary channel through which asset purchases would influence the economy, purchases of Treasury or mortgage-backed securities also expand the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and increase the amount of reserves in the financial system. This expansion of reserves might serve as an effective signal that highlights the determination of the Federal Reserve to reduce disinflationary pressures.\nCertainly, views on securities purchases differ within the ranks of policymakers and all manner of observers. I would just reiterate that it is important to keep firmly in mind the goal of such purchases: to stimulate the economy by reducing long-term interest rates to a level that is more consistent with where they would be, were we able to further reduce the federal funds rate.\nConcluding Observations\nWhile the economy is growing, it is currently growing too slowly to significantly reduce the unemployment rate or stem disinflationary pressures created by the high degree of slack in the economy. While fiscal policies may be the most effective way to stimulate the economy when short-term interest rates approach the zero bound, unconventional monetary policies provide additional policy options. Of course, policymakers need to carefully weigh the benefits and costs of unconventional monetary policy - some of which I have tried to share with you today. Yet all in all, my firm view is that it is important that policymakers be open to implementing policies consistent with achieving full employment, and an appropriate level of inflation, within a reasonable time frame.

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Federal Reserve Conference on REO and Vacant Property Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization\n[Slide 1] I'm very happy to be here today, to take part in a conference on topics of such importance.\nHousing has played a central role in the financial crisis and the subsequent economic difficulties that we have been experiencing now for more than three years. [Note]\nThis conference brings together people from around the country who have been on the front lines looking for solutions to mitigate the personal and societal costs of mounting foreclosures, and the buildup of REO properties. By gathering together, we can learn from each other's successes - and also from each other's well-intentioned failures.\nI expect we will learn that a single solution may not work in all regions of the country. What seems promising in Cleveland and in other cities in the northern Midwest may not be the best solution for New England, or for Southern California. The reason, I suspect, is that the effects of the housing and financial crisis on any community depend, importantly, on the attributes of the community. For example, how susceptible is the population to extended spells of unemployment or other income disruptions? How healthy was the local economy and industry before the crisis? And how well-equipped are local nonprofit and governmental institutions - and civic leaders - to respond to the fallout from the crisis?\n[Slide 2] My comments today will focus on the foreclosure and REO problem in my region - New England. In particular, I want to ask how best to understand the problem: Is it a housing problem that affects all communities similarly? Or is it a foreclosure and REO problem that affects all communities in a similar way? Or is the problem better understood as a crisis that is reflected differently in each community, and thus requires solutions that are very likely to differ, across communities?\nI'll just take a moment to preview my remarks. I will first show that New England locations, defined by zip codes, with a high concentration of REO properties have (not surprisingly) incurred larger declines in home prices than zip codes with lower REO concentrations. I will then highlight that many of these same communities were areas that faced challenges even before the foreclosure crisis - challenges that made these communities more likely to suffer disproportionately the consequences of the crisis. [Footnote 1]\nI will then touch briefly on research and policy implications. In particular, do we need more holistic approaches to addressing this crisis? Should there be more state and federal revenue sharing focused on providing flexible funds to the communities most affected? My answer to both of these questions is a yes. But I would also argue that we need to not only explore alternative solutions, but also do a much better job of establishing which solutions work - and then try to replicate effective solutions on a larger scale.\nHow Should the Foreclosure Problem Be Framed?\n[Slide 3] Finding the right solution requires asking the right question. So I want to begin by asking, what is the question we are trying to answer?\nTo that end I suggest we do a little exercise. We might gain some insight into how the attendees at this conference are framing the question by looking at the non-profit organizations on the program. What is their key focus? If we assume the name of an organization was chosen to indicate its central mission, by noting the keyword in the name we may learn something about their primary focus. On the agenda for this conference, five non-profit organizations have \"community\" or \"neighborhood\" in their names; two have \"housing\" ; and one has \"foreclosure\" or \"REO.\" Most of you are no doubt focusing on rising foreclosures and REO properties, but it seems that you see these through the \"lens\" of community. However, it is less clear that public policies have been similarly aligned.\n[Slide 4] To help illustrate why the framing of a problem is important, we should consider what the focus might be if we assume different primary objectives.\nIf one looks at the problem as primarily a foreclosure and REO problem rooted in the housing bubble, the solutions will tend to emphasize mitigating the foreclosure problem or accelerating the disposition of REO properties.  Some will also advocate for a reconsideration of the legal system’s approach to personal bankruptcy and foreclosure. \nIf, instead, one views the problem as being primarily a housing problem, you might address the problem differently.  You might focus on solutions that result in sustainable home ownership.  For example, what should be the minimum down payment on a house, and what financing approaches would results in sustainable home ownership?  The solutions to this sort of a problem might be focusing on financial education, addressing predatory home financing, and redefining appropriate underwriting standards.  The availability of affordable rental housing might also be a focus. \nIf the problem is seen through the lens of community, however, foreclosure may be viewed as a symptom of broader problems affecting neighborhoods – such as high concentrations of unemployment, elevated crime rates, and poor code enforcement.  Let me be clear; I am not saying that “the community is the problem,” but rather that, in this view, different communities will experience problems differently because of their different characteristics, requiring different solutions in many cases.  The public policy solution for this problem may be to have more general revenues available for non-profits and local governments to address the problem in a more holistic fashion.\n[Slide 5] Clearly there are elements of all three in the current crisis. This is a foreclosure problem. This is a housing problem. This is a community problem. However, as I just illustrated, the solutions may be somewhat different, depending on how one frames the problem. So, we should ask, do we have the right balance as we think about the best way to address a serious - and I would argue multifaceted - public policy problem? My own view is that too little focus has been on community problems because the focus has been more targeted to housing and foreclosures.\nEvidence from New England\n[Slide 6] As we consider these questions, I'd like to share with you some evidence from New England - and in particular Greater Boston.\n[Slide 7] The first chart provides REO per square mile in three New England states by zip code and compares that with the change in the median housing sales price from 2005 to 2008 for the same zip code. As you can see in the chart, in areas with a lower concentration of REO there is not a strong correlation with changes in median sales price. However, as the concentration of REO increases there is a much stronger correlation with median sales price change. Zip codes with higher concentrations of REO tend to have seen larger declines in median sales price.\nLet me be quick to acknowledge the open question of causality. We are doing more statistical work to try to understand the causality in the REO-concentration and house-price relationship. That work needs to also control for factors such as population density.\n[Slide 8] The next figure highlights that high concentrations of REO are not the only problem afflicting those communities. Zip codes with four or more REOs per square mile also have higher property crime rates, higher rates of low birth-weight babies, higher unemployment rates, and weaker small business activity. Note that all these charts are for the time period that generally precedes the foreclosure crisis, so these communities were already challenged.\n[Slide 9] Indeed, the next figure highlights that children in these communities were being impacted even before the dramatic increase in foreclosures. Communities that would eventually have four or more REO properties per square mile had higher high school drop-out rates and higher failures in statewide math tests.\nIt is hard to imagine that dramatic increases in foreclosure rates would not exacerbate these problems. A foreclosure is likely to mean not only a loss of home, but also a disruption in where, or whether, kids are in school. Since foreclosure is often related to unemployment, marital stress, or physical ailments, the foreclosure is likely to make it difficult for even the most determined student to excel. The impact of the foreclosure crisis on children is something we are trying to better understand at the Boston Fed.\nThe bottom chart on slide 9 highlights that these communities have a large gap between their municipal service needs and their ability to raise revenues to pay for those needs (…the so-called \"fiscal gap\" ). A recent study at the Boston Fed highlights that non-school revenue sharing in Massachusetts is not well aligned with communities' fiscal gaps. [Footnote 2] Changes in revenue sharing are critical to helping those communities address their problems. Potentially, a federal revenue sharing program at the national level that focuses on these communities could help. These funds could be provided in a flexible way so they could target those areas of most importance - since local governments may be in a better position to determine if the funds should be directed to more teachers, more code enforcement, more police, or more assistance to non-profit organizations that are making a difference in their communities.\n[Slide 10] Now, since a picture is worth a thousand words, I would like to show you some maps that demonstrate how clusters of REO are associated with a host of other community problems.\nThe next five figures [Slide 11] , [Slide 12] , [Slide 13] , [Slide 14] , [Slide 15]] show the community patterns in the data. Those communities with very high REO per square mile also fare poorly in many other dimensions. Many communities are performing poorly in all the criteria illustrated in the figures. If these are community problems, we may need to search for community solutions.\nImplications for Research and Policy\n[Slide 16] The patterns in these data imply a need for more holistic approaches to the problem. This is not a one-size-fits-all foreclosure or housing problem; these are community problems. Of course, I am showing you examples from New England and one needs to examine how similar or dissimilar the patterns are in other regions.\nBut it seems, in sum, that communities with some of these challenging attributes are likely to experience higher rates of foreclosure and REO. And the same communities experience greater hardships in the face of rising foreclosures and REO.\nRather than treating the symptom - the high REO problem - we need to better understand how to resolve the more general problems in communities that lead to higher concentrations of REOs and exacerbate the effects of high REOs. However, the challenge of finding holistic solutions is significant, and longstanding.\nI am encouraging Boston Fed staff to work to better understand how foreclosures and REO can exacerbate problems in troubled communities - and to look for data that can better determine which solutions work, under which circumstances. For example, we have been examining the issues and barriers keeping the city of Springfield, Massachusetts from prosperity, with an eye to assisting Springfield and also sharing the lessons more broadly. As part of that work we have examined the factors that have helped other similar cities around the country achieve a greater degree of resurgence.[Footnote 3]\nI am particularly encouraging my staff to look at how foreclosures affect children. While not responsible for the foreclosure problem, children may be affected by its consequences for years to come, if it prevents them from meeting their potential in school and eventually in the labor force.\n[Slide 17] While more research needs to be done on the communities, and on which solutions work, we should also reflect on how we are spending our public policy dollars. Are they appropriately balanced to the problems of housing, foreclosure, and community need? If a more holistic approach is needed, states and the federal government may need to examine the most effective and efficient way to address the broader problems in these communities, including potentially looking at revenue sharing that provides a flexible way to address the fiscal gap faced by many of our hard-pressed communities.\nThank you. I believe we are now proceeding to the next session on the conference agenda.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "The Money Marketeers of New York University New York\nI am happy to be with you this evening. I appreciate your warm welcome, and your invitation to join the long and distinguished line of individuals who have addressed the Money Marketeers over the decades.[Note]\nI have always taken some delight in Yogi Berra quotes. As a Red Sox fan, I could always hope that garbled metaphors by the legendary Yogi would be as confusing to the players as they were to the public, which might translate into opportunities when the Red Sox came to New York. Alas, in the early going this season it is not the Yankees that seem confused.\nYogi Berra was not only a great catcher and manager, but also an astute observer of the obvious. If he were to summarize this talk he might suggest a title like \"Knowing Your Destination is a Good Start in Getting Where You Are Going\" or some other derivation of what I believe is his actual quote: \"You've got to be very careful if you don't know where you are going because you might not get there.\"\nWhen setting monetary policy, it is very important to have a clear idea of where you want the economy to go. And fortunately, there is now much more transparency about the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) expected destination, because the FOMC releases its long-term projections for inflation and unemployment. Unfortunately, however, actually reaching our desired destination will prove challenging and involve choices, as I will discuss this evening.\nAt our January meeting, the central tendency of the FOMC members' long-run projections for unemployment was 5.0 to 5.2 percent, and for inflation (measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index or PCE) was 1.7 to 2.0 percent. At present, both unemployment and inflation diverge significantly from these longer-term goals, with the March unemployment rate at 9.7 percent, and core PCE inflation over the past year at 1.3 percent. In such circumstances, one might think that the current path of monetary policy would be particularly straightforward.\nUnfortunately, just knowing your destination doesn't get you there. To reach your destination you need to know how you want to get there. If I plug a destination into my new GPS device, it asks whether I want the quickest route, or the geographically shortest route, or a route that meets some other criteria. The quickest route is likely to involve highways, but may cover more miles. The shortest route may take side roads that reduce distance and save gas, but take substantially more time. And, of course, you may run into traffic or construction that forces you to adapt your route.\nWhen setting monetary policy there may be a variety of paths you can take to reach the destination. For instance, aggressive pursuit of accommodative monetary policy by the Fed and stimulative fiscal policy by Congress and the Administration might get us more quickly to our desired destination - but could enlarge the deficit or risk igniting inflation expectations. Alternatively, aggressive pursuit of less accommodative policies - that is, removing monetary and fiscal stimulus sooner rather than later - could result in a more extended period of underutilized resources; or worse, significantly increase the length of the journey to our ultimate destination.\nRight now, we are far from our destination, and the rest of my remarks will focus on selecting among the alternate routes to our objective.\nThe economy is currently beginning to recover from what many are calling the Great Recession. While real GDP began to increase in the third quarter of last year, growth so far has been insufficient to improve conditions much in the labor markets. This unfortunate reality can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the employment-to-population ratio over the past 30 years with the shading representing recessions. The decline of about five percentage points in the employment-to-population ratio in this recession is striking, as many workers have either become unemployed or dropped out of the work force.\nWhile it is not uncommon for the employment-to-population ratio to decline in a recession, Figure 2 shows how dramatic the decline has been in this recession, compared with previous ones.[Footnote 1] The loss of jobs has been particularly acute in construction and manufacturing. The severity of the job losses in these male-dominated industries is one of the reasons that males in some age groups have experienced such a significant decline in their employment-to-population ratio, as shown in Figure 3. For example, the March unemployment rates for males between the ages of 20 and 24 was 18.4 percent, more than 5 percentage points higher than for females in the same age group.\nThe sharp reduction in the ratio of employment to population highlights our challenge - achieving a full recovery will require creating jobs for those currently unemployed and actively seeking work, those entering the labor force as the population grows, and those likely to return to the labor force once jobs become more available. Employing all these workers within a reasonable period of time will require very strong economic growth. The question is, how likely is that?\nFigure 4 shows the growth rate in each of the first three years of the last three recoveries, as well as the average rates for all three recoveries. The most recent two recoveries were quite slow to get started, but picked up steam over time. This is the pattern projected in most forecasts for this recovery.\nOver the past three quarters, GDP has increased 3.7 percent.[Footnote 2] However, some of the growth resulted from temporary rebalancing of inventories by businesses, as suggested by Figure 5, which shows that the percent change in real final sales was quite a bit smaller than the percent change in GDP. The gap between them would be inventory rebuilding.\nMost private forecasts expect growth in the next four quarters to be fast enough to begin to make more improvement in the labor market. My own expectation is consistent with this. As financial headwinds subside, and consumers and businesses gain more confidence in the recovery, expenditures that have been deferred will be made - and we should begin to see stronger economic growth.\nDespite this forecast of an improved outlook, we will need very strong growth if we are to return to 5 percent unemployment in a reasonable time frame. Economists frequently use a rule of thumb, called Okun's Law, to characterize the relationship between output growth and unemployment. According to Okun's Law, if the economy grows one percentage point faster than its potential for one year, the result will be a decline in the unemployment rate of approximately one-half of a percent. Of course, I would highlight that this is a rule of thumb, and that the relationship is more complicated than this and, of course, subject to error.\nBut using the simple rule of thumb implied by Okun's Law, the left side of Figure 6 shows the rates of GDP growth necessary to return unemployment to 5 percent over different time frames. The chart highlights that we need several years of very strong growth to reach 5 percent unemployment. For example, to reach 5 percent unemployment by the end of 2013, real GDP growth would have to average 5 percent per year.[Footnote 3] Such a growth rate has some historical precedent, as shown on the right side of the chart, but it is much faster than the growth rate in the past two recoveries. And to reach 5 percent unemployment by 2015 would still take growth averaging 4.2 percent per year - considerably faster than the average rate of growth after the 1991 and 2001 recessions.\nGiven the need for very rapid growth to get unemployment back to 5 percent, let me pose an oversimplified question - why would policymakers not keep monetary policy very accommodative, and fiscal policy very stimulative, until we had a sustained growth rate that brought the economy much closer to full employment? At least on the monetary side, one reason might be concern among policymakers that rapid growth would be inflationary.\nTo explore that, let's turn to Figure 7, which shows the total and core inflation rates, measured by changes in the CPI, with recession shading. What the chart shows is that inflation has declined in each recession, including this so-called Great Recession. It also highlights that inflation tends to continue falling in the early stages of a recovery. Figure 8 shows the change in the inflation rate from the business cycle peak. From the peak (shown at zero on the horizontal axis) the inflation rate is very restrained, and generally negative, for many months. With substantial excess capacity in the economy during the early stages of a recovery, workers don't tend to demand higher wages, and firms don't feel at liberty to substantially increase prices. Since the Great Recession has resulted in substantial excess capacity, it would be unusual to see increases in the inflation rate in the early stages of this recovery.\nHowever, while inflation does not normally increase in the early stages of a recovery, some economic observers may be concerned that this recovery will be different, because of the unusual actions that the Federal Reserve needed to take. As you know, the Federal Reserve took extraordinary measures to stabilize the financial system - measures that were critical to setting the stage for the current recovery. Figure 9 depicts the additions to the central bank's balance sheet from these temporary operations. As you can see in the chart, the liquidity facilities that we set up to restore more effective financial market functioning have wound down. At the same time, however, in response to the severity of the economic recession the Federal Reserve decided to expand its purchases of mortgage-backed and agency securities. These purchases were undertaken to improve market functioning in the mortgage market, and even more importantly, as a way to reduce a key interest rate at a time when many short-term interest rates were close to, or at, the zero lower bound.\nThe purchase program ended in March, and these balances will naturally be dropping over time as households prepay mortgages, sell their homes, or refinance. This decline in our balance sheet will actually occur without the Fed taking any specific actions. But it will occur slowly, and absent any action of the Fed's part, the balance sheet will remain elevated for years.\nThis expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet raises concerns for some observers and commentators. An important side effect of our asset purchases has, necessarily, been a dramatic swelling of so called excess reserves in the banking system. When the central bank purchases assets, it credits the selling institution with reserves. Over time, banks could choose to lend out these reserves, which would turn the reserves into broader money - and a rapid expansion of the broader money supply would be inflationary. However, as Figure 10 suggests, the current problem is not a rapid expansion in lending and the money supply. In fact, quite the opposite; banks have been reluctant to lend. Many have taken significant losses that have drained their capital; and, at the same time, the financial condition of many potential borrowers is worse than before the recession.[Footnote 4]\nWere that situation to change and bank lending to accelerate, the Federal Reserve could drain the excess reserves from the banking system. We have a variety of tools. We could sell some of our long-term assets, thereby increasing longer-term interest rates. We now pay interest on reserves, and that rate could be increased to discourage bank lending. The size of our balance sheet, the composition of the balance sheet, and our short-term interest rate target are all instruments that we have available to reach our destination of full employment with stable prices. Fundamentally, decisions about shrinking our balance sheet - like decisions to tighten interest rates - should be conditional on economic conditions.\nSome analysts warn of rapid inflation arising from the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet; but these forecasts have not been borne out. In fact, despite the buildup in excess reserves, the inflation rate has been falling - and I expect this trend to continue over the near term. The experience in both Japan and the United States is that after a banking crisis, excess reserves have not been inflationary in the short term. Of course, once the banks have recapitalized and economic resources are more fully utilized, we would not want to have a large stock of excess reserves. Again, as noted, we have a variety of tools to remove excess reserves at a time when that becomes appropriate.\nAs a result, I agree with many forecasters who expect disinflation in the near term. The substantial excess capacity in labor markets that I mentioned earlier has caused compensation to decline quite markedly (see Figure 11). Because employee compensation is the main cost component for most companies, lower labor costs enable businesses to improve profit margins without substantial price increases - particularly as the demand for goods and services improves.\nThis brings us back to Yogi Berra, who famously said, \"When you come to a fork in the road, take it.\" At times, a fork in the road is exactly what confronts monetary policymakers. We would face a fork, for example, if inflationary pressures were building despite a high unemployment rate. In this case, the choice between restraining inflation and supporting employment is a difficult one, and the policy decision becomes more complicated. However, with employment well below the level of full employment, and disinflation continuing to move us away from my own inflation target of 2 percent, one does not currently need to make such trade-offs.\nAnother possible complication could occur if very low interest rates were causing excessive, leveraged bets that were inflating the price of assets that have macroeconomic importance. While we need to be vigilant against the buildup of asset bubbles, there is little evidence of such a problem now. Many financial institutions are still deleveraging - a factor in why we are seeing too little lending rather than too much. Real estate can be a very important asset because it serves as collateral for many loans. However, in the current situation both residential and commercial real estate are, at best, stabilizing.\nEven if we were to see asset prices rising, it is not obvious that somewhat tighter interest rates will make a significant difference. A more targeted approach would be to examine whether supervisors should require tighter lending standards, or higher capital requirements, in areas where asset prices are appreciating rapidly. This would make sense from the perspective of good risk management - if institutions hold assets that appreciate quickly, they should retain sufficient capital and be vigilant in credit standards to insure that they can weather a quick reversal in asset prices. Raising short-term interest rates because of exuberance in one market is a blunt, and possibly ineffective, tool against the exuberance of investors in a particular asset. As a result, in my view, short-term interest rate-setting is better suited for calibrating the growth in the overall economy, rather than focusing on a particular asset class.\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum, while the incoming economic data have certainly been more positive of late, we remain far from our \"stated\" destination. Even with rapid growth in the economy, spurred by accommodative monetary policy and stimulative fiscal policy, it is likely to take years before we approach the growth and inflation rates that would really reflect achievement of the two elements of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.\nThe economy, while in a much better place than a year ago, is still susceptible to negative shocks. Serious fiscal problems loom for state and local governments, the U.S. government, and governments around the world - particularly those that have expended large sums of money to recover from this financial crisis and recession. Clearly over time we need to have much more sustainable levels of budget deficits, at all levels of government, here in the U.S. and abroad.[Footnote 5] However, I would just note that rapid movement to fiscal austerity, like rapid removal of monetary accommodation, could of course significantly delay the time it takes to reach full employment.\nWhile financial markets have improved significantly, real estate problems, bank closures, and significant non-performing loans on the books of many banks continue to provide financial headwinds to the recovery. And clearly - as the headlines of the past week have highlighted - financial problems abroad still have the potential to result in slower U.S. exports, and may hold potential further problems for global financial institutions.\nIn sum, my view is that with inflation expectations stable, core PCE inflation rates declining, and significant excess capacity in the economy, accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate.\nThank you.",

            "content": "The Global Interdependence Center's Conference on \"Financial Interdependence in the World's Post-Crisis Capital Markets\" Philadelphia\nThank you, Charles, for your kind introduction. I am very happy to be here today, to offer some perspectives on central banking and systemic supervision in an interdependent world - and in particular some lessons from the past that may serve us well in the future.[Note]\nThe past three years have dramatically underscored the interdependence of the world's financial institutions and financial markets. The financial crisis also, by the way, increased awareness of the interdependence of the actions of monetary and fiscal authorities around the world. In light of the crisis and the reality of financial interdependence, the Federal Reserve expanded the types of policy actions it was willing to take. My view is that our openness to innovative measures was critical to avoiding far more severe outcomes - by which I mean cascading failures of financial firms and a locking up of liquidity and credit extension, further impeding households and companies and eventually leading to unemployment that far exceeds our current, far too high, level.\nHowever, I must also stress that the nation's \"financial crisis toolkit\" was, unfortunately, incomplete, resulting in the Federal Reserve needing to reluctantly take some controversial actions - notably as a result of government in general lacking adequate tools or powers to address the resolution (or \"winding down\" ) of certain institutions, especially systemically important nonbank financial firms. If the U.S. puts in place better resolution powers for such institutions, the Federal Reserve will not need to be involved in lending under unusual and exigent circumstances to systemically important institutions that we have no regulatory or supervisory powers over, to prevent even worse outcomes. Unfortunately, at this point the U.S. is operating with the same incomplete toolkit available to policymakers that we had before the crisis. I know that Congress is considering various proposals for financial regulatory reform. My hope is that establishing resolution authority for systemically important nonbank financial firms will be an area with broad bipartisan agreement and support for change.\nLooking Back, to Look Forward\nDespite the Fed's aggressive use of both traditional and non-traditional policy tools, the economy is experiencing a slow recovery from a very severe recession, particularly when it comes to jobs.[Footnote 1] Still, with recent events fresh in our minds it is an appropriate time to discuss the actions a central bank should take during a crisis - and in the periods that precede a crisis - and the tools and powers needed to help avoid future crises. Of course, policymakers and lawmakers are studying these matters right now.\nSo now is the time to be compiling and applying the lessons of the crisis and its lead-up. But as I've noted in other talks, we must learn the right lessons, not necessarily the commonly accepted ones. The generally accepted narrative does not always stand up to closer scrutiny, and reacting to these narratives might lead to the wrong remedies. When you consider the human toll of this financial crisis and recession, nothing is more important than making sure we parse out and learn the \"real\" lessons. Otherwise the fixes may miss the mark and invite unintended consequences.\nSo today I would like to pose some key questions: Did monetary policy cause the housing bubble that played such a large role in this crisis? Was it, as some have suggested, mainly due to the Fed keeping rates too low for too long, after the 2001 recession? Or should our attention be less on monetary policy and more on supervisory policy? Looking forward, what are the best remedies to avoid a similar crisis in the future? Do we need traditional supervision done better, as some assume, or do we need something quite different? And does the recent financial crisis and recession suggest, as some say, that the central bank should not be involved in supervising financial institutions and mitigating financial instability, going forward?\nAgain, my focus is on avoiding future financial crises. In that spirit, I will touch on the ways that the Federal Reserve could and should use a combination of monetary and supervisory tools to foster better macroeconomic outcomes. To do this, I will look back at our recent economic history - specifically, the early part of the last decade[Footnote 2] - to investigate whether we could have employed a better mix of policy actions to strengthen the economy after the 2001 recession while avoiding the buildup of financial imbalances that occurred - in other words, avoiding the bubble that eventually burst.\nCauses of the Crisis?\nAs we unpack these issues I should begin by emphasizing that understanding the causes of asset-price \"bubbles\" is very difficult. Most economists are uncharacteristically humble in admitting their ignorance about what causes asset prices to diverge from their fundamentals (in other words, what causes bubbles).\nStill, research by Boston Fed economists points to a clear role for house prices in the recent crises. The rapid ascent of house prices - which started in 1998, accelerated in 2004, and reversed in 2006 - is in our view central to understanding the eventual challenges. The expectation of rising prices provided the incentive for potential homeowners to invest more in housing, and made them - and their lenders - more comfortable with putting relatively little money down. Rising prices also mitigated the risk to institutions and investors that held assets based on these mortgages. After all, as long as prices continued to rise, mortgage holders who got into financial trouble could sell or refinance rather than default, insulating the holders of their mortgages from financial loss. This encouraged more relaxed credit standards, including low downpayments. Of course, a higher loan-to-value ratio exposed the homeowner and the lender to risk should prices fall significantly, but this risk was judged to be minimal. House prices were expected to continue rising.\nThere is evidence that financial institutions understood the risks that would arise if house prices fell, but assigned too low a probability to this potential outcome. Thus they were woefully unprepared to weather the consequences when prices did indeed fall. Many investors believed that rising house prices made the possibility of significant losses on securitized pools of subprime loans remote.[Footnote 3] They realized that a significant decline in house prices would indeed cause subprime securitization deals to suffer enormous losses, but assigned a very low (or nonexistent) probability to the sort of drop in house prices that actually occurred. Although some housing experts had raised concerns that the rise in housing prices was not sustainable, noting unusually high ratios of house prices to income or rent, most took comfort in the fact that nominal housing prices had not fallen at the national level since World War II. Even the pessimistic forecasts tended to envision a gradual leveling off of prices rather than an outright decline.\nThe story fits with the notion of a classic bubble. The key feature of a bubble is that investors willingly pay high prices not because of the asset's intrinsic value, but because they believe some other investor will pay more for it in the future. The other key element of a bubble is that it almost always bursts.\nAll of this implies an important role for supervisors in undertaking scenario analyses that would make clear the exposures to such risks, both for individual institutions and for the financial system as a whole. I will return to this theme in a moment.\nDid Monetary Policy Cause the Bubble?\nAgain, understanding asset bubbles is not easy. One of the most prevalent theories on the source of the bubble involves the low interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve during the recovery from the 2001 recession, when the federal funds rate remained quite low - staying at 1 percent from June 2003 to June 2004 (Figure 1).\nLet's look closely at the episode. At the time, the rationale for maintaining such a low federal funds rate seemed clear. That rationale is summarized in the FOMC's outlook for inflation and unemployment. Figure 2 shows the internal Board of Governors staff forecast - a well-respected input to the FOMC's policy deliberations - for core inflation and unemployment as of the end of 2003. At the time, the Board staff had forecast that the unemployment rate would gradually fall to 5 percent over the next two years, while core inflation (as measured by changes in the core consumer price index or CPI) would edge down slightly and remain around 1.5 percent. Five percent was the staff estimate of \"full employment\" at that time; so to put this another way, the unemployment rate was expected to be above the full employment level for the next two years. Meanwhile, inflation was expected to be low.[Footnote 4]\nWhile the unemployment forecast was spot on, the inflation forecast was, in contrast, too low. Actual inflation was higher and more erratic. Had the Federal Reserve's inflation forecast been more accurate, monetary policy might have been somewhat less accommodative.\nAdditionally, in the post-September 11 environment, potential downside risks to the economy from other terrorist attacks were a concern. Policymakers were also anxious not to repeat the mistakes of their Japanese counterparts in the 1990s, who had withdrawn support prematurely, leading to deflation and a lost decade of economic growth.\nSo, did accommodative interest rates fuel the housing bubble? Actually, the relationship between interest rates and bubbles is not as obvious as one might think. Figure 3 highlights the federal funds rate and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate. While the 30-year rate declined during the period of federal funds rate easing, the drop was relatively modest relative to the decline in the fed funds rate. Over the 10 years shown in the chart, the 30 year mortgage rate averaged 5.99 percent; while during the one-year period when the federal funds rate was 1 percent, the 30-year mortgage rate averaged 5.51 percent. As the federal funds rate increased in 2005 and 2006, the 30-year mortgage rate fluctuated close to the 10 year average.\nSo mortgage rates were a bit lower while Fed policy was accommodative - but not dramatically lower.[Footnote 5] Most economic models of housing price movements would suggest that such relatively modest fluctuations in mortgage rates - less than half a percent - would produce only modest changes in house prices.[Footnote 6]\nMoreover, contrary to the generally-assumed narrative, the empirical link between periods with low interest rates and asset bubbles is not particularly strong. Generally speaking, lower interest rates lead to higher prices for a wide variety of assets, but they do not necessarily lead people to expect continued increases in asset prices - that key characteristic of a bubble that I mentioned a moment ago.\nIn addition, house prices also rose rapidly in other countries - in many cases more rapidly than in the United States. See Figure 4. Ireland and Spain, in particular, witnessed dramatic booms in house prices - and subsequent declines. Note that in contrast Germany, which had the same monetary policy as Ireland and Spain, did not experience a dramatic increase. All this makes it difficult to root an explanation for the bubble entirely in the choices made by U.S. monetary policymakers.\nI am not saying that low rates could have had no role in moving housing prices higher. But I suspect the booming demand for real estate derived in large measure from incorrect expectations that housing prices would not fall, rather than from the short-run effect on housing demand of low short-term rates and slightly lowered mortgage rates.\nPolicy Responses\nIf we cannot predict when bubbles will happen - or even, as many suggest, identify their presence - then what can policymakers do? Financial policymakers can ameliorate the problems that bubbles cause by taking a forward-looking and systemic view of financial risk regulation. Traditional \"prudential\" supervision tends to focus on areas of high risk at individual institutions. Systemic or \"macroprudential\" supervision needs to focus on possible misperceptions (and mispricing) of risk more generally and the way that risk is dispersed throughout the system, directly and indirectly. More scenario analysis, such as that done in the so-called \"stress test\" of large institutions last year, needs to be a focus for future systemic supervision - whether accomplished by a given agency or a council charged with systemic oversight.\nIn the financial context, forward-looking risk regulation focused on scenario analysis may have done a better job of identifying potential risks from a bursting bubble. Properly done, scenario analysis would have highlighted the sensitivity of financial institutions to various risks, like falling house prices. Not that this is easy to do. But certainly it is realistic to say that scenario analysis could have identified that values and ratings of subprime securities (especially the most exotic) were extraordinarily sensitive to assumptions for which no one had especially good information. This suggests the need, going forward, for more \"stress-test\" type exercises - to first identify, and then address,[Footnote 7] emerging risks.\nTraditional bank supervision tends to focus on the current condition of a firm by identifying write-downs of nonperforming assets and validating the ratings of loans and the adequacy of reserves. This partly reflects the current focus in accounting on incurred losses. In contrast, the systemic supervision that is needed would focus on possible future losses and is inherently forward-looking. Doing this well requires an understanding not only of institutions but also markets, and it requires taking into account the full range of outcomes, both expected and potential - including those that have a low likelihood of occurring but that could have serious adverse consequences. While we may not be able to eliminate all bubbles, we should be able to limit the degree to which the financial sector feeds and propagates these booms, and the sector's vulnerability to subsequent busts.\nSuch work is particularly well suited for the Fed. Its role as \"lender of last resort\" (where we lend at a penalty rate and have never had a Discount Window loss), its responsibility for bank supervision, and its constant monitoring of the economy provide the Federal Reserve with a unique window on financial-stability issues. It is a serious gap that there is no assigned responsibility for forward-looking, systemic risk supervision - and filling this gap in some way is probably the highest priority in regulatory reform.\nI would also emphasize the systemic nature of optimal supervision and regulation, because another aspect of achieving financial stability involves understanding the interdependence of financial institutions. Ideally, supervisors should have a good idea of how a failure of one institution would impact its counterparties; as well as the circumstances under which a large number of institutions would become insolvent. Most accounts of the financial crisis make clear how concern about counterparty risk fuelled panic among market participants. It also weighed mightily on policymakers trying to cobble together solutions to the crisis.\nIt goes without saying that understanding counterparty risk can be exceptionally complicated. Large financial institutions have a variety of subsidiaries around the world. As a result of acquisitions they often have legacy information systems that can make it difficult to aggregate their true counterparty exposure to one entity. Certainly this is an area where financial institutions and regulators need to do more work, to be better prepared for any future crises.\nAs part of scenario analysis, firms should be asked by supervisors to provide information on counterparties and exposure, to examine how major counterparty failures would affect them - and, if possible, how their own failure would impact their major counterparties. The regulators should then be able to compare results across institutions to get a better appreciation of, and ability to monitor, the counterparty risk.\nWe want analysts within a given financial institution to realize their firm would take big losses if, for example, a particular asset price were to fall. A systemic supervisor, conducting similar analyses across a variety of institutions, could see if others were in similar shape. And even if this supervisor saw only a small chance of a \"meltdown\" scenario for a particular asset price, they could evaluate the impact and perhaps conclude that the chance of a cascading systemic financial crisis was too big of a chance to take.\nOf course, it is also important to understand under what economic or financial situations such problems might rear their heads. Supervisors need to collect this information regularly, and some public reporting of interconnectedness would provide the public with a useful understanding of the risks inherent in the institutions, markets, and systems on which they rely.\nConcluding Observations\nTo conclude, I would just stress that supervisory tools can and should provide an alternative to monetary policy actions for addressing bubbles or other imbalances in certain areas of the economy or financial system. If we take a good hard analytical look at the last recovery, we see that the low fed funds rate was not the standout, and standalone, culprit that many assume. This is a crucial matter to consider right now, when rates are very low - in my opinion, totally appropriately - because some are predicting that these rates will fuel another bubble.\nFinancial regulatory reform needs to address who has responsibility for regulating and supervising systemic risk as well as who has responsibility for regulating and supervising systemically important institutions. In particular, reform should enhance the potential to wind down or resolve systemically important institutions that are failing. This is critical to avoiding future crises.\nBecause of the substantial synergies between monetary policy, the lender-of-last-resort role, and supervision of banks, I believe the Federal Reserve should play a significant role in overseeing systemically important institutions and addressing systemic risks. It is also important that the Federal Reserve continue to supervise community banks, which provide a window on lending to small businesses and other bank-dependent borrowers. The reality is that supervisory policies should not be independent of monetary policy - and similarly monetary policy should not be conducted without the valuable insights gained from supervision of large and small banks. Understanding the business cycle and its potential impact on the institutions under supervision should be integral to bank supervision and to understanding systemic risk. And supervisory powers provide an important alternative tool to traditional monetary policy as a way to address bubbles and insure the best possible economic outcome.\nThe crisis has highlighted how undesirable it is for the U.S. central bank to have to be involved in the rescue of individual institutions. However, it has also reinforced the important role that the central bank can and should play in maintaining financial stability. Remember that concerns over financial instability and the experience of financial panics were key motivations for the founding of the Federal Reserve by Congress. No one is happy with the current state of the economy and the suffering of so many Americans who seek jobs or face foreclosure. But the Federal Reserve's efforts to help maintain financial stability have averted much worse outcomes.\nI believe the Federal Reserve can and should be more focused on financial stability issues going forward. As a result, whatever actions are taken in Washington with regulatory reform, it is in everyone's interest that any changes not impede the ability of the Federal Reserve to be a lender of last resort or to troubleshoot the functioning of financial markets during a crisis.\nWith all this in mind, I would say that legislation that does not provide a significant supervisory and systemic responsibility for the Federal Reserve risks making us as a nation even less prepared for the next crisis than we were for this one.\nThank you.",

            "content": "The Connecticut Business , Industry Association and the MetroHartford Alliance Economic Summit , Outlook 2010 Hartford, Connecticut\nI am very pleased to be back at this important event, focused on the economy in the year ahead. I thank Jim Smith for that generous introduction, and the CBIA and the MetroHartford Alliance for inviting me to share my perspectives with you. [Note]\nAs we begin a new year, financial markets are in a much better state than they were a year ago. Interest spreads reflecting a \"panic premium\" on risk have narrowed to more normal levels, markets have resumed much more normal trading patterns, and the Federal Reserve is likely to be able to wind down many of its emergency lending facilities without any adverse impacts, as soon as next month - as the Federal Open Market Committee affirmed in its statement last month.\nBut despite the improvement in financial conditions, the recovery in the real economy has proceeded more slowly - with the declines in the first half of 2009 turning to slow but positive growth in the third quarter, and what appears to be stronger growth in the fourth quarter. This is resulting, in part, from firms less aggressively cutting inventories as their sales prospects improve. [Footnote 1]\nIn sum it seems to me that growth will be positive, but slow enough that unemployment remains much higher than I would like. I would be happy if in hindsight it is clear I have been too pessimistic. But as I see it, the economy faces three significant \"headwinds.\"\nFirst, while the banking crisis has passed, banking problems remain. Most economies that experience significant banking problems have been slow to recover, and that is likely to be true this time in the U.S. Loans at banks have declined over the past several quarters, as many businesses are constrained by their balance sheets and reluctant to take on new debt. [Footnote 2] Many banks are also concerned with their balance sheets - and particularly their capital ratios [Footnote 3] -- and have restrained their terms of lending to avoid taking on too much additional risk, given that they are still working through problems with existing loans.\nSecond, consumers and businesses will likely remain cautious - which is consistent with positive but slow growth. Consumption will continue to be subdued, as consumers are fully aware that housing prices are well off their peak, unemployment rates are high, and home foreclosures are continuing. Consumer caution and the desire to rebuild savings will likely result in some increase in the savings rate, which is of course good in the long run but dampens growth in the short term. Many businesses seem likely to only gradually expand investment, at least until they are more confident that the economy will continue expanding even after some of the stimulative government support winds down. Also, many businesses may be limited in how much external funding they can raise.\nThe third headwind involves the fact that recessions this severe have broader ramifications for labor markets. Workers become discouraged and leave the labor force, while the skills of workers that are unemployed for long periods may atrophy, and new entrants in the labor market often have to settle for jobs at levels below what they would be offered in a more robust economy.\nIndeed, to most Americans, economic prospects are better measured by an expansion of jobs rather than growth in GDP. So I would like to spend the rest of my time with you reviewing some of the patterns we have seen in labor markets during early stages of previous recoveries. Of course, given the severity of this recession, consumer and business behavior this time may be somewhat more restrained than in past recoveries.\nTo reveal a bit of the \"punch line,\" my conclusions from the analysis I am about to walk through are that the employment response in the last two recoveries was much slower than it was in the two earlier recoveries in the 1970s and 1980s. [Footnote 4] And unfortunately the financial headwinds, lingering labor market problems, and a cautious attitude of consumers and businesses in the wake of the financial crisis make it likely that recovery in employment terms will also be slow this time.\nUnfortunately, I expect a rather slow recovery in output, and a rather slow recovery in employment given the level of output growth - and I will explain why, this morning. But since unemployment is so fundamentally important, I think it is good to study our labor markets and earlier recovery periods so policymakers, businesses, and workers can anticipate and adapt to the experience we are likely to see.\nIn addition, I would note that during the early phases of a recovery, improvements in unemployment tend to lag those in the economy. But the strength of the recovery is partly dependent on how confident businesses and consumers are becoming that the economy will be able to grow fast enough for tangible progress in labor markets and the recovery will become self sustaining.\nEmployment Patterns in the First Year of Recovery\nAllow me to walk you through a few slides that help illustrate employment patterns in the first year of recoveries.\nGDP growth in the just-completed fourth quarter of 2009 looks like it will prove to have been stronger than in the third quarter, a result largely driven by businesses bringing their significant inventory draw-down to a close.\nAs shown in Figure 1, this is not unusual for the first year of a recovery. Consider the following logic. The difference between real GDP and real final sales is the change in inventories. In the first year of the recovery from the four previous recessions, real GDP grew faster than real final sales. This shows how the normalizing of inventories has been an important source of economic growth in the early stages of most recoveries.\nThe figure shows that the smallest inventory response was in the recovery in the early 1990s. Since inventories are often bank-financed, so-called headwinds provided by the troubles in the banking system that result in credit constraints are, unfortunately, a potential source of restraint on inventory replenishment now, as then. Indeed, research I have done with colleagues Joe Peek and Geoff Tootell confirms that inventory buildup tends to be more restrained during periods of significant banking problems.\nThus today, as in the early 1990s, inventory levels became quite low during this recession as businesses prepared for the worst, and I expect that inventory buildup will be an important source of growth - but also that it will likely be more restrained than one might have otherwise expected, because of tighter credit conditions.\nFigure 2 shows that the past two recoveries did not feature job growth in the first year of the recovery, in sharp contrast to the recoveries of the 1970s and 1980s. The past two recessions had positive economic growth in the first year of the recovery, but it was not rapid enough to generate job growth. In contrast, in the recoveries in the 1970s and 1980s, growth was sufficient to yield employment growth in the first year of the recovery.\nFigure 3 illustrates another pattern typical of recoveries. While there has been a longstanding downward trend in the average weekly hours of production workers, it is common for average hours to decline more steeply during a recession. Note that in prolonged recessions, where the shading is the widest, average weekly hours decline more significantly - as workers are placed on shortened work weeks.\nAs the economy begins to recover, businesses will restore the hours of such workers before hiring additional new workers. Note that in our current recession, there was a significant decline in the hours of production workers, which are just beginning to show signs of a rebound.\nAnother harbinger of a recovery in employment is growth in temporary services. Firms often extend work weeks and hire temporary workers before committing to hiring permanent workers. As Figure 4 highlights, the use of temporary workers fell quite dramatically during the recession, but has been rebounding more recently. Of course temporary jobs reduce the unemployment rate, and provide a needed bridge for workers looking for, but not yet finding, more permanent employment. But when businesses become more confident of the strength of the recovery, they will begin to hire permanent workers rather than rely on temporary workers.\nLabor-Market Dynamics that Impact Employment Growth\nNow I would like to explore with you some of the labor-market dynamics that will likely restrain employment growth in this recovery.\nThe severity of a recession can have a significant impact on how quickly firms resume hiring. As Figure 5 shows, this recession was quite severe in a number of respects. This recession was much longer than typical, making it difficult for those that lost their jobs to find employment. Research has highlighted the fact that workers that have been unemployed for extended periods can have significant difficulty being rehired. It may be that their skills atrophy, or just that their sector of the economy is particularly hard-hit. And potential employers may worry about the underlying reasons for the long unemployment spell.\nAs shown in the figure, currently the percentage of the unemployed who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more is much higher than in previous recessions, at just under 40 percent. This is likely to be one impediment to our seeing significant, speedy declines in unemployment.\nThe next set of challenges is related to the lack of business confidence that I cited earlier. Businesses are most likely to hire new workers when they are confident that their sales and orders will increase significantly for an extended period of time. Absent this confidence, businesses have at their disposal several alternatives for deploying more labor without incurring all the costs entailed in new hires.\nThe first of these alternatives is reflected in the blue line in Figure 6. Roughly 6 percent of the labor force is working part time for reasons related to the economy. Such a high percentage of workers being placed on part time work schedules is, as you can see in the figure, much higher than in the past two recessions - and was last at these levels in the 1980s.\nMany workers reflected in these data had their schedules reduced to part time because employers want to retain them but did not have sufficient work to keep them on full time. Before an employer is likely to do any significant new hiring, they will usually return these workers to full time work. While that defers new hiring, it does of course mean additional income for the worker.\nA second alternative to permanent hires is evident in the data for weekly overtime, which declined quite significantly during this recession, as shown in Figure 7. Businesses frequently will not only restore the aforementioned workers to full time status, but also begin incurring overtime before making the investment in new hires. While there has been some rebound in overtime work, you can see in the figure that it remains well below pre-recession levels.\nA final alternative to employment growth is improving the efficiency of the existing work force. In recent quarters, employers have found ways to produce more goods with fewer workers. While a more productive work force is very good news for the economy in the long run, it lessens the need for hiring in the short run.\nThe combination of these labor market challenges and the headwinds from problems in the banking sector make it quite likely that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually. While layoffs are subsiding, in sum it seems that new hiring is likely only after employers more fully utilize existing employees.\nIndustry Patterns\nNow I would like to share some thoughts on various industries and recoveries.\nFigure 8 shows the changes that have occurred in the industrial mix of employment over the past 30 years. Overall, much less of the work force is employed in manufacturing, which has fallen from 21 percent of the work force to only 9 percent of the work force now. The two areas that have increased significantly are professional and business services, and education and health services - both areas that have tended to be less responsive to economic downturns.\nGiven the difficulties in predicting overall employment trends going forward, it is even more difficult to determine which industries are likely to be engines of growth. However, it is instructive to see which industries, in the past, have tended to grow in the first year of a recovery.\nFigure 9 shows four industries that have tended to perform well in the first year of a recovery - professional and business services, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and to a lesser extent government. The first three are areas that have increased their share of total employment, and all have tended to be less sensitive to economic downturns.\nWhile it is quite possible that these areas will grow in the initial stages of this recovery, that growth is likely to be restrained by various factors. In education and health services, there is the matter of the significant retrenchment in college endowments, and uncertainty as national health reform proposals are debated in Washington. Government spending grew modestly in the first year of the past recoveries from recessions. This time, however, the outlook for government employment remains quite dim - as federal, state, and city governments struggle with rather severe revenue shortfalls and budget issues.\nProfessional and business services, and leisure and hospitality, have often increased employment in the first year of a recovery; however, the degree has been significantly less in the past two recoveries compared to the 1980s (and in fact negative for professional and business services in 2001-2002). The strength in these sectors this time around will depend on how quickly consumer and business confidence returns.\nFigure 10 highlights industries that have had more mixed results in the first year of a recovery and are uncertain this time as well. While construction employment will be restrained by low housing prices and elevated foreclosures - and commercial construction employment is restrained in many areas by falling commercial real estate prices and high vacancy rates - employment levels in these sectors have experienced such significant declines that we may still see some rebound.\nThe behavior of the consumer will help determine employment in manufacturing and retail trade. It is unclear how willing consumers will be to increase spending once the government's various stimulus programs abate. If consumption is relatively restrained, as many expect, then these sectors are not likely to hire significantly until consumers become more confident. On the bright side, though, a potential upside to manufacturing employment is the strong growth occurring in some emerging economies and prevailing exchange rates that favor U.S. exports.\nConcluding Observations\nTo sum up my remarks and conclude, I think we can gain insights on this recovery from the experience and trends of the past. Certainly for economies that experience substantial financial shocks, recovery is normally quite slow. While inventory rebuilding will likely provide some spark, the strength of underlying demand as government stimulus subsides is an open question.\nThe employment picture overall has improved, and the outlook is certainly much brighter than one year ago. Layoffs are abating, although many firms are not yet ready to do new permanent hiring. Any significant hiring will likely have to wait while current labor resources are more fully utilized.\nSo it appears that this recovery will likely experience only a slow improvement in the employment picture, and that the unemployment rate will remain quite elevated during the early phases of the recovery. GDP growth is expected to be strong enough to produce some employment growth, but that rate of employment expansion will not likely be rapid enough to put a large dent in the unemployment rate.\nOur research and analysis at the Boston Fed suggests that with significant capacity in labor markets, wages and salaries and the ability of businesses to increase prices are all likely to be restrained, resulting in little immediate inflationary pressures. In my view this should allow for accommodative monetary policy to continue to support the economy until the underlying demand of consumers and businesses becomes self-sustaining.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. I do wish each of you solid improvements in your businesses in the year ahead, and better economic times for all New Englanders as the recovery proceeds. Thank you.",

            "content": "Massachusetts Newspaper Publishers Association Annual Meeting Boston, Massachusetts\nFirst let me thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. I have always loved newspapers, and now as a policymaker I have an even greater appreciation for the ways that reporters, editors, and publishers inform the public, ask good and important questions, and often influence outcomes.•\nFrom all I have been hearing, it is not an easy time to be a newspaper publisher. So we have something in common. It has not been an especially easy time to be a central banker, either.\nAs publishers you must spend a great deal of time thinking about the key stories of our time - and the ways that your employees are uncovering them, reporting them, and putting forth the narratives that engage readers and shape the common understanding. Here, too, we have something in common. Central bankers care deeply about what people believe - that is, the stories they deem true - about issues like economic growth, financial stability, and inflation expectations. I know we could do a better job of explaining ourselves and communicating - although I think we do a much better job now than we did in the past.\nBeyond those core central bank responsibilities, we also follow with intense interest the commonly accepted narratives - the stories, if you will - of this extraordinary financial crisis. Making sure these complex stories are known and understood can benefit everyone, if in doing so we find ways to avoid repeating the problems of the past two years. It is also important that we don't assume the wrong lessons and adopt the wrong policies, going forward.\nOf course, it is important and natural for the public, and the public's representatives in Congress, to ask how the nation encountered such problems, and to vigorously explore what public policies - including those related to the central bank - would best prevent future crises. In short, to insist on getting the \"straight story.\"\nIn that spirit, today I would like to \"report\" to you three stories of this crisis - specifically around the controversial, emergency actions taken by the central bank. Understanding the context of those actions may help in understanding what policy reforms are necessary.\nWhile I can't claim to be fully objective, I pledge to tell it like I saw it. The three stories I will touch on are the following:\nThe Straight Story, Book One\nThe story of AIG is being told by many observers. I want to give you my take on why it was necessary to \"bail out\" AIG - and what the story says about how such outcomes can be avoided in the future. This narrative is, at its heart, about \"the lesser of several evils.\"\nAIG was the largest U.S. insurance company, with extensive business activities around the world. Importantly, AIG was one of the few companies that carried a Triple A credit rating.\nThe insurance subsidiaries were overseen by state insurance regulators, since there was and is no federal regulator for insurance, and the Federal Reserve does not have regulatory authority over insurance companies (nor do the OCC or FDIC, for that matter). AIG owned a small savings and loan institution that the Office of Thrift Supervision oversaw. Indeed, from our perspective the fact that the Federal Reserve had little by way of concrete, quantifiable information on the activities of the country's largest insurer, because it had no role in regulating or supervising the company, was one of the serious problems going into this crisis.\nAs a result of AIG's Triple A credit rating, a group of \"financial engineers\" in a relatively small subsidiary of the company (AIG Financial Products) realized that they could sell insurance against the default of securities, including securities backed by subprime mortgages. Because of AIG's reputation and stellar rating, parties felt comfortable buying the insurance (knows as credit default swaps) from AIG, and AIG became a major insurer against credit losses on these types of securities.\nThere was little supervisory oversight of the institution, and these transactions. In effect, the subsidiary became an unregulated hedge fund within AIG using the credit rating of the entire company to place large bets, with little held in reserve against these bets going bad.\nThis reflects a significant risk-management breakdown within the company. It also represents a significant gap in supervision and regulation, because AIG had become systemically important by virtue of its out-sized role in writing this kind of insurance - but no one was aware of the full extent of the activities that made it systemically important and risky.\nVital to this story and the others I will tell you today is the context - essentially, what was happening in the economy and financial markets as AIG's problems were being revealed. Figure 1 provides a timeline showing some of those events.\nBear Stearns had failed earlier in the year, Lehman Brothers had failed that weekend, and it was announced that Merrill Lynch was being acquired. The viability of the traditional investment banking model was fully in question. The stock market had declined sharply (as shown in Figure 2), and many of the credit markets were in severe disarray. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had been taken over by the government. The losses on assets in a money-market fund known as the Reserve Fund pushed its value below 100 cents on the dollar - it \"broke the buck\" - and this caused a run on prime money market funds that, as Figure 3 shows, was seriously disrupting short-term financial markets as mutual funds scrambled to increase liquidity. There was essentially a \"run\" on prime money-market funds. And several very large banks were rumored to be in trouble - including Wachovia, the nation's fourth largest bank; and Washington Mutual, the largest remaining thrift since Countrywide had been acquired.\nMy next slide (Figure 4) reprints some of the unprecedented headlines emanating, morning after morning, in some of the darkest days of the crisis. To me, they serve as a bracing reminder of where we were then - and, again, the context for what was done.\nMany firms were reporting an unwillingness to trade in financial contracts, as the health of the counterparties to those contracts became a growing concern. You've probably heard the maxim that markets abhor uncertainty, and the aforementioned problems left almost every counterparty tainted by uncertainty related to \"cratering\" assets they might be holding - representing losses which might prevent them from holding up their end of financial contracts. Fear approaching panic swept through global credit markets.\nA manifestation of this panic was an unprecedented increase in the interest rate at which large global banks were willing to lend to each other for even very short periods of time, relative to the short term rates influenced by the Federal Reserve. You can see the dramatic widening of the spread between the two in Figure 5.\nIn this context - let me bring in a second headlines slide (Figure 6) - a sudden and disorderly bankruptcy of a company with the global scope, deep reach, and voluminous activity of AIG would have severely exacerbated the crisis. Banks and financial firms that thought their AIG insurance protected them against losses on the mortgage-based securities they held would teeter on insolvency if, to their surprise, their AIG insurance evaporated and they saw large additional losses. Their counterparties - firms that had lent them money and expected repayment - in turn quickly became fearful that their debtors might have exposure to an AIG failure, which could threaten their ability to repay and lead to runs on these institutions.\nIn short, the failure of AIG would have caused very large losses at, and indeed possibly failures of, many financial firms. While it is impossible to know exactly what would have happened - what we like to call the counterfactual - I believe AIG's failure could well have caused cascading failures of many financial institutions, reminiscent of the Great Depression. This would have further frozen credit creation, and the end result would likely have been an even higher - I believe much higher - national unemployment rate than the very high rate we see now. Let me bring up my third and final headlines slide (Figure 7) which shows us some of what happened anyway, in late September and early October of 2008.\nFaced with a rapid and disorderly failure, the best outcome - hypothetically - would probably have been for the government to take over AIG. The shareholders would have been wiped out, management removed, and the company placed in receivership. While that sounds rather grave, such a relatively orderly government take-over would have avoided many of the consequences of the disorderly failure that I just outlined. Unfortunately, though, there was no applicable resolution authority in place to accomplish this for AIG or for other systemically important, non-bank financial actors. And there still is none today. With banks, resolution authority exists and is administered by the FDIC. Not so for non-bank financial organizations.\nThus the experience with AIG revealed two gaps in the regulatory framework. No one was charged with regulating or supervising the high-risk behavior; and once everything went wrong, no framework existed to resolve the institution in an orderly manner.\nIf you will indulge me a metaphor, the lack of resolution authority is akin to having a highway that moves well most of the time. Small accidents occur, and generally the parties pull to the side with only minor disruptions to traffic - although those directly involved in the accident may be seriously impacted. However, if a large tractor trailer overturns, you need equipment that can handle an accident involving a vehicle of that size. Emergency equipment that could handle small vehicles might be totally lacking in this case. In the absence of such equipment, the roadway grinds to a halt and everyone who uses that road is affected - not just those directly involved in the accident. Even those with no interest in using the highway may find themselves in traffic jams that spill over onto surface roads.\nWe have been operating in a world where small bank failures can be addressed with acceptable side effects, but large bank failures or the failures of large non-bank financial firms cannot. It is in everyone's interest that the tools exist to clear large \"vehicles\" and keep the \"roadways\" moving.\nAgain, an AIG bankruptcy was likely to completely freeze over already frigid financial markets, and create runs on AIG's many counterparties. So the problem had to be contained. Since no resolution authority (outside of bankruptcy) existed in U.S. law for a firm like AIG, and because no other financial institution was able and willing to buy AIG and internalize its financial problems, the only option for containing the problem was an emergency loan from the Federal Reserve. Regrettably, an emergency loan is a far-less-than-optimal solution. But I believe it was the only reasonable solution available at the time. We abhorred the steps taken, but thought them to be the lesser of several evils, given the situation.\nAllow me to sum up the two gaps I mentioned a moment ago - gaps that remain today. First, no one was explicitly responsible for systemically important institutions. Second, lacking a framework of resolution authority, policymakers were faced with the option of an unprecedented bankruptcy that may have caused a run on financial markets and institutions.1\nAs a result, the Federal Reserve felt compelled, by the likely downsides of a bankruptcy, to lend to a company over which it had no regulatory or supervisory oversight, in a very limited time frame, in order to prevent a true financial-system meltdown.\nThere are many distasteful parts to this story, and the frustration many feel is absolutely understandable. I would simply suggest that the most important narrative is that the legal framework for resolution in an orderly, transparent, and more palatable manner did not exist - but should have, and must as we move ahead.\nIndeed, while these controversial Fed actions were taken to prevent widespread problems for the entire economy, with proper resolution authority in place in the U.S., the Federal Reserve would not have needed to be involved with AIG at all.\nThe Straight Story, Book Two\nMy second story is about why the Federal Reserve had to expand its balance sheet so dramatically to address the crisis, and the implications of its swollen balance sheet. And how the need for such actions can be avoided in the future. Let me bring up Figure 8.\nThis narrative is, metaphorically, about the triage necessary in an \"emergency room\" atmosphere where, amidst the confusion and stress of the moment we found we had more creativity than many thought - leading to some very helpful \"treatments\" for the patients.\nTo see how dramatic the expansion in the Federal Reserve balance sheet has been, consider Figure 8. Prior to the crisis, the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet of $880 billion. Today it has expanded - more than doubled - to over $2 trillion. You can see why some eyebrows have been raised.\nInitially, most of this expansion was a consequence of attempting to \"restart\" financial markets in the wake of their freezing up after the failure of Lehman Brothers. Figure 9 gives one picture of the freeze-up by showing the dramatic decline in securitization of financial assets like home equity loans, credit card receivables, student loans, and car loans.2 While there are alternatives to securitization, such as bank lending, this represented a narrowing of financing sources and was likely to increase costs for the borrowers.\nI'll mention one example of Fed efforts. At the Boston Fed we operated the asset-backed commercial paper money market liquidity facility or \"AMLF\" on behalf of the Federal Reserve System. The light green area in Figure 10 represents the AMLF, which provided money market funds - an increasingly important corner of the financial world - the ability to sell asset-backed commercial paper. The funds were having significant difficulty selling the paper because potential buyers were concerned about the extent to which it was backed by troubled mortgages - a risk most were unwilling to bear. The mutual funds, however, needed to sell the paper in order to meet the substantial redemption requests that arose as money market fund depositors sought to move their deposits to insured institutions in the wake of Lehman's failure.\nIn the first ten days of operation, the AMLF lent out $150 billion. Please note that I said \"lent out,\" not \"gave out.\"\nThe facility currently has no loans outstanding and should improvements in market conditions continue, we may close it in February. It was structured to be attractive during times of financial stress, but unattractive under more normal economic conditions.\nThe facility experienced no losses - all the loans were repaid, with interest. Since the Federal Reserve delivers excess returns to the Treasury, this program not only supported money markets and the asset backed commercial paper markets, which were under great stress, but also as a side benefit generated income after expenses that we return to taxpayers. The Fed's other market-stabilizing \"emergency room\" activities, such as the commercial paper facility and the foreign central bank swap lines, similarly helped stabilize panicked markets and are winding down naturally as markets normalize.\nEven after all we did to provide and maintain sources of short-term funding, the Fed's traditional policy tool - the short term interest rate - encountered the \"bound\" of zero. To offset our inability to lower interest rates any further, we made a policy decision to undertake programs to buy Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (see Figure 11). This was designed to support market function, and ease credit conditions, in the mortgage market. While the Treasury purchase program was an extension of traditional Fed open-market operations that we use to set short-term interest rates, the mortgage-backed securities program was a significant departure from conventional policy.\nSince announcing the program at the March FOMC meeting, the Fed has purchased $300 billion worth of additional Treasury securities. The less traditional mortgage-backed securities program is scheduled to purchase $1.25 trillion by the end of the first quarter of 2010. Maintaining a healthy mortgage finance market is a critical economic policy goal, because housing is a major component of most economic recoveries - and because the housing sector has been significantly impacted by this downturn.\nIn fact, residential investment turned positive in the third quarter of 2009 after 14 straight quarters of decline.3 While there are many factors that account for the improved housing outlook, including the government's first-time homebuyer tax credit program, Figure 12 highlights that 30-year mortgage rates declined on the announcement of the purchase program and have remained low since the Fed began purchasing mortgages. Prior to the announcement of the program, the 30-year mortgage rate was over 6 percent, while over the past 6 months the mortgage rate has hovered around 5 percent.\nStill, some are concerned that the expansion of our balance sheet will be inflationary. For several interrelated reasons, I do not believe this will be inflationary in the near term, and I offer them as critical parts of this story.\nFirst, we can look to the one recent instance of a central bank in a developed economy setting its policy rate to zero and dramatically expanding its balance sheet - Japan. Despite the increase in the Bank of Japan's balance sheet, shown in the red line of Figure 13, Japan's main problem has been deflation, not inflation (as shown by the blue line in that figure).\nSecond, despite the expansion of our balance sheet, U.S. inflation has been declining. This is typical of recession periods (see Figure 14) for the same reasons that Japan experienced deflation - labor markets remain slack as recessions end, and labor costs are subdued. So total and core inflation tend to be much lower coming out of a recession than going in. Currently in the U.S., labor markets are weak, and labor costs have been trending down, not up (see Figure 15), as has been the case in previous U.S. recessions and in Japan over a more protracted period.\nThird, expansion of reserves could be inflationary if banks had healthy capital ratios and loan demand was strong in an economic environment close to full employment. Unfortunately, I do not expect those conditions to predominate in the near term.\nAnd, in general, I am confident that as conditions merit, the Federal Reserve will adjust the stance of monetary policy to an appropriately less accommodative stance.\nWhile the Fed's aggressive actions and unprecedented policy stance may be a bit unsettling, I think this is a story of effective emergency action that will wind down naturally as the emergency conditions subside, and treatments that will set the patients on the road to recovery.\nThe Straight Story, Book Three\nThe third story I offer you today involves what seems like a tendency of policymakers to focus more on Wall Street than on Main Street.\nThis narrative is, at its heart, about fixing the underlying \"plumbing\" or the supporting infrastructure of the economy. The commonly held narrative, quite understandably, has been Wall Street versus Main Street. I might suggest the actual story is more about where, like it or not, Wall Street and Main Street intersect and are interdependent - and that too few appreciated this reality before the crisis and even now with the benefit of hindsight.\nThe recent financial crisis clearly exacerbated problems in what we call the \"real economy\" - the production of tangible goods and services by real workers using real capital equipment and materials. The Federal Reserve has a mandate from Congress to pursue policies that yield maximum employment consistent with price stability. As economic problems became worse, the Federal Reserve took many actions that have received substantial public scrutiny, and criticism - but, I believe, substantially mitigated problems that would have otherwise adversely affected employment and price stability. This was consistent with our mandate.\nAs I suggested earlier, we undertook many of the actions to support individual financial institutions because we lacked viable alternatives to prevent a full-scale meltdown of the financial sector, with its damaging impact on everyone. With no entity responsible for ensuring financial stability and no way to resolve systemically important non-bank financial firms (which is important because the non-bank \"shadow\" banking system played an expanding role in credit delivery to firms and individuals4), the Fed stepped in to prevent a series of financial failures that could and would have led to a much worse outcome for the economy - and thus for all \"residents of Main Street.\"\nI can assure you, the immediate inclination was to let these institutions fail as a consequence of their risk-management breakdowns. But when weighed against the resulting losses in employment throughout the economy that were likely to mount if they had failed, we \"held our noses\" and did what we felt we had to do to prevent the actions of Wall Street from inflicting further collateral damage on Main Street.\nMy hope is that the work being done by Congress will remedy these significant regulatory gaps. My hope is that the Federal Reserve will not be in a position of needing to choose the lesser of two or more evils and lend to a deeply troubled yet systemically important financial institution it does not supervise. Similarly, my hope is that the Fed will not be in a position of needing to try to put in place ad hoc emergency remedies to stem the adverse economic consequences of a disorderly failure of one or more of these systemically important institutions.\nMany of our actions operated through financial institutions or financial markets, but were designed to help Main Street weather a crisis. While the crisis was not of Main Street's making, it took place within the financial infrastructure Main Street relies upon for credit, capital, and liquidity - an inherently frustrating scenario for citizens, to be sure.\nHowever, measures like the Fed's mortgage-backed securities purchase program have improved mortgage-market conditions, making it more affordable to obtain a loan for a home purchase or to refinance an existing mortgage. Our AMLF program was intended to support money market mutual funds at a time of great stress and, ultimately, shore up the market for commercial paper - a market that makes credit cards, student loans, and home equity loans more affordable. Our Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility or TALF program was designed to improve securitization, which makes credit more affordable, by facilitating the renewed issuance of consumer and small-business asset-backed securities - essentially providing a financing vehicle for credit instruments that had been disrupted by poor functioning in securitization markets. In doing this, the facility helps make credit more available for student loans, consumer credit, commercial real estate, and small business loans; leading to lower borrowing rates and improved access in the market for consumer and small business credit.\nAltogether, our programs to support financial institutions and financial markets were intended to prevent a financial collapse - not to benefit financial institutions, but to avoid a dramatically higher unemployment rate across the economy.\nThe actions by the Federal Reserve, while out of the ordinary and out of our own comfort zone, were what were necessary during these trying times. Hopefully, we as a nation will take actions to ensure that many of these measures are not needed in the future.\nConcluding Observations\nI'm not sure if my three stories are told well enough to make it into the newspapers you all publish, but I thank you for listening.\nI will conclude by noting that we are in a far better place than we were in the beginning of this year. I believe we are - appropriately - reading few if any articles that describe the nation as flirting with a second Great Depression. One reason we are hearing less about the risk of a second Great Depression is because of bold and creative actions taken by the Federal Reserve.\nBut let me acknowledge, without question, that the Federal Reserve, along with other regulators and parts of the government, did not accurately foresee and prevent all the problems that occurred over the past two years. We were far from perfect, but we are doing our best to learn from mistakes. We are partly responsible for the fact that we are coming out of a \"great recession,\" and no policymaker can be happy about that.\nBut let me stress - in contrast to some recent pundits - that this was not just a Fed failure, or that of the public sector alone. Financial organizations and indeed many economic actors of all stripes did not properly explore, and manage, the risks they were taking on.\nBut in the absence of the actions taken once the problems were apparent, we would have seen outcomes far worse than those the nation experienced.\nAlso, importantly, we are doing a great deal to understand and apply the lessons of the crisis. As Chairman Bernanke and others have pointed out, we are for example reorienting the Fed's supervisory activities, in light of the lessons of the crisis, in areas like capital adequacy, risk-management practices, liquidity management, and the effects on risk-taking of compensation structures. And we are augmenting traditional firm-specific oversight with a more macroprudential5 approach to anticipating and addressing threats to financial stability - that is, one that goes beyond a focus on the safety and soundness of individual institutions to also focus on risks to the financial system as a whole.6\nIn particular, I would point to the fact that avoiding a much more damaging wholesale financial collapse hinged in no small part on key parties like the Federal Reserve having the ability to obtain accurate assessments of financial firms' conditions, and having the ability to influence the actions of key financial institutions and financial markets. Again, this was critical to avoiding an even more damaging financial collapse.\nOne response to the crisis would be to limit the central bank's activities solely to monetary policy, curtailing the Fed's supervisory and lender-of-last-resort roles. My view - built on careful research, my experience as a bank supervisor and Discount Window lender, and my time as a member of the FOMC - is that supervisory and lender-of-last-resort responsibilities currently in place at the Fed were critical to preventing far worse outcomes for the economy and the country.\nIt is obviously appropriate, and important, for the public and the Congress to ask how we got into such a mess, why it was so hard to foresee, and how we can avoid such problems in the future. They should insist on getting the \"straight story\" - and on vigorously exploring what public policies would best prevent future crises.\nI firmly believe the narratives I have shared today, and I hope they help shape understanding of this important episode - and what can prevent its recurrence.\nThank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "European Economics and Financial Centre Distinguished Speakers Seminar London, England\nIt is a pleasure to be at the European Economics and Financial Centre to discuss a very important and timely issue - how we can avoid having global banks create global problems.•\nI applaud the Center's focus on both economics and finance, and on the nexus between the public and private sectors. Much of my own research career has been similarly focused, with particular attention to the connections between economics and finance, and to the ways that financial problems can spill over to the real economy - research that, I am sorry to say, turned out to be quite useful during the recent crisis.\nIndeed, one of the lessons from this crisis is how underappreciated were the potential spillovers from financial problems to the economy. I think it is incumbent on us to explore the implications of these spillovers for both public policy and macroeconomic modeling - which generally incorporates little if any role for financial intermediaries and their problems.1\nMy remarks today center on a particular irony that I would like to discuss - that, despite the widespread acknowledgement of the \"too big to fail\" problem, many of our largest global banks have actually expanded during the crisis. Indeed, in many cases the sizes of the largest banks have become quite large relative to the sizes of both their home and host countries.\nAs a result, the ability - more specifically, the economic capacity - of many countries to resolve troubled global banks is, in some instances, in question. Also, the potential cost to taxpayers has made providing emergency government support to global banks deeply unpopular - a situation that in some cases significantly complicates the available resolution options. Nor is this a new problem, as illustrated by the Japanese experience in the previous decade.\nPolicymakers, academics, and other observers are proposing a variety of measures that would reduce the probability of a large bank failing, or limit the potential impact if a large bank does fail. But please note that I am sharing my own general views today, rather than discussing any specific proposal under consideration.2\nAfter briefly reviewing some of the issues that have become evident in the recent crisis, I will cover some of the options for reform. Allow me to preview some of my points, which I will then go on to explore more fully:\nFirst, despite concerns about the too-big-to-fail issue, in a variety of countries the largest banks are becoming ever larger relative to the size of the economy.3\nSecond, banks that are global (not just large) create additional complications - they are more difficult to resolve and can \"export\" capital adequacy problems (a so-called \"credit crunch\" ) to countries that host their operations.\nThird, so-called \"living wills\" that outline, in advance, wind-down arrangements in the event of a failure, are not only important for addressing too-big-to-fail problems but can also be used to enhance the coordination of the bank regulators and supervisors in various affected countries - which should improve resolution procedures.\nFourth, narrowly defining the acceptable activities of financial institutions will merely shift the location of systemic problems, rather than reduce them. Instead, systemically important institutions should in my view be required to hold greater reserves and capital, to be built up during good times. Also, measures should be put in place that would facilitate global banks' obtaining and retaining capital during economic downturns. Such measures could include automatic reductions of dividends, and required use of debt instruments that could be converted to equity should the firms face a liquidity or solvency crisis. And in general, supervisory policy should be more focused on the potential build-up of systemic risk.\nGlobal Banks, Global Problems\nOne of the salient features of the most recent crisis is that among banking institutions, initially the problems were concentrated in large global institutions actively engaged in complex financial transactions.\nThis feature of the crisis created a number of significant complications. First, because many of the troubled financial transactions were bilateral - that is, between two firms or counterparties rather than through established exchanges - the firms were not only large, but were highly interconnected. As a result, the ability (or inability) to fulfill the terms of financial contracts had a significant potential to impact counterparties. Second, when a large interconnected financial institution became troubled, there were only a very limited number of institutions with sufficient size or sophistication to acquire the problem institution. Third, banking problems are particularly difficult to resolve when the banking institution spans national borders. Because of the nation-specific nature of bankruptcy codes, bank regulation, bank supervision, and lender-of-last-resort facilities, there are currently no robust infrastructures for addressing the resolution issues surrounding global institutions. Fourth, many of the activities that proved problematic were transactions involving supposedly highly-rated assets held in off-balance-sheet entities like conduits or \"structured investment vehicles,\" which were not particularly transparent. And the legal, accounting, and reputational issues surrounding these off-balance-sheet activities were often unclear.\nThe result was that a variety of financial institutions became \"too big to fail\" not because of deposits, but rather because they were so intertwined in the global financial infrastructure that their disorderly failure could cause the flow of financial transactions to freeze - calling into question the financial viability of their counterparties and the functioning of markets where they were key players. In essence, \"too big to fail\" was really \"too interconnected to fail\" or \"too relied-upon to fail.\"\nAgain, as the discussion of too-big-to-fail institutions has increased so (somewhat ironically) has the size of many of our largest global financial firms. Figure 1 shows the size of the three largest U.S. banks, relative to the size of U.S. GDP. As is clear from the figure, the largest institutions have over time become larger relative to the size of the economy. And not only have many of the largest U.S. banking institutions grown larger, but in some cases they have become more complex - as they acquired firms that offer investment banking services and, also, expanded the global reach of the acquiring firm.\nThe trend toward rapid growth of the largest financial institutions has not been unique to the United States. As Figure 2 illustrates, the three largest banks in many countries have grown, relative to the size of the country's economy. What is also apparent - note the scale on the figures - is that in many countries the size of the three largest financial institutions relative to the size of the economy is much larger than it is in the United States. In fact, in several countries the combined size of the largest three banks is substantially larger than the GDP of the country.4\nImplications for Policymakers\nWhen financial firms become large relative to the size of their home country's economy, it can pose significant challenges for policymakers. First, should the largest banks become troubled, there may be questions as to the financial capacity of the sovereign nation to resolve these firms. Second, even if there is the capacity, the costs to taxpayers may be so large that there is not the political will to take the steps that would ensure a non-disruptive resolution. Third, in many countries where banks are large relative to GDP, the largest banks have significant operations outside the national borders of the home country. Fourth, most countries are likely to follow measures that protect domestic depositors and borrowers relative to foreign depositors and borrowers, and will be more focused on preventing \"collateral damage\" to their own domestic economy.\nWe care about problems at large banks because of the collateral damage caused by banks shrinking their balance sheet to satisfy capital requirements. As you know, loans are assets for banks. Banks must maintain a reasonable capital-to-assets ratio. In times of stress banks may shrink their balance sheet by tightening terms of credit - which can exacerbate problems that occur during an economic downturn.5\nAs Figure 3 illustrates, credit to business in the United States has been declining significantly over the past year. While loan demand does tend to fall during economic downturns, loan supply is also likely to decline if banks become capital constrained. And as Figure 4 illustrates, the shrinkage tends to be larger at institutions with a higher probability of failure, as denoted by their supervisory ratings. As a few financial institutions become large relative to the size of a country's economy, the need to simultaneously shrink balance sheets can have potentially serious consequences for bank-dependent borrowers. Thus, large banks become important because they not only can be too big to fail, but also because of the potential macroeconomic consequences of shrinking. In a sense, they become \"too big to allow to become troubled or constrained,\" considering the impact on bank-dependent borrowers.\nA natural consequence of being concerned about the domestic macroeconomic implications of banking problems might be to encourage globally-active banks to expand domestically but shrink internationally. This is what large Japanese banks did during the 1990s. Japanese banks significantly reduced their lending in the United States and Europe - which had consequences for credit conditions in the host countries.6\nThus, global banks pose two significant problems for host countries.\nFirst, should the bank's parent holding company fail, host-country operations could suffer collateral damage. Host country liability holders could be disadvantaged, particularly if assets were transferred out of the host country prior to failure. Because bankruptcy and bank resolutions are nationally focused, the impact on host country operations could be quite uncertain.\nA second issue is the concern that global banks may export a credit crunch to countries that host them. To the extent a global bank decides to reduce operations because of balance sheet problems, this reduction may exacerbate other economic problems in the host country.\nIn light of these concerns, many countries are considering requiring the domestic operations of global banks that they host to be separately capitalized. This would have several potential benefits to the host country. Should the global operations run into trouble, there would still be capital supporting the host country operations. This would mean the host country operations would be self supporting, and might facilitate a sale of the operations to other owners, if needed. If the domestic regulator was to restrict the ability to repatriate capital to the home country, then there would be little incentive to shrink the host country operations - thus avoiding the potential for importing a credit crunch from the global bank to the host country.\nOf course, the cost of such a restriction is that it impedes the free flow of bank capital across national borders.\nAs a result, global banks may be less willing to expand internationally, and capital may be \"trapped\" in countries that end up having limited economic prospects or lending opportunities. The cost of the inefficient use of bank capital is an area that deserves more research attention.\nWhether or not requiring bank operations to be separately capitalized within national borders makes sense will depend, in part, on improving global resolution procedures for failing firms. If countries can coordinate resolution and bankruptcy procedures, some of the costs of global bank failures can be reduced. But in the absence of improved coordination, it seems quite likely that many countries will decide to insulate their banking system and economy by requiring the domestic operations of global banks to be separately capitalized.\nGlobal coordination is also critical if the so-called \"living wills\" of financial firms are to be drafted and utilized. Living wills, wherein banks must detail how they would be resolved should they become troubled - or \"seriously ill\", if you want to continue the living will metaphor - are a potential supervisory tool that I and many others support. However, for the tool to be effective, a global bank's management team needs to have a clear idea of how regulators will react when a global bank becomes troubled. To truly be effective, a living will for a global bank would not only require a plan developed and kept up to date by management, but also an agreement among regulators in different countries that such a plan would be feasible - since supervisory, regulatory, and legal restrictions are country dependent. In essence, in the case of global banks, living wills may serve as a mechanism to encourage greater synchronization of supervisory policies across countries.\nI would note, however, that there may be areas that are not easily addressed by such living wills. Financial institutions that are critical market makers - or who engage extensively in complicated financial contracting not involving exchanges or clearing houses - are two possible examples. However, if the living will identifies these areas, the requirement could be made that they be run in separately capitalized subsidiaries, where these subsidiaries hold significantly more capital than other areas of the organization. Alternatively, the requirement could be made that such activities be run in independent companies - as activities that are not seen as appropriate to run out of large global banks.\nEffective living wills are also likely to identify areas where banks have chosen particularly complicated legal structures - perhaps to avoid taxes, capital charges, or regulation. Complicated structures that make resolution difficult impose externalities that will likely need to be addressed internationally.\nThe trade-off between the commercial benefits of complicated structures and the potential public costs of resolving complicated organizations is an area that deserves more supervisory and international study. One potential approach is to add significant Pillar Two capital under the Basel Accord for banks that choose complicated structures. This would essentially impose on institutions that make themselves difficult to resolve a need to hold additional capital. At a minimum, living wills should document the organizational purpose of different legal entities, and supervisors would have the ability to compare those structures with competitors who have chosen simpler structures.\nA more draconian solution that has been floated by some observers is to move to narrow the activities of banks. Narrowed banks would be constrained to only engage in very limited activities, and in particular would be banned from activities viewed as especially risky, such as proprietary trading.\nPersonally I am skeptical that such dramatic action would significantly limit systemic risk, for several reasons.\nFirst, even narrowly defined financial institutions can run into difficulties. One example involves money-market funds in the United States, which are very limited in their activities, and are only allowed to hold highly liquid, highly rated financial instruments. Nonetheless, despite this \"narrowness,\" there was a run on prime money market funds resulting from a variety of interconnected factors, which ultimately required the creation of an insurance scheme and the establishment of temporary liquidity facilities - and even so, there were significant disruptions to short-term credit markets, which greatly complicated financial problems in the United States last fall.\nSecond, firms that do not engage in traditional banking activities can run into difficulty and transmit their problems to the broader financial system. In fact, the recent government interventions were not driven by deposit insurance. The interventions were driven by concern over troubles at firms so integrated in financial markets that their failure would result in financial and macroeconomic consequences that would likely be unacceptable.\nLehman Brothers did not have FDIC-insured deposits; rather it was systemically important because it was a significant counterparty to myriad financial transactions. Its failure to meet its obligations created uncertainty about the exposure of counterparties and the ability to complete financial transactions in a variety of markets, causing a financial market \"freeze.\" The need for the establishment of appropriate resolution powers - and greater appreciation of the systemic risks created by investment banks that might be over-leveraged and possess too little liquidity - should be overall lessons drawn from the crisis.\nMoving to a narrow-bank approach is likely to merely shift the systemic risk out of banks but not significantly reduce it. Large interconnected firms with extensive lending do not necessarily need to be financed by bank deposits, as was shown by problems at many investment banks. Instead, I would advocate an alternative approach. For systemically important institutions, the risk of insolvency should be reduced by requiring more capital, and requiring the institutions to build up larger reserves during good times. Also, measures should be put in place that would facilitate systemically important institutions obtaining and retaining capital during economic downturns. By having mandatory conversion of debt and mandatory reduction of dividends, banks could retain sufficient capital - so they hopefully would not need to shrink during downturns. In addition, as I have argued in other talks, supervisors of such systemic institutions should have the mandated responsibility and authority to address emerging systemic concerns.\nConcluding Remarks\nIn conclusion, I would just reiterate that the recent turmoil occurred at a time when financial institutions were becoming large relative to the size of their home country economies. The problems highlighted by the financial turmoil illustrate how critical it is to address the problems of \"too big to fail.\"\nAs I have noted today, large institutions often are characterized by international expansion. Globalization significantly complicates the ability to resolve large financial institutions. However, I expect that \"living wills\" may be a mechanism not only to better understand the difficulties with resolving large complicated institutions, but also may serve as a vehicle to enhance greater international coordination, which will be crucial going forward. In addition, moving to establish a clear mandate for systemic regulatory responsibility is critical, as is providing the given regulatory entity the power to enforce that mandate.",

            "content": "The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 54th Economic Conference: \"After the Fall - Re-evaluating Supervisory, Regulatory, and Monetary Policy\" Chatham, MA\nGood afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to this conference, which is the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 54th economic conference. I'd like to thank my colleagues from the Bank for their work in putting together such a dynamic and timely program.\nThe decision to move our conference to the fall came temporarily into question when it started snowing this weekend. But the weather on Sunday didn't seem to bother our football team, the Patriots, and I don't think our conference will suffer, either. The snow is behind us and I think you'll all enjoy New England in the fall.\nThroughout its history, this conference has aimed to bring together policymakers, business leaders, and academics to discuss matters of public policy. This year's conference is very aptly timed, in that the nation is currently in the midst of a very important debate about what happened over the last two years and what we should do to avoid similar problems in the future.\nI want to kick off the conference by highlighting [slide 1] some of the extraordinary things that have happened over the course of the last two years, and by suggesting some questions we might want to address over the next two days at this conference.1 I think everyone here is well aware that over the last two years, government intervention into both financial markets and financial institutions has been extraordinary. There has been a major investment of taxpayer dollars in a variety of institutions. And the intervention has not only involved depository institutions, but also a variety of other institutions that were seen as systemically important but did not necessarily take deposits.\nThis is a phenomenon that has occurred not only in the United States but actually in many corners of the globe. So while you might say \"the match was struck\" in the United States, the firestorm that we've seen over the last two years has, in many respects, been global - and policy responses have been global in nature as well.\nI would highlight [slide 2] a few of the significant \"spillovers\" that occurred as a result of the problems that were occurring at many of the large global financial institutions. Perhaps the most striking was that previously very liquid financial markets essentially \"seized up.\" Transactions were not being done at anything near normal prices, and in fact the bid-to-ask spread for many financial transactions became very wide.\nThe United States' economy went into a deep and protracted recession. And we were not alone. Much of the rest of the world also followed suit, in part as a result of a very significant drop in international trade. Not only did the Federal Reserve reduce its target interest rate to close to zero, but so did central banks in many other parts of the world. And just as our deficit has swelled, so have deficits in many other countries that experienced significant problems as a result of the financial crisis.\nSo, this \"financial firestorm\" has raised a number of questions [slide 3] that I think are appropriate to explore at this conference; among them the following:\nWas this crisis preventable?\nCould it have been better contained?\nWhat are the implications for government structures?\nWhat are the implications for government policies?\nWhat are the implications for the global economy?\nNow I'd like to digress for just a moment to explore an analogy to what recently happened in financial markets, drawing on a very different type of crisis that occurred primarily in the 1700s and 1800s, but not since then. I think there are some broad lessons to be drawn from this historical example.\nAfter all, we are from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Boston is a very historical city. I want to highlight an element of that history - the second Great Boston Fire, which occurred steps from the current Federal Reserve building. The results of the fire are shown in this picture [slide 4]. As you can see, the devastation was extraordinary, with over 700 buildings burned to the ground. It was a tragic event, with a large loss of human life. The destruction that occurred in the downtown area devastated the core of the city.\nI am not an historian, but the popular histories of the Great Fire suggest a couple of striking thing about this tragedy. I think we do well to consider the analogies to the current financial crisis.\nThe next slide [slide 5] highlights patterns in some of the Great Fires. The first thing to note is that for many of the cities that had Great Fires, the tragedies were repeated. Boston had one in 1760, but roughly 100 years later, there was a second. So actions taken as a result of the first episode did not prevent a recurrence. This extends beyond any one city, because as you can see there were a number of great fires in American cities - and this is far from a comprehensive list. Needless to say they had devastating results both in loss of human life and in loss of buildings, businesses, and employment. As we contemplate the analogy, I'm sure all of us here would prefer to not see a repeat of the financial firestorm of the last two years.\nNote that as you get into the mid to late 1900s you don't see Great Fires anymore. Why is this? I think there are a number of reasons, rooted in what really created some of the Great Fires of the 1800s [slide 6].\nOne cause was, clearly, dangerous conditions. Buildings back then were much more flammable - with either wooden structures or at least wooden roofs, as was true in Boston. Certain business activities added danger to that situation - for example certain types of manufacturing taking place in dense downtown areas. Policy also played a role - interestingly, inventories in attics were not taxed, so attics were often stuffed with very flammable items.\nAnother factor involves what you might call \"inadequate mitigants.\" We take for granted out fire departments now, but fire departments in the 1800s were often inadequately equipped. And the water supply in American cities was quite problematic. In the case of the great Boston fire the water pressure was completely inadequate to reach the taller buildings that were being built, but pleas to upgrade water mains (to keep pace with newer buildings) had been rebuffed. Fire hydrants had varying sized couplings, so the fire brigade's equipment didn't fit on some hydrants.\nAnd finally, there was often insufficient enforcement of much of the fire code - while there were fire codes in place, to a large degree they were ignored.\nI'd also observe that one of the elements you read about in Great Fires seems to be - to borrow a phrase from fiction - \"a series of unfortunate events.\" Usually there are some unusual, but not unimaginable, combinations of occurrences that together escalate the situation. In the case of Boston's second Great Fire, one of the strange occurrences was that all of the specially-trained fire horses had come down with an equine flu, and as a result the fire engines had to be pulled by people, as best they could.\nSo why do we not see Great Fires in our cities anymore [slide 7]? Well, cities started to take fire prevention quite seriously. When the cities burned down, many of them rebuilt in a very different way, improving their layouts to inhibit the spread of fires that might emerge. Building materials improved - if you look around downtown Boston today you don't see wooden structures or wooden roofs. And strict enforcement of fire codes emerged.\nObviously there are much improved means to try to prevent fires, and to put fires out should they occur. We have professionalized firefighting in our major cities. Fire equipment has improved dramatically. All this was sufficient to reduce significantly the risk of Great Fires. Certainly there have been fires, but they haven't had the same devastating effect as in prior eras. Look again at the scene of Boston's Great Fire [slide 8], and then at the approximate scene today [slide 9]. What can we learn from this analogy to the financial firestorms of late - and can we make as much progress in the financial realm?\nI would just highlight [slide 10] a few things that I hope we contemplate in the course of this conference.\nFirst I think we do need to do a better job of improving our ability to mitigate various crises. High on my list of things we need to attend to is to have in place resolution authority for all systemically-important institutions. Had we had in place such resolution authority, the central bank would not have had to get involved with the financial problems of individual institutions.\nWhile I don't think the Federal Reserve should be involved in the resolution of individual institutions, it's very important that someone does have that authority. This crisis would have unfolded quite differently had resolution authority been in place.\nA second question I think we ought to be discussing is whether or not we can simplify the structure of many of our institutions - akin, in my analogy, to making buildings less fire-prone through enforced building codes, and making fires less likely to spread by instituting planning guidelines and zoning rules. There have been questions about whether institutions should have what amount to \"living wills\" - meaning they've come up with a plan so that if they get into financial problems, the plan for resolution is relatively clear. That would probably require simplifying institutions' structures. So, we should explore the extent to which regulatory and supervisory procedures should make sure institutions are easy to resolve - in other words, that they have simple enough structures so that if they do get into trouble you can sell parts of them without necessarily having to take them over.\nAnother area that I hope we focus on is improving some of the tools for dealing with the problems. This is akin to fixing the water pressure, standardizing the hydrants, and ensuring that fire equipment can make it to the scene - horses or not.\nIn this vein I would mention the issue of convertible debt, which is getting quite a bit of attention lately. I think this is a very good idea - giving the ability to convert debt to equity in times of serious stress in the banking system. Also, during this crisis, substantial dividends were paid in the initial phases of the crisis at institutions that ended up needing significant government support. During a financial crisis it is important that individual institutions as well as the banking system more generally take measures to retain capital. This would make it less likely that institutions need government support - but also would make it less likely that banks shrink in the middle of a crisis, reducing the critically important availability of credit.\nOther issues worth discussing at the conference are higher capital requirements for systemically important institutions, and finding ways to build up loan loss reserves in the \"good times.\" In addition, we need to reduce the risk that large financial institutions become illiquid during a financial crisis.\nNext [slide 11] I would argue that the appropriate institution or institutions need a mandate to focus on systemic risk. Mandates matter. The last two years have shown that we clearly need institutions that have a focus on addressing systemic risk. With more and clearer focus on systemic risk, there will be more focus on identifying problems earlier and making sure those problems don't become much larger over time.\nFinally, I think we should be discussing the issue of comprehensive oversight. There were major gaps evident in this last crisis, which allowed risks to build up in areas that were not necessarily inside regulated financial institutions. I think we need a mechanism whereby if we see large asset growth that's being financed by leverage, we should at least be asking questions, and there should be organizations designed to think about whether these situations are posing systemic risks that we need to address.\nHopefully these and other questions will be addressed in the papers we'll see presented over the next two days. This is a time where we need to re-consider some of what we've done and really learn the lessons from the last two years. My hope for this conference is that each of us will gain a number of insights - allowing those of us who are policymakers to better serve the public's interests. I wish you a very engaging two days.\nI hope everybody enjoys the conference, and now we'll start with the first session.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "The Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce: Financial Services Forum Boston, MA\nIt is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the outlook for the economy and, in particular, the possible path of inflation and the orientation of monetary policy.• In unique economic times like we are experiencing, these are issues that policymakers, businesspeople, and citizens are rightly concerned about.\nBut before I delve into the topic, I would just like to mention how much we at the Boston Federal Reserve Bank enjoy having opportunities to collaborate with the Chamber, on a number of initiatives. For example, studies undertaken by the Chamber and the Boston Fed, focused on maintaining a highly-educated work force in the region, are leading to concrete actions - including a successful event we held together for local employers' summer interns. It was designed to help the interns learn about the benefits of living and working in Greater Boston after graduation, with an eye to retaining their talent within the region's workforce. My colleague Paul Connolly, the Bank's Chief Operating Officer - whom many of you know well - has been a true leader on this effort, and on many others that the Bank and Chamber have pursued together. I want to thank him for that leadership. Paul and I and our colleagues at the Bank certainly look forward to future collaboration with the Chamber, to strengthen our local economy.\nWaves of financial turmoil have been with us for about two years - ever since I took this job, by the way - but it was about a year ago that we experienced a series of financial-market problems that brought us to the brink of financial meltdown. In light of that anniversary, it is useful to reflect on just how far we have come. A year ago, the stock market was in what anyone would agree was a \"tailspin\" ; short-term and highly liquid financial instruments were either not trading or were trading at huge spreads over Treasury securities; and many counterparties were wondering whether significant financial institutions had the capacity to survive.\nOne year later, the S,P 500 Index has increased more than 50 percent from its March nadir, and many stock market indices around the world have staged similar recoveries, as shown in Chart 1. The volume of short-term interbank lending is increasing, and Chart 2 shows that the interest rates banks charge each other on these loans (the Libor rate1) are returning to a level where the premium or \"spread\" relative to other financial instruments is comparable to what we saw prior to the crisis. And furthermore, the stock prices of many of our major financial institutions reflect a renewed belief that they can weather their credit problems and be profitable.\nThe financial recovery has in fact led the economic recovery, which is not unusual when emerging from a severe recession. However, despite the very positive signs we are seeing, the economic recovery remains fragile and quite capable of falling short of the more positive expectations and degrees of confidence now reflected in financial markets.\nI believe it is important that monetary and fiscal policy continue to support the economy until private-sector spending has resumed, and until we are confident that the recovery will continue once the programs that have supported the economy over the past year are removed. We have historic precedent for accommodative policies that were removed too quickly, thus exacerbating to a significant degree the financial and economic troubles facing a nation. Today I am going to discuss the risk of this sort of premature policy action, in the context of a specific historical case that I studied in detail in my research career. The case involves Japan, where policymakers were confronted with economic difficulties that were greatly aggravated by problems in real estate, banking, and financial markets.2\nSo this morning I intend to provide some of my own perspectives on the economy, the Federal Reserve's actions, and the lessons we can draw from the Japanese experience. I hope, in addition, that my remarks will bolster my fundamental argument: It is essential that we ultimately remove many of the extraordinary programs needed to fight our economic problems - and, by the way, many of those programs are already well on the way to being unwound - but, at the same time, we need to be sure the economy continues on a path that will bring the unemployment rate down. And in my view, we need to see inflation return to a trajectory that is more consistent with where I would like to see it settle in the longer run.\nInflation and Monetary Policy\nI would like to begin with a few of my own perspectives on inflation, and on the monetary policy actions undertaken by the Federal Reserve.\nIt is particularly striking to note the divergence we currently see among professional forecasters in their outlook for inflation. In stable and developed economies, inflation is generally viewed as moving relatively slowly in response to economic policies. So it is surprising how divergent the views on the outlook for inflation currently are - even over relatively short horizons.\nFor example, in Chart 3 we see that the forecasters in the Blue Chip survey disagree to a significant degree about inflation (measured by the consumer price index or CPI) in even the fourth quarter of 2010 - despite the consensus forecast that the CPI inflation rate will be about 2 percent then. What is interesting is how wide the spread is. The ten highest inflation forecasts average 3.3 percent, while the ten lowest inflation forecasts average 0.7 percent.3\nThe CPI forecast can be influenced by assumptions on food and energy prices. But no doubt the major reason for this divergence involves differences of opinion about the significant drivers of inflation.\nThe forecasters that are predicting relatively low inflation over the next several years - and I generally share this view - highlight the importance of excess capacity in the economy. These models note that the inflation rate after a recession is often well below the rate prior to the recession, as you can see in Chart 4. During recessions, there are downward pressures on wages and salaries, and many firms find it difficult to pass on price increases. In fact, a distinctive feature of the current recession has been the near disappearance of upward pressure on compensation, as seen in Chart 5. Indeed, in my own discussions with small and medium sized businesses over the past year, it is striking how many have reported that they have cut wages and benefits in lieu of further layoffs.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, many of the forecasters who expect much higher inflation rates have cited as a rationale the dramatic growth in the Federal Reserve balance sheet in response to the financial crisis, as Chart 6 shows. Just for clarity, I should note that many foreign central banks have taken a similar course with their own balance sheets in this crisis.\nInitially, much of the increase was related to our efforts to stabilize financial markets, last fall, and was designed to \"automatically\" diminish as the economy heals. Most of the programs initiated last fall were designed to be attractive during periods of financial stress and less attractive (that is, quite costly for the participant) during less stressful periods - thus encouraging firms to seek funds from sources other than the Federal Reserve when market conditions were more normal.\nIndeed, as Chart 7 shows, Federal Reserve lending to support money market funds, the commercial paper market, primary dealers, and foreign central banks grew rapidly last fall, but has since fallen quite dramatically. In fact, our lending supporting money market funds and primary dealers is now virtually zero, and the other two programs have shrunk quite dramatically. However, as these programs have wound down, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing mortgage-backed securities and government securities to stabilize financial markets and lower the cost of funds, to help promote economic growth. These purchases have added to our balance sheet as the shrinking of the liquidity programs has drawn it down - so that on net our balance sheet has remained relatively stable, and large, in recent months. As a reminder, with the constraint of the zero nominal bound on the fed funds rate, alternative policy instruments had to be examined.\nLessons from Japan's Experience\nWith this background I would now like to share some observations on Japan's experience - hopefully to help us narrow this difference of opinion about inflation's trajectory and its drivers. I should stress at the outset that I do not equate our situation to Japan's, or expect us to follow Japan's path; but I do think there are insights to gain from their experience.\nThis perspective may be particularly helpful in relation to concerns about the impact of the growth of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The impact is hard to quantify, because we have not needed to take such dramatic actions in the previous 50 years here in the United States or in most other advanced economies - there is simply not much historical data on a crisis like this. The closest precedent to the current expansion of a central bank's balance sheet in a developed economy involves the actions taken by the Bank of Japan, in response to their financial crisis that began in the early 1990s.\nChart 8 shows that following the sharp decline in stock prices in Japan in 1990, the Bank of Japan began to lower interest rates. Interest rates were reduced quite gradually - over a four-year period interest rates 4 moved from over eight percent to one half of one percent.5 The gradual nature of this action stands in contrast to Federal Reserve policies in the recent crisis. Then, once the Bank of Japan had reduced interest rates to nearly zero, the Bank began using what you might call non-traditional monetary policy actions.\nAs there were tentative signs of recovery, and because of concerns with fiscal deficits, the Japanese government announced a tax increase in 1997. Shortly thereafter GDP fell sharply and Japan went into a period of deflation that persisted for much of the past decade. Chart 9 highlights the fact that during that period, the Bank of Japan nearly tripled the size of its balance sheet. Despite the sizable expansion of bank reserves that this entailed, core consumer prices fell throughout the period - with a brief pause in mid 2008. Strikingly, the CPI line is below the zero line on the chart for most of a decade.\nFurthermore, not only was monetary policy accommodative, but so was fiscal policy, as you can see in Chart 10. The 1997 tax increase notwithstanding, the ratio of government debt to GDP more than doubled, and is currently more than double the rate in the United States. To be clear, however, I would note that Japan's private saving has historically been much higher than that of the United States.\nSo, why did Japan experience deflation despite very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy? Certainly part of the story involves problems with financial institutions. Japan's government was famously slow to force resolution of banking problems, and many Japanese banks were constrained because their capital was not sufficient to support growth in their assets.6 As a reminder, loans are assets for banks, and banks are obliged to maintain a reasonable capital-to-assets ratio.\nAs Chart 11 shows, bank lending in Japan did not expand despite the sizable increase in the balance sheet of the Japanese central bank. Sizable increases in bank reserves will have little impact on the economy if banks are shrinking assets, which they do primarily by maintaining tight credit standards for lending, in order to meet capital requirements. In essence, the bank reserves sat in the banking system. Had Japanese banks been able to lend these reserves to credit-worthy businesses, it would likely have spurred economic activity.7 But dormant, un-lent bank reserves have little if any effect on spending - and consequently, in an environment of significant excess capacity, will do little to spur an increase in inflation.\nI see three important lessons to take from the Japanese experience:\nFirst, taking gradual action in response to a significant asset-bubble decline may not be as effective as taking more aggressive action. Thus I am pleased to note that both the decrease in U.S. interest rates and the increase in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet have occurred over a much shorter time period than we saw in Japan.\nSecond, significant expansion of the central bank's balance sheet is not likely to be inflationary during a period when financial institutions are capital-constrained and substantial excess capacity exists in the economy.8\nThird, persistent problems in the financial sector may be a significant impediment to a general economic recovery, because of the importance of credit being available to finance the economic expansion.\nConclusion\nAnd now I'll offer a few concluding remarks.\nBased on the historical experience with inflation in the United States and Japan, I personally expect our primary short-run concern to be disinflation rather than inflation. The growth rate of the core PCE inflation index over the past year is 1.3 percent. This rate is well below the 2 percent rate that most members of the FOMC expect to see in the long run, as revealed in their published forecasts.9\nThere remains substantial excess capacity in the economy, and while I expect that we will see positive growth in the third and fourth quarter of this year, it will not be sufficient to make significant headway in improving labor-market conditions right away. This significant excess capacity in labor markets has the potential to be disinflationary at a time when the inflation rate is already below where we expect it to settle in the long run.\nDespite the many positive signs we are seeing in the economy, the financial markets and the real economy need more time to heal. There are significant impediments to more rapid growth. Commercial real estate prices have been falling in many areas of the country, and non-performing commercial real estate loans have been rising. Such loans are likely to be a potential challenge for many of the banks that are trying to improve their balance sheets. Also, while credit conditions have improved, firms and individuals with impaired balance sheets are likely to find credit difficult and costly to obtain. And individuals that are still recovering from house and equity values well below their peaks are likely to remain slow to spend on consumer goods until their comfort with their \"household balance sheet\" has been restored. These challenges will likely make the recovery rather restrained by historical standards, with subdued levels of spending and lending continuing to hold back a more rapid recovery.\nWhile many of the non-traditional approaches to monetary policy enacted to combat the recession are already in the process of being removed, how quickly to further reduce the policy accommodation should depend on economic conditions. In particular, we need the economy to grow rapidly enough that unemployment falls substantially and inflation settles at a rate near 2 percent. Price stability implies that the inflation rate should not diverge significantly on the downside or upside. Thus, just as policy needs to insure that inflation rate does not get too high, equally important is that it does not get too low.10\nThe extraordinary economic times we have been experiencing give us all pause, and leave many observers with concern about policy actions and their possible outcomes. I believe, however, that despite the differences in our economies, the lessons from Japan's experience are illuminating and should bring comfort that current U.S. policy is on the right path - with beneficial implications for the trajectories of both inflation and economic growth.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Testimony\nChairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and distinguished members of the Committee, I thank you for your invitation to testify today. My name is Paul Willen, and I am one of the Senior Economists and Policy Advisors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which as you know is one of the twelve regional Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System. I would like to stress that the views I share with you today are mine, not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the other Reserve Banks, or the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.\nIn the time allotted today I plan to briefly summarize some key findings in the research that I and several talented co-authors have done over the last two years – findings that I think are particularly relevant to the issue of foreclosure prevention. I have also submitted a written statement to the committee, which contains more detail on our research, and which I respectfully request be accepted for the record.\nI hope that my comments today and our broader research will be helpful to the Committee, as you consider the important issues that are the focus of this hearing.\nThe limited success of foreclosure prevention strategies undertaken to date results, at least partly, from reliance on theories about the causes of the crisis that – while intuitively appealing – are at odds with the data. In my remarks today I will focus on four facts from the data which contradict widely held beliefs about the causes of the crisis:\nResets of adjustable rate mortgages have not been the main driver of borrower payment problems.\nHousehold life events like job loss and illness played a central role in the surge in foreclosures that started in 2007, even prior to the start of the recession.\nMost borrowers who got subprime mortgages would not have qualified for a prime mortgage for that transaction.\nThe practice of securitization is not the main reason that lenders have failed large numbers of home mortgages. A more plausible explanation is that it is simply unprofitable for them to do so.1\nI would respectfully submit that policies that ignore these facts - however well intentioned - will address some smaller problems while regrettably ignoring much more serious ones. According to the conventional wisdom, large payment increases associated with the first reset of subprime adjustable rate mortgages led to large numbers of foreclosures. To test this in the data, researchers – including but not only my co-authors and me – have looked at a large sample of individual loan histories which provide information about both the expected payments owed by borrowers and whether borrowers made those payments. If resets were truly important, we would expect to see a dramatic increase in the likelihood that a borrower has trouble with his or her payment to coincide with the first reset of an adjustable-rate-mortgage. But we see no such relationship in the data and, in fact, the majority of borrowers who default on subprime adjustable rate mortgages start missing payments long before the rate increases with a reset.2\nPart of the reason for the confusion about the resets is the widespread and, we have found, incorrect belief that rates on subprime ARMs spike dramatically at the reset. Our research reveals that in fact the so-called \"teaser\" rates on subprime mortgages were very high to begin with. Indeed the phrase \"teaser rate\" is something a misnomer as it was typically 3 percentage points higher than the rate on an equivalent prime mortgage. The bump in rates at the reset, which is typically tied to six month London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), was only about 3 percentage points when LIBOR peaked in 2007, and the Fed Fund rate cuts in the fall of 2007 largely eliminated the reset as an issue entirely. Starting in 2008, most subprime mortgages saw no change in the rate at the reset. The fact that there was no improvement in loan performance corresponding to interest rate cuts suggests the limited scope of resets as a problem. Allow me a point of clarification that is more than mere semantics. Some commentators have erroneously equated subprime mortgages with alternative-mortgage products like so-called Option-ARMs. Option-ARMs, which allow borrowers to pay less than the interest on the loan, and make up for it by adding to the principal balance, were not generally marketed to subprime borrowers, and our investigation of the data suggests that the typical pool of subprime loans had no Option ARMs at all. In fact, the majority of problem subprime loans were fully-amortized loans and many of them were, in fact, fixed rate mortgages. Option ARMs have been and will continue to be a problem but they are not, nor have they ever been, the main source of problems in the mortgage market.\nA second point. The conventional wisdom until very recently minimized the role of so-called \"life events\" like unemployment and illness in generating defaults on subprime mortgages. People argued that life-events could not explain the surge in defaults in 2007, because there was no underlying surge in unemployment or illness that year. But I believe that view reflects a misunderstanding of the interaction of house price depreciation and life events in causing default. Foreclosures rarely occur when borrowers have positive equity, for the simple reason that a borrower is almost always better off selling if they have to leave the house anyway. Thus, detrimental life events have no effect on foreclosures when prices are rising. Consider that in 2001, Massachusetts suffered a fairly severe recession which led to a big increase in delinquencies, but the number of foreclosures actually fell to a record low, as shown in the chart I have included with my testimony (Figure 1). But when home prices fall, some borrowers can no longer profitably sell, and then the income-disrupting life-events really take a toll. Thus we did not need to see a surge in life-events to get a surge in foreclosures, but rather a fall in house prices – which is exactly, and unfortunately, what we saw.\nIn understanding the role of unemployment in foreclosures, for example, one has to understand that large numbers of households suffer job losses – “separations,” in the lingo of labor economics – even when the economy is doing well. Even in the summer of 1999, in the best labor market in a generation, 300,000 individuals filed new claims for unemployment insurance every week. Because house prices were rising rapidly, few of these job losses ended in foreclosure. But the recession that started at the end of 2007 and worsened dramatically in the fall of 2008 has aggravated the problem. The separation rate has increased and importantly, the finding rate – the rate at which unemployed worked get new jobs – has fallen to record lows. While a recession certainly makes the foreclosure problem worse, it is not necessary to generate large numbers of employment-related foreclosures.\nOne key policy concern I see is the likelihood that the problem of negative home equity and job loss will persist even after the economy recovers. A borrower with negative equity is, unfortunately, somewhat like a patient with a weak immune system – shocks easily absorbed by a \"healthy\" homeowner can prove fatal to a homeowner with negative equity. To see this depicted, please note again Figure 1. In Massachusetts, house prices stopped falling in 1992 and a vigorous economic recovery started the following year; but we saw elevated foreclosure numbers for the next five years. The reason is, I believe, rather easily determined: homeowners who bought at the peak of the market in 1988 did not have positive home equity and the protection it brings from foreclosure until house prices fully recovered the 1988 peak in 1998.\nMy third point relates to the oft-made claim that many borrowers who used subprime mortgages were \"steered\" into subprime loans and, in fact, would have qualified for prime loans. Part of the problem here relates again to a misunderstanding of what a subprime loan is. What differentiates a subprime loan from a prime loan is not the loan itself – a subprime adjustable rate mortgage is no different from a prime adjustable rate mortgage – but rather the characteristics of the transaction: the size of the down payment, the ratio of the monthly payment to income, the credit history of the borrower, the level of documentation provided by the borrower, among other things.\nCareful analysis of the data shows that the vast majority of borrowers who took out subprime loans could not have qualified for prime loans. We looked at a large sample of subprime mortgages in New England in 2007 and defined a prime loan as a loan to an owner-occupant, with a loan-to-value ratio of 90% or less, full documentation of income and assets, a borrower FICO scores of 620 or higher, and a monthly payment that was less than 45% of monthly income. Only 9.6% of the mortgages identified as subprime met these criteria. Furthermore, that subset of prime-qualifying buyers got mortgages with characteristics very similar to prime mortgages available at the time – 65% had fixed interest rates and the average initial interest rate for these loans was 6.7%.3\nIt should be clear that borrowers may well have been steered into transactions that required subprime loans. For example, a real estate agent may have convinced them to buy an expensive house or a mortgage broker may have encouraged them to do a cash-out refinance that in either case required a loan that no prime lender would approve given their income and credit history. But conditional on the actual transaction, there is no evidence right now that borrowers who used subprime loans could have qualified for a prime loan. The evidence typically cited to make the claim that borrowers were steered is that over the period 1999 to 2006, the fraction of borrowers who used subprime loans but had FICO scores typically associated with prime mortgages increased sharply, going from about 35% to 70% in our data. What this evidence fails to take into account is that over that same period, all the other characteristics of the loans deteriorated sharply: the average LTV for a subprime borrower with 660 FICO went from 82% to 95%.4\nMy fourth and final comment today relates to foreclosure prevention strategies. Foreclosures are bad for homeowners, but they are also bad for lenders, which typically recover less than half the principal owed to them. So it seems natural to think that borrowers and lenders could work together to arrive at some happy medium in which the borrower gets to stay in his or her home and the lender continues to receive payments, albeit smaller ones. In our most recent paper, we find that such renegotiation is extremely rare. Through careful statistical work using a dataset with 29 million active residential loans, we were able to look at borrowers in the year after they became seriously delinquent. Our main finding is that lenders are reluctant to renegotiate loans: only about 3 percent of the seriously delinquent borrowers in our sample received payment reducing loan modifications in the year subsequent to their first 60-day delinquency.5\nA leading explanation for this relative paucity of renegotiation is the view that since most loans are securitized now, the fragmented ownership and contractual complexity inherent in such transactions makes it difficult for borrower and lender to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. But our data does not support this theory. We find servicers equally reluctant to modify loans, whether they are owned in portfolio or serviced on behalf of securitization trusts.\nWe argue that a more plausible explanation for the unwillingness of lenders to renegotiate is that it simply isn’t profitable. The reason is that lenders face two risks that can make modification a losing proposition. The first, which has been recognized as an issue by many observers and researchers, is \"redefault risk\" – the possibility that the borrower who receives a modification will default again, and thus the modification will have only served to postpone foreclosure and increase the loss to the investor as house prices fall and the home itself (the collateral) quite possibly deteriorates. The second risk, which has been largely ignored but I believe is no less important, and arguably more, is \"self-cure risk\" – the possibility that the borrower would have repaid the loan without any assistance from the lender. About a third of the borrowers in our large sample are current on their mortgages or prepay a year after they become sixty days delinquent. An investor would view assistance given to such a borrower as \"wasted\" money.\nLet me conclude by saying that my observation, rooted in our investigation of the data, that servicers and investors may find modification unprofitable should not be misconstrued as suggesting that modification is not desirable for society at large and the economy. The private net present value and the social net present value of a modified loan may well be very different. An investor may have an urgent need for cash that leads it to find the short-term payoff of a foreclosure far more attractive than the uncertain longer-term (but potentially larger) payoff from a modified loan.\nWe hope that these empirical findings about the crisis add important, and per- haps unexpected, insights to your work as policymakers. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. I would of course be happy to address any questions you might have.",

            "content": "RiskCapital 2009: The Global Risk Regulation Summit Brussels, Belgium\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today.The topics being discussed at this conference are of great importance to us all - market participants as well as policymakers. We share a keen interest in the return to stability, and future vibrancy, of the financial infrastructure that underpins economies around the world.•\nThe financial crisis of the past two years has made it clear that significant gaps exist in global financial regulation. In the United States, the crisis made absolutely necessary a great deal of unprecedented intervention in financial markets. To avoid an even deeper crisis, the U.S. Treasury provided capital infusions to a large number of commercial banks, the FDIC substantially expanded its guarantees over bank liabilities, and the Federal Reserve expanded its discount window activities to support the liquidity needs of banks and other financial-market participants.\nNotably, this support for the financial system has, out of necessity, gone well beyond commercial banks to include financial institutions that did not have access to deposit insurance and often did not have the oversight of a bank regulator. Money market mutual funds were provided insurance from the U.S. Treasury, and now have access to liquidity in the event of significant demand for redemptions. Credit facilities have been established by the Federal Reserve to support renewed issuance of commercial paper and to revive the securitization market. The largest investment banks were provided access to the Federal Reserve's discount window, and have either been acquired by commercial banks or become bank holding companies. Insurance companies have received access to TARP funds.1 These proactive steps have been difficult but absolutely crucial, in my view, to avoiding much worse outcomes.\nThe United States is not alone in this type of necessary support for financial markets. Central banks and financial regulators across the globe have adopted a variety of programs, many of which are similar to those adopted in the U.S. This government intervention has been necessitated by concerns that financial markets were in danger of significant systemic problems, where the failure of one or more financial institutions could create contagious losses of confidence that would destabilize a broad set of financial-market participants around the globe.\nMy remarks today will focus on the roles and responsibilities of a so-called \"systemic regulator\" .2 Please note that when I speak here of a systemic regulator I am sharing my own general views of that role, in broad terms, rather than discussing any specific proposal currently under consideration.3\nFurthermore, I am specifically focusing on the activities of a systemic risk regulator that involve so-called macroprudential analysis4 - or in shorthand, macroprudential supervision. There are other aspects of systemic risk regulation, such as resolution authority, that do not necessarily need to be the responsibility of the entity that supervises systemically important institutions. As Chairman Bernanke noted in a March speech on financial reform to address systemic risk, \"Financial stability […] could be further enhanced by a more explicitly macroprudential approach to financial regulation and supervision […] Macroprudential policies focus on risks to the financial system as a whole […] [and] a macroprudential approach would complement and build on the current regulatory and supervisory structure, in which the primary focus is the safety and soundness of individual institutions and markets.\" 5\nIndeed, I would like to begin by highlighting some differences between a macroprudential supervisor and one focused on traditional bank-solvency oversight. I will then touch on the characteristics of two types of institutions that render them \"systemically important\" - first, large and highly leveraged institutions, where losses of capital could have a magnified impact on the economy; and second, financial institutions that have extensive counterparty exposure to other financial institutions and financial markets, such that their failure could create significant problems for domestic and international counterparties in \"domino\" fashion. Note that most of the institutions likely to fit this definition are, or have recently become, bank holding companies that are already under the supervision of the Federal Reserve - although systemic regulation would differ from the traditional supervisory responsibilities of the Federal Reserve.\nI plan to then discuss some of the roles and responsibilities a systemic regulator should have, in order to prevent contagious failures. In particular I will argue that the systemic regulator should have the ability to do the following three things, at a minimum, at systemically important institutions:\nFirst, supervise capital structure to minimize the potential for problems originating at such institutions to spill over to others.6 This can, perhaps, be pursued by limiting debt instruments that qualify for capital; requiring banks to hold additional capital during expansionary periods; and mandating higher capital ratios for systemically important firms.\nSecond, supervise liquidity risk and asset-liability management to minimize the likelihood, and impact, of runs on institutions.\nThird, supervise risk management so that systemically important institutions have robust and effective means of evaluating risk, thus minimizing the likelihood of needing government support to avoid the spread of contagious instability.\nTo give you a peek at the bottom line, I will conclude that such responsibilities overlap with what is needed for effective oversight of potential discount window borrowing, if such borrowing is available to non-depository systemically important financial intermediaries. Monitoring solvency risk and liquidity risk are key elements of discount window analysis, and are also key components of macroprudential supervision.\nTraditional and Macroprudential Oversight of Financial Institutions\nOversight of financial institutions has traditionally focused on the safety and soundness of individual institutions, consumer protection, and investor protection. Today I am going to focus on the first - safety and soundness regulation - to highlight how it differs from macroprudential supervision.\nBank supervisors have long focused on understanding the likelihood that a bank could become insolvent, and then taking actions aimed at protecting government-insured deposits. One of the main tools employed to assess the probability that a bank could become insolvent has been to periodically rate institutions according to their capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk (the so-called CAMELS rating). The higher the likelihood of insolvency, the higher the CAMELS rating - and the more aggressive the supervisory response.\nFrequently, examiners spend significant time analyzing the adequacy of reserves, given asset quality. Reserve levels are calculated based on accounting standards that focus on incurred losses at the bank, rather than expected or unexpected losses. The incurred-loss model can sometimes be at odds with a more risk-based view that is more forward looking. By focusing on reserves in the manner defined by accounting rules, examiners are looking at history7 rather than focusing on whether banks have adequately provided for future losses. During periods when asset prices are rising rapidly and when nonperforming loans tend to be low, this construct can result in lower estimates for incurred losses and thus lower reserves - while at the same time, earnings and capital will likely be growing.\nPeriods when earnings are strong and nonperforming loans are low are likely the times that a macroprudential supervisor would need to be particularly vigilant. Rising asset prices are often accompanied by increases in leverage, as financial institutions provide financing for sectors of the economy that are growing rapidly. This growth frequently occurs with lessened attention to underwriting standards, a greater willingness to finance long-run positions with short-term liabilities, and a greater concentration of loans in areas that have grown rapidly. So - unlike the focus on incurred losses and accounting reserves of traditional safety and soundness supervision - a systemic regulator would need to be focused on forward-looking estimates of potential losses that could cause contagious failures of financial institutions.\nI should acknowledge that even in traditional supervision, examiners can also focus on future or unexpected losses - and in theory, capital is expected to provide protection for losses occurring outside the accounting reserve model. But in practice, this is not always the case.\nLessons from the Current Financial Crisis\nThese nuances in supervision approaches - and, more generally, the need for a new and enhanced focus on supervision - are illuminated by the recent experience of some of the large investment banks during the financial crisis. As Figure 1 highlights, from 2004 to 2006 there was very rapid growth in the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS). As the figure shows, privately issued mortgage-backed securities outstanding grew by almost $1.5 trillion over that period of just three years.\nFigure 2 shows that there was also rapid growth in financial assets outstanding for broker-dealers during this period. This growth in their balance sheets aggravated what were already very large leverage ratios - these firms were operating with less than half of the leverage capital ratio of many large commercial banks. The investment banks were very profitable during this period as the securitization of mortgages and the \"tranching\" of mortgage-backed securities provided substantial fee income.\nOne method for financing the growth was increased reliance on short-term repurchase or \"repo\" agreements. As shown in Figure 3, repo agreements outstanding expanded very rapidly between mid 2004 and mid 2007. This short-term financing of longer-term mortgage-backed securities made institutions particularly susceptible to any disruption to their ability to \"roll\" the short-term financing. While during this period broker-dealers were generating significant profits, they were accompanied by greater leverage and a riskier asset-liability mix.\nPeriods of market booms and other expansionary periods are precisely the times that macroprudential supervision would diverge from more traditional prudential supervision. Historically, prudential supervision has been largely reactive, becoming more activist as losses mount (or conditions otherwise deteriorate) at an institution. In contrast, a macroprudential supervisor should be particularly attuned to changes - especially dramatic ones - in such areas as leverage, asset-liability mix, or underwriting standards. This requires the macroprudential supervisor to be willing and able to \"lean against the wind\" during booming markets or other periods. It is not that economic conditions are necessarily riskier in good times, but rather that economic actors become more confident and thus more willing to incur risks.\nAnother key ingredient in the financial crisis was the fact that several large U.S. institutions were highly leveraged and had extensive counterparty exposures. Such exposures are particularly likely to accumulate when institutions trade extensively outside of traditional exchanges. Thus, while firms such as AIG and Lehman Brothers had no significant depository, their counterparty exposures created the possibility of contagious failures. Thus, both firms had attributes that made them systemically important - they were highly leveraged institutions and they had extensive counterparty exposures. A significant complicating factor, I would add, was their importance in international markets as well as domestic markets. This greatly complicated the ability to easily restructure, or to use traditional bankruptcy procedures.\nWhile it sounds obvious, it is important to note that a systemic regulator would need the ability to monitor systemically important institutions. In the most recent period, this would have required understanding things like the risks in the originate-to-distribute model of lending and securitizing; and the ability to link the rapid expansion in asset-backed securities to increased leverage and liquidity risk. Systemic risk could potentially have been reduced had there been a systemic regulator that questioned and resisted the increased leverage and liquidity risk, and potentially required an increase in capital reserves and possibly the use of debt instruments that could be converted to equity should the firms face a liquidity or solvency crisis.\nThe Role of the Discount Window\nIn more normal times, the discount window is intended to fill two roles - first to serve as a \"safety valve\" by providing liquidity to solvent firms that is not otherwise available in the market; and secondly, to help facilitate orderly resolutions of insolvent depository institutions. Both roles have characterized discount window lending during the current crisis in the United States. During the crisis, both discount window roles have also been extended to non-depository institutions - for example, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility enabled approved broker-dealers to have access to the discount window when interbank funding markets were under stress. Traditional discount window lending requires continuous monitoring of firms to ensure they are solvent in order to gauge the level of credit risk that the firm poses to the Federal Reserve as lender, and to determine whether funding needs of a firm have transitioned from liquidity to solvency concerns.\nThe establishment of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility has raised the issue of whether any firm deemed systemically important should have access to the discount window facility. As can be seen in Figure 4, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility was actively used during spikes in financial stress during the recent crisis. These are the very times where making the distinction between liquidity and solvency risk will be most important. If systemically important firms are granted access to the discount window, discount window operations will - much like the role of a macroprudential supervisor - have to involve evaluating the solvency and liquidity risk of such systemically important firms in order to gauge the level of credit and other risks posed to the Federal Reserve, and ultimately the taxpayer, by extending credit to the firms.\nConcluding Observations\nI will leave you with a few summary observations. As I mentioned at the outset and hopefully illustrated in my remarks, a systemic regulator should have the ability to supervise capital structure, supervise liquidity risk and asset-liability management, and supervise risk management - all to minimize the likelihood of systemically important institutions negatively impacting market functioning and economic stability, proving \"contagious\" to counterparties, and possibly needing government support to avoid further spreading damage or instability.\nA systemic regulator or macroprudential supervisor would need not only the ability to monitor systemically important institutions, but also the ability to change behavior if firms are financing a boom by increasing leverage and liquidity risk. It follows that legislation that aims to design an effective systemic regulator needs to provide the regulator with the authority to make such changes. Understanding the activities of systemically important firms would require a clear picture of their leverage, their liquidity, and their risk management. Furthermore, to be truly effective in \"leaning against the wind,\" such a regulator would need the ability to prevent the build-up of excessive leverage or liquidity risk.\nIt is noteworthy that the role of closely monitoring solvency and liquidity risk on an ongoing basis would be very similar to what might be expected of discount-window operations, were the discount window to be made available to systemically important institutions regardless of whether they owned a depository institution.This of course suggests the logic of a role for the discount-window operator - in the U.S., the Federal Reserve - in macroprudential supervision.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Panel Discussion at the Conference on Financial Markets and Monetary Policy Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking Washington, D.C.\nIt is a pleasure to be here with everyone participating in the conference, and my fellow panelists and Vice Chairman Kohn.1\nThe financial crisis of the last 20 months highlights the need for better understanding of the links between financial intermediaries, financial markets, and the real economy. Consider the fact that many models of the economy underestimated emerging problems, in part because the financial links to the real economy are, in my view, only crudely incorporated into most macroeconomic modeling. Indeed, most forecasters did not recognize we were in a recession in the spring of 2008 even though the recession, as now dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), began in December 2007. Of course this happens with recessions, but my point is that even after serious problems in housing and financial markets were revealed, many forecasters underestimated the size, severity, and length of the downturn. In fact, many analysts and economists were focused on short-term inflation risks in the spring of 2008, when we were entering the most severe recession of the past 50 years.\nPart of the reason, I think, relates to three critical features of this crisis I would highlight - features, I would add, that are likely to have a long-lasting impact on financial markets and perhaps on how economists perceive them:\nthe first is the increased importance of disruptions to liquidity;\nthe second involves the significant changes that occurred in securitization;\nthe third involves banks and their role in the economy.\n1. The Role of Liquidity\nLiquidity risk has received relatively scant attention in academic research. And the Basel II Capital Accord, which focused on a bottom-up assessment of risks at financial institutions, emphasized holding capital for credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.\nWhile liquidity risk was acknowledged, it had no explicit treatment in \"Pillar 1\" of the Basel II framework, and received relatively little attention in other portions of the framework.2\nSimilarly, liquidity receives relatively little focus from most macroeconomists. While it is mentioned in money and banking texts, liquidity is generally characterized as a short-lived problem that can be handled by effective use of the Fed's discount window. With most liquidity problems short-lived (for example, after the September 11 terrorist attacks), liquidity did not receive that much attention from most economists, financial institutions, or regulators.\nBut this crisis has been different in that there has been an extended period where bid-to-ask spreads have widened, where conditions have hindered buying or selling in short-term credit markets absent significant price movements, and where there has been a drying up of the ability to engage in various financial transactions that were formerly quite routine and markets that were quite active. I refer to the notion of a \"liquidity lock,\" by which I mean extreme risk aversion by many investors and institutions that fear they will not be able to sell assets in a timely fashion without steep discounts.3 This makes short-term financing difficult to come by, for even creditworthy firms - including financing for very short maturities, measured in days. At certain points in this crisis, market participants saw few if any bids for even high-grade financial paper that had a maturity greater than one day. Another manifestation was the unwillingness of many of the largest financial institutions to lend to each other - as represented by the very large spread between the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and the overnight index swap rate.4\nThis unwillingness to take credit risk or to lend money other than overnight constrains creditworthy borrowers from undertaking worthwhile projects - and thus has implications for economic growth. And these disruptions have not been short-lived; even more than 20 months into the crisis many markets are still not functioning as they did.\nExchange-traded markets seem to have been less disrupted than markets dominated by dealers. This has broader implications for market structure and potential systemic risk - implications that I hope will get more attention from researchers and regulators in the future.\nA variety of financial institutions and markets are undergoing significant change as a result of liquidity concerns. Considering our time today I will focus on just one example, changes occurring in the money market mutual fund industry. Money market funds do not generally receive much attention. They receive short-term deposits that are then invested in highly liquid short-term investments. But the size and role of the industry has probably been underappreciated - at the end of the second quarter of 2007, money market funds had $2.5 trillion in assets, and were major holders of financial and non-financial commercial paper and large certificates of deposit (CD's).\nFollowing the failure of Lehman Brothers, investors in some money market funds that held Lehman securities began to withdraw money. Redemptions rose dramatically. Because of losses on the Lehman securities, the Reserve Primary Fund was unable to maintain the standard $1 per share current net asset value - they \"broke the buck.\" This had very significant implications, as did the need of numerous banks to support their money market funds to avoid a similar outcome. For example, because of concern over redemptions, money market funds that were still willing to purchase commercial paper wanted only very short maturities.\nAs Figure 1 shows, the overall result was a significant outflow from prime money market funds, which merited a policy response. The Treasury announced a temporary insurance program and the Federal Reserve created two liquidity facilities under its \"Section 13-3\" authority.5 Since market participants largely viewed the programs as temporary, there have been significant shifts in the holdings of money market mutual funds. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show that such funds have shifted their composition materially, away from commercial paper and toward more liquid government securities. In part this represents a change in preferences of investors, who have shifted assets to government funds, and in part a change in preferences of fund managers seeking more liquid positions. However, the shift has disrupted the commercial paper market, increasing spreads and causing some issuers to rely on the Federal Reserve's commercial paper funding facility. All in all, I suspect that the shift in money-market funds' liquidity preferences is likely to have longer-term repercussions for the medium-term financing needs of firms.\nThis is just one example of how liquidity issues may have longer run implications. A broader question for economists is how illiquidity could persist for so long. While this is a good topic for future research, I would highlight two interrelated factors. First, much of the illiquidity results from concerns with counterparty risk. Major financial firms were unwilling to trade with other major firms in volume, because of concerns about solvency risk - and the opaqueness of firms made it difficult to ascertain their true financial health. Financial firms and regulators need to consider ways to make entities less opaque. Second, securitization often relied on financial firms to provide liquidity and credit support, and was dependent on investor confidence in ratings. As investor confidence in financial firms and ratings of structured products waned, securitization declined dramatically - and many markets became significantly less liquid, as firms did not want to hold assets they could not securitize.\n2. The Role of Securitization\nTurning to a second major issue, securitization, I would note that the aforementioned liquidity concerns initially had their roots in credit concerns - for example, in worries about the potential of mortgages bundled into securities to go into default. Some of my colleagues have observed that credit worries have existed for centuries - so why, this time, have credit problems turned into severe liquidity stresses? I suspect that securitization has played a role, in particular the rise of what I have called \"surrogate securitization\" (where investors were willing to buy debt assigned high credit ratings by rating agencies, to whom they basically delegated due diligence).6\nWith that thought, allow me to discuss securitization, where loans are pooled together and sold to investors. Originally, the securitization market served as a source of financing primarily for home mortgages, but increasingly it was used to finance credit card receivables, home equity loans, and car loans. Because assets were financed by issuing securities directly to the marketplace, many assumed that securitization would provide a more resilient source of financing than depending on financial intermediaries. But ironically, the events of this crisis led to a state where securitization has been severely impaired, leading to increases in the cost of financing for assets that could no longer be easily securitized.\nFigure 4 shows the significant decrease in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) outstanding. ABCP was frequently sold to money market funds and other intermediaries interested in holding short-term, high-quality paper. ABCP usually was sponsored by commercial banks that provided liquidity, credit support, or both. With the onset of the crisis it became increasingly difficult for such sponsors to place their commercial paper, as potential investors became concerned about both the credit quality of the assets and the credit quality of some sponsors. In addition, changes in accounting rules for off-balance-sheet conduits made this type of financing less economical. As a result, ABCP issuance has significantly decreased.\nSimilarly, other types of securitization have been under severe stress. As investor demand for structured finance decreased, relatively few securitizations have occurred. Figure 5 shows the dramatic decline in securitization of home equity loans, credit card receivables, student loans, and car loans. While there are alternatives to securitization, such as bank lending, this represents a narrowing of financing sources - and in the case of bank loans, has implications for capital requirements.7 Overall, the cost to borrowers is likely to go up.8\nMore research is needed on the links between banks and the securitization markets, and the structure of securitization. Many securitizations are sponsored by financial institutions, and rely on their credit and liquidity support. As a result, securitization is not as insulated from banking problems as many assumed. Also, lack of confidence in ratings has reduced investor demand. In an environment where investors are less willing to rely on third- party ratings, securitizations will need more transparent structures that allow for easier monitoring of risks.\n3. The Role of Banks\nTurning to the role of banks, in this crisis large banks have been extended unprecedented support - extensions of deposit insurance, federal guarantees of debt, and equity infusions. The support required to alleviate the crisis suggests that clearly, financial supervision and regulation must be enhanced going forward. In the limited time we have today, we cannot do justice to all the lessons we should draw from recent experience, but I would like to highlight three.\nFirst, the stress tests conducted earlier this year were instructive to banks and supervisors. Some banks had difficulty providing the data needed as inputs to the tests - data that would ideally exist as inputs to robust budgeting and risk-management systems. Thus, like the crisis itself, the stress tests highlighted shortcomings in management information systems and data.\nBecause the stress-tests were done simultaneously across institutions, using the same assumptions, it was possible to compare results - and, indeed, to observe differences in institutions' ability to undertake a rigorous test. Previously supervisors did conduct comparative exercises (called horizontal reviews), but the sequential nature of those exercises (that is, their occurrence in different time periods) made it more difficult to compare results across institutions.\nThe stress tests provide a top-down assessment of capital, based on economic assumptions - and thus provide a very good complement to the bottom-up risk assessment that is the cornerstone of most risk-management frameworks at major banks and is the cornerstone of the Basel II Capital Accord. In addition, making the results public allowed outside investors to \"bound\" the likely losses at financial institutions, even considering the more dire outlook (compared to the base forecast of many) that was part of the stress tests. This ultimately helped financial institutions raise additional capital at a critical juncture for the economy.9\nA second area that should be considered is the role of debt. A variety of debt instruments are issued by banks and qualify as capital for institutions' capital requirements, and the use of subordinated debt has been advocated by some economists. However, the reluctance to require debt to be converted to equity, or to shoulder more of the losses, should cause us to reexamine the role of debt in systemically important institutions. A number of proposals exist, but one possibility for reform would be to establish that debt instruments could be used to meet capital requirements only if they have automatic triggers to convert to common equity under certain circumstances.10 While such instruments would not likely be attractive in the current environment, they may find acceptance once the economy and financial markets have recovered.\nA third area involves the off-balance sheet operations of banks. Many large banks are market makers in assets held off of balance sheets. This has resulted in banks having very sizeable positions in derivatives instruments relative to their capital positions. In addition, banks had significant positions in structured investment vehicles and conduits that had much more risk than many financial institutions and their supervisors thought prior to the crisis. Examination and understanding of the role of off-balance sheet activities deserves significantly more supervisory attention, going forward. It will be important to ensure that capital held for off-balance sheet exposures is commensurate with the risk that they pose.\nConcluding Observations\nAllow me to close with a few concluding observations. This crisis highlights the important role of financial institutions and markets on the real economy. In my view this is an area that does not receive sufficient attention in research, or in the teaching of economics.\nThe contributions of financial institutions and markets to the length and severity of this recession are likely to be a topic of research well into the future. However, given the extent of government intervention that has been necessary, more preventive measures must be considered.\nReform efforts will need to consider appropriate regulatory and supervisory measures to insure that financial markets can efficiently allocate capital without placing the economy, and taxpayers, at this degree of risk again. To accomplish this, I would suggest that lawmakers and policymakers will need to keep in mind the complex but undeniable way that financial markets, financial institutions, and financial matters such as liquidity and securitization interact with the real economy. And this, I firmly believe, means the Federal Reserve can and must play an integral role in the financial regulatory framework in the United States.\nThank you.",

            "content": "The Worcester Economic Club Worcester, Massachusetts\nThank you for inviting me to join you this evening to talk about recent economic trends and prospects for recovery.1 As you know all too well, the economy has been in the throes of a particularly long and severe recession. The national unemployment rate has more than doubled from its low of 4.4 percent before the \"peak\" of the business cycle. All of us in this room are well aware of the toll on individuals and households brought by job losses, so this is indeed sobering.\nHowever, incoming data have been mixed of late - rather than solely negative - and the stock market has improved significantly from its low point in March. After two quarters where real GDP shrank by more than 6 percent, I expect that the economy will contract by much less than that this quarter, and that we will begin to see positive growth - perhaps by the end of the year.\nThe severity of the recession has led both fiscal and monetary policymakers to implement aggressive responses. The Federal Reserve acted aggressively on the monetary front, and the Administration and the Congress on the fiscal front with the stimulus legislation. While these policies will still take some time to have their full impact, they are in my view part of the reason the rate of decline in the economy seems to be slowing.\nCertainly any near-term recovery needs to be predicated on continued healing of the financial markets and financial system that underpin the economy. This is an outcome that is hoped for, and that policymakers are working intently to ensure, but not yet a certainty.\nNonetheless I hope the debate will soon center on the nature of the recovery, rather than the severity of the recession. It is a positive sign that some analysts are beginning to speculate on the likely nature of an economic recovery - and, indeed, that a talk focused on aspects of recovery is now quite relevant.\nCertainly a wide range of views have been expressed, with references to L, U, and V shaped recessions. While I am at heart very much an optimist, my own view of the situation suggests that due to some unusual features of this recession the economy is likely to experience a slow recovery. I'll mention these features briefly, and then explore them with you in a bit more detail.\nFirst, while the \"financial freeze\" has thawed quite a bit, it will take some time for complete normalization of financial markets and lending.\nSecond, consumers' \"balance sheets\" have been under significant strain, in part due to a loss in household wealth, and improvements will take some time.\nThird, a related point: the very sharp decline in housing prices is likely to inflict some forms of \"collateral damage.\" Labor market mobility is likely to be hampered, financing for homes is likely to be restrained, and the ability to use home equity to finance various projects will be limited.\nFourth, the economic health of key trading partners remains somewhat fragile, so it would be unwise to expect much help in the form of foreign growth that would propel our export-led industries.2\nConsidering these issues and taking into account the current level of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, my best judgment is that a rather slow recovery is likely. Unfortunately, such a forecast does still imply continued weakness in the labor market, and an unemployment rate that continues to rise through this year.\nWith significant growth in payroll employment unlikely until next year it will obviously and unfortunately be some time before we see labor markets return to what we think of as \"full employment.\" And it is too soon to know when the trough of the recession will occur, although there are hopeful signs that we are nearing it.\nThe Employment Situation\nAllow me to make a few observations on the employment situation. As Figure 1 highlights, we are in the midst of a severe recession. Since the official onset of the recession in December 2007, on net, 5.7 million American jobs have been lost.3\nWhile the 1973-75 and 1981-82 recessions brought peak unemployment rates above our current level, in these and other recessions it is important to consider not just the peak level of unemployment but also the level at the beginning of the recession, and thus the percentage point increase during the downturn. Consider Figure 2. From the official start of this recession in December 2007,4 the unemployment rate has risen by 4 percentage points - a percentage point increase from the start of the recession that already exceeds what we saw in the last three recessions. And the unemployment rate is quite likely to continue to climb, although I hope at a much slower pace than in previous months.\nI think it is important to note that labor markets tend to be somewhat lagging indicators.5 So the expectation that the economy will grow below its potential for the rest of this year suggests that the unemployment rate will likely rise through this year - even if we get to a state of slow positive growth in the economy later this year.\nFigure 3 provides the peak-to-trough changes in several of the components of real GDP. Several patterns are apparent. First is the important role played by residential investment. While residential investment accounts for a relatively small share of GDP, it is a volatile component. In three of the past four recessions, residential investment has seen the sharpest decline of the components of GDP shown in the chart. Only the 2001 recession did not have declines in residential investment from peak to trough, primarily because that recession involved imbalances in corporate balance sheets partly triggered by the rapid investment in the \"dot-com\" boom.6\nOne reason residential investment is so volatile is that it is the component of GDP most sensitive to changes in interest rates. The housing sector tends to be disproportionately impacted by rising interest rates, which typically occur when monetary policymakers are working to prevent increases in the inflation rate.\nHowever, this residential investment cycle has been different. Mortgage interest rates have remained relatively low, but residential investment has declined sharply as significant over-supply in some key areas has led to rapidly falling housing prices, which provide a strong incentive to postpone a home purchase. This time falling house prices, coupled with rising unemployment rates (rather than interest rate increases) have been the main housing drivers.\nWhile the decline in residential investment from peak to trough has been much more severe during this recession than the previous three downturns, as shown in Figure 3, this actually understates the decline for two reasons. First, residential investment was falling well before the official start of the recession. The decline in residential investment began in the first quarter of 2006, while the official start to the recession was not until December 2007. Second, we remain uncertain about the date of the trough of the recession; though it seems that it most certainly will not be the end of the first quarter of this year.\nAlso notable in this recession has been the decline in business fixed investment. Particularly since the fall of last year, businesses have reacted quite aggressively to the slowdown in economic activity. Not only have they moved to reduce overall costs by reducing expenditures for labor, but they have also slashed their investment budgets.7\nFurther, exports have declined sharply during this recession, as they have in three of the past four recessions. But once again, the decline in exports to date likely understates the ultimate size of the decline - because we have likely not yet reached the trough of this recession, and foreign economies have been weakening rather rapidly since the start of the year.\nEconomic Recovery\nFigure 4 highlights the recovery in several components of the economy in the first year following the trough of a recession. Several interesting patterns appear. In the previous three recoveries, the housing sector has shown the largest percentage change among the components of GDP shown in the figure. This largely reflects that this interest-sensitive component is usually buoyed by the reductions in interest rates that are the normal monetary policy response to recessions. This is why many analysts have highlighted the importance of seeing the bottom of the housing market for the economy to begin a true recovery.\nAnother important point related to recovery is that consumption needs to grow. While the percent change in consumption looks small in the figure relative to some of the other components, it is important to remember that consumption is by far the largest component of GDP. Because consumption accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, these percent changes are on a large base. In short, it is very difficult to have a recovery without consumers being willing to spend, which was a motivation for some of the fiscal stimulus being directed towards increasing consumption.\nIn contrast, business fixed investment is not usually the driver in the initial stages of the recovery, as businesses are hesitant to hire more workers and make further investments until the recovery is more firmly established. Government spending also plays a role in recovery, as you can see in Figure 4. Certainly in the current recession, policymakers hope the stimulus spending will play a role. Furthermore, exports normally grow during the initial stages of a recovery. This is why it is important to us that policymakers worldwide respond to a recession that is clearly global.\nImpediments to a Recovery\nNormally forecasters are slow to recognize a recovery. Just as economic models usually do not foresee the depth of economic problems at the onset of a recession, most models miss the speed of the recovery. Thus, while I do indeed expect the recovery to be slow, I am well aware of the perils in making such a forecast - given the forecast errors often made at this time of the cycle. Still, while every recession has its unique features, this recession has involved larger impacts on our economic and financial infrastructure than others - a fact that makes my outlook on the speed of this recovery rather subdued.\nThe first major impediment is the financial infrastructure. While we have seen some improvements in financial firms' stock prices, and a generally positive response to the banking industry's so-called \"stress tests,\" financial institutions and financial markets are still recovering from recent turmoil. As is shown in Figure 5, despite recent improvements, bank stock prices remain well below their cyclical peak, and the decline in bank stock prices has been more severe this recession than in the previous one.\nContinued healing of financial institutions requires recapitalization and full recognition and disposal of problem assets. While there have been significant steps taken to recapitalize many financial institutions, there has been a slower movement towards removal of problem assets from financial institutions' balance sheets (although the Treasury's Public-Private Investment Program is intending to address this). Unfortunately, countries that have experienced significant banking problems normally have a slower economic recovery, as bank lending improves only slowly while banks remain risk-averse and work to repair their balance sheets.\nIt is not only financial institutions that have been damaged; many short-term credit markets have been badly disrupted by recent events. While the commercial paper market and money market funds have shown some improvements - in part as a result of Federal Reserve lending facilities - short-term credit is still difficult to access for many firms. Similarly, while we are beginning to see some financing for securitization of assets, the securitization market is dramatically smaller than before the recession. A full recovery requires that financial markets as well as financial institutions return to their role of efficiently allocating financing.\nA second significant impediment is the amount of wealth lost during this downturn, as shown in Figure 6. Not only has the decline in the stock market been particularly severe, with many citizens reluctant to look at their monthly 401K statements, but our housing wealth has also declined significantly as housing prices fell - making the real estate pages a section of the Sunday paper many want to avoid. Because of the large loss in wealth implied by these two dynamics, it is likely that consumers will be slower to spend during this recovery as they seek to balance their saving behavior to reflect their loss in wealth.\nA ramification of this loss in wealth is less access to consumer financing. With home equity lower or gone, it is no longer a source of financing for many consumers. In addition, the financial stress created by this recession has impaired the credit rating of many consumers, making credit less available and more costly for many borrowers. In addition, many potential home buyers are finding that if they want to buy a house, lenders are requiring higher down payments, better credit ratings, and more income in relation to debt. While housing credit was by most accounts too readily available several years ago, the current environment is likely to be particularly challenging for first-time home buyers and those with modest incomes.\nFurthermore, Americans have tended to be much more mobile than residents in many other countries. As a result, job seekers could move to those regions of the country most in need of additional workers during an economic recovery. This labor flexibility is important if different regions and different industries recover at different paces. However, during this recovery low house prices and low housing demand may make individuals reluctant to move, as it would require them to lock in losses on their houses - particularly if the selling price is likely to be below the value of the loan.\nConcluding Observations\nThis recession has been long and severe. While we are beginning to see more mixed economic data, which are likely a harbinger of a trough in this recession, the economy and financial markets remain quite sensitive to additional shocks. While problems in financial institutions and financial markets have abated from last fall, the recovery is likely to be impeded until there is greater normalization in financing flows.\nI believe the aggressive monetary and fiscal response to the crisis has no doubt helped provide the foundation for an economic recovery. While I expect in the absence of significant further shocks that we will begin to see positive economic growth towards the end of this year, that growth is not likely to be robust enough to provide much improvement in labor markets until next year.\nI want to stress, however, that I anticipate that actions taken to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable growth. Furthermore the Federal Reserve has been and will remain committed to employing all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.\nFinally, as the recovery begins, it will be critical to fully evaluate the lessons of this recession, so we can make our economy, our financial markets, and our regulatory environment more resilient and less susceptible to the shocks that have impacted us all. Hopefully the start of the recovery will be an appropriate time to begin that process, in earnest.\nThank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "The Institute of Regulation and Risk North Asia Hong Kong\nIt is a pleasure to be with you this evening. The events of the last year and three-quarters have brought matters of regulation and risk - your Institute's focus - to the top of the list of concerns for national and international policymakers.1 Thank you for inviting me to share these remarks and participate in the panel discussion to follow.\nIn the past year, crises and resulting failures of a number of large internationally active financial firms have rippled across and weakened the global economy. Events demonstrated the glaring absence of resolution powers in the United States - except in the case of banks - and demonstrated the limited ability of U.S. authorities to intervene in troubled non-depository financial institutions, at least before the passage of the TARP legislation.\nThis state of affairs left the United States lacking the tools to smoothly address the failures of \"systemically important\" institutions - those whose disorderly failure could potentially lead to a drop in confidence in the global banking system, seize-ups in credit markets, the collapse of other financial institutions, and worsening economic conditions.2 Many others, including Chairman Bernanke, have noted the urgent need to address the lack of resolution authority.3 Of course, difficulties dealing with financial troubles in several European countries have shown that the United States is not alone.\nSo clearly, the role played by financial institutions in the current crisis has laid bare the need to rethink how systemically important financial institutions should be regulated and, if they fail, how they should be resolved. As you know, policymakers in the U.S. and many other countries are right now working through the intricate and challenging issues associated with creating a more effective regulatory structure, making forums like this both timely and important.\nIn a recent talk,4I expressed my view that we need to have organizations with explicit responsibility for financial stability (that is, charged with making sure that \"contagious\" failures of financial institutions do not occur, and alert to trends emerging across a swath of interconnected institutions and their counterparties5). I argued in that talk that a regulator explicitly charged with addressing financial stability probably could have spotted some of the financial trends leading up to the crisis. In my remarks today, I would like to make some observations related to questions about the powers a systemic regulator would have needed in order to mitigate some of the problems we have seen.\nAs you consider the perspectives I share this evening, I encourage you to keep at the back of your mind the scale of these regulatory challenges. In the end we need to be able to address these complex questions, and adequately empower those in the systemic-regulatory and resolution roles. If we cannot, we will do well to find other ways to limit systemic risks.\nIn particular I will focus on the need for a systemic regulator to be able to address firms' global operations, and the increased use of financial derivatives. These are key issues because financial institutions are likely to have a larger global presence over time, and to be more active in financial derivatives. Both trends represent the normal outgrowth of globally integrated economies and financial markets, and are not necessarily unwelcome or unhealthy. But the critical point is that the roles and powers of supervisors and regulators have not kept up with these developments.\nAllow me to make one important distinction at the outset. My remarks today touch on both systemic regulation and on the resolution of systemically important institutions. Clearly these roles could be carried out by either one entity or by two separate entities - a systemic regulator and a resolver of systemically important institutions. My remarks touch on both functions, while for simplicity I tend to refer in my own shorthand to a \"systemic regulator\" - but the distinction is important.\nResolution of Systemically Important Institutions\nThe financial crisis has highlighted the pressing need for better resolution procedures. For banking organizations, the FDIC has the ability to place banks under receivership without going through bankruptcy proceedings. However, these resolution powers apply only to banks, not other non-bank financial firms, and do not apply to bank holding companies.\nThe resolution power of the FDIC allows the FDIC to conduct an orderly resolution of the bank, which protects depositors and provides the least-cost solution to the government. In the case of bank holding companies and non-depository financial institutions, insolvency must be addressed in bankruptcy court. Unfortunately, bankruptcy procedures are designed to provide a clear priority among creditors, but do not provide any special provisions for an insolvency that has broad systemic implications. In such situations, it is very possible that a preferable public policy would be to minimize systemic implications rather than follow the normal creditor priority set out in the bankruptcy code.\nConsider this argument in relation to the Lehman Brothers failure. The government lacked any resolution powers in the case of investment banks, and Lehman had no immediate merger possibilities, so Lehman was forced to file for bankruptcy. The Lehman failure had broad implications for the financial system and economy. The firm was internationally active, engaged actively in derivatives contracts, and a counterparty to many other financial institutions. Figure 1, which shows legal proceedings resulting from the Lehman bankruptcy filing, is instructive.\nHad there existed the authority and procedures to resolve Lehman outside of bankruptcy proceedings, there may have been a much more orderly \"wind down\" of Lehman's operations. Of course, the Lehman failure suggests that even with resolution powers in place this would have been a very challenging situation - Lehman would have been difficult to wind down, in part because of the scope of its global operations.\nLehman Brothers operated in over 40 countries and had over 650 distinct legal operating entities outside of the United States. While there were many separate legal entities outside of the United States, the firm was managed globally - meaning many of its risk management and operating platforms stretched across its many distinct entities.\nIn the event Lehman Brothers had been placed in receivership in the United States, it is unclear how Lehman's operations outside the United States would have been treated in foreign jurisdictions. In such situations it is possible that a country would try to \"ring fence\" assets so that liability holders in the country would be paid prior to returning funds to a foreign parent.\nSuch a situation raises a number of interesting questions concerning the role of a systemic regulator. I would like to provide my own perspective on some of these questions - \"straw man\" approaches, if you will:\nFirst, for globally active and systemically important U.S. institutions, I suspect that the potential disruptions to operations associated with ring fencing will likely mean that capital support of foreign operations (that is, capital injections) will be a critical part of the resolution procedures. As a consequence, the systemic regulator would need to have the power to inject capital or request that the Treasury inject capital.\nSecond, given the speed with which failures have occurred, it may be difficult to incorporate legislative oversight of the resolution process in the short-term – so an understanding of such arrangements should be worked out between Congress and the systemic regulator.\nThird, international agreements on receivership procedures for globally active institutions will be necessary. What institutions or agencies will have a role in negotiating these procedures? I certainly believe that a systemic regulator should have a role.\nFourth, I would note that policymakers will have to sort out the appropriate uses of conservatorship (operating the bank as a going concern) versus receivership (which has the goal of liquidation) in the case of systemically important institutions.\nFifth, a systemic regulator may need the ability to require reductions in foreign exposures as a systemically important financial institution encounters problems. This might include the ability to require that foreign subsidiaries and branches be sold to avoid broader systemic problems, as financial problems increase.\nSixth, perhaps the systemic regulator will need to be able to influence the \"home/host\" rules that govern the division of labor in the supervision of internationally active firms.\nSeventh, a systemic regulator may need the ability to require higher capital requirements for globally active financial institutions that will be difficult to resolve if they become insolvent.\nBeyond these challenges related to global operations, a second problem highlighted by the crisis is the difficulty in managing the derivatives book of global financial institutions. While derivatives contracts were a problem in the case of Lehman's failure, they were particularly acute in the case of American International Group (AIG). Because of the presence of complicated, interrelated financial contracts the unwinding of the derivatives positions of AIG has been costly and time consuming.\nIncreasingly, derivatives and other forms of structured finance are inherent in the operations of large global financial institutions. However, the presence of a small number of global financial institutions as significant counterparties or dealers in the derivatives markets has made such institutions very difficult to resolve, whether through bankruptcy or through receivership. This raises several interesting issues and questions, which I will provide my own current views on:\nFirst and very importantly, I believe a systemic regulator should have the ability to require that transactions be moved to an exchange as the contract becomes standardized and widely used.\nSecond, I believe that in finding the most efficient way to resolve complicated financial transactions in the event a major player becomes insolvent, the systemic regulator would need the ability to explore whether bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, or governmental equity ownership would provide the best model for resolving complicated financial transactions that affect a large number of financial institutions around the globe.\nThird, a systemic regulator may need the ability to require financial institutions to reduce their derivatives exposure as they become financially troubled. This might include the ability to require the selling of broker or dealer operations in major markets as a firm's financial position deteriorates.\nFourth, a systemic regulator will likely need the ability to require higher capital requirements for firms that are active counterparties or dealers in complicated financial products.\nFuture Resolution Challenges\nWhile the problems of 2008 highlighted the difficulty of resolving financial institutions with large global operations and active involvement in derivatives, these problems are likely to be even more important in the future. Figure 2 highlights the importance of foreign banking operations for U.S. commercial banks. Looking forward, as more and more customers of financial institutions are either global themselves, or have supply lines and sales channels that are global, they will expect their financial institutions to have global operations. U.S. banks that are internationally active hold 18 percent of assets in foreign offices. Over time, foreign operations seem more likely to grow than contract in an increasingly global economy.\nAs U.S. financial institutions become more involved around the globe, it is likely that these institutions will become more important in their host countries and more difficult to resolve should they become financially troubled. In this regard, I would suggest the following about some of the key issues that will emerge:\nFirst, a key issue will involve the willingness of home and host countries to supervise and, more importantly, potentially bear the burden of financially supporting the operations of a large and systemically important financial institution, if it becomes troubled. This could alter what we have traditionally seen as the roles of home and host supervisors.\nSecond, it will be important to determine how best to structure U.S. financial firms abroad, to minimize the potential for disruption if the firm becomes insolvent.\nOf course, foreign firms have significant involvement in the U.S. economy. Figure 3 shows the share of U.S. bank assets held by foreign owners. British, Canadian, German, and Swiss banks all have a major presence in the United States. Some foreign banks operate large subsidiaries in the United States; others have very large branch operations. As a result, if the parent company has financial problems, it can have a downstream impact on the U.S. economy. Should foreign banks shrink as a result of financial problems, U.S. borrowers may find it more difficult to secure financing. This too raises several questions, about which I observe the following:\nFirst, it will be important to determine whether there should be a preference for branch versus subsidiary structures in systemically important institutions.\nSecond, where the financial institutions are large relative to the size of the home country, there will need to be expectations and obligations of the home country. How explicit these should be will need to be determined. We should note that in some countries, systemically important financial institutions figure very prominently in the country's economy – more so, in relation to the country's GDP, than any one U.S. financial institution does in relation to U.S. GDP.\nDerivatives contracts have become increasingly important for financial institutions - to support their customers, to serve as brokers or dealers, and to hedge their own positions. Over time, the size of the gross derivatives positions of the five largest commercial banking organizations most engaged in derivatives activity has become quite large relative to their assets (Figure 4). These positions are likely to get larger over time, and substantial derivatives operations are likely to be important for more and more financial institutions. Given their complexity and likely growth, we need to explore the implications for bank regulation and the role of a systemic regulator, and indeed to better understand their potential impact.6\nConcluding Observations\nGreater integration of the world economy and financial markets is both desirable and inevitable. However, our ability to manage insolvency risk of key players has not grown with these developments. The presence of globally active financial institutions involved in derivatives operations world-wide requires a major rethinking of how we supervise and regulate systemically important institutions. Until global resolution policies are adopted, resolution of internationally active organizations will remain problematic.\nBoth issues I have discussed today - global activity and derivatives involvement - would be important for any regulator charged with systemic responsibilities. Of course, a systemic regulator will need to consider many other issues besides the two I have highlighted today - including issues like leverage, liability management, and securitization - but given the constraints on time these additional issues will have to be a topic for another day.\nBankruptcy laws and resolution procedures are national. Home country financial supervisors have a national focus, and bank regulations apply within the firms' national borders. However, as financial firms increasingly span national borders, much greater coordination is necessary. This is particularly true as the size of financial institutions' on- and off-balance sheet exposures become large relative to the home country's financial capacity to provide emergency support to the financial institution. In some countries the focus of financial institution resolution has seemingly been the protection of government-run deposit-insurance programs - a local mindset at odds with a potentially global issue. Increasingly their attention will need to focus on potential systemic problems with global ramifications.\nI hope my remarks today have provided a sense of the urgency, and also the complexity, of these issues. I have given my own views on some of the key questions that policymakers must ultimately consider. I'll conclude by noting that the complexity of these issues makes it no less important that we address them, for the good of all participants in our economies.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nI’m Paul Connolly, chief operating officer of the Bank.  On behalf of my Bank colleagues, and our friends at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, I want to thank you for being with us today for this Workshop on Internships. \nWe believe you will find today’s Workshop to be both interesting and valuable, in large measure because of the terrific panelists, and breakout session leaders, who bring so much to the program.  My thanks to all of them.\nThe Workshop will be valuable as well because of you.  We have a rich cross-section of employers and academic institutions represented in the room.  Our program provides for lots of discussion, and for networking.  Please take advantage of these opportunities for mutual learning.\nOur Workshop this morning represents follow-through on two important research reports issued in the fall of 2008.  The Boston Fed issued one, and the Chamber of Commerce, working with Mercer, issued the other.  Both are available here this morning if you have not already read them.\nThe two studies together comprise a call to action, for Greater Boston and the broader New England region.\nTheir message is that although the region’s skilled, educated labor force has been an engine of economic growth in the past, New England’s advantage is being eroded.\nThe research conducted by my colleague Alicia Sasser at the Boston Fed shows that the supply of recent college graduates is growing more slowly in New England than in the rest of the nation, partly because new graduates go elsewhere to get jobs.\nMoreover, the study conducted by Mercer for the Chamber finds that Greater Boston is not growing its skilled workforce fast enough to meet employers’ needs, and that gaps already exist in both professional and technical occupations.\nTo address these issues comprehensively will take multiple approaches, some of them longer-term in nature.\nOne promising short-term strategy for increasing the supply of skilled, educated  workers in New England is to expand the use of internships, to retain a higher percentage of college students graduating from our colleges and universities.\nOur higher education institutions attract local young people, and students from all over the country, and excel at producing highly skilled college graduates.\nSurveys consistently reveal that recent college grads who leave New England do so primarily for job-related reasons, often without being fully aware of local job opportunities.\nExpanding the use of internships would help college students to learn more about local opportunities, and to form networks and connections in the region.\nDuring the past few months, the Chamber and the Fed have convened a small group of business leaders, and senior people from a few universities, to develop a plan for expanding and strengthening internships in Greater Boston.\nThe group includes PriceWaterhouse Coopers, Citizens Bank, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Genzyme, Mercer, Bentley, Northeastern, and Boston University.  And we’ll be reaching out more broadly as we go.\nWe agreed to focus on four initiatives in the near term. Our first initiative is this Workshop. In addition, we want to explore the possibility of some form of an online clearinghouse, to make internship opportunities more visible in ways that might help students, colleges, and employers.\nWhenever we mention it, we find that there are a lot of ideas about how this might be done.  We look forward to learning more, and your assistance is welcome.\nA third initiative will be to add value to this year’s internships.  We will look to do a few things this summer that might help to give college interns some broader knowledge about Boston and the region, and increase their feeling of belonging here, and wanting to stay here after graduation.\nFor example, we might invite employers with interns to ask the interns to come here to the Bank for an afternoon, to hear about the economy, and the roles of the Federal Reserve Bank.  That might be of some interest this year.\nOur fourth near-term initiative will be outreach.  We know there are numerous organizations in the region, both public and private, engaged in similar or related activities.  We want to connect with them, let them see what we are doing, learn about their plans, and see where we might be able to help each other.  Here also, your help is welcome.\nSome of the employers in this room have highly successful internship programs that already are working well as channels to full-time employment for the talented people they need.  We can learn from you, and   you may pick up some ideas today about how to be even more successful.\nThe majority of employers may be more like the Boston Fed.  We have college interns every year; we attract great young people; they do good work during the summer; and occasionally interns become employees after graduation.\nHowever, we want to use our internships more strategically.  We want to use more of them as low-cost, low-risk opportunities to look a year or two ahead, think about our expected employment needs, and hire interns who might be matches for those future needs.\nThe Bank, and the Chamber, believe individual employers and the broader community will benefit if more employers move toward this strategic use of internships. \nWe have several colleges and universities in the room this morning.  Some have broad and deep relationships with employers that are national models.  Others are looking to develop or grow such relationships.  We anticipate that you will learn from this Workshop, and from each other, and will make new contacts with employers as well as peers.\nOf course we all realize that we are facing strong headwinds this year when it comes to internships and employment.\nBusiness conditions are tough.  Most companies are making cut-backs, may not be focused on future employment needs, and may not be planning to do as much with college interns this year as they otherwise might.\nJust two points to consider.  First, the labor supply issues we face in Greater Boston and New England are long-term issues.  When economic conditions improve, as they will, the problem still will be with us, and the fight for talented recent graduates with needed skills will pick up again.  Internships are not difficult or costly, and when used strategically can position us better for tomorrow.\nSecond, one really inexpensive option is unpaid internships that provide academic credit for the students.  This approach can be particularly attractive during the academic year, say in the fall semester or the spring semester.  We have people on the program and in the audience who can explain how to work with colleges and students to set up such internships.  It could be another way to get to a win-win for everyone.\nThis Workshop is happening because Eric Rosengren, the President of the Bank, and Paul Guzzi, President and CEO of the Chamber, wanted follow-through on last fall’s studies.  They wanted to put research into action.  They wanted to bring people together to work on initiatives that would make a difference.  With their leadership, and your help, we’re doing it.  Thank you.   ",

            "content": "The Seoul International Financial Forum 2009 Seoul, Korea\nDefining Financial Stability Supervision and Regulation\nThe Development of Current Financial Problems: A Brief Review\nThe Role of a Systemic Regulator\nInternational Coordination\nSummary Observations\nI would like to thank the organizers of this important forum for inviting me to speak with you today.[Footnote 1] It is a great pleasure to return to Korea. On my last visit I had the opportunity to speak about the information that central banks need to make informed decisions during periods of financial turmoil. My regret is that one year later this period of financial difficulty continues. Considering the downstream economic hardships that so many people are encountering, these matters of regulatory frameworks and supervisory policies are both urgent and imperative.\nMost of the world is currently experiencing what has already been a long and severe recession. As in several previous episodes, crises at leveraged financial institutions have been at the center of problems that eventually rippled across and profoundly impacted the global economy. So, realizing the importance of a well-functioning financial sector to economic activity, many countries have taken extensive steps to stabilize financial systems, including providing additional capital in their banking system, guaranteeing debt, expanding deposit insurance, and guaranteeing (or limiting losses on) some banking assets. These policy actions were taken to support the functioning of financial institutions and markets so that problems do not derail banks' ability to continue lending to creditworthy individuals and firms, hampering economic activity.\nThe need for such extensive government intervention on an essentially worldwide basis highlights the importance of creating a more stable financial infrastructure - and, I believe, to have organizations with explicit responsibility for financial stability. As you know, policymakers in the U.S. and many other countries are right now working through the intricate and challenging issues associated with the creation of a more effective regulatory structure. So I believe this forum is both timely and important.\nDefining Financial Stability Supervision and Regulation\nIn my remarks today, I plan to explore a somewhat simple-sounding question that, when fully considered, has broad implications for the wider policy debate. The question is, could an effective systemic regulator have spotted the roots of the current crisis, identifying the problems and anticipating their ramifications early enough for action to be taken?\nTo explore this question, I think we need to consider the issue of what data an effective regulator or supervisor with explicit financial-stability responsibilities might have been examining over the past 5 years - and what questions they might have been asking as they studied these data. Keep in mind that unlike most prudential supervisors that focus on the solvency of individual financial institutions, a financial-stability regulator would clearly need to take more of a \"macro\" perspective on financial trends (and their crosscurrents and unintended consequences).\nFinancial stability is often cited but rarely defined, so for the purposes of this talk let us assume that a financial-stability regulator would be charged with making sure that what I will call \"contagious\" failures of financial institutions do not occur. Such failures could involve a large group of financial intermediaries, all with a prominent shared risk exposure, or could involve one key player becoming insolvent but many other financial institutions failing because of their exposure as counterparties to that institution. Please note that this definition does not require that the involved organizations are depository institutions, nor does it hinge on the presence of deposit insurance.\nOne - but not the only[Footnote 2] - important \"warning flag\" a systemic regulator would watch for would be any significant divergence of financial trends from those of past experience. This would not necessarily compel action by a systemic regulator, but should trigger more careful questioning. For example: How are the financial trends being financed? Are financial institutions taken together - thus, the financial system - becoming more leveraged, or significantly increasing maturity mismatches? Are prudent underwriting standards still in use across the financial system, and by potentially-contagious institutions - or are prudent standards being abandoned? In short, do these novel financial trends seem likely to hold up over time and be part of a healthy financial system, or not? What are the risks to the financial system if an institution or a \"trending\" asset type becomes illiquid, or valueless?\nUpon exploring such questions, if a systemic regulator concludes that the financial trends that diverge from past experience are indeed being generated by unsafe and unsound practices at highly leveraged institutions, and concludes that the practices could indeed result in highly correlated financial problems across the landscape of financial institutions, a fundamental issue would still remain. The systemic regulator would need to have the powers necessary to stop the unsafe practices. The issue of the powers needed to effectively mitigate such problems is very important and deserves careful thought. I plan to make it a question for another talk, another day.\nA key point is that the systemic regulator cannot just look institution by institution, but needs to think about the potentially difficult trends emerging across a swath of interconnected institutions and their counterparties. And while it may go without saying, for a systemic regulator to be effective, the regulator needs to be able to identify whether actual systemic problems are emerging. This involves, in part, assessing the \"feedback effects\" that might result from initial problems.\nSo I think it is instructive to ask whether a systemic regulator would have been able to identify the problems that we are currently grappling with. So far today I have put what I think are key issues in front of you. Now I would like to flesh them out a bit through a brief discussion of some of the financial trends leading up to the current problems, and then consider whether these trends might have generated more actions if there had been a systemic regulator focused on these issues. I will conclude with some thoughts on the international challenges to addressing systemic concerns.\nThe Development of Current Financial Problems: A Brief Review\nIn the United States, the initial trigger to the current financial crisis was deterioration in the housing market. Because our time today is short, I will discuss mainly these housing-related trends - although it should be noted that questionable practices certainly extended beyond housing markets.[Footnote 3]\nBetween 2004 and the early part of 2007, the housing market had experienced significant price appreciation, rapid expansion of construction of new houses and condominiums in some markets, and a willingness by many investors to provide financing to higher-risk borrowers (using reduced underwriting standards). The willingness to lend to borrowers who represented higher credit risks - generally by largely unregulated mortgage companies, not traditional banks - was fueled by the increased ability to securitize subprime loans.\nThe securitization process took pools of subprime mortgages and split the income streams into tranches that would bear the first losses in the event of payment disruption, and tranches that would bear losses only after the lower tranches were wiped out. Because the odds were viewed as very small that losses would be so severe as to wipe out the lower tranches and affect the upper tranches, sellers of subprime mortgage-backed securities could market the tranches protected from most losses as Triple-A rated securities.\nThe result was that lenders that normally would not have been interested in riskier subprime mortgage loans in the United States, including many foreign investors, were willing to purchase such securities primarily based on their Triple A ratings, rather than by careful credit analysis involving the characteristics of the underlying collateral.[Footnote 4]\nWhile the ability to finance mortgages with securitization helped fuel the housing boom in the United States, other countries that did not have substantial subprime lending also saw rapid increases in their real estate prices. As shown in Figure 1, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Spain all saw residential house prices expand more rapidly than did the United States. However, there were countries where residential real estate prices did not experience rapid appreciation - such as Japan and South Korea. Figure 2 shows that in some countries the growth in housing prices was much more rapid than the growth in incomes. One explanation for the rapid increase in some countries' house prices is that during this period, nations that enjoyed significant trade surpluses or were the beneficiaries of the commodity-price boom looked for investment opportunities; they gravitated to countries where real assets were appreciating and where financial institutions or financial markets were readily able to convert large pools of savings into investment opportunities.\nIn the United States, there existed significant demand for houses, including among low- and moderate-income households that looked to participate in the housing boom. The securitization of subprime mortgages provided a large pool of high-grade securities that paid higher returns than Treasury securities. These securities were attractive not only to U.S. investors but also to investors around the world looking for highly-rated securities.\nAs shown in Figure 3, beginning in 2003 subprime mortgages accounted for an increasing share of new mortgages in the United States. As the supply of low- and moderate-income borrowers with some capital and reasonable credit scores dwindled, there emerged an increased willingness to provide loans to borrowers with little or no money down. With rating agencies not sufficiently differentiating their ratings to take into account worsening underwriting standards, and housing prices in some markets beginning to decline as the economy slowed, the default rates on many pools of mortgages began to increase. As the extent of the problems became apparent in the summer of 2007, financial markets became increasingly unwilling to hold securities backed by mortgages, became wary of the reliability of ratings, and began to question the size of the direct and indirect exposure of financial institutions.\nThe Role of a Systemic Regulator\nA starting point for an effective systemic regulator would be to carefully monitor any rapid appreciation of a particular asset class, and any rapid expansion of particular financial institutions or financial markets. While rapid growth in asset prices would not in and of itself necessitate any direct actions, it should cause a systemic regulator to ask several questions.\nFirst, can one develop a plausible fundamentals-based explanation of the rapid rise in prices? Many if not all past financial crises were associated with bubbles in asset prices, and in many cases careful observers could eventually identify the appreciation as suspiciously detached from fundamentals. But there also will be cases in which the introduction of a new technology or the opening of new markets will justify a fairly rapid appreciation in an asset price that may not need to be viewed as worrisome.\nSecond, is the rapid growth in an asset class financed by leveraged institutions? Losses at leveraged institutions tend to have a disproportionate negative impact because the deleveraging process (in shorthand, reigning in assets like loans to maintain a reasonable capital-to-assets ratio at the institution) has a broad impact on the borrowers who depend on the financial intermediary for loans. In addition, most leveraged financial institutions have extensive counterparty exposures to other financial institutions, raising the risk that counterparties will call for additional collateral from interconnected institutions they see faltering, which can exacerbate problems with capitalization.\nThird, has the rapid expansion of the financing caused any financial institutions to increase their leverage? Increases in leverage make a financial intermediary more at risk should losses be incurred.\nFourth, has there been a significant change in the mismatch involved in funding long-term assets with short-term liabilities? While the transformation of funding is an integral role for many financial intermediaries, significant changes in asset-liability maturity structure can make the financial intermediary susceptible to liquidity problems, particularly if falling asset prices reduce confidence in the financial intermediary.\nIn the most recent experience, all of these questions would need to be answered in the affirmative. As I mentioned earlier, real estate prices rose rapidly. A more subtle dynamic involved how leveraged financial institutions financed the growth. Many large commercial banks held Triple-A rated securities, or held these securities in off-balance sheet conduits. While it was well understood that these financial institutions were involved in the originate-to-distribute model of mortgage lending and securitization, what was less understood was the nature and extent of the holdings within the Triple-A securities.\nBecause of their perceived low credit risk, Triple-A rated securities received relatively little attention by bank examiners, particularly as real estate prices were appreciating. In addition, I think it is important to note that three of the largest exposures were held by a commercial bank, an investment bank, and a foreign bank, which likely made the potential problem less obvious to any single regulator.\nThe increase in leverage was most obvious for the investment banks, which had become very large players in securitizing assets. In part, the securitization was financed by holding large pools of mortgage assets and financing them through short-term repurchase agreements. The result was that investment banks had not only increased their leverage significantly (see Figure 4) but they had also increased the mismatch of the terms of their assets and liabilities. This made the investment banks that were actively originating and distributing mortgages at greater risk should investors become less confident in their organizations.\nBecause no one was charged with systemic regulation, the problematic links among an array of key factors were largely missed, until the problems had become quite severe. Those factors included rising real estate prices, changes in underwriting standards by largely unregulated mortgage brokers, the rapid rise in securitization outside of supervisors' purview, the dependence on credit ratings that are largely unregulated, the increased holdings of highly rated securities both off and on balance sheets, and the change in leverage and asset-liability composition of investment banks. A systemic regulator charged with taking an \"aerial view\" - understanding changes in markets and how they impact leveraged institutions - would likely have intervened earlier, if operating effectively.\nThis brings up a related point. Recent events suggest that an effective systemic regulator must have very detailed understanding of institutional practices and products - simply put, how things really work, in good times and bad. For example, securitization grew rapidly, and while many observers did take note, it took much longer to come to understand the complexities of the servicing business model and the reasons why it presents challenges in a declining market. Another example is the market for credit default swaps, which ballooned but still seems less well understood than is desirable.\nIn sum, you might say that a systemic regulator must connect potential dots - not just actual dots. Assuming the systemic regulator has the ability to monitor solvency risk, liquidity risk, and risk management practices, and react to practices viewed as unsafe or unsound, some of the most serious financial problems might have been identified, and their severity lessened.\nInternational Coordination\nFinancial problems at leveraged institutions increasingly require international coordination. While the subprime market was largely a U.S. phenomenon, the run-up in real estate prices was not unique to the United States. Other countries experienced rapid appreciation in real estate, though the financing vehicles were different.\nIn the United States both domestic and foreign financial institutions were involved. In addition, many of the American institutions had a significant global footprint. Thus, the aforementioned deleveraging process impacts any country where the leveraged institutions are active. The financial assets were also being sold worldwide.\nThe result was that losses were correlated without much regard to national borders, and exposures to the subprime market appeared in a surprising variety of financial intermediaries. Thus, the actions of intermediaries in one country can have a significant spillover to other countries' financial systems.\nAs financial intermediaries become more global, resolution becomes more difficult. The resolution of a large global player is quite different than resolution of a purely domestic institution. A globally active institution placed into receivership in the home country may quickly find that its ability to transfer deposits, cash, and capital is hampered as host countries impose controls to protect liability holders in their own country. So, until global resolution policies are adopted, resolution of internationally active organizations will remain problematic.\nBeyond this issue of the resolution of individual organizations, it seems clear that effective systemic regulators will need to understand how the actions of financial intermediaries in one country affect other countries' financial systems. This will be both extremely important and, potentially, very challenging.\nSummary Observations\nMost countries, including the United States, do not currently have a systemic regulator. In order for a systemic regulator to be effective, the regulator clearly needs to be able to identify problematic situations like those I have described today. Had there been some entity charged with such responsibilities, my hope is that sufficient \"red flags\" would have emerged to give such an entity the opportunity to prevent, or at least mitigate, some of the problems. At the same time, my remarks today should also convey the profound challenges that a systemic regulator would face. Of course, the next time a crisis begins, the patterns may be very different.\nAnd while the ability to identify emerging systemic problems is critical, it is not enough. To have an effective systemic regulator, obviously having sufficient authority to change behavior is also critically important. The issue of authority is, however, too large a topic to be covered today. I know that I, and many of you, will be exploring that topic in the days and weeks ahead.\nI want to conclude by reiterating my strong hope that the recent crisis will provide not only the opportunity but also the urgency and will for a thorough, global reexamination of how we think about systemic problems and their mitigation and resolution. And of course, as our nations consider the role of a systemic regulator it will be important that they have the ability to interact in a coordinated way with their regulatory counterparts around the world.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Field Hearing of the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives \"Seeking Solutions - Finding Credit for Small and Mid-Size Businesses in Massachusetts\" Massachusetts State House\nChairman Frank and members of the Committee, it is my pleasure to appear before you today to discuss the availability of credit for businesses amid the current economic and financial turmoil, and the steps the Federal Reserve is taking to help make credit available to small and medium-sized businesses.\nIn my testimony today I plan to first share some national context, and some perspective on the Federal Reserve System's responses to date. I plan to then comment, more briefly, on the situation in Massachusetts.\nThe National Context\nSince August of 2007, financial markets have been severely disrupted. The functioning of financial markets and the functioning of institutions that serve as financial intermediaries have tremendous downstream impacts on businesses, state and local governments, and households. As a result, these disruptions are of great concern to the Federal Reserve as we pursue our policy goals of maximum sustainable employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\nWhile credit availability has been a concern since the outset of the financial crisis, the credit situation became more severe as problems expanded beyond a few large financial institutions focused on subprime-mortgage securitizations to a broader group of financial institutions. The Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices has been showing substantial tightening of credit, which dovetails with the perspectives voiced since last summer by many advisory groups we engage at the Boston Fed. Other entities such as Associated Industries of Massachusetts are finding when they survey companies that credit conditions are tightening - and that the tightening may affect companies directly, or indirectly through suppliers and customers who face credit constraints.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains focused on ensuring adequate financing for businesses of all sizes. Last week's official FOMC statement indicated, among other things, that \"weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment.\" Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report suggested that \"The availability of credit generally remained tight. Lenders continued to impose strict standards for all types of loans, with scattered reports of further tightening and particular scrutiny focused on construction projects and commercial real estate transactions.\"\nCredit availability issues remain a significant focus at the Federal Reserve and are a significant factor in how we are addressing the current economic and financial problems. The Federal Reserve has acted proactively and creatively to address these concerns - first by aggressively easing conventional monetary policy (the federal funds rate) and, since the fall, using less-conventional monetary policy tools to mitigate continuing problems with the cost and availability of financing for businesses and households.\nFigure 1 shows how the Federal Reserve acted to address problems in financial markets, and concerns that market disruptions would impact the cost and availability of finance, by rapidly moving the target federal funds rate to only a little above zero. As the Federal Reserve lowered the target federal funds rate, most short-term market interest rates fell - although not commensurate with the decline in the federal funds rate.\nIt is important to note that many small and medium-sized businesses have loans tied to the prime rate, or to the London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor, which decreased significantly as we moved the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent in July 2007 to between zero and one-quarter of one percent at the end of December. While a year ago many observers were critical of these rapid rate cuts, it is fortunate that the Federal Reserve did move so quickly. While the reduction in interest rates did not prevent the economy's weakening, it helped cushion the economy against some of the shocks experienced over the past year.\nWith the federal funds rate approaching the zero bound, the Federal Reserve has turned to some alternative approaches to monetary policy, which have rapidly increased the Fed's balance sheet. Many of the new programs are intended to improve the availability of credit in the marketplace and reduce the cost, which had not fallen commensurate with the decline in the federal funds rate. I would like to briefly discuss these Federal Reserve programs.\nFigure 2 shows the composition of the Fed's balance sheet. The largest expansion of the balance sheet occurred in the fall, as a series of actions were taken in response to the increasingly fragile state of financial markets. Our actions were designed to improve the functioning of interbank lending. Borrowers and businesses whose rates are tied to interbank rates like Libor benefit as interbank lending markets see more normal spreads and declining rates.\nAllow me to mention two programs that have been critical to the improvements in interbank lending markets and the related reduction in market interest rates - the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility or TAF, and a network of liquidity swap lines we have arranged with other central banks. The TAF is designed to help ensure that banks can obtain the funds they need to provide credit to their customers. It involves an auction-model variant of discount-window lending to financial institutions (backed by collateral subject to significant \"haircuts,\" to mitigate risk to the Federal Reserve). Central bank liquidity swaps are loans made to foreign central banks so that they can provide dollar funding to their banks in much the same manner as our TAF.\nThese two programs were designed to stabilize and improve the functioning of the interbank dollar-lending market - indeed, to ease conditions in global dollar markets that were spilling over into our own funding markets. As shown in Figure 3, the Libor rate is now much more aligned with the federal funds rate. The reduction in the Libor rate helps a variety of borrowers. Most subprime mortgages have reset rates tied to Libor, many credit card rates are tied to Libor, and the rates on many business loans are tied to Libor. The actions we have taken are reducing the cost of financing for borrowers and businesses whose rates are tied to Libor and thus influenced by the functioning of interbank dollar lending markets.\nI would like to mention another area of substantial growth in the Fed's balance sheet - specifically, the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities designed to provide market support and improve conditions in short-term credit markets (see Figure 4). Some, like the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), provide an alternative funding source to the market when interest rate spreads become very elevated.\nIn general, the various programs that have expanded the Federal Reserve's balance sheet should be less attractive to market participants as financial conditions improve. Figure 5 shows that of late, the rate on asset-backed commercial paper has fallen dramatically, and many issuers can receive better terms by issuing commercial paper directly to the market.\nFigure 6 shows that the prime money market funds have tended of late to have a net inflow of funds, which has helped stabilize short-term credit markets because money market funds are a key investor in these markets. Correspondingly, money market funds have reduced their reliance on the Fed liquidity facility that was designed to help them - the asset-backed commercial paper money-market mutual fund liquidity facility, or AMLF. This experience provides a clear example of how improved market conditions provide incentives for financial firms to reduce reliance on our facilities. We expect this to be the case for many of our facilities as the economy and financial markets gradually improve. Stabilized short-term credit markets mean that businesses that borrow with commercial paper are able to obtain less costly, more dependable sources of financing. In addition, many issuers of commercial paper used the funding to provide loans to businesses to finance receivables, to provide floor plan financing, and to provide other types of essential short-term credit.\nTwo new programs should provide additional help to markets. First, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is designed to facilitate the renewed issuance of consumer and small business asset-backed securities - essentially providing a financing vehicle for credit instruments that have been disrupted by poor functioning in securitization markets. This facility, which is just starting up, should help make credit more available for student loans, consumer credit, commercial real estate, and small business loans; leading to lower borrowing rates and improved access in the market for consumer and small business credit. The facility will do this by lending against triple-A rated asset-backed securities collateralized by recently originated student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, mortgage servicing advances, loans or leases relating to business equipment, leases of vehicle fleets, or floorplan loans. A second program involves the large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed and agency securities. As shown in Figure 7, conventional mortgage rates that had been around 6 percent have declined since the announcement of this program.\nLast Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee announced that to provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Federal Reserve would further increase its balance sheet by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (bringing its total purchases of these securities up to $1.25 trillion this year), and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion (to a total of up to $200 billion). An important effect of this program is that it provides lower cost loans to homeowners, but it should be recognized that the program also bears significant benefits for many small businesses, which often rely on home equity loans as a critical source of initial financing. I should also mention that in order to improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee on Wednesday decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. This action is expected to ease credit conditions in a wide variety of markets that tie their cost of finance to Treasury yields.\nThe Situation in Massachusetts\nWhile my goal today has been to provide some national context and perspective, I would like to add a few comments about the situation in Massachusetts and New England. Figure 8 shows that lending patterns in the United States differ depending on the financial condition of the banks. Banks with the lowest supervisory ratings have reduced their lending while banks in better health show positive asset-growth percentages. Empirical research suggests that during previous banking crises this behavior was, to an important degree, explained by differences in the ability to supply credit, not just differences in the demand for credit. As you know, extending credit means expanding the asset side of the balance sheet for a bank, and banks must maintain a reasonable capital-to-assets ratio. This underlines the importance of steps to bolster or resolve poorly capitalized banks, in order to address broader problems of credit availability.\nFigure 9 shows that the share of commercial and savings banks with the lowest supervisory ratings is quite a bit smaller in New England than it is nationally - and furthermore, that share has remained constant in New England while doubling for the nation overall in a year's time. Considering the aforementioned dynamic, the good news locally is that a greater share of New England banks are in good health and thus more able to supply credit to businesses. Of course, most anecdotal indications are that even among healthy banks willing to lend to creditworthy borrowers, standards have probably tightened in response to the riskier environment (that is, over concern related to the impact of the slowing economy on even creditworthy borrowers).\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would offer just a few summary thoughts. Over the last year and a half or so, the Federal Reserve has been proactive and innovative in trying to address problems in financial markets and the broader economy. While traditional monetary policy had focused on lowering the federal funds rate to spur interest-sensitive economic activity, now that this rate has approached the zero-bound floor, the Federal Reserve has focused on more direct means of lowering the cost of credit in the marketplace, which had not fallen commensurate with the decline in the federal funds rate. Federal Reserve programs have intended to offset disruptions to interbank lending, short-term credit financing, the ability of money market mutual funds to meet investor redemption requests, and housing finance - and these program should have beneficial effects on the cost and availability of credit for businesses.\nThank you for inviting me to testify today.

            "content": "Institute of International Bankers Annual Washington Conference, Washington, DC\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you today. Allow me to begin with an observation: It is rarely good when bankers, and central bankers, are considered especially \"newsworthy.\" But the financial and economic turmoil of the past year and a half has banking and financial markets at the epicenter of current problems, and very much in the spotlight.\nTwo years ago, few saw the extent of the problems to come. Bank stock prices were at record highs, earnings forecasts were rosy, and bank capital seemed sufficient. Indeed, a striking aspect of this episode is the fact that many banks went into the current banking problems with unusually high capital ratios. As Figure 1 shows, aggregate U.S. bank capital had grown significantly over the past two decades, as preparations for the Basel II Capital Accord and advances in banks' own internal modeling led banks, generally speaking, to become better capitalized.\nHowever, in less than two years the banking environment has changed dramatically. Losses have mounted and a number of small and large banks here and abroad have required extensive government support, or were forced to close. Furthermore, banking problems are having macroeconomic consequences, as obtaining financing from banks and securities markets has become a more uncertain proposition for companies and individuals.\nToday I want to discuss some lessons I have drawn from the Japanese experience in the 1990s, a topic I explored in depth with fellow researchers. Allow me to share at the outset two overarching questions that I think we must keep in mind. First, how can we reduce the macroeconomic consequences of procyclical regulatory and accounting policies? (By \"procyclical\" policies I mean those that magnify economic fluctuations). And second, how can we more quickly remove problem assets to get banks and financial markets focused on future possibilities, rather than past problems? Certainly my remarks today will not resolve these important questions, but they must remain in our sights.\nLessons from Japan's Experience\nIn the early 1990s, the prices of Japanese real estate and stocks experienced sharp declines. As is usually the case, losses in collateral values had a disproportionate impact on banks. But unlike their counterparts in the United States, many Japanese banks had extensive stock holdings, which compounded their problems as falling share prices coincided with loan losses and resulted in a significant shortage of bank capital.\nBut as bad as the initial problems were, the failure to quickly restore banks' financial health had serious consequences for the Japanese economy, which as you know experienced growth below potential for over a decade. There are several lessons - admittedly intertwined - that I take from my studies of this experience:\nFirst, undercapitalized banks behave differently than well-capitalized banks.\nSecond, certain bank-regulatory and accounting policies may amplify the business cycle.\nThird, troubled assets need to be moved off bank balance sheets as quickly as possible.\nAllow me to discuss each of these lessons in just a bit of detail.\nFirst, empirical research suggests that undercapitalized banks behave differently than well-capitalized banks. Undercapitalized banks shift their attention to short-run capital preservation rather than long-run profit maximization, and this change in goals has several undesirable effects. Perhaps the most undesirable is that undercapitalized banks, finding it difficult to raise additional capital, are forced to improve their capital ratios by shrinking assets.[Footnote 1]\nBanks hold capital in part to absorb loan losses that are in excess of loan-loss reserves, and seek to maintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets. A reduction in the value of capital leads a bank to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet, to maintain the desired capital-to-assets ratio. Thus, since loans are usually the bank's most significant asset, lending becomes more restrictive.\nReturning to the case of Japanese banks in the 1990s, they tended to shrink their assets abroad, in some cases pulling out of markets where their prospects were arguably better than their prospects from additional domestic loans.[Footnote 2] And, because undercapitalized banks seek to shrink without incurring additional losses, the specific form the asset shrinkage took could be perverse. For instance, some banks would support troubled borrowers in an effort to avoid loss recognition, while reducing credit to more creditworthy borrowers with whom the bank could curtail credit without incurring a loss. [Footnote 3] In short, as the banks sought to preserve or shore up capital-to-assets ratios, they disposed of assets (indeed, the particularly salable ones) or declined to add new ones.\nAdditionally, undercapitalized banks have an incentive to postpone reserving for problem loans, to avoid further depleting capital. This is why loan loss provisioning often rises significantly as a result of an exam of an undercapitalized bank. [Footnote 4]\nFigure 2 shows that lending patterns in the United States differ depending on the financial condition of the banks. Banks with the lowest supervisory ratings have reduced their lending significantly more than have banks in better health. Empirical research suggests that during previous banking crises this behavior was, to an important degree, explained by differences in the ability to supply credit not just differences in the demand for credit. [Footnote 5] Thus the evidence from Japan and previous problems in the U.S. indicates that allowing poorly capitalized banks to continue operations with insufficient capital is likely to exacerbate problems with credit availability.\nMy second observation from Japan's experience, and the current banking problems in the U.S., is that certain bank-regulatory and accounting policies may amplify the business cycle - in other words, they are procyclical. During a downturn, assets that are pledged as collateral against bank loans decline in value. Of course, collateral value is only one procyclical driver. [Footnote 6] Nonetheless, declining collateral values generally result in higher loss rates on non-performing loans. In terms of accounting, higher loss rates result in larger loan charge-offs and increases in loan loss reserves - which depletes capital and leads banks to reduce lending (the asset side of their balance sheet) in order to maintain capital-to-assets ratios.\nOne step that might make banking problems less procyclical would be to thoughtfully examine, and consider modifying, policies related to loan-loss reserves - specifically, how loan loss reserves are calculated for purposes of determining regulatory capital and for financial statements.\nUnder current policies, regulatory rules essentially follow U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in determining an appropriate loan-loss reserve. U.S. GAAP accounting rules provide that a loan-loss reserve should reflect probable and estimable losses that have already been incurred in the loan portfolio, but have not yet been discovered. This is often referred to as the \"incurred loss\" model. The accounting profession often notes that these accounting rules were written in this way, in part, to inject more transparency into the reserve setting process and to address concerns about financial manipulation.\nA criticism of the accountant's view is that as financial conditions deteriorate, loan loss reserves lag the increases in nonperforming loans and expected losses (see Figure 3). It can be argued that this is true because management failed to adequately assess changes in current loss estimates, or because reserve models are somewhat backward looking. In either case, it has been observed in previous periods of banking problems that loan-loss reserves were low at the beginning of the banking problems, lagged as problems became apparent, and likely to peak at the very time that we could most use bank capital to be at work financing economic recovery. Solutions to this predicament, which I will not expound on or argue for today, would do well to result in earlier loss recognition, more rapidly addressed problems, and indeed a curtailing of high-risk lending earlier in the cycle.\nAgain, my goal today is to point out some lessons we would all do well to consider and apply. Proposals to make reserving less procyclical will no doubt take different forms. To an economist's way of thinking, a reserve should not be limited to a view of a current period or snapshot in time, focusing on losses that are currently in the portfolio based on loans made previously - rather, expected future losses should also be considered. For example, if one anticipates that unemployment rates were to rise rapidly, a statistical calculation of expected losses looking through the cycle may be very different than the losses that are probable and estimable given current economic conditions. [Footnote 7] This more comprehensive view of loan losses could lend itself to addressing some of the perceived shortfalls associated with the current accounting model.\nSome of you, I am sure, are familiar with a variant from Spain which bears study; whereby \"stress\" losses are estimated and loan-loss reserves are built up during good times. The promising aspect is that losses draw down the reserve rather than capital, so capital is much less sensitive to current economic conditions and thus there is less pressure to reduce lending during periods of financial difficulty.\nI think there is a compelling argument for some form of action to address procyclicality through policy change. Whether that policy change should be addressed through accounting or regulatory rules is open to debate. Of course, any changes proposed for accounting rules must take pains to avoid inviting so-called \"earnings management,\" and should respect the needs of investors and other primary users of financial statements. In whatever form policy ultimately takes, both current losses in the portfolio as well as the \"stress\" losses would need to be disclosed, in a transparent and rules-based manner.\nThe third lesson I take from the Japanese experience is that troubled assets should be moved off bank balance sheets as quickly as possible. Banks with troubled assets focus on avoiding further losses and further depleting capital. Troubled banks in Japan were often more supportive of problem borrowers than borrowers who had good prospects going forward. Focusing on future growth requires removing the problem assets.\nFurthermore, governments are not the best managers of bad assets. Removing bad assets and quickly selling to new owners are steps that are likely to get resources allocated to their best economic use. When a bank is closed with FDIC support, this is relatively straightforward. The bad assets are removed from the bank and quickly disposed of by the FDIC, and the good assets are sold to an acquirer. The new acquirer does not spend time focused on the problems of the past, but rather, focuses on maximizing future profitability. This is a reason for moving to resolve, as quickly as possible, banks that are clearly insolvent.\nThe problem becomes more difficult when the bad assets are in troubled, but not insolvent, banks. In this case, bank management becomes focused on the problem assets, and ways to avoid realizing losses that would threaten the solvency of the bank. The problem is particularly complicated during the current period, because of the intertwining of liquidity and credit problems in securities portfolios.\nA good example of the potential liquidity problems is provided by securities backed by student loans that are 97 percent guaranteed by the government (see Figure 4). Currently there exist about $250 billion in these securities, many of which are held by banks or bank-affiliated conduits. Despite the 97 percent guarantee, pricing services suggest prices below, and in some cases significantly below, 97 percent of face value. This discount suggests that sales of such assets are taking place by sellers who have no option but to sell - and suggests that given the financing and balance sheet constraints of most buyers, they will only purchase the asset for a price well below the level one would expect considering the government guarantee. Given the government guarantee, most of the discount in these securities seems to be the result of liquidity concerns.\nFor securities where the problem appears to be liquidity rather than credit concerns, there should be a role for purchasing these assets and reducing the liquidity premium. Consider the aforementioned securities backed by student loans, where liquidity concerns seem to be driving the steep discounts. If the securities were purchased at a more modest haircut relative to the government guarantee - say for 94 percent of face value - it would serve to significantly reduce the liquidity premium, allowing banks to use much higher marks in their investment portfolios, and thus improve their capital position while still purchasing the assets at a price below the government guarantee. These, of course, are benefits they would realize if they could hold the security to maturity. With their capital position enhanced, the banks could do more to restore credit flows.\nA more difficult issue relates to loans and securities that would be deeply discounted primarily because of credit concerns. For banks, selling such assets below their net recorded value, thus recognizing a loss, involves further depletion of capital. Incenting banks to remove these problem assets is likely to require more supervisory pressure to appropriately reserve against or write down those assets, and to take actions to quickly dispose of the assets.\nGranted, this is not an unusual role for supervisors - frequently, written agreements and cease-and-desist orders require increasing reserves, improving risk and credit management, and expediting the removal of bad assets. In this case, moving more quickly to mandate reserving for and disposing of problem assets will speed recovery from current problems.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Japanese experience of the 1990s highlights the fact that forbearance can have significant macroeconomic consequences. Troubled banks are reluctant to expand balance sheets or to address problems with troubled assets. I believe it would be desirable to move quickly to remove problem assets from bank balance sheets, so banks can once again focus on future prospects rather than past mistakes.\nIn the longer run, we need to explore ways to make banking problems less procyclical. Certainly an area worth further careful investigation is whether current loan-loss-reserving policies can be recast to encourage less procyclical behavior.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, it is not a good thing when bankers, and central bankers, are central to the news. However, we should use the attention and urgency of this moment to galvanize the hard thinking and hard work needed to remedy the current crisis, and put in place a framework that will help us avoid future crises, going forward.\nThank you.",

            "content": "U.S. Monetary Policy Forum The University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Brandeis International Business School New York, New York\nMonetary Policy During the Crisis\nExpansion of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet\nConclusion\nI am pleased to participate in this important forum again this year, and welcome the opportunity to discuss monetary policy during the current financial crisis. Thank you for inviting me to be here with all of you and with Charles Plosser and Rick Mishkin.\nAs you know, what began as a problem involving securitized subprime mortgages in the United States has become a problem of global reach and historic proportions. The problem grew in scope and severity as investors became skeptical of financial statements, and as the ability to value and trade a wide variety of financial instruments became severely impaired.\nProblems in financial markets spilled over into the real economy and contributed to deteriorating economic conditions. The U.S. economy lost 1.8 million jobs over the past three months. With the economy likely to shrink significantly in the first half of this year, the unemployment rate rising higher than 8.5 percent is, unfortunately, very likely.[Footnote 1]\nUnlike in some previous periods of financial disruption, this time around most countries are well aware of the precarious financial circumstances and have taken action to mitigate the problems. While the responses have varied, in most countries the monetary authorities have eased interest rates, the regulatory authorities have taken actions to shore up financial intermediaries, and the fiscal authorities have adopted more expansionary or \"stimulative\" policies than previously were planned.\nIn combination, these actions - along with lower energy prices - will, I hope, provide a foundation for positive economic growth in many countries in the latter half of this year. However, I believe that below-potential growth is likely to persist until financial markets and financial institutions can resume more normal functioning. So in addition to the other steps being taken to stimulate the economy, we need to be sure that actions to support the stability of the financial system are taken without delay - and, in the slightly longer term, that regulatory frameworks are thoughtfully reformed.\nMonetary Policy During the Crisis\nFigure 1 highlights a striking feature of this financial crisis - the rather rapid movement, at least by central banking standards, to a federal funds rate only a little above zero. The Federal Reserve has moved with commendable speed in lowering the interest rate target to address problems in financial markets and the real economy.\nOf course, one year ago many observers were critical of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate cuts. Total inflation was above the \"comfort zone\" of many, as rapid increases in oil and commodity prices were occurring despite unsettled financial markets. In retrospect, it is fortunate that the Federal Reserve moved as quickly as it did. While the rapid reduction in interest rates did not prevent a recession, it has mitigated the depth of the downturn and cushioned the economy against some of the shocks experienced over the past year.\nHowever - with the federal funds rate bounded by zero, the forecast one of continued weakness, and challenges in the transmission of funds-rate changes into borrowing rates in the marketplace - the Federal Reserve has turned to some alternative approaches to monetary policy. I would like to take a moment to highlight some key steps we have taken in this regard, and some of their implications.\nFirst, the Federal Reserve has taken pains to make clear in communications that it will take all necessary actions to stabilize the economy. At the same time the FOMC has increased transparency by providing longer-range forecasts of growth, inflation, and unemployment - given the current structure of the economy, the presence of appropriate monetary policy, and an absence of unexpected shocks.[Footnote 2] Chairman Bernanke addressed this topic in his speech at the National Press Club last week.[Footnote 3]\nThe added transparency should help the Fed attain its goals of full employment and price stability. Currently, significant excess capacity in the economy risks lowering inflation and inflation expectations. Since short-term interest rates are effectively zero, reductions in inflation expectations imply a higher real interest rate - and, effectively, tighter monetary policy. So the additional clarity on the long-run intentions of monetary policy (as reflected in the longer-range forecasts) might keep inflation expectations well anchored[Footnote 4] and real interest rates low enough to help get the economy moving again.\nAn important consideration involves what the long-run goal for inflation should be, given recent experience. Twice this decade, short-term interest rates have approached zero, and the probability of possible deflation has risen significantly. In light of this experience, some might conclude that the implicit inflation target has been too low. A fruitful area for future research would be to re-consider the likelihood and the cost of hitting the zero lower bound, and what that cost implies for setting inflation targets.[Footnote 5]\nBut now I would like to spend a bit of time discussing a second, alternative approach to monetary policy that the Fed has been pursuing. Since the fall of last year the Federal Reserve has rapidly increased its balance sheet, from $880 billion in July 2007 to $1.9 trillion as of last Wednesday, February 18. While this expansion of the balance sheet is unprecedented, and gives some observers pause, it is worth taking the time to understand the sources of that growth, the goals behind that growth, and how the Federal Reserve balance sheet can be expected to eventually return to a more normal size, due to market developments and Federal Reserve actions.\nExpansion of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet\nFigure 2 shows the composition of the Fed's balance sheet. While this period of financial turmoil began in August 2007, much of the initial activity by the Federal Reserve involved traditional monetary policy - reducing the federal funds rate. Then in 2008, the Federal Reserve began what became a series of actions that expanded our usual \"discount window\" function. While the discount window had traditionally been available to depository institutions, in the spring of 2008 investment banks gained access to the discount window through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF).\nThe largest expansion of the balance sheet occurred in the wake of the Lehman Brothers failure, as a series of actions were taken in response to the increasingly fragile state of financial markets. The three most significant areas of growth were discount window lending, foreign swap lines, and actions taken to stabilize financial markets.\nThe discount window lending I am referring to includes traditional discount window loans, primary dealer discount window loans, and lending in the Term Auction Facility (TAF). The largest category of lending in this group is the TAF, which as of February 18 had $448 billion in loans outstanding. This Fed lending has been critical to the reduction in market interest rates that are charged in the interbank lending market.\nThese TAF loans are arranged through an auction process, and like regular discount window lending, are loans to banks that are in satisfactory condition and are also backed by collateral subject to significant \"haircuts,\" to mitigate risk to the Federal Reserve. In considering how we get to a more normal-sized balance sheet, it is important to note that TAF lending is likely to fall once financial conditions become more normalized, although the Fed could also hasten the reduction by holding smaller auctions or charging a higher minimum stop-out rate.\nThe second area of substantial balance sheet growth involves central bank liquidity swaps. These are loans made to foreign central banks so they can provide dollar funding to their banks in much the same manner as the U.S. Federal Reserve's TAF. Why we are doing this? Because global dollar markets are interlinked, and dollar markets overseas affect our own domestic financial conditions. Our counterparties are the other central banks, not individual financial institutions, and the swaps are essentially loans.\nAs the interbank dollar-lending market has stabilized - and given that the rates on the loans by foreign central banks are often set to make them less attractive as markets stabilize - this lending has fallen from a peak of $583 billion on December 17 to $375 billion on February 18. This second area of balance sheet growth also is likely to decline naturally as more normal market functioning resumes.\nThe third area of substantial balance-sheet growth involves the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities designed to provide market support (see Figure 3). These facilities are designed to improve conditions in short-term credit markets. Some, like the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), provide an alternative funding source to the market when interest rate spreads become very elevated. With this facility in place, when interest spreads are high firms have an incentive to issue commercial paper directly to the Federal Reserve. When interest spreads are low, issuers will get a better rate by going to the market, thus unwinding the facility and shrinking the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\nOther facilities like the Asset-backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) serve as a back-up for holders of existing short-term credit instruments. Both the CPFF and AMLF experienced substantial lending when the programs were first made available, but loan activity has declined as market conditions have improved.\nIn general, the various programs that have expanded the Federal Reserve's balance sheet should be less attractive to market participants as financial conditions improve. Figure 4 shows that of late, the rate on asset-backed commercial paper has fallen dramatically, and many issuers can receive better terms by issuing commercial paper directly to the market. Figure 5 shows that the prime money market funds have tended of late to have a net inflow of funds, which has helped stabilize short-term credit markets because money market funds are a key investor in these markets.\nTwo new programs should provide additional help to markets. First, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is designed to provide a financing vehicle for credit instruments that have been disrupted by poor functioning in securitization markets. This facility, which will commence operations soon, should make credit more available for student loans, consumer credit, commercial real estate, and small business loans.\nA second program involves the large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed and agency securities. For a variety of reasons, mortgage rates had not fallen in response to the decline in the federal funds rate, as is usually the case. As shown in Figure 6, conventional mortgage rates that had been around 6 percent have declined since the announcement of the program. Mortgage rates have been between 5 and 5.25 percent recently. Of course, an additional policy action that could potentially be undertaken by the Federal Reserve would be to expand this program, to help further lower the market rates on home financing.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I offer just a few summary thoughts. Over the last year and a half or so, the Federal Reserve has been proactive and innovative in trying to address problems in financial markets and the broader economy. While traditional monetary policy had focused on targeting the federal funds rate, now that this rate has approached the zero-bound the Federal Reserve has focused on other ways to lower the cost of credit in the marketplace, which had not fallen commensurate with the decline in the federal funds rate. Federal Reserve programs have intended to offset disruptions to interbank lending, short-term credit financing, the ability of money market mutual funds to meet investor redemption requests, and housing finance - to benefit all participants in the economy.\nIt is very important to note that the largest components of the expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet are likely to become unappealing to market participants as financial conditions improve and interest rate spreads decline. Thus, much of the Fed's balance-sheet expansion should be reversed as we see the return of more normal trading.\nAs a student of the Japanese financial crisis, allow me to make one final point. The so-called \"quantitative easing\" that focused on increasing reserves in Japan during the 1990s, while well-intentioned, in hindsight suggests that merely increasing reserves when financial intermediaries are capital-constrained is unlikely to have much impact.[Footnote 6]\nIn contrast, the Federal Reserve programs I have described today are intended to reduce the unusually large spreads created by financial disruptions, so that the cost of credit for a variety of borrowers returns to the level we would expect with more normalized functioning of credit markets. The Federal Reserve's recent monetary policy actions, combined with the fiscal stimulus package that the government recently enacted, should in my view help pull the economy out of the severe recession we have been experiencing.\nThank you.",

Policies that Influence the Cost of Financing for Housing\nIII. Troubled Homebuyers and the Availability of Financing for Housing\nConclusion\nIt is a pleasure to be with you this evening. We all know that housing and mortgage lending have played central roles in the dramatic economic and financial developments of the last year and a half. As a central banker, I welcome opportunities to meet with and hear from you in the industry, and to share my views on housing markets, the economy, and policy options with you.[Footnote 1] So I thank you for inviting me to join you this evening.\nThe Economic Outlook\nBy way of introduction, I would like to make a few observations on the economic situation. With the holidays concluded, it is clear that sales fell short of expectations for many retailers. Despite significant discounting it seems that consumers, worried about the economy and their own economic situation, curtailed their spending. Indeed, it appears that the economy contracted quite significantly in the final quarter of 2008, and may continue contracting over the first half of 2009. We are seeing businesses retrenching and unemployment rising, and many of our international trading partners expect equally grim results.\nAs a result, this recession looks to be longer and more severe than was originally forecast. Still, there are indications that the second half of the year will show improvement.\nConsider several developments. Energy prices have fallen dramatically, making it much less expensive to drive cars or heat homes, freeing up much-needed cash flow for many consumers. Fiscal-stimulus packages being discussed in Washington could provide an economic boost. And monetary policy is also contributing. With the federal funds rate at historic lows, in a range only slightly above zero, and various lending facilities helping to lower the elevated spreads on many interest rates, the result is that many short-term interest rates are now significantly below the levels seen at the end of the third quarter. Also, recent actions by the Federal Reserve to reduce mortgage rates are having an impact, with mortgage rates already falling about 100 basis points from the end of the third quarter. While all of these developments will take a little time to fully impact the economy, they should be sowing the seeds for a recovery later in 2009.\nObservations on the Housing Market\nNow I would like to turn to the focus of my remarks, the housing market. By way of context, residential investment[Footnote 2] has been declining since the first quarter of 2006 (see Figure 1, which plots the quarterly percent change), and this decline in residential investment is already of notable length and depth relative to previous housing downturns.[Footnote 3]\nIt goes without saying that it is important to the broader economy that the housing market stabilizes. Normally, housing markets decline because mortgage interest rates have risen and the higher cost of obtaining a mortgage weighs down residential investment. During more normal times, the Federal Reserve can address this by reducing the federal funds rate, a step that usually helps to lower mortgage rates - and the housing market improves.\nBut this housing downturn is different. Increasingly, the housing market is impacted more by the availability of credit than the cost of credit.\nBorrowers who have poor credit histories or little equity in their homes are having difficulty finding mortgages - even higher-rate mortgages. Borrowers looking for home equity loans or seeking to refinance are finding that falling housing prices have reduced their ability to borrow against the value of their home. Borrowers that stretched to purchase or refinance their home are finding it difficult to stay current on mortgage payments if a family member is laid off or assigned reduced hours, or if other problems strike the household.\nGiven all these factors, it is important to recognize that no one solution is likely to fix our housing market challenges. And let me be clear, I am not for a moment suggesting the return of lax underwriting standards. Rather, I am suggesting that with a variety of well-designed approaches, tailored to current problems, the housing market can and should stabilize - by which I mean easing the difficulties with the cost and availability of mortgage credit that we are seeing, which in turn would support housing markets more generally.\nI plan tonight to first discuss some recent trends in the housing market. I will then touch on actions that could influence the cost of financing for housing. I will then discuss some actions that could influence the availability of financing for housing - especially for troubled borrowers - before offering a few concluding remarks.\nI. Recent Trends in Housing\nAs Figure 2 illustrates, single-family housing starts have declined precipitously from their peak in January 2006. The extent of the decline is so striking, in part, because of the large increases in housing starts that occurred over this decade. But housing starts are at their lowest level in the past 50 years - and many private forecasters suggest they have not yet bottomed out.\nOf course, the decline in housing starts is playing a necessary role in reducing the excess inventory of new homes for sale. As shown in Figure 3, there has been a substantial decline in that inventory - although at 374,000 units for sale as of November, new homes for sale still remain above the historical average.\nSales have declined for new homes of all price ranges. For the most expensive homes, \"jumbo\" mortgage rates remain very elevated relative to conventional mortgages. At the other end of the spectrum, purchasers of the least expensive homes are having great difficulty securing financing if they have little down payment equity, or low credit scores.\nA critical aspect of the current situation has been the disruption of the securitization[Footnote 4] process, where mortgages are sold to be part of a security backed by many (pooled) mortgages, and re-sold onto the secondary market to investors. For expensive homes that are financed with jumbo mortgages, the disruptions in securitization have caused rates on jumbo mortgages to rise even while the federal funds rate has dropped sharply. Prior to the financial-market disruptions that began in August 2007, jumbo mortgage rates had moved closely with conventional mortgage rates, with an approximately 25 basis-point premium over conventional mortgages (see Figure 4). However, the spread became quite large as securitizing jumbo mortgages became increasingly difficult. Many jumbo mortgages were provided by portfolio lenders who began to demand a premium over what they had required when the loans could be more easily securitized.\nThe current government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) cut-off for jumbo mortgages is $417,000 nationally, although the limit is $625,500 in some areas with particularly high costs of housing[Footnote 5] and is somewhere between $417,000 and $625,000 in certain cities and counties. In places with a relatively high cost of housing, the large premium for jumbo mortgages is a deterrent to home purchases. Raising the maximum amount on conforming mortgages would likely go some way towards reducing this spread, by making it easier for the industry to securitize home loans and thus for borrowers to purchase homes in regions where housing costs are high.\nOf course, securitization is also disrupted for subprime[Footnote 6] and Alt-A loans. The result has been that borrowers with limited down-payments, low credit scores, or other issues are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain mortgage financing - even at rates well above conventional prime mortgages.\nWith the securitization market not seeming ready to recover in the near term, one thinks of the traditional way that low- and moderate-income borrowers qualified for mortgages prior to the expansion of the subprime market - through Federal Housing Administration (FHA) lending programs. They alleviate some of the risk of lending to borrowers who can only afford a small down payment and therefore might have difficulty obtaining a conventional mortgage product.\nHowever, many would say that FHA lending has a reputation for bureaucracy and unwieldiness. By many accounts, FHA has been working to address this, and there have been significant modifications made to traditional FHA lending programs. At the Boston Fed we have developed a brief guide with questions and answers that may be helpful to institutions considering becoming an FHA lender - either a correspondent or a full mortgagee.[Footnote 7] The resource is available on our website.[Footnote 8]\nFHA mortgage lending expanded quite significantly in the latter half of 2008. Still, many banks remain unwilling to participate. Making these programs more accessible to borrowers and banks would help ensure that low- and moderate-income borrowers can obtain financing, which should help stabilize the market for lower-priced homes.\nII. Policies that Influence the Cost of Financing for Housing\nAs we consider steps that could assist the recovery of housing markets, I would now like to share some perspectives on the potential for policies to influence the cost of financing for housing. Over the past 18 months, the Federal Reserve aggressively lowered the federal funds rate, as financial problems worsened and the economic outlook deteriorated. But despite aggressive easing, many interest rates in the marketplace remained high, or rose - thus, the \"spreads\" between overnight fed funds and many rates in the marketplace widened considerably.\nThese elevated spreads reflected investors' pessimism about the economic outlook and lack of liquidity in many financial markets. The lack of liquidity raised investors' concerns about their ability to resell financial assets other than Treasury securities without very steep discounts. This has been particularly evident for assets with longer maturities, lower credit quality, or structured financing. The sharply discounted sale prices on some mortgage-backed securities implied a very bleak outlook for default experience.\nWhile the federal funds rate declined substantially over the past 18 months, the rates that many borrowers paid to finance assets rose, or declined by much less than would have been expected given the decline in the federal funds rate. This unusually large widening of interest-rate spreads implies that the transmission mechanism for monetary policy has been impacted. If the goal of monetary policy is to avoid severe economic problems and maintain liquid markets, the evident disruption to the transmission mechanism implies that more than just a lower base rate is needed.\nSo, over the past year the Federal Reserve System designed a variety of liquidity facilities, aimed in large part at reducing the interest rate spreads on short-term, high-quality assets. In particular, the interbank loan market (as reflected in the London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR) and the market for short-term commercial paper saw extremely high spreads, as Figure 5 and Figure 6 show. Because the central bank established a variety of liquidity facilities designed to address these markets, the spreads have declined substantially. Further evidence of reduced stress in short-term markets comes from the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility (TAF), where the auctions have recently been under-subscribed and stop-out rates have been equal to the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate.\nAs investors become more confident that they can sell assets if needed, the premium on liquidity falls, and interest spreads decline. By supporting short-term credit markets, the Federal Reserve is signaling its determination to take appropriate actions to prevent \"seize-ups\" in financial markets, reducing the risk premium. In short, we have seen improvements of late in the functioning of many short-term credit markets, and I expect this improvement will continue.\nImprovements in short-term credit markets do have indirect effects on the housing market. Some mortgages, particularly sub-prime loans, were tied to the six-month LIBOR rate. As short-term rates have fallen, those who either refinance or whose adjustable rate mortgages adjust are suffering smaller payment shocks.\nHowever, many interest rates remained relatively unresponsive to the decline in the federal funds rate. Figure 7 shows that during 2007 and the first half of 2008, mortgage rates remained around 6 percent and the rates on \"Baa\" rated corporate bonds actually rose. As conditions in the short-term credit markets have started to improve, and as the base federal funds rate is trading between 0 and 25 basis points, it seems that improving housing finance is likely to take concerted fiscal and monetary policy actions.\nOn the fiscal side, it is possible that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could play a more significant role in restoring liquidity and providing a secondary market for mortgages that reflect the lower cost of funds in many credit markets. Further exploration of the GSEs' options for pricing and programs may result in additional support to the mortgage market.\nOn the monetary policy side, the Federal Reserve announced on November 25 that it would be buying up to $100 billion in GSE direct obligations, and up to $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities.[Footnote 9] A subsequent announcement on December 30 provided more details.[Footnote 10] Since the announcement of the program, designed to reduce the recently widening rate spreads on GSE debt and on GSE-guaranteed mortgages, mortgage rates have declined (see Figure 8). Some mortgages in Boston are now available for under 5 percent.\nLower mortgage rates help alleviate the current problems in several ways. First, potential home buyers have the possibility of buying their homes with the lowest rates in the past 30 years. Because interest rates may only be lower temporarily, they provide an incentive for buyers to purchase now rather than wait in the hope that home prices fall more. In terms of cash flow, locking in a lower rate now may be more important than potentially buying the home at a somewhat lower price, later. Obviously, getting buyers \"off the sidelines\" and back into the market is critical for a housing market recovery. Second, the lower rates provide the opportunity to refinance. This can improve cash flow, freeing up household resources to fix up the home or consume other items. Third, lower rates have the advantage of benefiting credit-worthy borrowers as well as more troubled homebuyers.\nLow mortgage rates primarily benefit home buyers with significant equity for a down payment and good credit scores, and borrowers that seek to refinance and still have significant equity in their house as well as good credit scores. However, if prices stabilize, home owners and holders of mortgage instruments will benefit. Since stabilizing the housing market is critical, expanded use of policies that address the cost of housing finance may give further impetus for new home buyers and existing mortgage holders to take advantage of what are very low rates by historical standards.\nIII. Troubled Homebuyers and the Availability of Financing for Housing\nNow a few comments on the availability of home finance. Clearly, there are many borrowers that are unlikely to fully benefit from the aforementioned lower mortgage rates, because they have negative home equity or poor credit scores. It can be helpful to think of these troubled borrowers in segments. There are those who are stressed but still making their payments, despite impaired credit scores or home equity; those who are temporarily unable to make payments (for example because of reduced hours, a spell of unemployment, or health issues); and those whose inability to make the payments is not temporary, but permanent. Different approaches are probably necessary for borrowers in these different circumstances.\nFor borrowers who continue to make payments but are under stress and unable to ease their payment burden through refinance (perhaps because they cannot provide a significant down payment), one possibility is to improve access to FHA loans. During the subprime boom, many lenders stopped providing FHA loans.[Footnote 11] Improving access to FHA programs, and providing greater incentive for bankers to provide FHA loans, could help many borrowers gain access to the market at relatively favorable rates. Since many banks have been raising their minimum credit score to qualify for mortgages, the FHA may be able to provide loans for borrowers whose credit history is not up to current thresholds, yet have the capacity to make payments.\nDuring a recession like the current one it becomes increasingly common for borrowers to experience temporary setbacks. A family member might lose a job, have hours reduced, or no longer get overtime. These can all present significant difficulties, and these problems can be compounded if a family member encounters significant health issues. For such individuals, steps such as deferring payments or reducing interest rates can prevent foreclosure. By providing a temporary or permanent reduction in payments, the lender can avoid foreclosure and bridge the borrower through a difficult period. Of course, with a job loss and loss of income the required payment reduction, while temporary, can be quite significant, on the order of 50 percent. For this type of borrower, small modifications are unlikely to prevent foreclosures.\nThe United Kingdom has announced a program that focuses on borrowers facing temporary challenges - allowing lenders to reduce interest payments, with the deferred payments added to the principal and paid when the borrower's circumstances improve.[Footnote 12] The British government guarantees the lender against a percentage of the deferred interest payments. In a similar vein, a proposal developed by several Federal Reserve economists, and available on our website,[Footnote 13] suggests that the U.S. government could pay a significant portion of monthly payments for borrowers who are facing severe but temporary financial setbacks. There are two variants to the proposal. One way in which such a plan might work is for the government to offer these borrowers temporary loans that must be paid back once the borrower returns to financial health. Another version of this plan calls for the government to offer grants, not loans, to borrowers who have adverse life events, such as job loss.\nImportantly, both versions include aspects that will minimize the number of people who would sign up for government help when they do not really need it.[Footnote 14] While any extension of direct government assistance to borrowers has potential \"moral hazard\" problems, the mere potential for such problems should not automatically derail proposals that are likely to keep temporarily troubled borrowers in their homes.\nOf course, variants of these proposals are currently being used by mortgage servicers. At an event at Gillette Stadium last August, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in conjunction with the Kraft family, the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation, the HOPE NOW Alliance, and NeighborWorks America brought troubled borrowers together with mortgage servicers to help address preventable foreclosures. The results, based on follow-up contacts with a subset of the 2,200-plus borrowers that attended the event, are shown in Figure 9. A little more than one-third of borrowers, about 35 percent, received some type of modification or workout offer from servicers. The most prevalent type was a loan modification that reduced monthly payments, which was received by 27 percent of borrowers. These were achieved by reductions in interest rates or by plans that lowered payments on a temporary basis. Only in very rare cases was the outstanding balance of the mortgage reduced.\nAllow me to make an important parenthetical note. As mortgage rates decline, the ability of servicers to provide these interest rate concessions to borrowers should increase.\nLarge foreclosure-prevention events like this are one way to bring troubled borrowers together with servicers, since borrowers often complain they have difficulty reaching servicers and servicers complain that many borrowers do not open mail or return calls. Indeed, we at the Boston Fed will soon be announcing another such foreclosure-prevention workshop, to be held in Connecticut. While such events can play an important role, I think we would all agree that more systematic approaches or programs are desirable to reach a larger number of troubled borrowers.\nThe third pool of troubled borrowers involves those that realistically are not going to be able to make their mortgage payments. In such cases, it may well be impossible for lenders and borrowers to work out a plan. But that does not mean that nothing can be done to make the best of a difficult situation, for the borrower as well as their neighbors and the housing market in their area. One possibility is to provide borrowers who have little or no housing equity and are unable to make mortgage payments with assistance to move to a rental property. Some may eventually have the capacity to purchase a home that is affordable to them, while for others, renting may be the appropriate long-term solution. But there is an important role for stabilization in high-foreclosure communities and a need to put foreclosed properties back to productive use, whether for rental or homeownership. An alternative would involve the government making a significant financial commitment that makes the mortgage affordable on terms acceptable to the lender - but the cost of such a program would likely be very high.[Footnote 15]\nConclusion\nThe housing market has played a significant role in current economic problems. But with appropriate steps, the housing market could stabilize this year. The recent reductions in mortgage rates, in part due to monetary policy actions, have enabled more borrowers than would otherwise have done so to purchase or refinance homes. Expansion of this effort, and encouraging greater GSE participation, should encourage borrowers that have equity and reasonable credit scores to purchase or refinance homes.\nFor more troubled borrowers, programs will need to be designed to address the specific nature of their problem. For some borrowers, greater use of FHA programs may be appropriate; while for others, interest rate concessions that are now more affordable for lenders may serve as a bridge for the temporarily impaired.\nLet me conclude by making a point that should not be overlooked. Although it is a discussion for another day, we need to remember that once the market has stabilized, much work needs to be done to structure mortgage securitization in a way that that reduces the likelihood of future episodes of significant upheaval in mortgage finance. And more generally, financial regulatory reform will also be a key policy topic this year.\nThank you and I wish you the very best in the year ahead.",

I am very pleased to be with you today, as it is a particularly appropriate time for all of us to be at a conference focused on risk management and risk modeling for financial institutions.1 As you know, many banks around the world have, of late, found themselves needing equity infusions from governments, or expanded guarantees for their liabilities.\nA widespread need for banks' recapitalization has occurred at least twice in the past century, and in many countries has occurred much more frequently than that. Many banks' risk models were supposed to be calibrated for \"once-in-a-thousand-years\" events; however, these models seriously underestimated risk.\nCertainly there is much still to study and understand about the recent financial turmoil that emerged in the summer of 2007. But it seems abundantly clear, and not all that surprising, that risks calibrated from a few years of data from good times can dramatically under-estimate risk exposure for a particular asset, as well as the high correlation of risks across asset classes during periods of significant stress. Furthermore, while capital models were intended to suggest minimum capital requirements that would keep institutions sound during risky times, the models were frequently used to justify expansion of dividends and stock buybacks, because they suggested that banks were overcapitalized during boom times. So this conference occurs at a good time, as we all try to re-evaluate how best to model and manage risk.\nAnd it is not only our risk models that need to be reevaluated. Our regulatory framework clearly needs to be reconsidered, in light of recent events. Both in the U.S. and globally, we had in place a complex set of regulations and supervisory structures intended, in part, to increase the likelihood that financial intermediaries would remain well capitalized without government assistance. Like the risk models, bank regulators did not foresee the dramatic illiquidity that could emerge during a period of acute financial turmoil - nor the changes in the value of assets on balance sheets, or the degree of correlation of those asset values.\nWhile regulatory reform proposals are already beginning to surface, I see value in first evaluating the principles that should frame the discussion. Before we begin to work on regulatory details we need to evaluate whether the problem was poor execution of a well-considered regulatory framework, or that important principles were absent from the framework. While in my view the recent experience shows elements of both, I want to focus today on regulatory principles rather than their implementation.\nBut before discussing regulatory principles, I would like to briefly discuss our current economic situation, in order to put the recent crises in context.\nRecent Economic Conditions\nMany countries have already experienced two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and the NBER has recently declared that the U.S. entered the recession at the end of last year. In the U.S., GDP in the second quarter was positive, helped in part by a fiscal stimulus package. In the third quarter, GDP declined by 0.5 percent, and it looks like in the fourth quarter it will decline somewhat more significantly - since consumer and investment spending appear to be dropping quite precipitously. This is due, in part, to the interplay of developments in asset markets and the real economy. U.S. consumers - and, increasingly, consumers across Europe - have been buffeted by declining housing prices and falling stock prices. The resulting loss of consumer wealth, coupled with a rapidly rising unemployment rate, suggests the holiday buying season will not be robust as was hoped earlier this year.\nThe likelihood of further weakening of labor markets, and a reluctance of consumers or businesses to increase spending until economic conditions are more certain, together imply a continued difficult environment for banks. There are several conditions necessary for financial markets to resume a more normal state, and I would like to briefly discuss each.\nFirst, we need short-term credit markets to return to normalcy. Conditions in short-term credit markets have improved significantly since the end of September. As shown in Figure 1, rates in the market for high-grade financial commercial paper have resumed a more normal relationship to the Federal Funds rate target, compared to the mid September to mid October timeframe. This improvement in what was a very large spread has been greatly aided by the various short-term credit facilities established by the Federal Reserve to help reduce the stress in short-term credit markets. These facilities have also enhanced the ability of financial firms and issuers of commercial paper to extend the maturities on commercial paper issues (see Figure 2), which at the end of September had become dependent on overnight financing. The facilities have also reduced the risk that financing would not be available over the year end, as many commercial-paper issuers have now financed themselves beyond that point. But despite these improvements, short-term credit markets remain strained. Figure 3 shows that the spread between Libor2 and the Overnight Index Swap rate has fallen from its late-September peak but remains well above the level that prevailed prior to the outbreak of financial turmoil in summer of 2007.\nSecond, we need to see some improvement in the housing market before financial markets will resume a more normal state. In the U.S., residential investment began declining in the first quarter of 2006 and has declined in each quarter since. And as Figure 4 shows, house prices have declined nationally, and in some markets the declines have already exceeded 25 percent. A number of proposals have been floated to help stem foreclosures, but to date there has been relatively modest progress - faced, as we are, by the dual problems of falling housing prices and rising unemployment. Stabilization in house prices and a drop in foreclosures would help the overall economy as well as the banking sector that is exposed to construction loans, residential mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities.\nThird, officials must take into account - and develop policies and actions that reflect - the degree to which monetary policy tools are currently deployed. The stance of U.S. monetary policy reflects our rate reductions, with the Federal Funds rate target currently at 100 basis points. Given that interest rates cannot be negative, further monetary-policy actions are limited by the zero lower bound for interest rates. While other monetary policy tools can be employed, increasingly many observers and commentators are suggesting that fiscal stimulus will be an important element of economic recovery.\nWith actions already taken to stabilize short-term credit conditions, and the widely-reported likelihood of further fiscal measures, I would hope that over the next year there can be a broader discussion of lessons learned from our recent problems, and what measures can be taken to reduce the risk of a recurrence. There can sometimes be a tendency to move to proposals for regulatory design before building a consensus on the underlying principles that should guide the debate. To that end, I would like to use my remaining time to discuss a few key principles that I hope will inform the many proposals that are likely to emerge.\nPrinciple 1:\nFinancial regulation must be more clearly focused on the key goal of macroeconomic stability as well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions.\nI lead with this principle, because I believe it has not necessarily received sufficient attention in our current regulatory structures. There is a clear link between the financial regulation of institutions and the stability of markets and the macroeconomy. Some countries have had frequent and severe banking crises, while other countries have been much more successful at weathering periods of international financial turmoil.\nOn the one hand, too conservative a regime of financial regulation can stymie innovation and creativity, thus preventing borrowers and lenders from interacting in the most efficient ways. On the other hand, inadequate oversight can cause periods of financial turmoil that are quite destructive to the financial infrastructure and the real economy. Future regulatory design must allow for innovation without increasing risks to the financial infrastructure and the real economy.\nPrinciple 2:\nBecause it is a key determinant of macroeconomic stability, systemic financial stability must receive greater focus, with roles and responsibilities during a financial crisis more clearly articulated.\nRegulatory structures should be designed to minimize the probability of systemic disruption or instability. In the future, the definition of a \"systemically important\" firm must be clear in advance, and the regulatory structure should be designed to minimize the chance that such firms will take actions that would put systemic stability at risk. In addition, should a crisis arise despite the best efforts of regulators, the conditions and processes to \"save\" such firms must be well understood in advance.\nImportantly, care must be given to the design of rescue options to minimize the incidence of moral hazard, or additional risk-taking by a party that is insured, \"saved,\" or otherwise insulated from the consequences of its activities. Of course, the best way to avoid moral hazard is to avoid crisis situations in which organizations need \"saving.\" The next best way is to have well-defined processes in place in advance, which minimize the effects of moral hazard.3\nEssential to determining which institutions are systemically important is a comprehensive view of what you might call the \"financial entanglements\" - interdependencies - among financial instruments and institutions.4 In an ideal situation, financial institutions could fail or have their assets transferred to other organizations with little disruption to counterparties or markets. Recent experience indicates that the uncertainty around counterparty risk in non-exchange-traded transactions is significant during periods of market stress. And it is difficult to ascertain the true extent of counterparty risk and whether a failure will result in significant disruptions in markets where the financial institution serves as a key player.\nIn the U.S., the central bank can provide liquidity to the marketplace, but decisions to take on credit risk that pose substantial risks to taxpayers should ideally be in the hands of the Treasury Department, with oversight by Congress. However, during this period of financial turmoil the Treasury Department did not have the pre-existing authority to intervene expeditiously in such a crisis situation. The result was that the central bank became directly involved in urgent, time-sensitive issues that involved significant credit risk.\nTo be better prepared for systemic problems, \"standing\" fiscal and monetary facilities are needed, to provide the ability to react more quickly than was possible of late. Until the passage of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), the U.S. Treasury Department did not have the ability to react to emerging problems as quickly as it would have liked. Similarly, many of the Federal Reserve facilities required significant accounting, legal, and back-office infrastructure that took some time to put in place.\nIn addition, as you all know, liquidity has been provided to institutions and markets where previously the central bank had little direct regulatory involvement. For example, facilities that were needed to provide liquidity to investment banks and money-market funds were established despite the absence of direct regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve at the time the facility was initiated. Also, markets such as those for asset-backed commercial paper and unsecured commercial paper were not markets in which the Federal Reserve was actively engaged prior to the crisis. In the future, it would be ideal to clarify in advance which institutions and markets could require liquidity, and make sure the central bank has sufficient information about these institutions and markets to better serve in its role as lender of last resort.\nPrinciple 3:\nLiquidity risk must receive greater policy focus in determining regulatory structures.\nAt the outset of the recent financial turmoil, many observers assumed that liquidity risk was well contained. In the case of investment banks, many of their assets were financed by repurchase agreements - short-term loans that were fully collateralized. Because the repurchase agreements were collateralized, most parties assumed there was a relatively low risk of a \"run\" because the collateral could always be sold in the event of a default. However, concerns with valuations of assets used for repurchase agreements resulted in many investors refusing to continue to lend even overnight once the counterparty was feared to be at risk of failure.\nIn addition, money market mutual funds were assumed to have relatively little liquidity risk, because they were constrained by regulations that compel them to hold only investment-grade securities of short duration. However, after one well-known money market mutual fund announced that its investors would not be able to redeem their entire principal (\"breaking the buck\" ), many funds faced a wave of redemption requests they had great difficulty meeting - until action was taken to put in place temporary U.S. Treasury insurance as well as a new Federal Reserve liquidity facility.\nThe financial turmoil has highlighted the reality that our regulatory structure had not fully anticipated the types of liquidity shocks that have occurred. Going forward, more attention should be focused on ensuring that the causes of liquidity disruptions are better understood, and that we are better equipped to avoid liquidity problems.5\nAlso, we must be cognizant of an issue that has compounded these liquidity problems - the interaction with accounting rules. Regulatory and accounting frameworks need to consider how best to address periods of sustained illiquidity.\nIn order to prevent bank runs, many countries have not only insured bank deposits but have also guaranteed other liabilities. We need to better understand how best to structure liabilities to avoid the need for such debt guarantees in the future. In the recent turmoil, for many institutions it was the unexpected lack of a stable and fluid market for short-term debt to finance their balance sheets that created liquidity problems.6\nPrinciple 4:\nCareful thought must be given to coordinating the work of the various domestic and international regulators in the design of the regulatory structure.\nIn the United States there exists a patchwork of overlapping regulators. Much of our regulatory design results from reactions to the Great Depression. Given all the changes that have occurred since then, it is probably appropriate to take a fresh look at our regulatory structure - not just the bank-regulatory agencies but also the inter-relationship of their work with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\nIdeally, a new structure would minimize the adverse effects of competing regulatory goals. It will also need to consider how different regulatory bodies can be better coordinated so that information moves more freely between them. Also, international coordination is becoming much more important, as firms have become more global. And as with monetary policy, I believe that to the extent possible, creating independent regulatory agencies with clear mandates is critical to success.\nPrinciple 5:\nResponsibility for strengthening market infrastructure should receive more attention in regulatory design.\nThe current crisis has highlighted the need for better transparency. If every transaction is unique, it becomes difficult to determine valuations during periods of illiquidity. To the extent possible, contracts governing securitization should be standardized, with clearly defined steps to resolve competing interests when the underlying assets lose value.\nSimilarly, contracts between institutions provide less transparency than transactions through exchanges. Exchange-traded assets provide a price that is widely observable - on contracts for assets that are clearly defined. To the extent that more assets move to be exchange-traded, counterparty risk is reduced, and transparency is increased.\nI also believe that payment and settlement activities need greater oversight. The back-office difficulties involved in unwinding complex trades that were not exchange-traded highlight the need for more attention to settlement activities.\nConclusion\nOf course, these five principles are not the only ones of import. Others may stress other very worthy points taken from the lessons of the recent episode. For example that financial regulation must be grounded in an understanding of institutional relationships - \"real world\" details, which clearly do matter. Or, as I mentioned when discussing moral hazard, that financial regulation needs to do a better job of recognizing the role of incentives. For example, compensation structures affect actions - as is evident in situations where short-term risk-taking is rewarded very lucratively and losses are not borne by the originators of the risk.\nThe current crisis provides the opportunity and impetus to reexamine a regulatory framework that originated in the Great Depression. While I believe there is a clear need to redesign the current regulatory structure, it is important that we not lose important features of the current market. It is critical that any regulatory design not stifle the industry's innovation and creativity. However, the regulatory structure needs to be more adaptable to innovations - in order to ensure that new safety and soundness, and systemic, concerns are not ignored. And it needs to be aware of the details of the evolving financial-market structure.\nAdditional regulations do run the risk of moral hazard where the presence of a safety net creates an incentive to take additional risk. While any countercyclical monetary, fiscal, or regulatory policy runs this risk, it should be minimized. Ideally, situations requiring public support should occur only after losses have been borne by equity holders, and existing management and directors have been held responsible for the losses.\nTo the extent a new regulatory structure reduces counterparty risk, or requires offsets in capital for transactions involving significant counterparty risk, the likelihood of spillover effects from one firm's failure should be significantly reduced. Ideally a new structure will reduce the likelihood of future financial turmoil of the length and severity of current financial problems.\nThank you for having me join you today, and thank you for the opportunity to share my views on principles to guide the redesign of U.S. financial regulation.",

Background on Current Housing Problems\nII. Connecting Distressed Borrowers with their Lenders\nIII. Preliminary Results\nConcluding Observations\nI want to thank you for inviting me to join you this evening for the Citizens' Housing and Planning Association's 41st Annual Dinner and Meeting.1 And I want to applaud CHAPA for its longstanding, proactive commitment to affordable housing and community development.\nI especially admire the ways in which you bring together and leverage the interests of all parties with a stake in housing. This approach is no doubt challenging, but in it lie the roots of your success. As recent events in housing and financial markets have shown us, comprehensive solutions that engage many stakeholders can make for long days, tough conversations, and complex negotiations - but can also make for workable solutions that make a difference.\nLately I have had occasion to say that these are the times when you need a central bank. I would add tonight, in all sincerity, that these are times when you also need a CHAPA.\nAs you all know, economic and financial conditions have deteriorated recently, and while the housing and financial markets are most impacted, there is little doubt that the effects are spilling over to the rest of the economy. However, now with appropriate and determined policy actions underway, I believe much of the spillover can be mitigated and the economy can return to growth that is closer to potential next year. To that end, I believe that policymakers should maintain a focus on three key areas, which I'll mention briefly.\nFirst, it is essential that liquidity for companies is maintained, or more accurately, is re-established. It is really in every citizen's interest that firms - particularly our most creditworthy ones - not face uncertainty over whether they will be able to continue to finance themselves with short-term debt. In fact, firms with top credit ratings can be critical stabilizers during difficult times, as they should be in a position to continue to invest and ultimately help the economy maintain employment levels.\nIn this regard I am very pleased to point to recent steps policymakers have taken to restore well- functioning short-term credit markets. Actions taken include the establishment by the Federal Reserve of liquidity facilities for money market funds, primary dealers, and issuers of commercial paper; the U.S. Treasury's recent steps such as providing temporary insurance for money market funds and the plan to invest capital in banks to free up lending; and the FDIC's guarantee on senior debt and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts of banks.2\nIn a speech at the University of Wisconsin last week,3 I spoke in some detail about issues of liquidity and liquidity-risk concerns. But as we gather tonight, I can say that I believe appropriate and powerful actions are now in process, so that while it will take some time for markets to return to normal, problems should moderate going forward.\nMy second observation is that financial firms need to have the financial strength to continue to lend to creditworthy borrowers. Making sure that banks have sufficient capital to continue to lend is vital, because access to credit is critical for households and businesses.\nThe policy actions taken earlier this week, building on those of recent months, should insure that banks have sufficient capital to continue lending, preventing more significant problems. It is very likely that these policy actions will mitigate some of the problems that have been rippling out from capital-constrained banks.\nMy third broad observation for policy focus involves the housing market - it needs to reach bottom and potential homebuyers need to gain the confidence to return to the market. By this I mean that individuals shopping for homes need to be confident that appropriate financing is available for home-ownership. Individuals need to be more confident in housing transactions proceeding normally because institutions and markets with a role in such transactions are functioning well. And individuals need to feel that there is the potential for housing prices to rise.\nIt is this third broad theme, concerning the housing market, which I would like to expand upon this evening. I plan to offer a few thoughts on the background to current housing problems, make some observations on the issue of connecting lenders with borrowers, share some early results from a large foreclosure-prevention event we helped organize at Gillette Stadium, and end with a few concluding remarks.\nI. Background on Current Housing Problems4\nI'm sure most of you at a CHAPA event would agree that the causes of current housing problems are complicated and multifaceted. Yet despite the complexity of the issues, there are some observers who look for easy answers. Some have focused on lenders and lax underwriting standards; others have focused on profligate borrowers.\nHowever, neither of these simple \"black and white\" explanations seems consistent with the facts - including the reality that just over half of all recent (2006-2007) foreclosures in Massachusetts have been suffered by prime, not subprime, borrowers - borrowers that did not need lax underwriting standards to qualify, and who did not have undue leverage since they qualified as prime borrowers.5\nThis is a good example of the complexity and nuance that surrounds the situation. So the explanations that assign blame in only one corner seem to me to fall short. This is an important point, because if we misdiagnose the causes of the crisis, we could misdirect the remedies.\nIn this regard, allow me to make just a brief comment on a matter of some debate in recent news reports and opinion pieces. Some, unfortunately, see the crisis and say that regulators pushed lenders to extend bad loans in previously underserved areas. The Boston Fed's position has long been - despite some determined mischaracterizations - that some flexibility in underwriting criteria may be appropriate if the borrower's willingness and ability to handle the debt can be affirmed, and such flexibility is considered in a consistent and fair manner across applicants.\nWe have not, and do not, advocate for irresponsible or poorly underwritten lending. That perspective, however, is not at odds with advocating that the various participants in housing markets continue to strive for fair access to credit, appropriately extended. Nor is it at odds with our belief that responsibly underwritten loans to borrowers in low- and moderate-income areas - including those whose credit situation is considered \"subprime\" but can document their ability to afford the loan - are welcome and indeed crucial.\nTo return to my discussion of the present situation, I know that most of you here tonight are seeing the toll that foreclosures are taking - particularly in low-and-moderate-income and minority communities and areas like Dorchester, Lawrence, Chelsea, and Worcester. Such communities are bearing the brunt of foreclosures in terms of volumes and rates.\nI would like to make a few observations on foreclosures in general. Foreclosures are cyclical, meaning they are much more likely to occur when the economy is in a downturn and when housing prices are declining. Slide 2 shows the delinquency rates for residential mortgages at New England financial institutions. Not surprisingly, the last time that housing prices were falling and the unemployment rate was rising significantly, we saw a significant number of delinquencies.\nTo expand on this I would add that foreclosures, with their extraordinary toll on individuals, neighborhoods, and the broader housing market and economy6 - not to mention the lender or investor in many cases - usually have two common threads. First, foreclosure is much more likely if house prices are declining, since when prices are rising (especially if rapidly) a homeowner whose situation sours can sell the house rather than see the house foreclosed.7 Second, studies attribute the majority of foreclosures to certain unfavorable \"life events\" such as divorce, a spike in out-of-pocket healthcare costs stemming from an illness or injury in the family, or a loss of a job or income stream. Some such events are more likely during a period of elevated and rising unemployment rates. Unfortunately, in the current environment we have been experiencing both a decline in home prices and rising unemployment rates - conditions where we might expect elevated foreclosures.\nSlide 3 shows that areas with the most significant declines in home prices, such as Florida, Nevada, and California, are also areas that have experienced very significant rates of foreclosure. This is also true for states in the Midwest that have been particularly impacted by the downturn in the auto industry.\nClearly, matters have been aggravated by developments for borrowers and lenders in the marketplace for home loans.8 For borrowers, it became much more common to borrow with little or no money down. Such borrowing is more risky, and would be expected to result in more foreclosures during an economic downturn. In addition, low- or no-documentation loans expanded.\nIt has also become increasingly easy to refinance homes or take out a home equity (\"piggyback\" ) loan9. In fact, many (about 70 percent) of the subprime foreclosures in Massachusetts came on homes that were originally purchased with prime loans - for many of these loans, owners had refinanced into subprime mortgages before defaulting.10 This suggests room for improvement in terms of informing and educating borrowers on the risks of homeownership, borrowing, and various financing arrangements. I would add, somewhat parenthetically, that in some markets many of the homes in foreclosure are investor-owned, or are second homes.11\nSignificant innovations in mortgage lending occurred as the industry evolved - and some of these innovations have exacerbated recent problems. Mortgages that used to be held at local banks are now frequently originated by mortgage companies that reach out to borrowers through brokers, and then sell the mortgage to be part of a security backed by many mortgages.12\nWhile some mortgage companies and brokers clearly acted in good faith, under such \"originate to distribute\" arrangements there was less direct incentive to insure that the mortgage was a sustainable product for the borrower than, for instance, with a loan a bank planned to hold in its portfolio. Certainly concerns about reputation in some cases exerted discipline - especially in situations where brokers depend heavily on word-of-mouth to generate leads - but there were significant countervailing forces at work. Lenders were rewarded for volume, and brokers were frequently rewarded for both volume and higher interest rates. Too often in the unregulated sector, brokers' customers ended up in loans with high fees and unsustainable terms.\nMany mortgage brokers had little or no regulatory oversight. Most of the subprime lenders active in this state were not federally regulated depository institutions, and most have failed.13 In short, there is a role for increasing the incentives for lenders, and those that broker loans, to place homebuyers in mortgages that they can sustain.\nII. Connecting Distressed Borrowers with their Lenders\nIn today's mortgage environment, the continuing relationship with the borrower - that is, the collecting of mortgage payments and the handling of delinquencies and foreclosures - is generally handled by servicing organizations under contract to the individuals or entities investing in the securities that are backed by the mortgages. Sometimes the same organizations are both loan originators and servicers. It is important to recognize that in their servicer capacity these organizations are still working for the investors.\nA persistent complaint among distressed borrowers has been their inability to reach informed representatives of the loan servicers, to discuss and resolve their payment problems.14 In many accounts, borrowers report repeated efforts to reach servicers' representatives and describe the frustration of \"bouncing around\" a telephone maze without being able to reach someone with the information and authority to discuss their situation. Interestingly, we also hear complaints from loan servicers as to how difficult it is to reach and engage troubled borrowers. They highlight repeated mailings to troubled borrowers and the difficulty in finding phone numbers to reach some borrowers.\nWhen home mortgages were held by local community banks, the banks were often in a position to know the borrower personally, and were well aware of how to contact the borrower should payment problems emerge. But today, loans may be originated by a broker who has no involvement with the borrower once the loan has closed. Frequently the loan servicer is located in another part of the country.\nIn sum, while economists like me have tended to assume that borrowers have a strong incentive to discuss their payments problems and the possible options for renegotiating terms, and that lenders have a strong incentive to avoid costly foreclosures, in practice getting borrowers and lenders together has proved to be surprisingly difficult (see Slide 4).\nIt was this observation that led the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to want to hold a large, well-publicized foreclosure-prevention workshop. There are significant economies of scale to such an event. Large events can draw representatives of all the major servicers (many of whom have to fly in), so borrowers are less likely to be disappointed by their servicer not attending. There are also economies of scale in advertising the event and using a large venue with easy access and adequate parking and public transportation arrangements. Large events are also advantageous for the loan servicer, because they can reach a large number of their troubled borrowers in a particular geographic location.\nFortunately, Robert Kraft, Josh Kraft, and the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation were willing to provide Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots football team, as the site for a major foreclosure-prevention event in August (see Slide 5). We had a variety of other invaluable co-sponsors and supporters: the Hope Now Alliance helped bring in the loan servicers, and Neighborworks America helped bring in the housing counselors, some of whom work for organizations affiliated with CHAPA and some of whom may be here tonight. Many of your organizations helped us get the word out about the event. I want to thank everyone for working with us.\nOutreach to borrowers was critical. The loan servicers that participated sent 27,000 letters to their borrowers in New England who were 60 days or more past due. The Boston Fed sent out over 50,000 postcards (Slide 6) to borrowers who took out subprime loans - developing the mailing list from publicly available information from the Registry of Deeds that was compiled by the Warren Group. We simply encouraged the recipients to consider attending the event if they would find it helpful to speak directly to their servicer, and to meet with a foreclosure prevention counselor if they chose. For additional outreach, with the help of our co-sponsors we placed numerous radio interviews and ads in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. In part we focused on areas with high incidence of foreclosures.\nThe event itself needed a big venue (Slide 7). We hosted 20 servicer organizations, which sent 80 loss-mitigation representatives. Most of them remained busy until late into the night, well after the formal close. In addition, we had the vital participation of some 20 counseling agencies that sent 50 counselors and legal aid representatives. They also worked tirelessly and stayed well after the close. In addition there was a large contingent of volunteers from Neighborworks, Fannie Mae, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston who pitched in to help the event run quite smoothly, considering its complexity and size.\nIII. Preliminary Results\nThe event attracted over 4,000 members of the public, representing 2,167 borrowers. While there was a significant wait to see some servicers, 60 percent of the surveyed attendees took advantage of the counseling services while waiting. Some servicers had the capacity to make loan modifications on the spot, while others could only collect information, assess the borrower's situation in person, and get back to the borrower after the event.\nIf one assumed that the mortgage crisis was isolated to one demographic slice of the country, the scene that day told a very different story. The borrowers who made the trek to Gillette seemed to be from all walks of life, and all races and ethnicities. The scene was both poignant and illuminating. Notably, the first lot to fill up at the beginning of our event was the handicapped parking area. We saw people of all ages with health concerns and physical ailments.\nIt is still too early to statistically analyze the ultimate, long-term impact of the event for distressed borrowers, but there are some indicative results that I can share with you this evening. Slide 8 shows the results we at the Boston Fed have compiled to date for borrowers that attended. We signed up just under 400 of the borrowers that attended to be contacted for phone interviews, which we began conducting in the week following the event. The initial results show that about 39 percent of the people were still waiting to hear definitively from the servicer, about 37 percent had been told that the servicer would not make any adjustments, and about 24 percent had received some modification in their loan terms.\nFurthermore, where there was a modification, the type of adjustments varied (see Slide 9). Of those we surveyed who had their loan modified, 62 percent had a permanent reduction in their interest rate, 42 percent had a temporary reduction in their payment, and 6 percent had a reduction in principal. In addition, about half of these borrowers were offered a repayment plan to make up for the late payments. By the way, it is worth noting that the event occurred in the middle of August, before the terms of the new \"Hope for Homeowners\" (H4H) program were announced by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on October 1.\nWe are now re-contacting the borrowers (the 39 percent) who were waiting to hear from their servicer about possible loan modifications, and we very much hope that round of calls will show additional progress. Of course, we also need more time to pass before we can analyze whether people who attended the event, or people who received loan modifications as a result, experience a significantly lower rate of foreclosure than those who did not attend.\nWe learned a lot with this event. We hope that at future events, more servicers will have the ability to make decisions on the spot or soon after the event. We are eager to see the numbers of borrowers who are still waiting to hear from their servicer on a possible modification go down, and for those decisions to happen more quickly in the future. Also, we will be interested to see whether the newly passed legislation has an effect on the number of borrowers that qualify for permanent reductions in interest rate or changes in principal, relative to what was experienced in August.\nConcluding Observations\nWhile it is too early for a full assessment of this one major foreclosure-prevention event, we do know that 24 percent of the attendees we have surveyed already have had the terms of their loan changed - and as we re-survey people, we hope that number will go up. As servicers have become better staffed to work out problems with borrowers, and with new legislative initiatives and other policy developments, we hope that more concrete actions can be taken sooner, thus avoiding preventable foreclosures.\nIt does appear that bringing borrowers together with servicers and counselors to discuss issues in person has significant advantages, and that large events reap certain economies of scale. For these reasons the Boston Fed is looking to partner on one or more large foreclosure-prevention events in the future. If we can line up a time and place that are appropriate for another such event, we will be making an announcement.\nOf course, while foreclosure-prevention workshops appear to be helpful, ideally borrowers and lenders will not wait for these large events before initiating fruitful discussions. Ideally, with new legislative initiatives and the actions recently announced by the U.S. Treasury, more forceful actions will be taken by all participants - actions that in sum will help stabilize the housing market and benefit all its participants.\nThank you.",

            "content": "The University of Wisconsin - Madison\nI. The Critical Role of Financial Intermediation\nII. Financial Turmoil and Liquidity\nIII. New Credit Facilities\nConclusion\nIt is great to be back at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I earned my Ph.D. in 1986.\nThe economics department at the University of Wisconsin is known for producing empirically focused, pragmatic economists with a strong interest in public policy. Certainly it is a good time to have this as your training. Among the few beneficiaries of the current financial turmoil will be economics graduate students, who should not have any trouble finding dissertation topics to study in the coming years. More broadly, I hope that the Wisconsin economics department continues to provide the economics graduates needed to address the problems of an increasingly complex world.\nRecent events in financial markets, and weak incoming data, suggest that the economy is likely to grow well below its potential for the rest of this year.1 While the second quarter benefited from the Federal tax rebates of the \"stimulus plan,\" and strong exports, these sources of growth do not appear to be carrying in to the second half.\nConsumers faced with falling housing prices, falling stock prices, and a weakening labor market are unlikely to continue to spend at the same rate that they did in the second quarter; and recent data seem, unfortunately, to confirm this expectation. Exports are likely to weaken as many of our trading partners are facing significantly slower growth prospects in their own economies. Recent data also show little evidence that the housing market has \"touched bottom.\" And firms appear to be holding back on investments until the economic outlook becomes clearer.\nThe weakening in the real economy is being compounded as so-called \"financial headwinds\" become more severe. The losses of capital and de-leveraging of balance sheets that have been underway at many financial institutions are continuing to serve as a drag on the economy, as financial institutions focus on restructuring their balance sheets with the consequent tightening of lending standards.\nRecall that a loan is counted as an asset on a bank's balance sheet. Banks hold capital in part to reserve against the possibility that a loan defaults, and must maintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets. If a bank experiences a reduction in the value of its capital, it must take steps to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet in order to restore its desired capital-to-assets ratio. In other words, the bank becomes more restrictive in its lending.2 This is no small matter for the broader economy when you consider that, thanks to leverage, when a bank's capital declines, the bank must reduce its loans by much more to maintain its capital-to-assets ratio.\nIn addition to this state of affairs, often referred to as a \"credit crunch,\" a new and unwelcome wrinkle to the financial turmoil is occurring in many short-term credit markets − something you might call a \"liquidity lock.\" By liquidity lock, I am referring to extreme risk aversion by many investors and institutions, which makes short-term financing difficult to come by for even the most creditworthy firms - including financing for very short maturities, measured in days.\nToday I am going to focus on this aspect of the current financial turmoil - the enhanced role of liquidity-risk concerns. Liquidity risk occurs when sellers cannot be sure that they can sell assets in a timely fashion without offering a very steep discount.\nAllow me to make an important point at the outset. My goal is not to be alarmist or even pessimistic, but rather to provide what I hope is a helpful and illuminating view of recent developments. Because only in understanding the situation and its severity can all of us, and especially policymakers, develop effective responses in the near term and long term.\nParticularly striking have been the stories a number of market participants have told me about how, at times during this financial turmoil, there have been few, if any, bids for even high-grade financial paper that has a maturity greater than one day. An example of this has been the unwillingness of many of the largest financial institutions to lend to each other - as represented by the very large spread between the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and the overnight index swap rate (Figure 1).\nIf it were to persist, this unwillingness to take credit risk, or to lend money other than overnight, could constrain creditworthy borrowers from undertaking worthwhile projects - and thus have implications for economic growth.\nNote that this liquidity lock, where transactions are impeded by severe risk aversion by potential investors, compounds problems created by a traditional credit crunch - a situation in which institutions seek to shrink assets (like loans) in order to meet regulatory or market-imposed capital-to-assets ratios. In the current crisis, not only are financial firms faced with a need to de-lever (thus, a credit crunch), but they are also finding it increasingly difficult to borrow other than overnight - even if they are an organization that is highly rated (thus, a liquidity lock).\nTo explore this situation with you today, and to discuss some policy initiatives, I would like to cover three topics: first, the critical role of financial intermediation in the economy; second, what is actually happening with financial turmoil and liquidity; and third, new credit and liquidity facilities at the Federal Reserve that represent important policy responses to the crisis.\nI. The Critical Role of Financial Intermediation\nFinancial intermediaries like banks provide a critical function in the economy. They essentially match borrowers and lenders - taking funds provided by depositors or investors and distributing those funds to individuals and firms that have opportunities for higher potential returns. The individuals and firms often seek to use the funds for significant periods of time, and there is some degree of credit risk. This transformation of assets - where firms with opportunities for higher potential returns obtain funds from investors and depositors looking for shorter-term safer investments - is facilitated by the financial intermediary.\nThe financial intermediary needs to have expertise in identifying creditworthy investment opportunities, monitoring the investments, and obtaining enough unrelated investments to provide the benefits of diversification. In normal times or circumstances, the financial intermediary can allow depositors or investors access to their funds with little or no notice, because the financial intermediary draws its funds from a diversified set of depositors (with diverse financial needs), and thus they are unlikely - again, in normal economic times - to demand their funds simultaneously.\nBut if depositors and investors do all seek their funds simultaneously, as in times of heightened uncertainty about the soundness of intermediaries, the financial intermediary may experience a significant liquidity problem. To sell a large volume of assets in a very compressed time may be difficult, and probably would require selling at a price that is quite low compared with the price that might be obtained in selling the assets gradually over a longer period of time. Liquidity problems can become even more acute if the reason for the early redemption is a widespread move by investors to reduce risk, or if the reason is less confidence in financial intermediaries generally.\nDuring the recent financial turmoil, some fundamental assumptions about the financial system have proven to be seriously flawed. Specifically, assumptions concerning the ability of some financial intermediaries to generate sufficient liquidity to meet potential redemptions of investors have proven to be excessively optimistic.\nA leading example has been the assumption that investment banks are insulated from liquidity concerns because, although they are quite dependent on short-term financing, they can borrow using their assets as collateral. Investment banks typically raise funds via repurchase agreements (\"repos\"), which are agreements that are essentially short-term (often overnight) collateralized loans.3 The collateral for repurchase agreements has traditionally been government and agency securities (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs), but over the years there has been an expansion to riskier assets.\nBecause the lender could sell the collateral assets if the investment bank defaulted, financing with repurchase agreements that provided collateral in excess of the loan amount was viewed as significantly reducing any potential liquidity problems. However, in recent years investment banks have increasingly collateralized their repurchase agreements with mortgage-backed securities and other securities that, in the current crisis, have become difficult to value and thus to sell on short notice. As a result, investors have become less willing to lend to troubled firms even on a collateralized basis; they take little comfort that their recourse is to sell collateral, since they might have to sell it at a significant loss.\nInvestment banks have found that having ample assets to use as collateral did not insulate them from liquidity problems. And because they were highly leveraged, they were susceptible to a \"run\" by their investors and counterparties. Their sources of the short-term funding on which they relied to stay in business refused to lend to them.\nIn part to reduce this liquidity problem, the Federal Reserve provided a liquidity backstop to investment banks through the creation of a primary dealer credit facility. It should be noted that the Federal Reserve imposes a substantial \"haircut\" (write-down) on the value of the collateral it accepts at such facilities.\nIn addition to turning to our primary dealer credit facility, investment banks have also moved recently to obtain the more stable funding source available to commercial banks − federally insured deposits. They have either been acquired by commercial banks or acquired bank holding company charters. Commercial banks are less vulnerable to runs, while also offering less leverage since they are required to maintain a higher capital-to-assets ratio than are investment banks.\nII. Financial Turmoil and Liquidity\nMore recently, liquidity concerns have spread to other financial intermediaries, including taxable money market mutual funds, which hold approximately $2.9 trillion in assets.4\nMoney market mutual funds (MMMFs) are regulated by the SEC5 and are required to hold assets that during normal periods are viewed as safe and highly liquid. These restrictions6 are intended to insure that there is little risk to principal.\nIn addition to holding government and agency securities, MMMFs tend to hold highly rated unsecured commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper, and large certificates of deposit. The unsecured commercial paper represents short-term debt issued by some of the largest and most creditworthy non-financial and financial firms in the United States. The asset-backed commercial paper represents debt instruments used to finance short-term receivables, which can include home-equity loans, student loans, and credit-card loans. Certificates of deposit are debt issued by large domestic and foreign commercial banks.\nInstitutional money market funds all hold short-term, high-grade securities.\nHowever, some hold only Treasury securities; some hold a mix of Treasury and agency securities; and some - sometimes called \"prime\" funds - hold a mix of Treasury issues, agency securities, and short-term debt instruments. While a MMMF that holds only Treasury securities will have no credit risk, it also provides a lower expected return. Prime funds, by holding non-government high-grade debt instruments, have somewhat more risk but also provide a somewhat higher expected return. Some funds invest in state and municipal debt.\nFollowing the failure of Lehman Brothers, investors in some MMMFs that had holdings of Lehman Brothers securities began to withdraw their money. Redemptions rose dramatically. One fund in particular, the Reserve Primary Fund, was widely reported by the financial press to hold $785 million in Lehman Brothers securities. When Lehman Brothers failed, some investors moved swiftly to take their money out of this fund. Because of the loss on the Lehman securities, the current net asset value of the fund dropped from the standard $1 per share to $0.97 - a phenomenon known as \"breaking the buck.\" Investors in the fund experienced a loss.\nIn addition, the Reserve Fund instituted a seven-day delay on redemptions. Following the announcement of this delay, another firm announced that one of its funds could not meet redemptions and the fund would be closed. In the face of massive redemption requests, a MMMF needs to sell off assets - unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper in particular - in larger volumes than normal, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to find buyers for such assets.\nIn reaction to all this, many MMMF institutional investors have become much more risk averse. This is evident in the significant shift in investor's preferences from prime funds to government-only funds (Figure 2) and to ordinary bank deposits. The movement out of prime funds was quite abrupt, with nearly $300 billion in redemptions from prime funds in the three days following the Reserve Fund announcement.\nIn addition, because of concern over redemptions, MMMFs that remained willing to purchase commercial paper wanted to hold only very short maturities. As Figure 3 illustrates, commercial paper issuance responded to this shift, and the vast majority of new paper has been issued for maturities of just one to four days.\nThese developments have unfortunate implications for the functioning of our capital markets. First, the \"flight to Treasuries\" has, of course, increased demand for government securities.7 Second, the move out of prime funds has reduced investor demand for commercial paper and large certificates of deposit. The result has been an increase in the rate paid by even high-quality firms to raise short-term funds and higher costs to finance highly rated ABCP Figure 4) - both of which have traditionally been viewed as relatively low risk. Third, commercial paper issuance has become of very short duration, which means that commercial paper issuers must now bear interest-rate risk or funding risk every few days, rather than every few weeks or months, as they roll over their issues.\nBecause of the important role that MMMFs provide in buying high-grade financial and non-financial paper, and high grade short-term tax-exempt securities, the shift in investor preferences to government-only funds makes it more difficult for even high-quality borrowers to get short-term financing. The alternate buyers for short-term high-grade securities are banks, but, as described earlier, many banks are seeking to shrink their balance sheets given recent losses. The result has been that high-grade short-term paper of all types has been very difficult to place - causing firms with good credit ratings to become concerned about meeting their short-term financing needs.\nIII. New Credit Facilities\nOn September 19 the Federal Reserve announced a new credit facility - one with a long name, I might add - the Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (or in shorthand, the \"AMLF\").8 The AMLF was created in response to the large number of redemptions at money market funds occurring in the wake of the \"breaking the buck\" news I described a moment ago.\nYou see, the large numbers of redemptions by institutional investors were leaving money market mutual funds in a quandary. Some funds had redemptions in excess of their cash and Treasury positions - so they could meet their redemption needs only by selling other assets. But these other assets, high-grade short-term paper, had become unusually illiquid, so sales could occur only at a deep discount. Money market funds were faced with the unpleasant choice between announcing they were suspending redemptions, or liquidating paper at a discount that would likely force them to break the buck.\nThe AMLF was designed to help provide liquidity for MMMFs to meet redemptions of institutional investors and to help support the ABCP market, a market where, as noted earlier, MMMFs were the predominant buyers of the paper.\nIt was hoped that the announcement of the facility to fund redemptions, in conjunction with the U.S. Treasury Department's announcement of insurance for money market funds,9 would reduce the outflows from institutional money market funds.\nThe facility needed to be quickly organized to help stem the immediate flow out of prime funds. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston was charged with setting it up. It was announced on Friday, September 19. We set it up over the weekend and began making loans the following Monday (September 22). The AMLF lending program involves a non-recourse loan to banks, provided they have purchased ABCP directly from a money market fund.10\nBy making the loans non-recourse, the Federal Reserve accepts the risk11 associated with the collateral over the term of the loan.12 Highly rated ABCP can be pledged by eligible borrowers (banks, bank holding companies, or broker-dealer affiliates of bank holding companies) to secure advances.13 The Federal Reserve charges the primary credit rate (the so-called \"Discount Rate\") for the loan, currently 1.75 percent.\nWith the announcement of the AMLF and the Treasury's insurance, redemptions from prime funds slowed appreciably (Figure 5). However, the percent of ABCP held by prime funds did decline, as the AMLF was used to meet redemptions (Figure 6). It should be noted that on Tuesday the Federal Reserve Board announced the creation of an additional facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), in light of market conditions and to complement the efforts to date.14\nThe combined availability of Treasury insurance for money market funds and the new AMLF should significantly reduce the risk that outflows will force MMMFs to delay redemptions or sell paper in good standing at a deep discount in order to meet redemptions. Hopefully, over time, confidence in prime funds will be sufficient that MMMFs can remain significant purchasers of high-grade short-term paper - a role that is so important to meeting the short-term financing needs of corporations and financial institutions.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I thank you for the opportunity to describe how over the past several weeks, credit markets have been in a liquidity lock, where high grade short-term paper can only be sold at deep discounts. A liquidity lock makes it more difficult for financial firms and non-financial firms to raise the funds they need. It also makes it more difficult to finance short-term receivables, ranging from home equity loans to student loans to auto and credit card loans. Were the liquidity lock to persist, more financing would need to be done through bank loans - but, as noted earlier, banks already are struggling to adjust to a more traditional credit crunch.\nOur hope is that the new liquidity facilities will make it easier for commercial paper to serve its important purposes and for financing to flow to assets that rely on issuing high-grade ABCP. With the ability to access Federal Reserve facilities, in addition to the new Treasury insurance for money market funds, investors should be less concerned that institutional money market funds will experience liquidity problems.\nWell-functioning credit markets are essential for restoring economic health. These and other measures taken by the Federal Reserve should help restore confidence in credit markets, and allow the financial system to efficiently link borrowers and lenders in ways that promote economic growth.\nThank you.",

            "content": "The Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire and the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce Manchester, New Hampshire\nI am pleased to be with you today in New Hampshire, and would like to share some perspectives on the implications of a credit crunch.1 Unfortunately, a credit crunch is not an entirely new topic for those of you who have been doing business in New Hampshire for some time, since you experienced the early 1990s - when many of the larger banks in the state failed, and credit availability was an acute problem.\nToday, banking and real estate problems are less severe in New England than they are in many other parts of the country. However, on a national scale the \"headwinds\" pushing against the economy look to be a good bit stronger than those experienced in the early 1990s.\nOver the course of this summer it became clear that the economic headwinds have not subsided as hoped. With some help from tax rebates and previous interest-rate cuts, the second quarter was better than many had feared; however, most private forecasters are expecting significantly slowed growth in the second half of this year - as residential investment continues to be a drag on the economy, as consumers tighten up on their spending, as the impact of the Federal tax rebate subsides, and as weakness among some of our major trading partners makes the outlook for many exports more restrained.\nWith the economy expected to expand at a rate below its potential in the second half of this year, further increases in the unemployment rate are possible. It now appears that the national unemployment rate may rise above 6 percent, an increase of more than one and a quarter percentage points - or about 2 million workers - from last August, when the financial problems emerged.\nContributing to this weakness, in my view, is a significant change in the nature of the financial problems facing the economy. In particular, the financial problems that initially created a liquidity crunch2 have now evolved into a more traditional credit crunch.\nBefore discussing a credit crunch, allow me to describe what I mean by a liquidity crunch. Simply put, the reluctance of banks to lend to each other became quite elevated, beginning in July 2007. A combination of balance sheet constraints, poor transparency regarding potential losses, and concerns about heightened counterparty risk contributed to less liquid financial markets. Uncertainty over asset valuations increased, and banks became reluctant to take on counterparty risk with certain financial institutions - particularly with those that have significant exposure to complex financial instruments.\nTurning to the notion of a credit crunch, we see that mounting losses at financial institutions, and an increasing reluctance among investors to invest new capital while the economic outlook is unclear, are forcing financial institutions to \"shrink their balance sheets.\"\nAllow me to explain that notion for the non-bankers here today. Recall that a loan is counted as an asset on a bank's balance sheet. Banks hold capital in part as a reserve against the possibility that a loan will default. Thus banks attempt to maintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets. If a bank experiences a reduction in the value of its capital or an increase in its assets (for example as credit lines that were extended in better times are tapped),3 the bank must take steps to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet in order to restore its desired capital-to-asset ratio.\nIn other words, the bank becomes more restrictive in its lending. This shrinkage in lending entails tighter underwriting standards, wider interest rate margins, and reduced credit availability.\nAn alternative is to raise more capital, but this can be quite difficult in times like these, when investors are wary of putting more money into some seemingly fragile financial institutions. Witness the reliance, particularly by some large, well-known institutions, on foreign sources of capital like the sovereign wealth funds in recent months.\nThis seemingly technical issue of banks' balance sheets is no small matter for the broader economy. Because a bank extends loans that are many times the value of its capital base - the hallmark of a \"leveraged\" institution - the result is that when a bank's capital loses value, it must reduce its loans by much more in order to maintain its capital-asset ratio. In numeric terms, for a bank seeking to maintain a 10 percent capital-to-asset ratio, the bank would need to reduce assets - like loans - by $10 for every $1 lost in capital.4\nToday I am going to discuss the implications of a credit crunch - specifically, the effects of a credit crunch on the degree of stimulus that is provided by monetary policy. In particular, I will discuss how a low Federal Funds rate provides much less stimulus during a credit crunch than it otherwise would - because those low rates for inter-bank loans do not necessarily translate into lower costs to the vast majority of borrowers who rely on funding sources outside the Federal Funds market.\nTo preview the punch line, let me say that looking only at the Federal Funds rate during periods of significant economic headwinds will, in my view, provide a misleading gauge of the degree of monetary stimulus that the Federal Reserve has put in place. At such times, a low Federal Funds rate does not signal a particularly accommodative monetary policy, but rather offsets some of the contraction that would otherwise occur as financial institutions tighten credit standards and offer borrowing rates with a spread over the Federal Funds rate that is larger than usual (in other words, larger than would be the case outside of credit crunch conditions).\nThat said, make no mistake: in my view, credit conditions would likely be much worse if the Federal Reserve had not lowered the Federal Funds rate and taken several innovative steps to enhance liquidity in the marketplace - steps like opening our new Term Auction Facility and other facilities that complement our traditional \"Discount Window\" for banks.\nI. Overview of recent financial issues\nFor context I would like to provide an overview, as I see it, of the recent financial turmoil. Over a year ago, problems stemming from large losses in securities backed by subprime5 loans led to a liquidity crunch. While the initial trigger for the financial turbulence was related to subprime mortgages, the uncertainty surrounding ratings of complicated financial instruments caused disruptions in a variety of other assets and markets that depend on securitization - including state and municipal financing, student loans, and commercial real estate. Inter-bank lending markets, mortgage markets tied to securitization, and short-term assets financed through the commercial paper market experienced sharply wider spreads and significant declines in volumes.\nAt the time, it was hoped that these problems would be short-lived. However, after one year, while the spreads have fluctuated they remain quite elevated by historical standards.\nThe initial liquidity problems soon created credit problems at large financial institutions with significant exposure to these markets. While it is true that significant new capital has been raised, for many institutions the new capital only partially offset losses and provided little cushion for potential additional losses.\nIn addition, the continued decline in housing prices has caused problems to extend well beyond the larger banks active in complicated financial arrangements. Falling housing prices, coupled with a rising unemployment rate, are contributing to increases in non-performing loans - on prime as well as subprime mortgages, on construction loans, and on home equity loans (see Figure 1).\nAs problems have extended to a broader set of financial institutions, concerns that the financial condition of leveraged institutions will create a more traditional credit crunch have increased. The last time a significant credit crunch occurred in the United States was in the early 1990s.\nAt that time, falling commercial real estate prices in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and California caused large losses of capital for banks in those regions. Many banks had little success in attracting new capital, and instead shrank their assets to improve their capital ratios.6 Because of the implication of leverage that I mentioned earlier, banks' capital losses can have a magnified impact on the overall economy.\nIt had been hoped by many observers that consolidation in the banking industry and growth in securitization would make a 1990s-style credit crunch less likely. Unfortunately, that is not how things have worked out.\nAs we all know, there has been significant consolidation in the banking industry (see Figure 2). It was hoped that banks with a more national footprint would be less susceptible to regional shocks and thus more able to lend during regional downturns. Unfortunately, many of the largest commercial and investment banks had a significant concentration of their assets in complex securities that have declined in value, had significant exposures to subprime mortgages or so-called \"Alt A\" mortgages that have declined in value, and also had exposure to construction and residential loans that have suffered from national rather than just regional declines in value.\nIn terms of securitization, the loss of confidence in complex financial instruments and their ratings has dried up the demand for all but the simplest and least-risky securitizations. So rather than serving as a shock absorber for banking problems, it seems that securitization has actually exacerbated the problem. Indeed, a wide variety of loans that were once widely securitized are now not available (e.g., subprime mortgages) or are only available from financial institutions at much higher costs (e.g., jumbo loans).\nII. Credit availability for businesses\nNow with that context, I'd like to comment on the current state of credit availability for businesses.\nThe 1990s credit crunch was primarily a problem for small and medium-sized businesses that were dependent on their bank for credit - businesses that found credit less available as their bank reduced assets to improve its capital ratio. As I suggested earlier, banks can choose to shrink assets in several ways - by raising rates, tightening credit standards, or refusing to roll over loans and lines of credit that expire.\nA useful indicator of bank lending practices has been the Federal Reserve's senior loan officer survey, which asks senior loan officers from large domestic banks as well as foreign banks with branches in the United States a series of questions. Numerous academic studies have found that the survey can be useful in estimating credit restraint and its impact on bank-sensitive components of GDP.7\nFigure 3 provides the responses of loan officers asked if their bank had tightened lending standards for commercial and industrial loans to firms over the past three months. As the figure shows, the results of the July 2008 survey indicated that nearly 60 percent of banks had tightened their lending standards for large firms and 65 percent had tightened their lending standards for small firms. This was the largest percentage of banks tightening commercial and industrial loan standards for small firms in the survey's history, which includes both the 2001 and 1990 recessions (and the number for large firms is right in the vicinity of the observations from those eras).\nFigure 4 shows the survey answers to the question of whether lenders had increased spreads - in other words the amount by which their loan rates exceed the bank's cost of funds. In July, about 80 percent of domestic banks said that they had increased their loan rates for large firms relative to their cost of funds, and roughly 70 percent of banks said they had increased their loan rates for small firms relative to their cost of funds. These responses represent the highest net percentage of banks reporting that they had increased interest-rate spreads on commercial and industrial loans in the survey's history.\nFigure 5 relates to the survey's question on whether domestic respondents had tightened lending standards on commercial real estate loans. Again, the results of the July survey are at high points for the series, exceeding the peak that occurred during the early 1990s.\nIn sum, these results indicate that the financial problems at banks are beginning to be reflected in reduced lending to businesses. The tightening already appears to be more widespread than it was during the early 1990s (the \"economic headwinds\" period), and portends more difficulty in financing business fixed investment and commercial real estate projects in the second half of this year.\nAt least for large firms, an alternative to bank financing is to go directly to the bond market to raise funds. Figure 6 shows the Moody's \"Aaa\" grade bond yields and the effective Federal Funds rate over the past 20 years. High-grade bond yields tend to fall during periods where the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy and the economy is experiencing a significant slowdown. However, to date - despite a significant reduction in the Federal Funds rate target from 5.25 to 2 percent - the corporate bond yield has remained little changed from its level just before the financial problems first emerged in August 2007.\nThus, while the Federal Reserve has lowered the Federal Funds rate, interest rates paid by businesses have not reflected this easing. Banks have increased their spreads on business lending and investors have continued to demand relatively high yields on bonds issued by highly credit-worthy borrowers.\nIII. Consumer credit conditions\nSimilarly, consumer credit practices have also undergone significant changes of late, as banks have underwritten consumer mortgages and credit card loans, but have increasingly sold many of those loans in the secondary market. With an active secondary market provided by the securitization of these loans, it was again widely anticipated that the availability of these types of credit would be relatively protected from credit supply shocks.\nThat, however, has not been the case since last August. Innovations that were supposed to insulate consumers from credit supply problems have essentially done the opposite, making a credit crunch a concern for consumers as well as businesses.\nInitially, borrowers of subprime mortgages felt the largest impact. Because investors lost confidence in the securitization structure for subprime mortgages, investors virtually abandoned the market, impeding the ability of borrowers to get subprime mortgages.\nBut so-called jumbo mortgages were also affected. While these mortgages were often to borrowers with good credit history, banks were no longer able to securitize these mortgages but were forced to hold the loans in their own portfolio. This resulted in the spread on jumbos rising, reflecting banks' limited desire to expand their balance sheet on these types of mortgages.\nInitially, the one area of the mortgage market that was only modestly impacted was that for prime mortgages that could be securitized by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. However, this spring highlighted the financial problems at the two Government Sponsored Enterprises (the GSEs) - problems which have both increased their borrowing costs and reduced their willingness to expand their balance sheets.\nFigure 7 provides the 30-year conventional mortgage rate and the effective Federal Funds rate. During the previous two periods of significant monetary easing, around the times of the 1990 and 2001 recessions, the 30-year rate trended down when the Federal Reserve was reducing the Federal Funds rate. This is in contrast to the current period when, despite a significant decline in the Federal Funds rate, the 30-year conventional mortgage rate has remained little changed.\nFigure 8 shows the rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and jumbo mortgages. Because one-year ARMs are frequently reset, their rates tend to be much more responsive to Federal Reserve rate easing than those of longer-term loans. While the yield on one-year ARMs did fall significantly in the previous two periods where the Federal Funds rate declined substantially, this time the yield on one-year ARMs has been fairly unresponsive to the lower Federal Funds rate. While there is only a limited time-series for rates on jumbo mortgages, those rates have increased significantly despite the lower Federal Funds rate.\nIn sum, the problems relating to the securitization market and the GSEs have reduced the responsiveness of mortgage and other consumer lending rates to reductions in the Federal Funds rate. It is also a sign of the times that for many borrowers, access to credit may be limited because of an unwillingness to lend to borrowers with troubled credit histories, or because falling housing prices have reduced their ability to utilize home equity lines of credit. Where credit is available, the yields have remained high despite the reductions in the Federal Funds rate.\nThat is not to say that monetary policy has been ineffective - quite the opposite, in my view. The rate easing and liquidity measures undertaken by the Federal Reserve were appropriate and effective, in that credit problems would likely be a great deal more severe, and widespread, had we not taken the steps.\nIV. Implications for monetary policy\nNow a few additional thoughts on what this all means for U.S. monetary policy.\nWhile the Federal Funds rate is low by historical standards, I would argue that one cannot capture the stance of monetary policy by only looking at this one rate, particularly during a period when the transmission of monetary policy has been impeded by problems with securitization, financial institutions, and GSEs.\nDuring a credit crunch, various constraints on the supply of credit will make market rates less responsive to a lower Federal Funds rate. While the Federal Reserve essentially sets the Federal Funds rate (the rate at which banks will lend to each other), it does so with the intention of also impacting other rates that more directly affect borrowers. But in the current period, many business borrowers and consumers are finding their access to credit has diminished, and their cost of credit has risen, despite the reductions in the Federal Funds rate.\nIndeed, as suggested earlier, the reductions in the Federal Funds rate have done little but offset some of the tightening occurring in the marketplace in response to the credit crunch conditions. Thus one can argue that much of the easing in monetary policy to date has merely offset the tightening in credit conditions created by the financial turmoil that began last summer.\nIdeally, as these financial headwinds subside, the current very large spreads relative to the Federal Funds rate will narrow, and we will see the rates available to businesses and consumers decline, helping to stimulate demand. It is precisely for this reason that the Federal Reserve has undertaken a variety of innovative liquidity measures, to enable the financial markets to begin to operate more normally.\nLet me conclude by reiterating my view that credit conditions, while difficult, would likely be much worse if the Federal Reserve had not lowered the Federal Funds rate and opened the additional liquidity facilities.\nIn closing let me thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today about these important issues, and their implications - for all of us in the region and for the national economy.",

            "content": "The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 53rd Economic Conference Understanding Inflation and the Implications for Monetary Policy: A Phillips Curve Retrospective, Chatham, Massachusetts\nI am very pleased to open the second day of this conference focused on the 50th anniversary of the Phillips Curve.1 This conference, although long in the planning, turns out to be very timely. The effects of significant increases in food and energy prices are still feeding through the economy, as are the impacts of appropriately aggressive monetary and fiscal policy responses to the recent financial turmoil and its spillover effects. As a result of all these developments, consumers, commentators, and policymakers are intensely interested in the current outlook for inflation.\nFood- and gas-price increases - so-called supply shocks - have heightened everyone's awareness that the total consumer price index (CPI) has increased 3.9 percent over the past year; clearly an undesirable outcome. As consumers, we all buy food and gas with high frequency, so sharp relative price movements for these goods get our immediate attention. Furthermore, if sustained, such increases in food and energy prices, which are not currently suggested by food and energy futures prices, would raise concern that these commodity price increases could become embedded in expectations - clearly an outcome to be avoided.\nDespite these recent supply shocks, the central tendency of the forecasts of the Federal Reserve Presidents and Governors indicates that total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation and core PCE inflation are expected to move downward, to around or below 2 percent over the next two years (Table 1). While many private forecasts do not yet extend out through 2010, many that do are broadly consistent with the central tendency reported after the April Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\nThese baseline forecasts indicate a general expectation among many analysts, forecasters, and policymakers that inflationary pressures will moderate. However, there remain significant disagreements over which factors are the most important determinants of future inflation. It is my hope that this conference will help facilitate - and indeed sharpen - the debate and provide some empirical support for our thinking on the inflation outlook and the implications for monetary policy.\nToday in these opening remarks I simply want to highlight and briefly mention some of the key empirical questions that I expect will be addressed in greater depth in the conference presentations and discussions.\nThe first empirical question involves the role that domestic excess capacity (for example, unemployed workers) plays in reducing inflation. Does sizable excess capacity in the economy significantly reduce future inflation? This question is at the heart of discussions of the Phillips Curve and its relevance for forecasting inflation.\nThe second question involves the divergence between core inflation and total inflation. Many forecasters – including many central bankers – use the core inflation rate as an indicator of future total inflation trends. Is that use of core inflation prudent? How will these two measures, core inflation and total inflation, converge over time? A closely-related question centers on higher food and energy prices: how important is the \"pass-through\" of these price changes to the core and overall inflation rates?\nAnd the third question involves the impact of relative price changes on labor markets. Specifically, under what circumstances do inflationary pressures affect inflation expectations, and become embedded in wage and salary increases? In the current environment, we need to gauge the likelihood that inflationary pressures will cause further upward pressures on wages and salaries.\nI. Excess Capacity and Inflation\nA key element of the Phillips Curve framework is the assumption that significant excess capacity in the economy should exert downward pressure on inflation. While this key link in the Phillips framework provokes considerable skepticism in some quarters, it nonetheless serves as the underpinning of the inflation forecast for many private forecasters, much of Wall Street, and indeed many of the models utilized within the Federal Reserve System.2\nThis widespread use reflects the fact that forecasts of inflation do seem to improve when measures of excess capacity are incorporated.3 These models derive their success from the simple empirical observation that during recessionary periods, the inflation rate tends to fall (Figure 1). Over the past 50 years, the rate of total CPI inflation has tended to be lower after a recession than before; and the proxies for excess capacity capture this business cycle regularity. The intuition behind this empirical regularity is that, with widespread current and expected excess capacity, firms have greater difficulty increasing prices, workers' expectations of inflation decline, and they thus demand smaller wage increases. As a result, during a recession wage and price inflation slow, and the economy returns to full employment with a lower equilibrium inflation rate.\nDespite the heavy reliance on a Phillips Curve empirical framework in many models, the extent and reliability of the short-run tradeoff between excess capacity and the inflation rate remain matters of much debate. In addition, how inflation expectations are set remains an issue that economists are only beginning to understand, and an area of considerable disagreement. As both questions are very important for policy, I look forward to a thorough discussion of these issues over the next two days.\nII. Issues around Core and Total Inflation Rates, and their Divergence\nIn the long run, in my view, it is total inflation - rather than core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components - that should be the focus of monetary policy.4 However, total inflation is typically much more strongly influenced by temporary changes in relative prices than core inflation. This suggests a potential role for core inflation as an indicator of the subsequent trajectory of total inflation - so I want to spend a few minutes focusing on the impact of relative price changes on inflation, and on the relationship between core and total inflation measures.\nAs shown in Figure 2, total CPI has been more volatile than core CPI, as food and energy prices have been much less stable than many of the other components of inflation. Because the volatility in food and energy components is largely transitory, many focus on the core rate of inflation as a \"medium-term\" indicator of where inflation is trending.\nIn gauging the usefulness of core inflation as an indicator of inflation's trend, one might perform the following simple exercise: see whether, when total inflation and core inflation show significant divergence, the core inflation rate moves to the total inflation rate over time, or the total inflation rate moves to the core?5\nOne would expect the core to move to the total if aggregate inflation expectations consistently reflect a large part of the volatile changes in food and energy prices that arise from periodic supply shocks. If, instead, such supply shocks are seen as producing a temporary change in relative prices - and as a result are not incorporated into inflationary expectations - then one would expect total inflation to converge to the underlying rate of core inflation.\nThis is more than just an academic debate. Over the last four years, rising food and energy prices have caused total inflation to be significantly higher than core inflation. Figure 3 plots, over ten years, the gap between total inflation and core inflation against the total inflation rate two years ahead. The relationship between the two shows that, at least in this period, when total inflation is higher than core inflation, total inflation tends to move down to close the gap.6\nFigure 4 plots the same gap between total inflation and core inflation against the core rate of inflation two years ahead. In this case there is no relationship, indicating that at least in this period core inflation does not rise following an increase in the spread between total and core inflation.7, 8\nGiven that total inflation has been higher than core inflation for the last several years, will core inflation tend to rise to close the gap, or will the total inflation rate fall to close the gap? Work under way in the Boston Fed's research department, forthcoming in a discussion paper, would seem to indicate the latter; however, we urge participants at this conference to share their views and help improve understanding of this important topic.\nOf course, closely related to the question of how core and total inflation converge is the issue of how large movements in food and energy prices might differentially affect core versus total inflation - the so-called \"pass-through\" of food and energy prices into inflation.9 The observation that, of late, total inflation tends to converge to core inflation would seem to imply that higher food and energy prices have a significant concurrent impact on the total inflation rate, but have little contemporaneous effect on core inflation, and little or no lasting effect on either. Food and energy prices, this observation implies, are likely to have little impact on longer-run expectations of inflation.\nHowever, some have raised concerns that the future behavior of inflation may look different than the past, perhaps because food and energy price increases will no longer be transitory, but will instead become an enduring feature of the economic landscape. Rising food and energy prices could become the norm if demand for these commodities outstrips supply on a continuous or prolonged basis.\nIt is important to note, however, that futures prices do not generally reflect an expectation that oil prices will continue rising at their recent rapid rate. In the past, higher oil prices have spurred conservation efforts and contributed to slower economic growth - both reducing energy demand. Higher oil prices also encouraged new technological improvements, and exploration and production from higher-cost sources - increasing supply. In other words, economists expect that the laws of supply and demand will ultimately limit price increases - even in the face of relatively rapid economic growth in emerging markets. That said, it seems to be taking quite a long time to date for long-run supply and demand influences to rein in oil price increases. You might say the short run is getting longer every day.\nAnother frequent explanation for recent oil prices increases is that dollar depreciation has boosted the demand for oil in strong-currency countries while discouraging oil output in the oil-producing countries. However, the strength of the statistical correlation between the exchange rate and oil prices is modest at best. As Figure 5 shows, while the price of oil is indeed correlated with the exchange rate, the cumulative change in the exchange rate pales in comparison to the enormous run-up in oil prices - in other words, the exchange rate cannot explain more than a very small fraction of the change in the dollar price of oil.\nFinally, even if oil prices do continue to rise much faster than U.S. core inflation for an extended period, the experience of the past 20 years (shown in Figure 6) indicates that there is a relatively low correlation between oil price movements and the underlying core rate of inflation.10 More comprehensive statistical work by researchers at the Boston Reserve Bank concludes that the impact of relative price shocks from oil - and other related supply shocks - has had a very minor impact on the underlying rate of inflation.11 Of course, we know that not everyone here shares that view, and we look forward to hearing other perspectives on this issue over the course of the next two days.\nIII. The Impact on Labor Markets\nA question related to substantial supply shocks is whether labor contracts will start to incorporate higher wage demands intended to offset rising price pressures. If workers believe that underlying inflation will be higher over time as a result of increases in food and energy prices, they may begin demanding higher wages and salaries to match their expectations of future inflation.\nThe determinants of worker expectations remain a relative unknown in economics. We know that a wide variety of factors can affect expectations, factors ranging from past rates of inflation to sophisticated forecasts of future inflation which end up being consistent with economists' models. The role that the Federal Reserve may play in the formation of those expectations has been an issue of discussion and debate for economists since the late 1970s; it continues to be so.\nIn any event, workers' ability to demand higher wages and salaries is likely to depend on the competitiveness and structure of labor markets, as well as on broader economic conditions. Recent increases in U.S. wages and salaries have been quite modest and do not show evidence of \"ratcheting up\" related to recent supply shocks (see Figure 7).\nLike the inflation rate, increases in wages and salaries have, historically, slowed during recessions. Since wages and salaries are an important component of overall costs, one can argue that the excess capacity that exists during recessions is an important element in dampening wage and salary demands - and as a result plays the role in the inflation framework that is embedded in the Phillips Curve.\nWork done in the Research Department at the Boston Fed indicates that recent wage and salary growth has not reflected increased inflationary expectations or a significant reaction to recent supply shocks. Because these conclusions have important policy implications, we hope the conference will include a vigorous discussion of the evidence on this issue.\nConcluding Observations\nIn short introductory remarks like these, it is impossible to do justice to the topic of understanding inflation dynamics and how they might impact monetary policy. That is exactly why we were eager to seize the opportunity presented by the Phillips Curve anniversary and organize a conference devoted to the topic. Fortunately, those who are presenting and discussing papers have the opportunity to delve into the issues in much more depth than I have been able to, today.\nAs I believe this conference will show, the past 50 years have brought significant advances in our understanding of these issues. Building from the relatively primitive relationship embodied in the Phillips Curve, economic researchers are now in the process of developing a much more robust understanding of inflation dynamics.\nAnd in my view, one area that provides particularly promising opportunities for further research is inflation expectations. Early Phillips-Curve models used simple rules of thumb to capture how inflation expectations are set. But increasingly, economists are starting to develop a more rigorous understanding of how inflation expectations are established. I anticipate that the burgeoning field of behavioral economics will greatly improve our understanding of how individuals set their expectations and how consumers, firms, and workers react to supply shocks and other macroeconomic issues. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's Research Center for Behavioral Economics and Decisionmaking12 is devoting a good deal of attention to these issues.\nAlthough many economists have done extensive work on inflation dynamics, I strongly suspect that this conference will highlight that there is still plenty of work to be done. And like all of you here, I look forward to hearing about some of the new research that is currently under way. My hope for this conference is that each of us will gain a number of insights that will allow us to better understand our interesting and at times challenging macroeconomic environment - and that will help those of us who are policymakers to better serve the public's interests. So I wish you a very engaging two days.",

Macroeconomic Implications of Housing Trends\nII. Length and Duration of Housing Downturns, and Other Recent Research from the Boston Fed\nIII. Issues Complicating the Resolution of Housing Problems\nIV. Implications for Policymakers\nAs someone who is an ardent consumer of good economic analysis, I have often been the beneficiary of work done by the New England Economic Partnership. So it is certainly a pleasure to be with you today to participate in your discussion of current trends in the economy, and credit and housing matters.1\nOver the past year, the economy has been buffeted by a series of shocks including financial turmoil; an emergency acquisition of a major investment bank to avoid a sudden, disorderly failure2; falling national housing prices; and oil prices that have exceeded $130 a barrel. Despite all these challenges, the U.S. unemployment rate is at 5 percent; the rise in prices of \"core\" consumer goods and services (Personal Consumption Expenditures) to a little above 2 percent, while unwelcome, has not been large compared with past episodes; and the economy has been growing, albeit at a much slower pace then we would prefer. These relatively benign outcomes to date are at least partly the result of recent monetary and fiscal policy actions taken to mitigate some of the problems facing the economy.\nIn keeping with the title of your conference - \"Crunched: Credit, Housing and the Consequences for New England\" - I am going to focus on the continued downside risk posed by falling asset prices, particularly in the housing sector. Residential investment (the housing component of GDP3) has declined for nine straight quarters, and in all likelihood will decline this quarter as well. This has been an unusually long period of continuous decline in the housing sector, and coupled with falling housing prices nationally, has complicated predictions of what will happen in the economy going forward.\nI would like to begin by first looking at some of the macroeconomic issues related to the housing sector, and considering why - despite being a relatively small component of GDP - housing continues to be a source of such significant uncertainty in the economy.\nThen secondly, I will discuss some of the varied and interesting research done recently at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston by economists and analysts (including Prabal Chakrabarti, Chris Foote, Kristopher Gerardi, Lorenz Goette, Kai-Yan Lee, Adam Shapiro, and Paul Willen). This work highlights some striking differences, and some similarities, between the current housing problems and those experienced in New England in the early 1990s. In particular I will note the observation that foreclosures remained elevated well after their peak in the last downturn, and the finding that multi-family properties are playing a much more important role in the current housing downturn.\nThirdly, I am going to discuss why developing solutions to the current housing problems has not been easy, and why the housing sector, despite being sensitive to interest rates, remains very weak notwithstanding a significant amount of monetary stimulus in the form of Federal Funds rate reductions. In particular, I will highlight the important role of so-called \"piggyback loans,\" or second mortgages; the implications of homeowners having \"negative home equity\" as a result of falling house prices; and the complications created by the securitization of many mortgages.\nFinally, I am going to briefly discuss some implications for policymakers in seeking to develop and implement responses to the problems posed by falling house prices and rising delinquencies and foreclosures.\nI. Macroeconomic Implications of Housing Trends\nFigure 1 highlights how precipitously single-family housing starts have declined since their peak. This is actually the largest peak-to-trough decline in housing starts to occur in nearly 50 years. The decline is occurring in what would seem, in fact, to be a relatively benign economic environment, with U.S. unemployment at 5 percent and interest rates low by historical standards.\nHowever, the reduction in credit availability generated by recent, significant disruptions in the securitization of mortgages has made it particularly difficult for borrowers seeking subprime4 and \"jumbo\" loans. What was likely to be a weak residential market has become a market characterized by major declines as builders seek to reduce their swelling housing inventories and as continuing price declines raise the costs of holding on to land or unsold homes.\nThese problems have begun to have an impact on some financial institutions that had taken outsized positions in construction loans, or whose business model was focused on the types of residential lending most impacted by the downturn. Of course, the dramatic decline in housing starts should expedite the process of reducing the inventories of unsold homes, and over time provide a basis for stabilizing the housing market - although with sales continuing to decline, the most recent readings show little or no progress in cutting inventories relative to sales.\nA potential problem for financial institutions is the interaction between falling housing prices and homeowners' home equity lines of credit (HELOCs5) and junior liens6 (home equity loans). As housing prices have risen over the course of this decade, products have proliferated that allow consumers to tap into the wealth created by home-price appreciation. As can be seen in Figure 2, home equity loans and HELOCs have expanded rapidly - together they now account for over $700 billion of bank assets (which accounts for about one-third of the $2.1 trillion in one-to-four-family mortgages held by the nation's commercial and savings banks as of March 31, 2008).\nUsing home equity can be particularly attractive to consumers because of the tax advantages of borrowing with the home as collateral, the lower interest rate on mortgage loans relative to other forms of consumer debt, and the ability to expand the credit line during a period of rapid appreciation in home prices.\nDespite the advantages to consumers, these products are potentially risky to lenders during periods of falling home prices. Most financial institutions will not take possession of homes when borrowers default on their home-equity loans (junior liens), because this would require them to assume the first mortgage. With falling housing prices, assuming the first mortgage is not an attractive option from the lender's perspective. An additional complication is that default will frequently not occur until the home equity line of credit has been fully utilized, as borrowers who are having difficulty making payments can tap their credit line again and again. Thus, credit problems may first appear as rising balances rather than a failure to make payments.\nAs Figure 3 illustrates, the delinquency rates (specifically, the share of loans 90 or more days past due or nonaccruing) on junior liens and home equity lines are rising quite rapidly. One should note that most banks were not lending to so-called subprime borrowers, but nonetheless, the delinquency rate on one-to-four family mortgages just surpassed the levels seen in the early 1990s7.\nAs noted earlier, the rapid rise in delinquencies for home equity lines and junior liens held at banks is occurring despite an unemployment rate of about 5 percent - so, should the unemployment rate rise and housing prices continue to fall, financial stresses caused by the housing correction could well spread beyond the large banks involved in complex securitizations, and the smaller banks with sizeable portfolios of construction loans, to a larger set of financial institutions. Not surprisingly, in regions where housing prices are falling and delinquencies are rising, we are seeing that banks are beginning to reduce the lines of credit available to borrowers.\nA second potential problem for banks is that other types of consumer debt can suffer \"collateral damage\" from the difficulties in the housing sector. Regions that have experienced falling house prices over the past year are also areas that are seeing some of the larger increases in delinquencies on consumer loans. Banks with significant consumer loan exposures are observing that consumer delinquencies are becoming elevated in regions most affected by housing problems.\nTo date, credit problems have been focused on large financial institutions, many of whom have shown the capacity to raise new capital. However, should the challenges in housing continue, problems could expand beyond securitized assets to have an impact on the nonsecuritized assets held by smaller banking institutions. It is possible that these institutions may not be able to tap additional capital quite as easily as larger institutions, and if so they may be forced to constrain other lending to address any losses. So I leave you with the cautionary note that while small and medium sized businesses have not generally experienced significant problems with credit availability to date, further deterioration in housing markets, if it occurs, could carry over and begin to impact lenders who serve such borrowers.\nII. Length and Duration of Housing Downturns, and Other Recent Research from the Boston Fed\nNew England is no stranger to falling asset values. As you no doubt know, during the early 1990s, New England experienced a steep decline in housing prices. We at the Boston Fed think it may be useful to compare that experience to what we have experienced to date with falling housing prices, and we are pursuing a number of research avenues to do that.\nA new research paper by Foote, Gerardi, Goette and Willen is one example8. The authors have, among other things, done extensive data analysis that allows us to compare the current situation to that earlier episode, using publicly available data from the Massachusetts Registry of Deeds compiled into a database by the Warren Group. I will say more about our researchers' findings in a moment.\nSeparately, we are launching today an interactive mapping feature for our website that tracks the rise in foreclosures and subprime activity, then and now. The next few slides will give you a rough sense of how it displays data -- although the site itself will show the year-by-year progressions, dynamically, and I am going to just show you static shots of given years for our purposes here today.\nAs you can see in Figures 4 and 5, Massachusetts moved quite rapidly from a situation of relatively limited foreclosures in 1990 to a period of very high foreclosures in 1992. The timing is interesting. By late 1989, Massachusetts house prices had begun to fall, but delinquencies and foreclosures did not really accelerate until there was also a significant weakening of the economy. In fact, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts, which had declined to 3.1 percent in late 1987, peaked at 9.1 percent in the second half of 1991. Declining housing prices alone did not cause very elevated foreclosures; it was significantly compounded by an economic shock such as the loss of a job which disrupted the ability of many borrowers to make payments. As house prices fell, many homeowners who lost their jobs in the early-1990s recession could not sell their homes to pay off their mortgages because they owed more than their homes were worth. For unemployed homeowners with \"negative equity,\" foreclosure was often the only option.\nThe more recent period also points to the importance of falling house prices and negative equity in foreclosures. In the more recent period (shown in Figures 6 and 7), the foreclosure rate - which was not particularly elevated in 2005 - had become quite elevated by 2007 as house prices softened. This increase in foreclosures occurred even though the Massachusetts unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent for the year.\nWhy are foreclosures so high today, given that the economic situation is so much better than it was during the early 1990s? Even in expansions, many homeowners undergo adverse life events - like a job loss, a divorce, a spike in medical expenses, or the like - that disrupt their ability to make mortgage payments. Of course, with regard to unemployment, such household-level disruptions are not as prevalent in expansions as they are in recessions. But when such a life event does occur, it can still precipitate a foreclosure if the homeowner has negative equity because of a fall in house prices.\nAnother reason for elevated foreclosures today concerns changes in the susceptibility of mortgages to economic shocks. In the late 1980s, many borrowers had made significant down payments and had good credit histories. But the recent ability of borrowers with weak credit histories and little or no down payments to purchase homes, often with subprime loans (and sometimes with minimal income verification), means that a greater share of today's mortgages are a good bit more susceptible to the types of disruptive life events that precipitate foreclosure. These borrowers were fine when housing prices were rising because if needed, they had the ability to refinance or sell their homes and pay off (or more than pay off) their mortgages. In contrast, in the current environment of falling housing prices, borrowers who made small down-payments or have otherwise risky mortgages are now more likely to end up in foreclosure if they experience an adverse event that interrupts their ability to make mortgage payments.\nSo, in short, we have seen similar foreclosure numbers this time around without a technical recession, and with a more modest fall in home prices. Boston Fed researchers attribute that to the prevalence of riskier loans and higher combined loan-to-value ratios in general.\nFigures 8 and 9 provide some background on the foreclosure experience by house type. Several interesting patterns are apparent. In the early 1990s, foreclosures rose rapidly for all types of homes as the economy deteriorated. While foreclosures peaked in 1992, they remained quite elevated through much of the decade, despite the eventual rebounding of the economy. In addition, that period's speculative fervor in New England real estate markets had a particularly large impact on the condo market, where a disproportionate share of the foreclosures occurred.\nToday, problems appear most pronounced in the multifamily market. The two- and three-family houses that are prevalent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in Massachusetts have experienced very elevated foreclosure rates. Specifically, multi-family units accounted for 28.4 percent of the foreclosures in 2006-2007, but have constituted only 10.8 percent of residential purchases since 19909 (Figure 9).\nThe impact on particular communities can be seen in Figure 10,10 which shows foreclosure petitions by property type in given cities and towns in Massachusetts. In Boston, 47 percent of foreclosure petitions between January and August 2007 were multi-family properties. Many of the cities with high concentrations of low- and moderate-income borrowers have also seen particularly high rates of foreclosure petitions11 on multi-family properties. Our researchers suggest that one explanation for the higher foreclosure rate on multi-family properties is found in higher combined loan to value (CLTV) ratios, which make them more vulnerable when prices are falling.12\nStates like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have a much larger concentration of multi-family homes than do many other regions of the country13. Streets with a large concentration of foreclosures in major New England cities frequently are dominated by multi-family units. Recently both Boston and Chelsea have begun programs to purchase foreclosed multi-family units, to try to prevent these properties from becoming vacant and slipping into disrepair, which would bring broader collateral problems for the affected neighborhoods.\nBecause many of these properties are investor owned - or the current owner occupies one of the units and has limited financial means to deploy should the property require major capital improvements - programs focused on owner-occupied single-family properties will not address these problems. One area that will need focus going forward involves strategies to prevent streets of foreclosed multi-unit properties from leading to broader sections of urban decay.\nSeveral lessons from the historical comparison can be highlighted. First, should the economy worsen and suffer a period of significant job losses, the housing problem could become much more severe. Second, past episodes of elevated foreclosures lingered well after the peak in foreclosures had passed, indicating that the duration of today's situation may be longer than some are anticipating. Third, because the current problems have been concentrated in vulnerable low- and moderate-income areas with a prevalence of multi-unit properties, such multi-unit properties will be a more important public policy issue in the current situation.\nIII. Issues Complicating the Resolution of Housing Problems\nAs I have noted, a major change in the U.S. housing sector in recent years has been the emergence of the ability to buy homes with little or no down payment and the increased prevalence of such purchases. Many of these purchases are structured with a first loan that covers 80 percent of the value of the house and a second loan, sometimes called a \"piggyback\" loan, which is taken out at the same time as the first. The piggyback loan tends to be at a higher interest rate reflecting the greater risk of the loan, but the interest is tax deductible and allows the borrower to avoid purchasing private mortgage insurance (which lenders require if the borrower is paying less than 20 percent in down payment).\nAs can be seen in Figure 11, until recently, an increasing percentage of homes were being financed with these piggyback loans. In Massachusetts, piggyback loans were used with 26 percent of subprime mortgages in the second quarter of 2003 but that percentage increased to 65 percent of subprime mortgages in the third quarter of 2005. Piggyback loans were about twice as prevalent for subprime borrowers as prime borrowers, and were particularly prevalent in multi-family purchases. In fact, 75 percent of subprime multi-family purchases in the third quarter of 2005 involved a piggyback loan.\nAt the time of purchase, subprime borrowers frequently used the same lender to acquire both the first loan and the piggyback loan. The complicating factor is that these loans were frequently then securitized, with the first mortgage and the piggyback loan often sold into separate portfolios of loans to be securitized. Thus, even while piggyback loans were becoming more abundant, many mortgage-backed securities contained no piggyback loans, implying that the borrower's loans were frequently packaged in separate securitizations.\nThe combination of piggyback loans, securitization, and legal complexities makes it much more difficult to modify loans, particularly if the first and second mortgages have been packaged into separate securitizations. Dealing with two different lenders or servicers, as well as different securitizations, can significantly complicate efforts to restructure loans. Also, loan servicing agreements are not identical and indeed include a variety of forms of authorization (of the servicer) to modify loans. Frequently the only leverage the owner of the piggyback loan can and does exercise with a distressed borrower is demanding compensation should the borrower seek to modify both loans.\nIn short, while a variety of programs and policies are being considered in order to improve the loan modification process for distressed borrowers and their lenders, a key consideration involves figuring out how to modify loans when the interests of the primary loan holder may be different than those of the holder of the piggyback loan.\nA second complication involves targeting the modifications to the homeowners who really need them. We have seen that falling house prices tend to raise foreclosures by causing a negative equity situation which limits homeowners' options (e.g., to refinance or sell and pay off the loan) if their financial situation deteriorates.\nThe rising share of homeowners with negative equity in their house - meaning their home is now worth less than their loan(s) - might seem to suggest a large group for whom loan modifications would be a \"slam dunk.\" Principal write-downs to bring \"underwater\" mortgages above water may well be the appropriate solution for some troubled borrowers14, but lenders and loan servicers continue to be reluctant to provide modifications in a wholesale manner. Negative equity does not imply foreclosure with certainty - in fact, most people with negative equity situations continue to make their mortgage payments. Lenders and loan servicers who are aware of this fact may be reluctant to offer a modification if they believe that the homeowner has the capacity to continue making payments, no matter the hardship.\nTo \"unpack\" this a bit, I want to spend a moment looking at the history of negative-equity borrowers over the past two decades, drawing on a new working paper just produced by Boston Fed researchers15.\nIn the late 1980s, house-price declines in New England meant a large number of borrowers had negative equity in their house. The Registry of Deeds data allow us to study the historical relationship between negative equity and foreclosures for a limited set of borrowers - specifically, people who purchased homes in Massachusetts on or after January 1987, when the Warren Group data begin. Using these data to calculate a rough proxy for housing equity, Foote, Gerardi and Willen calculate that 100,288 of these post-1987 purchasers, or 36 percent, were in a position of negative equity as of the fourth quarter of 1991 (a high fraction because January 1987 came just before the peak of the housing cycle).16 Yet of this negative-equity group, only 6,453 (or just 6.4 percent) defaulted on their mortgages within the following three years.\nWhat about today? Using the same rough method to approximate home equity for the same subset of homeowners, the data imply that about 10 percent of post-1987 purchasers were in a position of negative equity as of the fourth quarter of 2007. Assuming that the unemployment rate and benchmark interest rate (the 6-month London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR) stay at their fourth-quarter 2007 levels, the statistical default model of Gerardi, Shapiro and Willen predicts that less than 10 percent of these homeowners with negative equity will default.\nContinued declines in house prices, higher unemployment, and possibly a greater willingness to default on home mortgages might raise this estimate of future defaults. Even so, many lenders will not be inclined to make concessions unless borrowers clearly lack the ability to pay. This is one reason that workouts or distressed borrowers' mortgages continue to proceed loan by loan, rather than through wholesale changes in mortgage terms. Lenders want borrowers with the capacity to pay to continue to uphold their legal obligation to do so - and any wholesale change in mortgage terms could benefit borrowers that are still able to fulfill the original agreement. To avoid this problem, some policy proposals17 maintain the legal obligation for the full loan for the borrower, but involve significantly reduced payments in return for the lender sharing in any future appreciation of the house.\nAnother impediment to restructuring loans that have been packaged into securitizations involves the legal restrictions imposed on many securitization agreements18. These agreements allow the servicer to pass through payments by borrowers without incurring any tax liability, as long as certain conditions are met. One of the conditions is usually that modifications cannot be made to the loans unless the loan is either in default or default is reasonably foreseeable. This determination is generally made loan by loan, with wholesale modifications being interpreted by some servicers as possibly violating the service agreement and the legal framework used in many securitizations and thus potentially imposing tax liability.\nDespite some promising proposals, these factors - the presence of piggyback loans, the desire of lenders to continue to get paid unless the borrower does not have the capacity to make payments, and the legal restrictions and tax-liability concerns surrounding securitization agreements - make any across-the-board modification of loan terms challenging.\nAs long as loan modifications are taking place on a loan-by-loan basis (a time-consuming and labor-intensive process), to significantly increase the number of loan modifications and avoid significant numbers of foreclosures, many servicers will need to quickly expand the pool of staff capable of making these evaluations.\nIV. Implications for Policymakers\nTo reiterate, falling housing prices continue to be a significant source of down-side risk to the economy. Previous periods of real estate problems have taken significant time to be worked out, with foreclosures remaining elevated well after their peak. The current foreclosure problem has been exacerbated by the difficulties related to many of the problem loans being held in securities.\nTo help mitigate the current situation it is important for servicers to have the capacity and the incentive to make loan modifications where appropriate. A challenge continues to arise around getting borrowers and servicers together to determine if loan modifications are appropriate.\nIn addition, it is clear that servicers were not set up for the spate of elevated foreclosures we have already experienced, and further increases in foreclosures would certainly test the capacity of servicers to have sufficient staff with the expertise to make loan modification determinations. Nonetheless, I am hopeful that the many mortgage forums that are being organized around the country to try to get servicers and borrowers together to work with problem loans will help some borrowers.\nThe large number of multi-family dwellings entering foreclosure presents a serious challenge to cities. Already there are streets in some cities with a high concentration of foreclosed multi-family properties, putting at risk many of the socioeconomic advances made in the last decade in some of these neighborhoods. Cities, working together and with community organizations and state officials,19 will need to find ways to make sure these low- and moderate-income neighborhoods do not regress as a result of the current wave of foreclosures. One promising tactic is rigorous municipal-code enforcement that ensures foreclosed properties are maintained. Furthermore, servicers must have a process for maintaining foreclosed properties and they must do more to ensure that these properties do not remain vacant for long periods of time.\nFinally, the legal structure for securitizations and mortgage-servicing agreements clearly did not foresee the widespread emergence of distressed borrowers, delinquencies, and foreclosures that are being experienced. Changes to servicing agreements and securitization structures that allow more flexibility during times of duress and also address servicers' liability concerns are necessary. Since different investors in a mortgage-backed security have different incentives, more clearly defining the governance of these securities would make it easier during difficult times to make modifications that are in the borrower's, servicer's, and investor's interests.\nThe extent of eventual housing problems is highly dependent on the outlook for the economy and the future path of housing prices. Fortunately, aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions have been taken to help mitigate some of the downside risk. These policies will likely result in some pick up in economic activity in the second half of this year, which should help to stabilize the housing market.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Conference on New Challenges for Operational Risk Measurement and Management Boston, Massachusetts\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you to this conference on operational risk, and to offer my thoughts on the lessons for risk management that we can glean from recent financial turmoil.1 I would like to thank all of you for attending, and the speakers and organizers for their efforts. Like all of you, I am looking forward to the conference and the opportunity for us, together, to take a fresh look at risk management and risk modeling in light of recent events.\nThe practices of risk management in general, and operational risk management in particular, have made great strides in the past several years - progress that has been stimulated, in part, by the Basel II process. In the past several years risk management information systems have improved significantly, the collection of data related to risk has become more comprehensive, and the analysis of risk and the determination of appropriate capital has become more sophisticated. In addition, within institutions senior management and boards of directors have become more attuned to their responsibilities in understanding the risks facing their organizations and ensuring they have appropriate capital.\nDespite these significant and important gains, there are clearly lessons to learn from the performance of contemporary risk management practices during the period of financial turmoil that began in late July.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1- which shows the spread between the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate - the reluctance of banks to lend to each other has been quite elevated since July 2007. A combination of balance sheet constraints2, poor transparency regarding potential losses3, and heightened counterparty-risk concerns has contributed to less liquid financial markets and highlighted the fact that, in retrospect, even improved scenario analysis and stress tests did not fully capture the potential for events like those that have occurred over the past nine months.\nAs the chart showing the LIBOR/OIS spread indicates, there have been ebbs and flows in the recent turmoil. I would suggest that the path of the chart's line reflects the three phases of recent turmoil - beginning with a focus on liquidity risk, moving to increased concern over credit risk, and now seemingly evolving into concern over economic risks.\nIndeed, initially the widening spread seemed to indicate serious liquidity problems. Problems in the subprime4 mortgage market and with securitization and structured products came to light in the summer of 2007. These problems resulted in illiquidity for a variety of financial instruments that market participants had assumed had relatively low risk and were highly liquid.\nAs the financial turmoil continued, the primary concern moved from illiquid financial instruments to concerns about credit risk and likely asset write-downs. Starting at the end of 2007 and continuing through the first quarter of 2008, a variety of financial institutions announced very significant write-downs, and many also announced that they needed to raise additional capital.\nAs we move to a third phase, the focus has shifted to concerns about the economic risks - the risks generated by an economy that has slowed noticeably. While much of the turmoil in financial markets occurred during relatively benign macroeconomic conditions, the economic situation has changed. We have seen job losses, persistent increases in food and energy prices, and falling asset prices - all increasing the risk that less benign economic circumstances will add to the already intense challenges faced by financial institutions this year.\nWith that context, it is useful and important to consider the lessons we can learn regarding risk management and risk modeling in light of recent events. Today I am going to discuss three areas that are important for risk management generally, but also have clear applications to operational risk.\nI will cover each of these areas in a bit more detail in a moment. First, however, I want to note that despite a number of lessons from the recent financial turmoil, we should not despair, nor should we see investments in risk management as wasted. Indeed, had the discipline not advanced as far as it has, I believe the recent financial turmoil would be much more damaging.\nAnd as a result of our models and improved risk management, with some nudges from bank supervisors, the capital position of banks in the aggregate remain quite healthy (See Figure 2). The willingness and ability of many financial firms to raise additional capital, despite the financial turmoil, highlights the fact that outside investors have confidence in the long-run strength of these financial institutions and their ability to appropriately manage risk going forward. Already I am hearing about improvements in risk management stemming from the current problems, and by building on these lessons we can be better prepared for future challenges.\nI. The Role of Liquidity\nUnderlying many risk models was the assumption of highly liquid markets. In a variety of markets, assets that were viewed as relatively safe and liquid in July 2007 are now thinly traded - and, when they do trade, do so at surprisingly deep discounts. In particular, there have been very steep discounts for triple-A tranches of asset-backed securities. Not only have prices dropped as investors have become less certain of the likely default experience of these highly rated securities, but prices also include a significant liquidity premium as investors are avoiding assets they now view as difficult to value. These discounts seem particularly large given the plausible estimates of potential losses for these assets - in particular if the economy improves in the second half of this year, as many private forecasters anticipate.6\nRecent experience highlights the fact that effective credit risk management requires a robust evaluation of exposure to possible liquidity strains during times of stress. Experience also highlights the issues that come with being overly reliant on credit ratings as a surrogate for rigorous credit evaluation. Firms that have significant investments in structured securities may need to consider whether their so-called \"Pillar II\" capital7 allocation is adequate to capture some of the liquidity and model risk that has recently shown its importance.\nHowever, traditional credit evaluation is not the only place where liquidity assumptions were imbedded, and somewhat problematic. Many firms held funds that they needed for short-term liquidity in auction-rate securities8 and in structured-product investments. As these complex instruments have become less liquid, many firms have been caught in a cash squeeze. (See Figure 3) Even some sophisticated hedge-fund investors were often too comfortable keeping short-term, liquid funds in complex instruments that encountered difficulties once the financial market turmoil emerged, leading to strains on liquidity. Many of these investors have re-evaluated their holdings, preferring to reduce risk (and return) in funds held for short-term liquidity purposes, and to focus their risk-taking within longer-term portfolios.\nLiquidity can also be an issue in operational risk management - the severity of operational losses can be impacted by liquidity assumptions. Backroom problems can occur during periods of stress. Particularly as firms have become more dependent on using credit-default swaps and tailored derivatives to hedge risk, imperfectly placed hedges (for example a hedge that was faulty due to model error) and processing problems that can occur during stressful times can generate outsized risks.\nThe most recent example of liquidity impacting the severity of operational losses is the illiquidity created by the need to quickly unwind positions generated by rogue traders. Having large unwanted positions that have declined in value can create significant problems for the institution. Such a firm has few appealing options, in that widespread knowledge of the loss can make it quite costly to unwind the position - but at the same time, failure to quickly reveal the loss can create legal entanglements as interested parties seek legal remedies for the concealment of material information. Many of the large rogue-trading losses occurred during periods when trading positions have declined, and where illiquidity made the unwinding of positions potentially costly.\nII. Estimating Risk Models with Limited Data\nEvaluating the risk of new products, or products undergoing significant change, is a particular challenge for risk managers. The subprime mortgage market is a good case in point, as subprime mortgages have undergone significant changes over the past five years. Traditionally, mortgage loans to \"less-than-prime\" borrowers were made through government programs such as FHA, or in an environment where prime loans were experiencing difficulties. But over the past five years there was a significant change. The advent of securitization and the ability to originate to distribute had a dramatic impact on this market. (See Figure 4)\nThe growth in this market benefited from the history of low default rates on home mortgages in general. It was often noted that home prices had not fallen nationally since the 1930s, that real estate cycles had not been correlated in different regions of the country, and that homeowners would go to great lengths to avoid foreclosure on the \"roof over their heads.\"\nHowever, the originate-to-distribute model for subprime lending changed many aspects of these underlying assumptions. The ability of borrowers to purchase homes with little or no capital greatly expanded the pool of potential borrowers - which, coupled with rising prices, resulted in positive homeownership experiences for so-called \"subprime borrowers\" in the first half of this decade.\nAs regional real estate markets have become more integrated and their prices more correlated, home price declines have been national, not just regional. While there are certainly some important regional differences, all ten of the metropolitan areas tracked in the Case-Shiller index have seen a fall in home prices (See Figure 5).\nThe generally accepted approaches to modeling subprime mortgage default probabilities frequently did not capture how the economics of subprime lending had changed. For example, models estimated only on the experience of the first half of this decade - the period for which data on securitized, originate-to-distribute, subprime loans were available - did not include significant downturns, did not have falling home prices, and did not have the increased correlation of regional home prices. The result is that both the ratings and the capital needed to hold mortgage securities underestimated the risk.\nOf course, the challenges of new products and short historical time series are quite familiar to operational risk practitioners.9 Product innovation can make historical data less useful for understanding future risks. Operational risk modeling has been plagued by the short period of time that most institutions have collected comprehensive internal data. However, even in this short period of data collection, it is striking how many billion- dollar operational loss experiences have occurred.\nThe bulk of these billion-dollar losses reflect rogue trading and large legal settlements. Many institutions have viewed losses of this magnitude as \"once in a thousand years\" events, or not applicable to their own modeling - for example, because of their institution's small size relative to the institutions experiencing those magnitude events (a logic that causes some risk managers at smaller institutions to truncate the potential for losses, perhaps incorrectly). As we get more data, however, it is becoming clear that such losses at financial institutions are more common than was initially thought. Clearly, discounting or artificially constraining such losses can risk leaving institutions with inadequate capital relative to their risks.\nThe example of subprime mortgages has relevance for operational risk as well as credit risk. The originate-to-distribute model resulted in the loan originator frequently having little interest in sufficiently screening borrowers. In fact, the desire to maintain volumes appears to have caused some originators to engage in fraudulent actions to qualify borrowers. In addition, lawsuits related to subprime loans have emerged, with concerns raised on fraudulent transactions, inadequate disclosure of emerging problems to investors, and selling inappropriate products to borrowers. While the likelihood of success for these lawsuits is uncertain, the relevant lesson for risk management involves fully considering all the potential operational risks with new products, or with new delivery mechanisms for existing products.\nOf note are the decisions that some financial institutions made in regard to subprime mortgages. Many large institutions chose not to participate in the subprime market. Conversations with some of these institutions about such decisions indicate that concerns regarding reputational risk and potential lawsuits - rather than credit concerns - seem to have played an important role. Other institutions chose to participate, but limited the products they offered, limited the originators with whom they would do business, or implemented other risk controls to limit exposure to inappropriately underwritten loans. In many respects, these decisions reflect a heightened awareness by senior management and boards of directors regarding operational risks.\nIt is noteworthy that some of the most poorly underwritten loans that resulted in early payment defaults were made by the sorts of independent, non-depository lenders that operated largely outside of formal regulatory oversight. For those institutions whose risk management approach did not sufficiently consider the operational risks related to these products, the lessons have already been costly, and potentially large legal risks remain from those decisions.\nThis difference in bank behavior towards subprime mortgages is noteworthy. While it is difficult to prove, firms that were better versed in operational risk may have been more careful in considering all the risks inherent in entering this market. Because subprime loans grew rapidly and were quite profitable for a number of years, it took significant discipline to decide to forego some aspects of the business.\nIII. The Role of Scenarios and Stress Tests in Evaluating Risk\nParticularly given the limited data, many banks have significantly increased their use of scenarios analysis and stress tests. While this is a very important and promising development, we must recognize that we are at the early stages of using these tools. Many institutions did conduct stress tests of what would happen if housing prices fell. Most of these stress tests noted the institution's limited amount of direct exposure to residential mortgages and construction loans. Others noted that while they held mortgage-backed securities, they held only the triple-A tranches of these securitizations.\nMuch of the modeling was a somewhat more sophisticated migration analysis of direct exposures. However, none of the major stress tests that I am aware of - done by a variety of financial institutions - came close to capturing the depth of the problems that we are experiencing today.\nWhat was missing was economic and financial analysis that would result in an accurate stress scenario:\nWith so many such linkages missed, and with undue confidence that the scenario was quite unlikely because national housing prices had not declined significantly in the post- war period, some managers took too much comfort.\nOperational risk management has increasingly used scenarios to understand the ways in which large losses can occur at a firm. However, as in the subprime example, scenarios that are to accurately reflect risk require a willingness to think expansively about linkages, and cannot be artificially constrained by a desire to minimize capital.\nIdeally, scenarios that suggest a need for greater capital should guide the firm in considering whether it needs new controls, or whether it is able in some other way to reduce the \"tail risk\" (i.e., low probability but high impact) associated with an activity. However, the scenarios used by firms are often capped or truncated in order to avoid incurring a large capital charge, or are assumed to have already been sufficiently mitigated even though they have occurred, sometimes frequently, at competing firms.\nPerhaps the biggest challenge arises in capturing legal risk. Most of the largest operational losses have been legal losses (See Figure 6). Frequently a firm is quite careful about discussing pending litigation for fear that it might provide information to the litigant. In addition, the probability of litigation and the possibility of severe impact should a case be lost or settled remain a \"blind spot\" in risk analysis.\nI am hopeful that in the coming years firms will be able to improve models of potential litigation losses. With the experience of accounting and market-timing scandals earlier in the decade, and the litigation likely to stem from the subprime mortgage crisis, firms should have a wealth of data to see if past scenarios captured this risk, whether that risk was elevated to appropriate levels, and whether sufficient actions were taken.\nEven with improvements in scenario analysis, there will be significant judgment involved in the exercise. As behavioral economics has highlighted, it can be very difficult to elicit accurate qualitative information from managers. Generating scenario data that are predictive (that is, forward looking) requires calculated rigor. Thus, it seems prudent to approach such analysis with a degree of humility. We should recognize the limits to our ability to capture the many interactions among actors and assets in our formal approaches, and thus introduce a sufficient degree of conservatism in estimating the potential losses highlighted in the scenarios.\nConclusion\nThe recent financial turmoil has highlighted both the benefits and the challenges associated with pursuing risk management. Clearly, firms that minimized capital estimates and did little analysis surrounding the credit, market, and operational risk associated with subprime securitizations have suffered.\nIt is not in the long-run interest of a bank to underestimate the capital associated with significant activities. Such an underestimation results in an over-willingness to continue to expand in risky areas and - should those risks come to fruition - risks the firm needing additional capital, being acquired, or in the extreme failing.\nEarlier in this decade I asked a risk manager whose firm had just experienced a very significant operational loss how that had influenced the firm's risk management and risk modeling. The answer I received was that it was a once in a thousand years event; so, while they had instituted some additional controls, it did little to change their need to allocate capital for that activity. The next year they had an even larger operational loss in a related area. While it is certainly possible to have two unlikely events in successive years, the probability is relatively remote. Organizations that too willingly ignore the unfortunate events that they or their competitors have experienced only increase the probability that such mistakes will be repeated.\nWhile there have been great strides in risk management practices, risk managers need to be continually pushing their firms to think creatively and expansively about potential risks. The lessons from the recent financial turmoil have probably provided more examples than we would have liked. Nonetheless, I am confident that continued, diligent improvement in risk management and risk modeling will make financial institutions and financial markets even safer and more resilient in the future.",

            "content": "The Changing Business of Banking, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's 2008 Credit Markets Symposium, Charlotte, North Carolina\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today. I want to thank the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank and President Lacker for inviting me to speak on an issue that central bankers have been spending significant time thinking about since last July - liquidity and systemic risk. 1\nPresident Lacker and I are seated next to each other at each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and since the August FOMC meeting our introductory ritual has been to compare notes on the latest anomaly occurring in financial markets, and the newest acronym or product-name to come to the fore, as formerly niche areas of the financial markets get their 15 minutes of either fame or infamy. From CDOs and SIVs to auction rate securities and conduits, they clearly have a big impact on the cost and availability of funds for consumers, businesses and governmental entities.\nToday I am going to focus on the role of signaling - and specifically, reluctance to provide a signal that might indicate weakness - which seems to have played a significant role in the behavior of many financial market participants of late. I'll also say a bit about ways the Federal Reserve has tried to help address the problem, and share some of my own views on what the Fed's role can and should be in the future, informed by my background in both economic research and bank supervision.\nIf I were to select a light-hearted title for my remarks, it might be \"Fear and Loathing on Wall Street.\" The basic premise is that as firms have become increasingly concerned about the valuation (pricing) of certain assets, their ability to accurately assess counterparty risk and the liquidity position of counterparties has become clouded. The lack of transparency in the prices of underlying assets, and the significant losses of some financial firms whose deteriorating situation had not been evident in earlier financial statements, have together made investors skittish. As a result, financial firms are increasingly willing to pass up the use of other attractive financing opportunities if they believe that action might lead to speculation about the liquidity or financial strength of their firm.\nWhile such skittishness is not unusual during periods of illiquidity, it is unusual for a period of illiquidity to last this long.\nI would like to provide a simple, non-financial example of the problems associated with signaling, and then proceed to describe some ways that these signaling issues can complicate decisions related to short-run borrowing from the Federal Reserve, and affect credit markets more generally..\nLet me say at the outset that concerns about signaling, stigma, and market information are one reason why the Federal Reserve can play, should play, and has played a significant role as a liquidity provider. Unlike private market participants, the Federal Reserve has no incentive to profit from knowledge of a counterparty's situation, making it a preferred counterparty during times of financial turmoil.\nA Brief, Non-Financial Example\nI am going to begin with a simple example of signaling that is personal, and unrelated to financial markets. I have always been an avid tennis player - although \"avid,\" unfortunately, does not necessarily translate to \"accomplished.\" I have had the good fortune to pass my enthusiasm for the game on to my son.\nAs he moved to adolescence it was clear that his game had surpassed mine in every dimension. Yet, his success was hampered by a simple signaling mechanism. When something in my play created a particular difficulty for him, he highlighted the difficulty by throwing his racquet. Fortunately, today's tennis racquets are made from alloys that help the Space Shuttle re-enter the atmosphere.\nIt does not take a very wily tennis competitor to realize that the optimal strategy is to repeat the same circumstances which frustrated or trumped the opponent - a tactic that resulted in an even more impressive trajectory for the racquet. Like my ability to surmise and exploit my son's primitive signaling mechanism, financial market participants are highly sensitive to signals offered by their competitors. And no financial institution wants to do the equivalent of signaling a vulnerability by throwing their racquet - particularly with far more at stake than a family tennis match.\nDiscount Window Signaling\nSimilarly, firms' concerns about signaling have hampered the ability of the Federal Reserve to encourage borrowing from the Discount Window during times of stress. A particularly interesting example of this occurred last week with the latest auction conducted under the auspices of the Federal Reserve's new Term Auction Facility (TAF).\nThe results of the latest TAF auction are shown on Figure 1. Allow me to provide a bit of background.\nThe TAF is an alternative to a Discount Window loan. Both result in a loan from the Federal Reserve to a financial institution, collateralized by assets that the borrowing institution has pledged to the Federal Reserve. However, with the addition of the TAF, financial institutions have two ways to borrow from the Discount Window. They can borrow using a traditional Discount Window loan, which is a loan at the primary credit rate - traditionally overnight but now up to 90 days term.2\nCurrently the primary credit rate is 25 basis points over the Federal Funds rate, or a rate of 2.5 percent. Alternatively, they can borrow for 28 days by participating in the Term Auction Facility, where the bidder is free to bid for funds at any rate above the minimum required for the auction (2.11 percent in the latest auction), and all those bids that are above the stop-out rate get the stop-out rate for the loan.\nAs can be seen in the graph, last week the stop-out rate was 2.82 percent, significantly higher than the primary credit rate of 2.5 percent. Such a bid could be explained if market participants believed it was likely that market rates would rise over the 28 day term, but evidence from trading in Federal Funds futures and in overnight index swaps indicate the opposite - that market participants believe it is far more likely that the Federal Funds rate will fall from its current target. Similarly, the TAF stop-out rate exceeds the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), the rate at which banks can borrow one month unsecured money in London.\nSo how can this seeming anomaly be explained?.\nFirst, the Federal Reserve does not trade for profits in the markets, so the firms can bid in the auctions without fearing that their bids imply any immediate signaling of potential balance-sheet constraints or liquidity problems to the counterparty, the Federal Reserve. As a result, firms may be willing to pay a premium for transacting with the Federal Reserve in order to avoid any immediate public signaling, and to avoid taking actions that could potentially be construed as signaling the existence of problems.\nSecond, firms may want to be sure that they have some term funding, and by placing bids well above the primary credit rate they are in effect offering the equivalent of a non-competitive bid in a Treasury auction. They are willing to purchase the use of the term funds at whatever the current market clearing price is in the auction, even if there are less-costly options at the Discount Window or with private parties..\nThird, the winners of TAF auctions are not disclosed by the Federal Reserve. Of course, neither are institutions that take out Discount Window loans disclosed by name. However, market participants may believe that the auction process, where a variety of banks are jointly acquiring funds, may be interpreted differently than an individual institution borrowing from the Discount Window.3\nSignaling and Short-Term Debt\nThe fact that banks are still choosing more costly financing options to avoid any potential signal of liquidity or balance-sheet constraints is very noteworthy - in that the financial turmoil that began in July of 2007 continues, even nine months after the onset of problems..\nFigure 2 shows short-term interest-rate spreads. As you can see, Libor had tracked closely with the Federal Funds rate target in the first half of 2007, but has been elevated since the onset of financial problems in late July 2007. This has occurred despite an overnight index swap rate that has been below the Federal Funds target since July, indicating a market perception that rates were likely to fall below the Federal Funds target. Since firms in such an environment should be able to borrow Federal Funds at the low rate, and lend funds at the elevated Libor rate, the puzzle is why these rates have become, you might say, \"unhinged.\".\nThe volume of term lending transactions has declined significantly, with few buyers or sellers of term funds. I can suggest several reasons.\nFirst, many potential suppliers of funds have become increasingly concerned about their capital position, causing them to look for opportunities to shrink (or slow the growth of) assets on their balance sheets, in order to maintain a desirable capital-to-assets ratio. Since unsecured inter-bank lending provides relatively low returns and has little benefit in terms of relationships, banks may prefer to use their balance sheet to fund higher-returning assets that advance long-term customer relationships..\nSecond, as the uncertainty over asset valuations has increased, banks have become reluctant to take on significant counterparty risk to financial institutions - particularly with those that have significant exposure to complex financial instruments.\nThird, many potential borrowers are reluctant to buy term funds at much higher rates than can be obtained overnight, for fear that they may signal to competitors that they have liquidity concerns. However, when the counterparty is a central bank, financial institutions have been quite willing to buy term funding, sometimes at rates higher than they would expect if they were to borrow funds overnight.\nThe various liquidity facilities being made available by central banks have helped improve liquidity, and borrowers are more willing to purchase term lending. However, the gyrations in the spread between Libor and the overnight index swap rate shown in Figure 3 demonstrate that we continue to have episodes where the spreads become large by historical standards. In addition, at times market participants have complained that few if any transactions occur at term Libor rates when uncertainty in the market increases.4\nWhile actions taken by central banks are improving the supply of term financing, eventually the confidence in private counterparties to comfortably buy or sell term funds needs to be restored. A key ingredient in this outcome is that counterparties are truly well capitalized and have a financing structure that does not make them susceptible to counterparty runs. Increased capital not only reduces solvency risk, but also reduces the need for liabilities that might flee during periods of financial difficulty.5\nUnlike the credit crunch in the early 1990s in the United States, many financial firms have raised significant capital. Unfortunately, while in many cases these equity issues have offset recent losses, they may leave little additional buffer should further credit losses occur. A number of large financial institutions have reduced their dividends, and given the potential for additional capital shortages it goes without saying that financial institutions should continue to assess whether further reductions or cessation of dividends would be advisable.\nIncreases in capital not only reduce solvency risk but also have salutary macroeconomic implications. Financial institutions that choose not to raise capital through new equity issues or reductions in dividends are likely to react to capital losses by shrinking their balance sheets. Where and how they choose to reduce credit can have macroeconomic implications, as the availability of credit can become a factor for some subsets of borrowers.\nWhile the most obvious loss of credit availability has been the unwillingness of many lenders to continue to lend for subprime mortgages, 6 other areas of the economy may also be impacted as lenders seek to shrink their balance sheets and lower their exposure to areas that may be adversely impacted by the current financial turmoil and a slowing economy.\nSo far the main effect of the financial turmoil has been concentrated in large financial institutions that may be able to attract additional investors (see Figure 4). These types of institutions tended to hold the complicated financial instruments that have been most affected by the financial turmoil. They have also seen their assets grow as they have needed to move some off-balance-sheet assets onto their balance sheet, had lines of credit and liquidity options drawn down, and have been unable to distribute loans that they had originated and expected to resell.\nSmaller banks have generally not held these complicated financial instruments, so they have been more insulated from the financial turmoil. 7 They also have not been liquidity providers for securities, so they have experienced less unexpected growth in their assets. As a result, there have been far fewer complaints from small and medium sized businesses - generally the clients of smaller banks - about credit availability.\nHowever, it is important to note that the continued health of small and medium sized banks will be impacted should residential and commercial real estate prices decline in a severe manner. While that is not my forecast, it is only fair to note that for the liquidity problems to be confined it is important for collateral values to stabilize. Significant price declines will likely lead to more residential and perhaps commercial mortgage defaults not necessarily limited to the subprime market, and thus more likely linked to mortgages held in portfolio by smaller banks.8\nConclusion\nThe extended period of illiquidity - in markets that, a year ago, would have been described by most as highly liquid and relatively low risk - highlights the importance of understanding liquidity risk, and understanding which asset-pricing and accounting assumptions rely on liquid markets. The ability to value complex financial instruments and the use of market-value accounting for financial statements are integrally tied to assumptions of liquid markets. In markets where few if any transactions occur, valuation difficulties can severely hamper the ability of key market participants to evaluate their counterparty risk and hence the functioning of markets.\nI believe this period of illiquid markets should also cause central banks to re-evaluate their roles. For a central bank to play an effective role during financial turmoil, it needs to understand the sources of liquidity problems, the interrelationships between market participants, likely losses, and market participants' potential reactions to these losses.9\nIn my view, this can only be done if the central bank has some form of hands-on supervisory experience with institutions - particularly the \"systemically important\" institutions - regardless of who is the primary regulator. The Federal Reserve has been far more effective during this crisis because it has hands-on experience with bank holding companies that are among the most significant players in many financial markets.\nIn short, there are significant synergies between bank supervision and monetary policy during periods of financial turmoil - synergies that can be used to achieve better outcomes for the public as policy makers try to determine the impact of liquidity problems and how changes in credit will impact the broader economy.10\nHaving some form of similarly hands-on supervisory experience with any systemically important financial institution that may need to access the Discount Window is, in the long term, critically important. We need to understand the solvency and liquidity positions of firms that may access the Discount Window - with access, at the very least, to the information any counterparty would require in a lending relationship. For those financial institutions that do have access to the Discount Window, there is indeed a need for the Fed to have broader access to information than marketplace counterparty creditors, if we are to effectively manage our responsibilities as lender of last resort and custodian of financial stability. So, regardless of who is the primary regulator, it is important for the Fed to understand the consolidated capital and liquidity positions of such firms.\nIn sum, I believe that as we consider these and other lessons learned from the current turmoil, we can take appropriate actions to reduce the likelihood that extended periods of illiquidity will occur in the future.",

            "content": "Bank of Korea and Bank for International Settlements Seminar Household Debt: Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Seoul, Korea\nI would like to thank the Bank of Korea and the Bank for International Settlements for sponsoring this conference on Household Debt: Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability, and for inviting me to participate as the keynote speaker 1. The planned sessions on mortgage finance, consumer credit, and securitization are all particularly topical and touch on areas that, especially since July of 2007, have been of keen interest at the Federal Reserve and at central banks throughout the world.\nToday I am going to focus my remarks on the key information necessary for central banks to make informed decisions during periods of financial turmoil. In particular, I am going to highlight the fact that non-public information about financial institutions has been extremely useful in understanding the current problems in U.S. financial markets, and in understanding how those problems might factor into monetary policy decisions and other policy matters.\nAt today's conference we have representatives from a diverse set of countries, and in those countries the responsibilities of the central bank in bank supervision vary considerably. The Federal Reserve has bank-supervisory responsibilities over bank holding companies as well as banks that choose both to have a state charter and to be members of the Federal Reserve. These supervisory responsibilities, I would argue, have been instrumental in dealing with the current episode of financial turbulence.\nIn many countries bank-supervisory roles continue to evolve, but whatever the institutional arrangements that prevail in your countries, I would argue that hands-on experience as a supervisor can be critically important to the central bank during times of stress and can significantly improve the ability of the central bank to choose appropriate monetary policy and address problems related to financial stability.\nTo make that argument, today I am going to discuss four areas where knowledge of confidential, non-public information about financial institutions has been important to central bankers. This is a topic that I investigated a number of years ago with co-authors Joe Peek and Geoff Tootell. Our research found that confidential bank supervisory information could be used to improve central bank forecasts of inflation, unemployment, and Gross Domestic Product. 2\nGiven the events that have occurred since financial turmoil emerged in July, I am now even more confident of the need for central banks to have the experience and perspective gained through bank supervision, although the institutional arrangements to facilitate those insights are likely to vary by country. For me, the information gleaned from the Federal Reserve's role as a hands-on bank supervisor has been particularly useful in thinking about appropriate monetary policy in the following four ways.\nFirst, understanding the size of and basis for likely losses has been useful in highlighting potential financial stability issues, as well as in determining where credit availability may become a problem. To be sure, the degree of exposure to loss that is embedded in complex financial instruments has been very difficult to ascertain - for banks' own managers, let alone bank supervisors - as many of the recent losses have involved complex and opaque financial instruments tied to the mortgage market. But that challenge notwithstanding, we know that the way that banks are likely to behave is linked to the size of their current and expected future losses; and as supervisors, with access to internal bank documents and interactions with bank management, we can estimate them.\nSecond, banks' balance-sheet constraints can transmit financial shocks to the real economy. Capital-constrained banks may be unable to provide loans or extend credit in markets where they are a key source of liquidity. For central bankers to gauge potential balance sheet constraints now and in the future requires a detailed understanding of a bank's financial position, capital management strategies, and likely management actions.\nThird, as problems spill over from mortgage loans to other types of credit, banks' actions can have a significant impact on macroeconomic growth. For example, reducing lines of credit on home-equity loans and on credit cards could have a significant impact on consumers and dampen economic growth.\nFourth, many of the recent proactive steps taken by the Federal Reserve relative to Discount Window lending are facilitated and informed by our role as a bank supervisor. These actions, taken as a lender of last resort, make the central bank a counterparty to banks - which requires an understanding of a bank's solvency and its liquidity risk.\nOverview: Banks and Financial Turmoil\nOne can find numerous examples of the critical role of banks in periods of financial turmoil. In the United States in the early 1990s, losses on commercial real estate and construction loans caused capital-constrained banks to contract their balance sheets. The result was that even companies with good business prospects found it difficult to secure adequate financing despite monetary policy's efforts to lower interest rates, causing the often-cited \"headwinds in monetary policy.\"\nAnd a sizable literature indicates that in Japan, problems in the banking sector played a significant role in the so-called \"lost decade.\" 3 Also, in the mid 1990s, many Asian countries found that their banking sector exacerbated problems that originated in real estate and foreign exchange markets. We see similar episodes in Europe as well.\nWhy do banks play such critical roles during periods of financial turmoil?\nFirst, their balance sheet structure tends to amplify the effect of economic shocks. Banks are highly leveraged and highly regulated. In order to maintain their capital ratios after experiencing a large capital shock, banks must significantly shrink assets on their balance sheets - in other words, not make or acquire loans - since their ability to raise capital at such times can be quite limited.\nSecond, while their role in financing business and residential investment has diminished in recent decades, banks remain the primary source of liquidity during periods of financial turmoil. Banks extend lines of credit, and these lines are most likely to be utilized when firms are experiencing financial difficulties. However, banks provide liquidity not only to firms, but also to finance an array of complex financial instruments. For example, in the U.S., banks have been providing liquidity to the commercial paper markets, to off-balance sheet financial vehicles (such as conduits, special investment vehicles or \"SIVs,\" and the like), and for municipal financing programs (for example through auction-rate securities).\nThird, banks are often the main source of financing to smaller firms, and are key market-makers in a variety of financial markets - one example is their role as dealers for municipal auction- rate securities. Should they choose to shrink their balance sheets, the shift can disrupt bank-dependent borrowing and markets where banks are key players.\nIn sum, understanding banks is critical to understanding how financial shocks can be transmitted to the real economy. Unfortunately, understanding how banks are likely to respond to problems requires far more than published financial statements. While U.S. banks report detailed information on their balance sheets and their income statements, these reports do not provide sufficient information to allow central banks to really discern how banks are responding to problems.\n1. Estimating Losses\nThe current financial turbulence, like most such episodes, has unexpected sources. In 2006, I met with the risk managers from a number of global banks. They highlighted at that time that they saw little risk emerging from the mortgage market. While they acknowledged the rapid acceleration in residential real estate prices, they emphasized that banks were extremely well capitalized and that their own internal \"stress tests\" indicated that 10 and even 20 percent declines in real estate prices would result in lower (but still positive) net income at their organizations - in other words would result in a loss of earnings, not capital, for their firms. Obviously, events have been more severe than that, and some of the largest financial institutions have found themselves needing to aggressively seek a new capital infusion.\nIt is worth highlighting that the banks' observations about being well capitalized were accurate. The attention that regulators have given to capital has caused banks in the United States to be much better capitalized going into these difficulties than they were in the 1990s (Figure 1). The introduction of the Basel I and Basel II capital accord frameworks, and of modern risk management techniques that focus on value-at-risk modeling, have caused banks to increase their capital. Current problems would clearly be worse had this not occurred. Similarly, bank supervisors viewed banks as being in good financial health, as indicated by the very low number of banks considered \"problem\" institutions by the FDIC 4 (Figure 2) - although there has been some additional deterioration recently.\nEven with the highly publicized financial turmoil that began in July, most banks remained profitable in 2007 (Figure 3). While there have been very significant losses announced by a few banks, to date the losses have been at large banks actively engaged in residential mortgage securitization. Both the number and share of banks reporting losses in 2007 are well below what was experienced during the early 1990s.\nSo how is it that the stress tests by large global banks did not indicate their susceptibility to falling housing prices in the United States? Most of these stress tests assumed that lower housing prices would cause elevated losses on construction loans and holdings of subprime 5 loans, but most of the large global banks did not have significant exposure in those areas.\nWhat these stress tests crucially failed to capture was the effect of house-price declines on the large holdings of highly rated securities that global banks held - the products of mortgage securitization activities, with their payment streams ultimately tied to the performance of subprime loans. In particular, they thought that housing prices nationwide were unlikely to fall, but that even if they did, they would only affect the high-risk slices or \"tranches\" of these securitized pools of mortgages - and the high-risk tranches were not generally held by U.S. banks. In fact, triple-A rated tranches continued to trade close to par when problems in subprime loans first became apparent in 2007 (Figure 4 - Markit ABX.HE indices 6).\nHowever, since the financial turmoil starting in July, the triple-A rated securities with payment streams derived from subprime loans have more recently been trading as low as 60 percent of par. Such values likely reflect a significant risk premium for holding mortgage-backed assets. The size of that risk premium is somewhat surprising, since the defaults on the underlying subprime assets would need to be quite severe to result in such large losses for these highest-rated and most-secure tranches - and investors would only take losses on these high-grade securities after all lower-graded securities had been wiped out.\nValuation has been made difficult by several factors - including uncertainty over the number of borrowers that may eventually default on their subprime mortgage loans as well as the liquidation value of foreclosed properties in the depressed residential real-estate market, and the large discounts that market participants have placed on complex financial assets tied to subprime loans. In addition, the deep discounts on highly rated securities have made investors skeptical of ratings as an indicator of default probabilities. With few trades happening - and many of those trades \"distress sales\" - the actual worth of many of these instruments is quite difficult to determine with confidence.\nHowever, knowing the nature of the exposure and knowing the possible pricing outcomes are both critical to estimating losses that could stem from these assets. Bank supervisors have the ability to get detailed information on the banks' exposures to these assets, their current pricing, and their possible future pricing. These insights are critical to understanding the size of likely losses to a financial institution, and management's likely responses to the losses (given an environment of falling housing prices, and the prevalence of underwriting problems with many subprime loans originated after 2004).\n2. The Importance of Balance Sheet Constraints\nHow banks manage their lending in the face of balance-sheet constraints can have significant macroeconomic effects. If banks are unwilling to lend in the subprime and jumbo markets because these loans are now difficult to securitize, the recovery of residential real estate may be impeded. If banks cut back on loans to businesses, business fixed investment and investment in commercial property may be impeded. If banks choose to reduce lines of credit to consumers, consumption may be impeded. These examples simply underline the fact that during a period of financial turmoil it is important for central bankers to understand the degree of balance sheet constraint, and how banks' management may choose to respond.\nAs Figure 5 illustrates, during the recent financial turmoil in the United States bank assets have actually grown, particularly at the largest institutions. Banks have reduced their holdings of government securities, but have expanded their holdings of other securities and commercial and industrial loans.\nMuch of this growth likely reflects \"involuntary lending\" - that is, banks expanding assets in response to liquidity commitments they extended during the previous good times. Some of the factors that have increased assets on balance sheets have included the inability to roll commercial paper, 7 firms expanding their use of lines of credit, the inability to sell leveraged loans that were originated with the expectation that they would be quickly distributed, liquidity triggers forcing the purchase of municipal bonds, and the inability to sell assets that were in the process of being securitized. Such factors can significantly swell bank assets, placing pressure on capital-constrained banks to pull back in other areas. And banks' choices regarding which types of credit to shrink can have macroeconomic consequences.\nSuch information can only be known with detailed knowledge of the bank's assets, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet, and information about which business lines each institution views as critical in the event it is forced to shrink (in other words, to cut back on credit extension) in some areas.\nIndeed, calculating how constrained banks are likely to become is not straightforward. One component is understanding the size of any possible losses that reduce banks' capital. At the same time, the likely growth in bank assets can also be very important - and it is virtually impossible to estimate without on-going discussions with bank management, such as occur in management's discussions with bank supervisors.\n3. Potential for Spillover to Retail Consumption\nWhile the problems at many large banks originated with subprime mortgages and securitization, policymakers and others are rightly paying attention to potential spillovers. As banks have seen housing prices decline, they have been reducing lines of credit associated with credit cards and home-equity loans. Declining home prices, which are a key driver of subprime defaults, 8 also erode the collateral value for home-equity lines. Thus, geographic areas that are experiencing falling home prices are likely seeing less credit available on home-equity lines, even if credit scores have not changed.\nSimilarly, banks are noticing - perhaps not surprisingly - that nonperforming credit card loans have increased more in areas with elevated home foreclosures. 9 As a result, some banks are reexamining their risk exposure for lines of credit in areas with falling home prices and elevated mortgage problems.\nConsumers who are informed that their credit lines have been reduced or possibly limited to loans outstanding lose an important financing option, which may dampen their consumption spending. To the extent that untapped lines of credit serve as a precautionary source of funds, consumers may reduce their willingness to purchase items. And purchases will likely fall for consumers who find themselves limited to current cash flow.\nLet me emphasize that it is too early to determine the degree that consumers will be restrained by credit availability in the current situation. But such trends will be easier to detect sooner and more accurately if the central bank has supervisory engagement with financial institutions.\n4. Bank Supervision and the Lender of Last Resort\nI would argue that it is very difficult for a central bank to be an effective lender of last resort without significant knowledge of the current and prospective value of assets and liabilities within financial institutions. Like any counterparty, a central bank acting as a lender needs to be able to evaluate the solvency and liquidity of a borrowing institution.\nOf course, determining future solvency of an institution can be challenging, particularly when assets are difficult to value. Knowing how likely it is that an institution's sources of funds will evaporate during times of financial stress requires a significant understanding of the institution's liabilities and its counterparty relationships. Such information has been particularly important of late, as the Federal Reserve has initiated a variety of innovative techniques to provide liquidity to the marketplace.\nFigure 6 provides a list of the various steps taken recently by the Federal Reserve related to our Discount Window - steps we have taken to try to enhance market liquidity and prevent ripples of difficulty that impact more institutions and ultimately the real economy and individuals. Because of the complexity and institutional details involved in each of these steps taken, I will focus today only on one, the Term Auction Facility.\nThe Term Auction Facility allows banks to obtain short-term financing using as collateral a subset of assets that the marketplace is currently seeing as illiquid. It has also provided an opportunity for banks to get financing for approximately one month during a period when obtaining such financing has sometimes proved difficult. Every other week, the Federal Reserve holds an auction where banks are able to use collateral at the Discount Window to get a loan. Currently the size of each auction is $50 billion. The auctions have been well received, and have generally resulted in financing terms (determined by the auction) that are somewhat above the Federal Funds rate.\nTo qualify, a bank first needs to be in sound financial condition, as the Federal Reserve must have confidence that the bank will be solvent over the time the loan is extended. While this determination is left to the individual Reserve Bank whose district the institution resides in, it generally requires that the bank not have low supervisory ratings. Second, the institution needs to have collateral at the Federal Reserve. Our Discount officers determine, as best they can, the market value of the collateral and apply an appropriate \"haircut.\"\nThere is little question in my mind that both the determination of the potential solvency risk and the evaluation of the institution's collateral are greatly aided by having experienced bank supervisors at the central bank.\nConclusion\nTwo years ago, few analysts were anticipating significant retail credit and banking problems. The most recent banking problems in the United States had been driven by problems in commercial real-estate loans. The current turmoil stems from troubles with residential real estate loans that are for the most part only indirectly owned, through securitizations.\nThe uncertainty surrounding ratings applied to relatively new and opaque financial products and the difficulty in pricing complex financial assets have seriously disrupted the \"originate to distribute\" model of recent real estate finance. In particular, it is clear that instruments that involve financing long-term assets with short-term liabilities, without institutional liquidity backing them up, are not especially suited to withstand times of financial distress such as the one we are facing.\nToday I have argued that knowledge of financial institutions has been a critical component of my own thinking as a central banker. In my view, central banks with potential counterparty risk as a lender of last resort need to have sufficient information to assess the solvency of their counterparty and the liquidity of its collateral - the same factors that any private counterparty would require.\nMuch of our understanding of the economy's evolution since July has been greatly influenced by turmoil affecting financial markets. The economy's path will vary depending on the size and nature of the problems at financial institutions, the distribution of those problems, and the reaction of bank management to those problems. I believe strongly that at the Federal Reserve, our role as a bank supervisor within a central bank has greatly facilitated our ability to operate effectively during this challenging period.",

            "content": "South Shore Chamber of Commerce Quincy, MA\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today.\nMy goal is to share with you what I see as some \"early lessons\" from the ongoing period of turmoil in real estate and credit markets.1 It is important, given the turbulence we have lately experienced, to begin to analyze and act on such lessons as early as possible.\nFirst, some background. For the past two years, the housing market has gone from bad to worse. What began as a mild reduction in residential investment2 at the start of 2006 has accelerated, with residential investment declining by more than 20 percent during each of the last two quarters of 2007.\nBeyond the obvious and intense pain for distressed borrowers, a noteworthy aspect of this downturn in residential investment has been its impact on financial markets. Previous housing downturns caused problems for savings institutions and banks that were generally smaller than the large financial institutions being affected today. This downturn has primarily affected financial markets and large financial institutions. Large financial institutions have lost billions of dollars, and in some cases tens of billions; and some are forecasting significant additional losses.3\nBut this is not just a Wall Street problem. Our real concern is the ways those problems in financial markets translate back to all of us.\nAfter a brief background on the genesis of the current financial turmoil, I am going to discuss three issues that I am sure you are increasingly seeing reported on the business pages of your national and regional newspapers:\nFirst I will discuss why the accuracy of ratings on securitized mortgage products have been so much less reliable than ratings for corporate-debt securities, and the lessons we should draw from those differences. Here is a peek at the main message: uncertainty surrounding ratings has caused a variety of markets to become less liquid. Less liquid credit markets can hurt borrowers of every type. Problems with the accuracy of ratings had their roots in the determinants of the ratings – and so we need ways to differentiate ratings that have different “drivers” in terms of the credit risk on the underlying assets. We need for example, to differentiate ratings on assets like corporate securities from ratings on assets whose ratings histories and price-drivers may be quite different, and less well understood, like certain mortgages-related securities.\nSecond, I will touch on the difficulty in pricing complex financial instruments, and actions that might help with transparency and pricing of these products in the future. Again, the main message: As I see it, the recent difficulty in pricing assets should make investors and financial intermediaries consider whether such complexity is necessary, and whether some of these instruments should be more standardized or possibly moved from dealer markets to exchange-traded instruments.\nThird, I will discuss the continuing problems in the housing market, and touch on the ongoing discussion of policies that might help mitigate those problems. Here I’ll suggest that, if housing prices continue to fall, we will need to increasingly consider programs for those with negative as well as positive equity in their houses.\nBackground On Recent Financial Turmoil\nFirst, a bit of background. In early 2007 it became apparent that delinquencies on subprime4 mortgages issued after 2004 were experiencing problems at a more rapid rate than would be expected, given the rather benign economic environment. We began to see an elevated rate of subprime delinquencies [See Figure 1].\nIn July of 2007, rating agencies began to highlight the fact that subprime mortgages that had been securitized - a process I'll describe in a moment - were performing poorly, leading to downgrades for securities that had significant exposure to the subprime market. Just as investors became more uncertain about valuing these securities, it became clear that subprime mortgages were part of various financial instruments that had been viewed as generally low risk.\nSecuritization relied on the reasonable premise that subprime loans might be more risky than prime, but the majority would not default - and higher interest rates and fees would compensate for those that did. Subprime loans were bundled for investors and \"riskiness\" was tiered. Investors in the least risky tiers were thought to be well protected from losses.5 [See Figure 2] Unfortunately, underlying assumptions proved inaccurate.\nThe market for short-term asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), short-term securities used to finance a variety of loans from student loans to home equity, has been particularly impacted [See Figure 3]. As problems with mortgage-related loans emerged, some investors became reluctant to continue lending in the ABCP market. This reduction in the availability of short-term funds caused the rates on ABCP to rise; and also forced some financial institutions to buy back ABCP that they could no longer refinance, bringing it onto their balance sheets. The combination of uncertainty over the appropriate rating of mortgage-related securities and the expansion of bank balance sheets caused significant pressure on the availability of short-term credit. In addition banks, as liquidity providers, were expanding their balance sheets in other areas, much of which was not anticipated prior to the financial turmoil. Some banks have had to take write-downs on some assets, and the losses in combination with involuntary growth in assets have made some banks more reticent to expand their balance sheets further.\nAn indication of the difficulties in short-term financing markets was the marked elevation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) relative to the comparable U.S. Fed Funds target rate. LIBOR is the rate charged in a key international market for short-term lending between banks. The elevated LIBOR rate not only made it difficult for banks to borrow short-term, but also raised the rates on loans tied to LIBOR -- notably including most subprime mortgages, corporate loans, and credit card debt.\nIndeed, while the initial trigger for the financial turbulence was related to subprime mortgages, the uncertainty surrounding ratings of complicated financial instruments has caused disruptions in a variety of other assets and markets that depend on securitization - including state and municipal financing, student loans, and commercial real estate. The effects have been felt up and down Main Street, as well as in some markets overseas.6\nI. The Role Of Credit Ratings\nWith that as background, I'd like to turn to my first subject today - the role played by the credit ratings used by investors to gauge the credit risk on securities.\nThe use of credit ratings for corporate bonds has been longstanding and generally free from substantial concerns about the ratings' accuracy, with a few notable exceptions.7 So I think it is useful to consider the similarities and differences between rating corporate securities and mortgage securities, where the accuracy of ratings has been called into question. This is particularly important because much of the current turmoil is driven by investor uncertainty in rating difficult-to-value financial assets.\nRelative to mortgage securities, ratings on corporate securities have been time tested. Downgrades have been quite modest. Defaults have often been tied to recessions or problems specific to a given firm, such as excessive leverage or poor management [See Figure 4]. In addition, investors in corporate securities can rely on a wealth of external sources to verify the health of a firm.8\nCorporate ratings have generally performed well. Despite the recent financial turmoil, corporate default probabilities in aggregate remain quite low [See Figure 5]. With relatively few downgrades, and delinquencies, the corporate balance sheet has held up better than that of the consumer - although the recent widening of spreads for lower-grade bonds gives one pause [See Figure 6].\nThe mortgage market is quite different. Most mortgage securities are based on a diversified pool of underlying mortgages. Many investors assumed that there would be significant benefits from diversification, that regional real estate shocks would be dominated by local factors, and that national home prices were very unlikely to decline. These assumptions proved to be wrong, resulting in widespread downgrades of mortgage securities.\nThe housing price assumption in particular has been critical, and many investors may have significantly underestimated a potential national housing price decline and its effect on defaults. The S,P Case-Shiller national home price index fell 10 percent from its peak in the second quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2007. Home prices are down in every one of the 20 large metro areas covered by the Case-Shiller national home price index.\nIn contrast to corporate securities, corroborating information on mortgage securities is not as readily available. There is no equivalent to equity analysts and equity prices to give investors updated market information. The information needed to analyze the individual mortgages in the pool can be expensive to obtain. So investors are more reliant on rating agencies than they are with corporate securities.\nThe problems in the mortgage market highlight the need for caution where there has been limited ratings history, where the underlying characteristics that drive the asset's price may not be fully understood or anticipated, and where evaluations cannot be easily corroborated by others such as equity analysts.9 Certainly one way to highlight these differences is to differentiate ratings on corporate securities from ratings on assets like mortgage-backed securities.\nII. Transparency and Disclosure\nNow I'd like to turn to a second area, transparency and disclosure. The heightened uncertainty surrounding ratings has been aggravated by the lack of transparency in the pricing of complex financial instruments. Because as many of the more complicated financial instruments have ceased active trading, determining a market price has become quite difficult.\nWhile defaults in housing move rather slowly, the pricing of financial assets has moved much more dramatically, causing many financial institutions to significantly change their expectation of losses from these complex financial instruments. In fact, the highest-graded securities are selling at a very significant discount [See Figure 7], implying a significant risk premium for holding even the highest quality securities of some complex financial instruments.\nThe opaqueness in pricing has caused a variety of complications:\nFirst, many securities have become illiquid, and sales are only occurring at “distress” pricing.10\nSecond, the uncertainty in pricing has caused a loss of confidence in firms that provided insurance on high-graded securities. This has been a problem for certain municipal securities, and instruments known as auction-rate securities11 and variable-rate demand notes12 where uncertainty in bond insurance has led to changes in pricing for securities previously thought to have little risk of default.\nThird, banks often provide liquidity backstops should securities trading become illiquid, and the current market turmoil is leading banks to be more cautious in lending because they are not sure if or when investor demand could evaporate, requiring significant extensions of bank credit.\nFourth, certain markets have been disrupted, as investors avoid complex securities where liquidity could be a problem. The recent reports of problems in auction rate securities, suggest that financing for all sorts of entities – universities or hospitals or some municipalities – can get a lot more expensive  when investors lose confidence in the pricing and liquidity of financial instruments.\nSo, what lesson should we derive from some of these complications?\nFirst, some financial products were not well designed to withstand liquidity problems. To avoid paying banks fees to provide a liquidity backstop, many financial products of recent vintage included provisions to force liquidation when necessary to insure payment to the holders of the higher-graded securities (or slices of securities). This structure was used, for example, by structured investment vehicles (SIVs)13. However, due to the recent financial stress, assets of SIVs could not be liquidated at prices felt to be reasonable. Broadly speaking, products should be structured to better weather periods of illiquidity, and ratings models should take better account of liquidity risk.\nA second way to improve price discovery would be to have greater uniformity in financial products. Standardization of products makes it much easier to price and trade securities. A case in point: many of the positive innovations in mortgage markets resulted from more uniform standards for conforming loans. Standardization helped insure minimum underwriting standards.14 Non-conforming mortgage markets, as well as other securitized assets, might well benefit from greater uniformity and standardization so that pricing is less idiosyncratic to the particular security an investor holds.15\nA third possibility is to seek more trading of financial products in exchanges rather than through dealers. Securities that are consistent enough to trade on an exchange are more likely to have market prices that all participants can use.16\nFinally, investors should give careful consideration to whether such complex financial products are necessary at all. With simpler and more understandable structures, the difficulties in obtaining market prices are likely to be significantly reduced, as are the consequent uncertainties like those we are currently facing.\nIII. The Housing Market\nNow I'd like to turn to the continuing problems in the housing market, and a few thoughts on policies might help mitigate those problems.\nThe housing market was the genesis of current financial turbulence, and a key point is that significant further declines in home prices could greatly complicate efforts to resolve current problems. As housing prices fall, loan-to-value ratios will rise, in some cases exceeding 100 percent, reducing the number of borrowers that qualify for existing government programs like Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans.17 Thus when considering ways to mitigate the current housing problem, it is useful to consider borrowers that still have positive equity in their house, as well as those that do not.\nFundamentally, I encourage worried borrowers who hold high-rate loans to approach a responsible lender about refinancing. I also encourage lenders to reach out to borrowers, and to take a fresh look at the state and federal programs that can be of assistance.\nIn recent months we estimated that a fair number of borrowers with subprime mortgages may be able to refinance into a more affordable loan, because they had good credit scores and some home equity when they got a fully documented loan on an owner-occupied property. As time goes by, however, declining home prices are eroding borrowers' equity, and some are experiencing financial difficulties or mounting debt as the economy slows. These forces complicate the picture, and narrow the pool of readily \"refinanceable\" subprime loans.\nGiven the worsening housing scene, Boston Fed researchers recently updated prior work in this area in an attempt to calculate the share of people with subprime loans who might qualify for FHA programs. They looked at subprime loans in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts that had full documentation, were owner occupied, had a loan-to-value (LTV) of no greater than 97 percent, met current FHA loan-size limits by county, were never 60 days delinquent, and had a maximum debt-to-income ratio (including other forms of debt) of 45 percent18. This approximates current FHA standards.\nThey estimate that about 16 percent of borrowers with subprime loans would meet those criteria. However, over time this pool is likely to shrink, as the number of delinquent borrowers has been rising and housing prices have been falling, likely reducing the number of qualified borrowers. For borrowers that could convert their subprime loan to an FHA-insured loan, saving significant money from converting from a subprime to a prime rate is an alternative that should be considered.\nOne refinance option is the Mortgage Relief Fund (www.MortgageReliefFund.com). Five large banks joined forces to set up this program, with the encouragement of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, to join forces in reaching out to borrowers with high-rate loans. The banks can help borrowers explore refinancing into a more-affordable loan - maybe an FHA loan, a state-guaranteed loan, or a conventional loan. We believe a number of community banks will join the effort in the coming months.\nWith two months completed, and realizing the lags from first contact on a mortgage to closing, the banks have logged over 1,000 inquiries, taken in more than 50 applications, made 115 referrals to nonprofit housing counseling services, and are now starting to close some of those loans from the first applicants - with the first dozen loans having recently closed. It is a modest start, but this month we are pursuing a second wave of outreach, and the banks are pursuing an additional advertising push, especially in areas with higher concentrations of subprime loans. We see the effort as a marathon, not a sprint, and we are refining and adding to it as we go.\nAs I noted a moment ago, as delinquencies and home prices shrink the pool of potential borrowers in existing Federal and state programs, an important consideration for lenders and policymakers involves the situations of borrowers whose loan now exceeds the value of their house. Of course, any remedies need to take into account the future risk to taxpayers, and the incentives created for borrowers and lenders. But we need to weigh that against the problems for communities that can occur with widespread foreclosures - including the negative effects on neighboring homeowners, the burden on tenants, and the costs borne by municipalities and communities in addressing blight and crime in areas of clustered foreclosures.\nAs Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday,19 this situation calls for a vigorous response - but care must be taken in designing solutions, so they represent safety and soundness for lenders and are characterized by fairness and minimal \"moral hazard.\" I would note that foreclosure costs are often substantial to lenders (and by extension, I would add investors) - of course it goes without saying that they are painfully costly on many levels for borrowers. So there is considerable scope for negotiating a mutually beneficial outcome.\nSomewhat along those lines, some parties are proposing variants of a \"shared appreciation\" loan approach.20 Lenders could write down the loan amount to the current home value, cap losses, avoid the costs associated with foreclosure, and receive a share of any future home appreciation when the buyer sells. The borrower could avoid foreclosure and reduce monthly payments.21 The FHA could provide insurance, but defray the increased risk with a share of the gains when the homeowner sells. Approaches like this, and other worthy ideas that are being proposed, should be debated by policymakers and interested parties - but without delay.\nConcluding Thoughts\nAs I noted at the outset, the current financial turmoil is ongoing but it is not too soon to consider lessons learned.\nThe uncertainty surrounding ratings has caused a variety of financial markets to become illiquid and caused very significant write-offs at major financial institutions. Considering ways to differentiate ratings on assets like corporate securities from ratings on assets whose ratings histories and price-drivers may be quite different, and less well understood, is probably a first important step.\nThe difficulty in pricing assets should make investors consider whether such complexity is necessary, and whether some of these instruments should be more standardized or possibly moved from dealer markets to exchange-traded instruments.\nIn the housing area, thought will likely be needed regarding programs for those with negative as well as positive equity in their houses. As long as housing prices continue to fall, the decline increases the risks to borrowers, lenders, markets and the economy.\nI thank you for exploring with me today these problems that have roiled Wall Street, and are beginning to significantly affect Main Street. We are facing some unique and complex challenges in all of these areas. Let me leave you with the thought, however, that there may be a significant cost to delaying needed actions that could restore confidence in the ratings process, the pricing of financial assets, and the impact of declining house prices.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "U.S. Monetary Policy Forum New York, NY\nI am very pleased to be able to discuss the paper \"Leveraged Losses: Lessons from the Mortgage Meltdown\" by Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap and Shin (GHKS).\nIt is somewhat ironic that several current participants on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), including myself, wrote extensively about the credit crunch period in the early 1990s and now have the opportunity as policy makers to consider how financial problems may be spilling over to the real economy.1 So it is particularly appropriate that the paper we are discussing today asks whether problems that originated in mortgage markets are likely to cause a credit crunch that significantly impacts growth in the economy, and what that implies for central banks.\nThe paper provides a variety of new facts about the current financial turmoil, and does a very nice job of detailing the extent of current and potential problems that may impact future public policy. I plan to first discuss the issue of the size of the losses to financial institutions stemming from the current financial turmoil. I will highlight both the uncertainty around the GHKS estimate, and the possible downside risk that may remain to their estimate. I will next discuss the issue of the impact on balance sheets. I will argue that to date, the balance sheet constraints are primarily occurring at a few large institutions with significant exposure to more complicated financial products; but that again, there is downside risk that balance sheet constraints could become more widespread in the future - particularly if housing prices experience more significant declines. I will then amplify an issue touched on only lightly in the paper, and that is the implications of mortgage problems for securitization and complicated financial products. I will conclude with a few observations on policy.\nResidential Real Estate Losses - The Role of Declining Housing Prices\nGHKS use three different methods to determine mortgage credit losses. The first is a migration analysis that looks at historical trends of each vintage year and then adjusts the trends for falling home prices. The second extrapolates from the current pricing of mortgage-backed securities' expected losses. The third uses foreclosure rates from previous regional periods of falling housing prices, and applies those rates to the current distribution of mortgages. With several assumptions and caveats they find losses are expected to be $400 billion, with about half of that figure being borne by leveraged institutions.\nThe authors highlight the significant uncertainty around their estimates. This is particularly appropriate since two critical components of the calculation, the path of housing prices and the path of the economy, are not directly estimated in the model. Analysis by Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston2 finds the probability of a default and foreclosure is highly sensitive to the macroeconomic environment - particularly to house price appreciation.\nIn making adjustments for falling housing prices, GHKS discuss house price declines of 5, 10, and 15 percent from the end of 2006. While housing prices are critical to understanding the extent of overall mortgage credit losses, the absence from the historical record of a sustained national decline in housing prices makes it problematic to extrapolate the future solely with historical data. As shown in Table 1, all 10 major metropolitan areas followed by the Case- Schiller home-price index declined in the past year, and five of the major metropolitan areas 3 show double-digit declines. These declines have occurred despite an unemployment rate in January 2008 of 4.9 percent. Should the economy weaken more than expected, one can envision downside risks to even the rather bleak forecast of GHKS - especially given the large number of high loan-to-value (LTV) loans made in the past three years.\nFrom a policy perspective it is important to understand not only what would happen if the economy behaves as expected - which would currently be that we skirt a recession and housing prices show only modest declines - but also how significant the downside would be if the rise in the unemployment rate and the decline in housing prices were significantly greater than currently expected. The authors' estimates of expected losses do not try to factor in the potential - though hopefully unlikely - outcome of housing prices interacting with sharper declines in employment and further financial difficulties at mortgage lenders. While not the most likely outcome, it is an outcome that policymakers and others may consider \"taking out some insurance against.\"\nAn additional factor left out of the analysis involves the nature of the housing recovery that is likely to occur if the mortgage securities market and financial institutions are unwilling to lend to subprime borrowers. Given the recent difficulty in securitizing troubled or high LTV mortgage credits, and the possibility that many financial institutions will be reticent to lend to risky borrowers in a declining house price market, the housing malaise could be more protracted and the recovery more anemic than we have experienced in previous housing downturns.\nBalance Sheet Constraints\nGHKS argue that the distribution of mortgage losses is important. Many of these losses are in leveraged financial institutions, which will be forced to shrink their balance sheets to maintain desired capital ratios. Thus the analysis is in the spirit of earlier credit crunch literature 4 that highlights that binding capital constraints at financial institutions can result in significant headwinds, as experienced in the United States in the early 1990s and in Japan during the \"lost decade.\"3\nTo date, there have been several significant differences in the distribution of losses compared to the 1990s. The 1990s credit crunch resulted from regional losses in commercial real estate and construction, and to a lesser degree residential investment. These losses essentially impacted all financial institutions in the affected region. To date in our current situation, the mortgage problems have been concentrated in some of the largest financial institutions involved in structured finance and the securitization of subprime mortgages.\nIn fact, three large financial institutions alone have already announced almost $60 billion in write-downs in the last two quarters of 2007.4 Despite the very significant write-downs, the losses have been mitigated by the ability of these global institutions to attract new capital. In fact these same three institutions have together announced $36 billion in new capital in the last four months (October - January).5 This ability to raise new capital has helped mitigate capital constraints.\nTable 2 shows that despite large financial losses announced by some commercial banks in the past two quarters, many banks have experienced increases in capital and in their capital ratios. In fact, more than two-thirds of bank holding companies had increases in capital in the last two quarters of 2007. Note, however, that the decreases are more prevalent among the largest bank holding companies while the increases are more prevalent among the smaller bank holding companies. In terms of capital ratios, 354 bank holding companies had increases in capital ratios in the last two quarters of 2007, while 592 had decreases. This reflects that even at 5 bank holding companies with increased capital, the asset growth has exceeded the capital growth.\nTable 3 shows that in aggregate, while capital was basically flat, assets did increase, as banks provided liquidity to many firms and financial market participants. To date, the resulting potential capital constraints are concentrated in the largest banks with the largest exposure to securities tied to subprime mortgages. While some of the capital losses have been mitigated by new capital, the losses in combination with involuntary growth in assets can potentially restrain the willingness of these institutions to engage in activities that would further swell their balance sheet.\nBecause these institutions are actively engaged in structured products and loans to finance leveraged deals, it is not surprising that participants in these markets are finding tighter financial constraints. For some markets where these banks are major market makers, the unwillingness to further increase balance sheets has impacted the liquidity in those markets.\nMany small and medium-sized businesses are not complaining about credit conditions. This reflects the lack of exposure that many small and medium-sized banks had to securitized products or the subprime market. However, should housing prices continue to fall, losses in prime residential mortgages and construction loans are likely to cause these institutions to be more capital constrained. Banks under $100 billion still retain significant exposure to residential mortgages and construction loans which account for 26 percent of assets or $750 billion. Should housing prices continue to fall and the housing sector get worse, it is likely that these institutions will begin being impacted more significantly.\nSpillovers From the Mortgage Meltdown\nAn issue not directly addressed in this paper, but nonetheless critical to the discussion, is the loss in confidence in the ratings process and the consequent uncertainty in the pricing of a wide variety of structured products.\nAs Exhibit 3.4 in GJKS highlights, AAA tranches for recently issued contracts are selling for less than 70 percent of their par value. Since lower-grade tranches would experience losses first, such pricing implies very severe losses on the underlying assets. It also highlights that the default probabilities on a large number of highly-rated securities are likely to be higher than would normally be expected by investors in the highest-grade securities. While the problems with ratings accurately reflecting probabilities of default are primarily related to mortgage products, their impact has moved well beyond residential mortgages.\nThe largest banks have increasingly moved to an originate-to-distribute model for a variety of assets formerly held on balance sheets. Leveraged loans, credit card receivables, commercial real estate loans, student loans, and municipal borrowings have all increasingly been moved off banks' balance sheets and into a variety of new securities. As investors have lost faith in the ratings process, many of these highly-rated securities have begun to sell at significant discounts, which will likely result in additional losses.\nIn addition to the losses experienced by the holders of these securities, the borrowers have had their financing disrupted. Many of these loans will need to be financed by bank balance sheets, and the terms may be significantly different than what they experienced prior to the recent financial turmoil.\nDifficulties in selling structured financial products have resulted in the disappearance or near-disappearance of trading in some collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized 7 debt obligations (CDOs), have disrupted the auction-rate securities market, have made it difficult to sell asset-backed commercial paper, have created problems for monoline insurers and have caused the winding down of many structured investment vehicles. Many of these markets financed assets above and beyond mortgages, and as a result may produce losses not captured in the analysis by GHKS. While problems in rating mortgages may have been the trigger, the drying up of the market for structured financial products is a downside risk and could make it more difficult or more expensive to meet the financing needs of a variety of organizations.\nPublic Policy\nGHKS express some pessimism regarding the ability of monetary policy to help mitigate problems. I am less pessimistic. Most subprime loans had reset rates tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) - generally around 6 percentage points over the six-month LIBOR. The reductions in the federal funds rate, as well as the reduction in the spread of LIBOR over the federal funds target after the introduction of the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility, have significantly reduced the reset rate for most subprime borrowers (Figure 1). For many borrowers, the reset rate may at this point not be dramatically different than the original rate - a significant difference from what would have occurred in the absence of appropriately aggressive monetary policy.\nIn addition, lower rates are likely to result in higher house prices than would occur in the absence of monetary easing. This should reduce the foreclosure rate and reduce some of the concern that housing problems will become more widespread. Finally, lower rates should result in less unemployment - one of the main drivers in forced sales of houses. Thus, monetary policy actions may significantly reduce the depth of problems, but are of course not a panacea.\nMany of the possible steps to mitigate these problems involve policy solutions not tied to monetary policy. In recent years the subprime market became the major avenue for low- and moderate-income borrowers to buy homes. There would seem to be a strong economic incentive for borrowers to seek FHA insurance and get a prime rather than a subprime rate. Examining how FHA programs could continue to be modernized and streamlined and become a more viable choice for borrowers may be an important mitigant for housing problems.\nGiven falling housing prices, many financial institutions are likely less willing to be exposed to the mortgage market. One aspect of the current situation is the high LTV ratios facing many borrowers, as low down-payments and falling housing prices have made refinancing homes difficult. A possible solution would be shared appreciation loans with FHA guarantees. This approach, variants of which are currently being discussed, would provide the FHA and the lending institution with a portion of future appreciation in return for providing the FHA insurance on high LTV loans.\nWhile too large a topic for today's discussion, I believe there is also a need to increase transparency and create more consistent prices for complex financial products. We need to think about the ramifications and possible remedies of a situation where parties are unable to accurately value financial assets tied to the mortgage market - a market whose prices are more easily determined than are many other types of balance sheet assets.\nConclusion\nGHKS have done a nice job of highlighting some of the ramifications of the mortgage meltdown. A critical factor in the size of losses, and whether balance sheet constraints become more widespread, is the extent to which housing prices fall. Unfortunately, we have little historical precedent for sustained declines in national housing prices, which makes it difficult to forecast future home prices. However, one of the significant downside risks to the economy is that further declines in housing prices could depress residential investment, reduce consumer spending, generate elevated foreclosures, and contribute to financial instability. Taking appropriate monetary, regulatory, and fiscal actions to mitigate this risk seems prudent.",

            "content": "The Seventeenth Annual Vermont Economic Outlook Conference Burlington, Vermont\nI would like to thank the organizers of this event for scheduling it after New Year's Day, since economists tend not to be particularly helpful for holiday cheer but quite useful when thinking of New Year's resolutions. On your list of New Year's resolutions, I would include not listening to pundits who claimed:\n…that housing prices could not go down, nationally;\n…that triple-A ratings meant no default risk;\n…that calculating fair market value was easy for mortgage products.\nMy talk today will touch on all three, because I am going to discuss recent trends in residential real estate, and their economic relevance.1\nToday I am going to examine two prior periods of declining house prices - with some observations on how they were addressed, the similarities and differences from our situation today, and the lessons we can draw. Throughout, I will refer to actions being pursued by a wide variety of actors including the Federal Reserve, financial institutions, investors, borrowers, and policymakers.\nRecent Trends in Residential Investment\nIn 2007, residential investment2 was the laggard among the components of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Residential investment began declining in the first quarter of 2006, and has continued to decline in each quarter since. It seems all but certain that residential investment also declined in the fourth quarter of 2007 - and many economic forecasts expect residential investment to continue to decline at least through the first half of 2008.\nHow should we interpret what could be nine or more continuous quarters of declining residential investment? Exhibit 1 provides some initial context. Should the forecasts prove to be right, we will have experienced a longer string of back-to-back quarters of declining residential investment than at any other time in the past 50 years., 3, 4\nThat historical observation should focus our attention, but must also be tempered somewhat by the unique aspects of our current situation. Let me be clear - this is an unusual economic situation and we cannot predict exactly what is going to happen. For one thing, to date this decline in residential investment has occurred in an economic environment of reasonably healthy job and income growth, and low rates of unemployment - although the December Labor Department report, released last Friday, suggests less welcome developments, as the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in December while non-farm payroll employment was essentially unchanged (an increase nationwide of 18,000).5\nPrevious periods where residential investment declined for a year or more were either accompanied by, or closely followed by, an economic downturn. But history may or may not repeat itself, because this period of prolonged weakness in housing is distinctive in several other ways that add to uncertainty over its ultimate impact on the broader economy.\nFor one thing, most other periods of extended decline in residential investment were preceded by rising inflation rates, which in turn induced a policy response - usually in the form of a significant tightening of monetary policy (that is, increases in interest rates) [see Exhibit 2]. However, the current period of weakness in housing has occurred despite a low inflation rate and low real interest rates, by historical standards.\nAnother difference has been the national nature of the decline in housing prices. Historically, housing prices have often shown sharp swings in particular states or regions, but it was unusual for prices to fall nationwide.\nThrough the 1980s there were a series of rolling regional downturns that resulted in big fluctuations in regional housing prices. These were generally due to significant regional economic factors, such as the surge in oil prices in the late 1970s that disproportionately boosted the southwestern portion of the country. When oil prices then fell by nearly half in the early 1980s, this same region experienced sharp drops in home prices. Similarly, the northeast's house-price cycle of the 1980s and early 1990s was a regional phenomenon, as the promise of a new technology-based \"economic miracle\" proved too good to be true.\nIn these earlier episodes, housing finance was still dominated by local financial institutions; and house price declines were regional, not national, and were not particularly well synchronized with national recessions.\nThe regional nature of these housing problems is illustrated in Exhibit 3, which plots changes in real estate prices by census region. Movements of housing prices in various regions during the 1980s - shown on the far left side of the chart - were not particularly correlated. Housing prices in some regions went up despite significant declines in other regions. The OFHEO national house price index did not decline, giving some analysts a false sense of confidence that a geographically diversified portfolio of real estate loans would perform at least reasonably well, since real estate prices were dominated by local effects.\nThen, over the 1990s, there was less regional variation in housing price appreciation and more of a common trend, which has become more pronounced recently. Greater correlation of housing price increases and decreases across regions of the country meant that the diversification benefit resulting from holding a national portfolio of real estate loans was significantly less than history would imply.\nWith housing price changes more correlated across regions, mortgage securities and derivatives of mortgage securities behaved differently than many investors had assumed they would. The Boston Fed's research6 shows that, in large part due to widespread house-price declines, foreclosures have risen sharply in much of the country - not just in regional pockets. Many of the investment products consisting of securitized mortgages assumed more favorable house-price trends, so many that carried triple-A ratings have been downgraded to below investment grade - or are trading as if they were downgraded to below investment grade.\nIn part, the trend towards securitizing mortgage loans allowed the financing arrangements to be driven by national rather than regional conditions. As long as investor demand for higher-yielding mortgage securities and derivatives was strong, there was little of the natural \"governor\" that occurs when financial institutions become unduly concentrated in particular regions or asset classes. This change enabled the supply of financing, particularly to riskier borrowers, to expand rapidly in all regions of the country.\nExhibit 4 illustrates how abruptly the pattern in house prices has changed. The home price indexes generated by both the U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO)7 and S,P/Case-Shiller8 show that home prices that accelerated during the first half of the decade have been quickly reversing that trend.\nAs of the close of the third quarter, the S,P/Case-Shiller index indicates that house prices are down 4.5 percent from a year earlier. The S,P/Case-Shiller composite 10 monthly index, representing the average of 10 large metropolitan areas, provides more recent data and has declined by 6.7 percent over the last year.9 This is the largest decline in the 21-year history of the index.\nThere has also been significant variation across metropolitan areas, illustrated in Exhibit 5. The largest decline among the 10 metro areas was in Miami, where prices have declined by 12.4 percent over the past year, while Denver's decline was just 1.8 percent.\nWhile real estate has not generally experienced the volatility of many financial instruments, large regional price declines over a relatively short period of time can, and have, occurred. And if regional price declines are becoming more tightly correlated, as some of this suggests, a more significant national house price decline cannot be ruled out.\nThe sharp declines experienced in many regions of the country have occurred despite low real interest rates and, until December, an unemployment rate below 5 percent. This highlights a risk to the housing sector going forward: Since prices have declined substantially even in a relatively benign economic environment, one cannot discount the possibility that they could fall more rapidly should economic performance not remain strong in 2008.\nThe Real Effects of Housing Price Declines\nWhile the outlook for housing will be greatly affected by the economy, history indicates that \"institutional\" factors can also play an important role. It is instructive to compare our current situation with earlier episodes of falling housing prices. Two very different scenarios, and outcomes, are illustrated by experiences in New England and Japan.\nTo give you a peek at the punch line, let me mention up front what I think the broadest lessons are:\nFirst, that transparency matters, and is generally beneficial;\nSecond, that prompt recognition of losses leads to a more efficient outcome – if somewhat more pain in the short run;\nThird, that adjustments are easier in an orderly economic environment with a well-functioning financial system.  This is something the Federal Reserve is working to help ensure. \nNew England's Experience\nExhibit 6 illustrates the significant decline in house prices that occurred in New England in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In contrast to the current period, many of those loans were held by local financial institutions. As prospects for the New England economy boomed in the mid to late 1980s, these financial institutions significantly increased their portfolio of construction, residential, and commercial real estate loans.\nFinancial institutions were regionally based, so they were highly susceptible to regional shocks. When the New England economy subsequently faltered, the real estate market collapsed. Prices on both residential and commercial real estate declined, resulting in losses to banks' loan portfolios. Many financial institutions found that they were inadequately diversified and had inadequate capital to absorb losses.\nThe supervisory process forced banks to recognize these losses. A key component of the bank examiner's job is to insure that problem loans are appropriately recognized on bank balance sheets. Accordingly, banks were forced to write down the value of real estate loans to reflect declines in the value of the underlying collateral, and the reduced ability of borrowers to service their loans. In fact, very large declines in bank assets frequently occurred at the time of bank examinations.10\nThe large losses sustained by banks in that era resulted in 115 banks failing.11 The combination of failed banks and significant losses at surviving banks limited the supply of credit to bank-dependent borrowers, many of whom were engaged in businesses not directly related to real estate. Many of the problem loans ended up in the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which expedited the necessary adjustment process by quickly disposing of the collateral property.\nThe prompt action of the bank examiners and the FDIC was, and remains, controversial. The swiftness of the write-downs and disposal of troubled assets initially aggravated the decline in residential and commercial prices. But it also meant that prices fell to the point that many investors became convinced that subsequent capital gains were inevitable. Thus, while the decline in prices was steep, the duration of the problem was probably shortened by aggressive and transparent actions. Within four years of the trough, housing prices had already returned to their previous peak.\nJapan's Experience\nOne can think of the New England experience, and the swift action of examiners, as one end of a continuum. At the other end is the experience in Japan. As the 1990s began, stock prices and real estate prices peaked. While stock prices fell relatively quickly, real estate prices declined much more gradually.\nKeenly aware of the credit-crunch experienced in the United States, Japanese regulators chose to move slowly in forcing write-downs of problem assets. In fact, in the early 1990s there was relatively little official information published on the extent of problems. To prevent write-downs, problem assets were not revealed publicly. This lack of transparency and disclosure made many investors and counterparties wary of Japanese financial institutions, as the magnitude of problems was difficult to discern. In addition, financial institutions and the government accumulated problem assets, which they held rather than disposing of the assets at \"distress\" prices.\nWhile reported prices in real estate declined slowly, volume was limited by investors' concerns that the large pool of problem assets would eventually need to be sold in the market. While bank lending did not decline abruptly, several studies have indicated that lending was quite inefficient - often used to prop up distressed borrowers rather than to allocate credit in the economy more efficiently.12\nThe overall result was that real estate prices declined for over a decade [see Exhibit 7]. Mirroring the gradual decline in prices, the recovery in prices was similarly very slow. The economy experienced subpar growth for an extended period of time.\nWhile our current period is different in many ways from the New England and Japan experiences with declining real estate prices, there are lessons to be drawn.\nFor one, the degree of transparency in financial statements can significantly affect confidence in financial institutions. Uncertainty about asset values may ultimately be worse than losses.\nIn the past cases of New England and Japan, and today as well, there are concerns about the value of the underlying assets complicating matters. In New England the problem manifested itself because real estate, especially commercial real estate, changes hands relatively infrequently - particularly in a slump - and thus is difficult to value. The slow recovery of Japanese financial institutions was in part related to significant concerns about their true financial condition, as many of the assets held by banks in Japan were loans to finance assets which changed hands relatively infrequently. The complex, opaque nature of many of today's mortgage-derivative instruments also makes them very difficult to value, which in turn makes them relatively illiquid.\nHistory suggests it is at such times that enhanced transparency can help clarify the extent of the problems, and allow financial market participants to determine appropriate valuations for assets and whether valuation methods are being conservatively applied. I am hopeful that the management of firms with large exposures to securitized subprime mortgages will embrace more detailed disclosures that allow for a more accurate assessment of the extent of the problems. Financial institutions with poor transparency are likely to have greater difficulty raising external funds at favorable prices; and indeed, we have seen significant tiering along these lines in the federal funds market and other credit markets.\nLooking at the New England and Japan experiences, let me be clear that I am not advocating responses to today's problems that are at either extreme of the continuum. But certainly we can learn what not to do from Japan's experience. Clearly it is better to take care of problems now than distort and greatly prolong the needed adjustment process.\nAlong with greater transparency, the New England experience reminds us that a full recognition of losses will create incentives for firms to dispose of bad assets. However, we face an added challenge today. When problem loans were held in commercial banks, much of the loss recognition was enforced through the bank-examination process. With today's opaque financial products held in a variety of financial intermediaries - not just traditional commercial banks, and located both in the U.S. and abroad - the loss recognition is not likely to be consistently enforced.\nMaintaining confidence in financial institutions and financial markets is key to a quick recovery from a crisis. Falling real estate prices caused a credit crunch during the early 1990s New England downturn, as banks reduced lending to borrowers in general as a result of the banks' capital-adequacy problems. In Japan, problem real estate loans caused banks to misallocate credit to inefficient projects to prevent recognition of their problems. However, in today's situation we are fortunate that most financial institutions have entered the current problems with significant capital cushions and that many U.S. financial institutions are moving to proactively address the problems.\nHowever, the potential for a credit crunch remains. Commercial banks are still an important source of liquidity and there are troubling developments at work. Allow me to delve for a moment into banking finance to make this point.\nMany commercial banks participated in the subprime market by sponsoring off-balance sheet investment vehicles. These vehicles were financed by short term commercial paper. In many cases, subprime loans were only a small fraction of the asset holdings of these vehicles. However, investors are very leery of anything associated with subprime loans and are reluctant to buy the commercial paper of these vehicles.\nFor both reputational and legal reasons, some of the sponsoring banks are now moving these off-balance sheet instruments onto their balance sheets, funding them as part of the bank portfolio. As shown in Exhibit 8, bank assets have grown significantly since the financial turmoil emerged in July. However, banks have capital requirements that limit their ability to expand. Thus, there is a risk that this unintended growth in bank assets will squeeze out loans to other borrowers.\nRisk Mitigation by the Federal Reserve\nIn the midst of this recent financial turmoil, I am hopeful that actions taken by the Federal Reserve will reduce the potential negative impact.\nMy view is that the continued decline in residential investment has heightened the risk of a more significant downturn in the overall economy. Falling housing prices further weaken the incentives for residential investment, but are also likely to dampen consumer and business confidence and spending. Furthermore, falling house prices roil financial markets and financial institutions by exacerbating exposures to the housing market.\nAs I suggested a moment ago, the Federal Reserve can minimize the severity and spillover of housing and associated weakness by implementing policies that foster a sound macroeconomic environment, low and stable inflation rates and a well-functioning financial systems. In that regard, the Fed has reduced its key policy rate by 100 basis points over the past five months.\nAlso, in an effort to help return markets to more normal short-term funding patterns, the Federal Reserve has initiated a new Term Auction Facility or TAF. The TAF enables banks with illiquid collateral to borrow from the discount window at a price determined by an open auction. This innovative tool has the potential to provide greater flexibility for the Federal Reserve to respond to the sort of liquidity problems that we have seen in recent months. The benefit to banks is that they can borrow relatively low-cost funds using assets that are temporarily illiquid as collateral. This facility is particularly useful in providing term lending, and appears to have been helpful as financial institutions sought liquidity at the end of 2007.\nThe first two auctions have provided term funding at a rate above the overnight federal funds rate but below the primary credit rate that banks borrow from the Fed's Discount Window. An added benefit of the TAF is that it allows the Fed to supply funds to the market without adding to stresses in Treasury markets by engaging in direct purchases of Treasury securities. Treasury markets have experienced significant stress in recent months, as Treasury issues were in great demand by investors around the world who sought safe, liquid assets.13\nOn a more regional note, the New England states have seen a falloff in housing construction and home sales roughly comparable to that of the nation. Housing prices, which grew very rapidly from 1998 to 2005, have leveled off and in three New England states - Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire - prices are down from a year ago.14 While Vermont's experience is more favorable than that of the other New England states, the picture is broadly similar.\nAs housing prices have leveled off or declined in New England, foreclosure rates have risen from well below the national average to the national average, which is also rising. Again, Vermont's experience is more favorable than the rest of New England: Its foreclosure rates as of the third quarter of last year were only half the national and the regional averages.\nThe increase in foreclosures has been particularly sharp for subprime adjustable rate mortgages. The typical subprime adjustable rate mortgage is a hybrid, with a fixed rate of about 8 percent for two years that resets to about 11 percent. The surge in foreclosures thus far is not due to resets. However, many borrowers holding subprime loans face resets in the coming year, indeed the next few quarters. This prospect threatens to make a difficult situation even worse.\nSo I am very pleased that five large New England banks have formed a consortium to reach out to subprime borrowers to see whether they might be candidates for loans at prime rates, making use of existing federal and state insurance programs. This initiative, called the Mortgage Relief Fund, was launched shortly before Christmas with a $125 million commitment from the five banks and has already has some success in generating inquiries. Exhibit 9 is an excerpt from the effort's web site.\nTo date the banks - Bank of America, Citizens Bank, Sovereign Bank, TD Banknorth, and Webster Bank - have had over 430 calls from borrowers, and a number of them are beginning the application process or have already submitted loan applications. Because borrowers can qualify for government-insured loan programs with as little as 3 percent equity in the house, this is an important initiative for borrowers to consider if they are currently holding subprime loans.\nThe challenge, really, is getting the word out and convincing borrowers who may face trouble in coming months that it is in their best interest to act now.\nSo I strongly encourage homeowners paying a high subprime rate, and possibly facing a rate-reset to an even higher level, to visit the website - www.MortgageReliefFund.com - to begin exploring whether they would be better off financially by taking advantage of this program.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is pleased to be working with the five banks on the Mortgage Relief Fund initiative and commends them for their efforts.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion and by way of recap, the weakness in the housing sector has slowed economic growth in the overall economy. The collateral effects of the residential slowdown are likely to be significantly affected by the path of housing prices and, importantly, how a wide variety of financial intermediaries react to the current and future problems. I have offered a few thoughts, gleaned from history, on how I hope financial intermediaries and others will react. In addition, I think it is important to note that the Federal Reserve has taken action on several fronts to date - actions that should help reduce the downside risk to the real economy.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.",

            "content": "Mortgage Relief Fund Press Conference\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve Bank. We have had a few cancellations among out of town speakers due to the snow storm but I would like to thank everyone who was not deterred by the snow. While the snow has made travel difficult around Boston, it is good news that Santa's sleigh should have plenty of snow for traction this year.\nI am very pleased to be standing here with financial and political leaders from New England to announce a joint effort to help subprime borrowers.\nI really commend the banks for stepping forward and working so hard to develop this initiative - which we all hope will assist a key subset of borrowers.\nAnd I thank the governor, the mayor, and the HUD regional director for being here to show their ongoing support and involvement.\nThe recent rise in delinquencies and foreclosures has been widely reported, and it is very possible that the problem could worsen.\nToday, these banks are announcing that they want to reach out to some of the New England homeowners who have been affected - or might be in the future.\nThe banks' initiative, called the Mortgage Relief Fund, should make it easier for some homeowners who are paying high rates - and those who face a reset of an adjustable-rate loan - to refinance into a more affordable mortgage, avoid becoming delinquent, and avoid foreclosure.\nThe five banks -Citizens Bank, Sovereign Bank, TD Banknorth, Webster Bank, and Bank of America - are stepping forward to play a positive role in the challenging situation facing many New England homeowners and have together committed an initial $125 million for mortgage loans.\nResearchers here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston are finding that many borrowers holding so-called \"subprime\" loans have solid credit histories and some home equity and should qualify for the Mortgage Relief Fund. Our research suggests that there may be 38,000 borrowers in New England that had 10% equity in their home when they took out the mortgage, had credit scores over 620, and where fully documented loans for owner occupied houses. For the individual New England states, there are over 15,000 subprime borrowers that satisfy these conditions in Massachussetts, over 10,000 in CT, over 3800 in both New Hampshire and Rhode Island, over 3400 in Maine and a little under 1000 in Vermont. This provides a conservative estimate of the borrowers that could qualify for this program.\nThe banks expect to incorporate Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance and beneficial aspects of state programs, which often include flexible underwriting and eligibility guidelines. These programs allow banks to offer borrowers a lower interest rate, similar to that of prime borrowers, which could result in savings of hundreds of dollars per month and the peace of mind of a fixed rate loan.\nThis fund of $125 million offers genuine help to a subset of borrowers who are at a perilous juncture in their mortgage. It is particularly important to find and locate the borrowers who may be eligible for a better rate and a healthier relationship with their lender. This press conference is meant to stimulate interest so we can do just that -- converse with those borrowers who we may be able to assist, study their individual circumstances, and take every responsible step available to us to help them.\nThis initiative began with a discussion with Larry Fish, the chairman of citizens financial group, about how commercial banks that were not part of the problem could nonetheless help in the resolution of the problem. I will now turn the podium over to Larry to discuss this bank initiative.",

            "content": "The Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth (MassINC) Boston, Massachusetts\nI would like to thank the sponsor of this breakfast, MassINC, for the opportunity to discuss1 an issue of national, regional, and local importance - recent problems with subprime mortgages. Like MassINC, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston believes in the power of non-partisan research and collaborative debate to address issues that are important to the economic well-being of all citizens. So I am very happy to be with you this morning.\nBackground: Developments in Subprime Mortgages\nThe Policy Challenge: Aiding Borrowers in Trouble\nIssues for Future Research\nFootnotes\nBackground: Developments in Subprime Mortgages\nThe subprime mortgage market - involving mortgages with a higher risk of default, often due to the borrower's credit history - has experienced significant changes over the past several decades. Historically, most mortgage loans were issued by financial institutions that would originate and hold them. However, since financing long-term mortgages with short-term deposits presented some difficulties for financial institutions, the mortgage market innovated and evolved so that mortgages were increasingly originated by a financial institution or a mortgage broker, then packaged into securities that could be sold to a wide variety of investors.\nWhile securitization of mortgages originally focused on mortgages to prime borrowers and mortgages with government guarantees, over the past decade there was significant demand for mortgage-related securities that would provide a higher return to investors. This investor demand created an incentive for more aggressive outreach to borrowers who previously may have had difficulty buying houses, resulting in a significant increase in homeownership. These trends were beneficial for borrowers who were able to make payments - which, by the way, still includes the majority of subprime borrowers. However, in retrospect, many borrowers took significant risks that would only be successful in a market with rising housing prices and the ability to refinance as needed - and as long as their own financial circumstances did not take a turn for the worse.\nSecuritization played a particularly strong role in the expansion of subprime lending. Certain lenders specialized in subprime mortgages, but most of these lenders only originated the mortgages, with the majority of loans packaged for the securities market rather than being held in the portfolio of the originator. As the market moved to this \"originate to distribute\" model banks, particularly smaller community banks, ceded much of the subprime market to specialized mortgage lenders.\nDespite fairly benign economic conditions (the unemployment rate is currently 4.7 percent and core inflation is close to 2 percent) subprime mortgages began experiencing a significant rise in delinquencies and foreclosures. The rise in delinquencies has been particularly concentrated in adjustable-rate subprime mortgages, particularly for mortgages underwritten in the past two years.\nThe effects have already been far-reaching. Homeowners who thought they were buying into the American dream of homeownership are now facing the loss of their home and the destruction of much of their financial wealth, as they realize they cannot afford their mortgage. Multi-family properties have experienced delinquencies at more than double the rate of single family homes - a trend that has significant ramifications for unsuspecting tenants. Entire communities are impacted as foreclosures of neighboring houses depress prevailing home prices and in some cases encourage others to walk away from their mortgages. This is particularly concerning since foreclosures have disproportionately affected communities of low and moderate income borrowers. Finally, the losses on mortgages have had a big impact on the markets for mortgage-backed securities and on the financial institutions and investors who purchased securities based on subprime mortgages.\nAs a result of these significant problems emerging, the Boston Fed has undertaken a significant research agenda to better understand recent mortgage-market trends. Much of my talk today benefits from that work, so let me just highlight some of the initial findings. Much of the work is being done by Kris Gerardi, Adam Shapiro, and Paul Willen, who have just published a working paper on subprime defaults that can be accessed on our web site2. They have been examining data on all loans in Massachusetts since 1987.\nThey are finding, among other things, that the current problems in the subprime market are heavily dependent on economic conditions - particularly housing prices.3 As a result, the outlook for how much worse this problem could become depends critically on the outlook for the economy and the housing market. We are currently expecting the economy to grow well below potential for the next two quarters, before gradually improving over the course of next year. Our research suggests that the foreclosure crisis will get worse before it gets better, but our forecast is quite dependent on how far house prices fall.\nThe problems emerging in the subprime market have been well documented in the press and in speeches by other policymakers. Much of the focus has been on the problems of borrowers who are already in trouble, and close to or in the process of foreclosure. These borrowers are experiencing significant hardship and it is appropriate that many are focused on these problems. This group of borrowers is experiencing a very painful human toll, one that is likely to worsen as home prices slump. The toll is also difficult for neighborhoods, since foreclosures tend to cluster. These are issues we at the Fed, and I'm sure all of you, are very concerned about.\nHowever, today I want to focus on the borrowers in the subprime market who have received somewhat less attention - those borrowers who have subprime mortgages but are not yet in a position where foreclosure is imminent.\nSubprime adjustable rate loans have experienced significantly more difficulties - currently 12.4 percent of subprime adjustable mortgages are seriously delinquent.4 My particular focus today is on the other 87 percent that are not seriously delinquent, where action now may avoid future problems and foreclosures.\nMost of the problems are concentrated in 2/28 and 3/27 mortgages5 that have a fixed rate for the first 2 or 3 years and then float, frequently at rates 6 percent or more above a measure of short-term rates (usually the benchmark six month London Interbank Offered Rate, known as LIBOR).\nThese 2/28 and 3/27 mortgages have suffered from several misperceptions. First, the fixed rate for the first 2 or 3 years is often referred to as the teaser rate. However, the \"teaser\" is very different than what is experienced on many prime loan products. The teaser rate was not particularly low - nationally, the average rate on a 2006 subprime 2/28 mortgage was 8.5 percent, which would reset on average 6.1 percent over the benchmark LIBOR. Thfese high initial rates are not surprising because most of these mortgages were refinanced or the homes were sold prior to the mortgage being reset. Nationally, 71 percent of 2004 subprime 2/28 ARMS were retired in two years, and 88 percent in three years. In New England, 74 percent were retired in two years and 93 percent in three years.6\nRising house prices and the abundant availability of financing were key factors allowing the refinancings. This chart shows the relationship between house price growth and the foreclosure rate in Massachusetts. As a result many borrowers did not worry about the reset, since they had no intention to remain in the mortgage once the mortgage reset. Historically, loans incorporating a reset feature have not been a serious problem because borrowers could refinance out of the mortgage prior to the reset (somewhat contrary to conventional wisdom that views resets as the problem). But, importantly, this result is conditional on housing prices rising and loans being available - conditions that may not apply over the next several quarters.\nThe Policy Challenge: Aiding Borrowers in Trouble\nWith this background we can turn to the policy challenge. What can be done to aid that large pool of borrowers who are not in trouble now, but could be if falling housing prices and fewer active lenders make refinancing or selling more difficult?\nFundamentally, we want to encourage refinancing before a problematic reset. Banks may not have viewed this market as an engaging opportunity when mortgage brokers were going aggressively after the business, but banks may now find profitable lending opportunities in the current environment - perhaps, in some cases, with guarantees provided by Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan guarantees, or state programs.\nA brief discussion of guarantee programs, such as those provided by the FHA is probably warranted. The FHA program is designed to provide government guarantees on mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers. The underwriting standards are designed to provide low cost insurance that allows the borrower to qualify for a rate, because of the guarantee, that is closer to the rate on a prime mortgage. This results in a significant potential savings for borrowers relative to subprime loans, often a savings of 2 percentage points or more. The underwriting standards are designed to enable low and moderate income borrowers to afford a house and be able to continue to make payments over time. The loans provide financing for borrowers with as little as 3 percent equity, and do not require a minimum FICO score.\nHow many subprime borrowers might be able to refinance into bank mortgages or loans guaranteed by FHA or state programs? Some should be able to do so relatively easily. Our research suggests that nationally, 20 percent of securitized subprime loans had, at origination:\nfavorable loan-to-value (below 90 percent)\nfavorable credit ratings (FICO7 scores over 620)\nfull documentation\nand were identified as owner-occupied\nIn New England, the figure is even higher, at 26 percent. These borrowers may qualify for prime loans and/or loan guarantee programs.\nInstead of minimum credit scores, borrowers can provide a history of making payments to qualify for the FHA guarantee. Currently, 55 percent of the 2.2 million securitized subprime ARMS (not jumbo, and owner occupied) have not missed payments in the past year - that's 1.2 million borrowers. These subprime borrowers may meet the credit standards required for FHA guarantees or for similar state programs, with potentially a significant savings. In addition, fixed-rate options are available for borrowers no longer willing to use a floating-rate product.\nWhile the FHA program uses credit criteria beyond credit scores, many subprime borrowers had reasonable credit scores when they originally got their subprime loan. For all securitized subprime mortgages, at the time of origination 50 percent had FICO scores above 620 nationally (in New England the figure is even higher, at 71 percent).8\nHowever, there are significant challenges in refinancing borrowers. In Massachusetts, 8 of the 10 largest subprime \"specialists\" are no longer lending [See Table]. So to refinance a loan or to seek government-guaranteed loan products, many borrowers will need to seek out new lenders.\nFurthermore, FHA lending is underutilized, falling from about 16 percent of mortgage originations in 2000 to only 2.8 percent in 2006. 9 Unfortunately, FHA lending currently carries some issues and concerns - but also opportunities. First, most commercial and community banks are not FHA approved lenders. The largest FHA lenders in New England are not New England financial institutions.10 The program has been modernizing and there may be an opportunity for commercial and community banks to take a fresh look at whether being an FHA-approved lender is in their interest.\nSecond, FHA limits may be binding in high-cost areas like Boston. These limits have been raised over time and are currently $363,000 for single-family properties and about $461,000 for multi-family. Notably, multi-family properties account for 10 percent of homes in Massachusetts, but 27 percent of foreclosures. While potentially binding on some subprime loans, many loans to low and moderate income borrowers should be below the limits, and considering raising the limits in high cost areas probably makes some sense.\nThird, FHA is seen as slow and cumbersome by lenders and borrowers, not to mention less lucrative for brokers. This suggests opportunities to streamline the appraisal and approval process, and opportunities to better articulate underwriting. Furthermore, there seem to be opportunities to further modernize and fund FHA, so the program better evaluates and monitors risks. While the FHA has been making improvements to processes and products, which may be of some help, further efforts could help mitigate some of the subprime problems likely to emerge going forward.\nAnother area to explore involves state programs that may also be helpful. Notably, many states are considering new programs. Traditionally, many states had focused on first-time home buyers, but events suggest they may want to put more focus on the refinance of subprime mortgages.\nAll in all, FHA and state programs should be considered by lenders and borrowers. Many borrowers may qualify for existing programs. However, knowledge of the available programs among borrowers and lenders is limited. Ideally, borrowers should ask lenders about the programs, and more commercial and savings banks should consider the benefits of offering these programs.\nThere are also opportunities for FHA to look for ways to better meet subprime borrowers' needs.11 Greater outreach to borrowers and lenders seems needed. Potentially, FHA may want to raise loan amounts, if they are binding, in high cost markets. And of course there seems to still be a need to simplify and streamline the program for both borrowers and lenders. I should stress that our focus on the opportunities for the FHA program to play a role in alleviating this crisis does not represent advocating a government bailout of lenders, investors, or reckless borrowers. Rather, I am advocating using existing programs for what they were designed to do - provide an option for low- and moderate-income borrowers to obtain financing at more affordable rates.\nAnother consideration involves extending the terms of current subprime loans. Still-solvent subprime lenders should extend terms or refinance borrowers into fixed-rate loans wherever possible. Given the high teaser rates on most 2/28 or 3/27 loans, credit extensions or refinances of current loans may frequently be in both the borrower's and lender's interests. In addition, given the importance that securitization has played, those involved in securitization should look for additional ways to allow modification of securitized loans.\nIn summary, I want to stress that the continued availability of loans to subprime borrowers is important. We will continue to encourage banks to lend to qualified borrowers. And we encourage existing lenders to extend terms or refinance into fixed-rate products. Of course, for depository institutions, lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers is positive in terms of meeting Community Reinvestment Act responsibilities.\nIn closing, I just want to touch on a few Federal Reserve Bank of Boston initiatives in this area. I've already mentioned some of our research on mortgage markets, including the new working paper \"Subprime Outcomes: Risky Mortgages, Homeownership Experiences, and Foreclosures.\" Also, for some time now we have been tracking and analyzing foreclosures in New England and sharing the research. We also aim to provide straightforward information for consumers, in part through a new website we have launched called theinformedhomebuyer.org, and guides and brochures that we publish in both English and Spanish.\nIssues for Future Research\nAs a final note, I think it is useful to just mention some issues for further research that I think are well worth exploring, and may be quite fruitful. One involves the incentives that mortgage brokers have in transactions, and whether incentives can be better aligned to avoid these problems in the future.\nThe second involves the field of behavioral economics, something we are very interested in at the Boston Fed. The question is, should lenders be required to offer fixed rate loans, with the borrowers needing to actively opt out of the fixed rate loan in order to be offered an adjustable rate loan (or, should borrowers always be given, and have to make, a choice). Such proposals are beginning to surface in states (such as Massachusetts) and may be an experiment worth exploring. Research on things like 401k saving suggests that opt-out arrangements can influence behavior and outcomes.12\nIn closing I want to again thank MassINC and thank all of you for your attention to this important issue and its implications nationally and locally. Working with financial institutions, city and state governments, community organizations, regulators, and others, we at the Fed hope to play a constructive role in mitigating subprime mortgage problems.\nIn MA, 8 of the 10 largest subprime “specialists” are no longer lending\n  # Loans % of Subprime Purchase Mortgages Status\nOption One Mtg.

            "content": "Chairman Frank and Members of the Financial Services Committee, I am pleased to have this opportunity to share my thoughts on mortgage lending patterns in the Greater Boston area. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s responsibilities in the areas of community affairs and consumer education fall under me.\nThe past ten years have seen dramatic changes in the housing and mortgage markets, both nationally and here in the Boston area. Until recently, housing prices were rising rapidly. New lenders were entering the mortgage market and expanding aggressively. Homeownership was rising.\nThere were negative developments. The release of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data for 2004 provided information for the first time on the prevalence of mortgages with higher interest rates. These data showed that blacks and Latinos were much more likely to have higher rate loans than whites; Asians were less likely to have higher rate loans. The data also show that blacks and Latinos were more likely to be served by lenders specializing in higher rate mortgages. Patterns in New England and the Boston area were broadly similar to those nationally, although disparities for Latinos were somewhat more pronounced.\nAnalysis of the HMDa data by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University shows that minority borrowers were more likely to be served by independent mortgage banks and less likely to be served by CRA-regulated institutions than white borrowers, and their loans were more likely to be sold to private label conduits. In other words, minority borrowers were more likely to be served by subprime lenders. The 2005 and 2006 data show similar patterns. (HMDA data for New England metropolitan areas for 2004 and 2005 can be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s public web site at www.bos.frb.org/commdev/hmda/. Data for 2006 will be available shortly.)\nWhile these cost disparities were disturbing, many observers took comfort from the growing numbers of minority households who were sharing in the American dream of homeownership. Further, with housing prices rising, these households were presumably accumulating equity and building wealth.\nThe situation has changed markedly for the worse in the past year or so. Housing prices are no longer rising in much of the country. In the Boston area, prices have fallen according to some measures. Foreclosure initiations have picked up dramatically in Massachusetts. As a fraction of loans outstanding, foreclosure initiations per quarter in Massachusetts have risen from less than 0.2 percent in 1999 to 0.6 percent in the second quarter of 2007. The recent figure approaches, but is still lower than, the highs of the New England real estate bust in the early 1990s. From much lower than the national average, foreclosures in the state have risen to match those nationally. (Charts depicting these patterns can also be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s public website. Data are from the Mortgage Bankers Association through Haver Analytics.)\nForeclosures have also increased nationally, but the trend is not quite so stark because different regions exhibit somewhat different patterns. Some parts of the country, where economic conditions have been chronically weak and where housing prices did not show much appreciation, have suffered from relatively elevated foreclosure rates for some time. In contrast, the experience of the West Coast is similar to that in New England. Home prices were rising rapidly until recently and foreclosure rates were low. Now that prices are flattening or falling, foreclosures are rising sharply.\nThe rise in foreclosure initiations has been particularly pronounced for subprime loans with adjustable rates. In Massachusetts, the foreclosure rate (foreclosure initiations per quarter relative to loans outstanding) for subprime adjustable rate mortgages has risen from about 1 percent in 2004 to 4.5 percent in 2007. Although subprime adjustable rate mortgages account for less than 10 percent of mortgages in Massachusetts, they now account for 50 percent of foreclosure initiations. It should be noted, however, that while the foreclosure problem is particularly acute for subprime adjustable rate mortgages, foreclosure initiations have also increased for subprime fixed mortgages and prime adjustable rate mortgages.\nI have not seen foreclosure information by racial and ethnic group. The Massachusetts communities where foreclosures are highest include some with large minority populations, Brockton and Lawrence being particularly noteworthy, but some predominately white communities, such as Barnstable, have also seen sharp increases in foreclosures.\nUnfortunately, the foreclosure problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. In the recent past, with housing prices rising rapidly, borrowers who faced the prospect of an increase in their adjustable interest rate or ran into difficulties making mortgage payments could refinance, often withdrawing some of the increase in housing equity in the process. In a worse case scenario, they could sell their home. With housing prices no longer increasing, these options may no longer be available.\nAdditionally, many recent subprime borrowers face the prospect of substantially higher interest payments in the near future. What are commonly called 2/28 and 3/27 mortgages have been popular. These mortgages have an initial “teaser” rate that is fixed for two or three years before re-setting.  In fact, the teaser is not all that low. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been analyzing mortgages in Middlesex county using public information from the Registry of Deeds. This analysis is part of a larger study of mortgages in New England and it is very much a work in progress. But the preliminary work has produced some interesting findings.  Boston Fed researchers found that for 2/28 mortgages the initial rate was over 7 percent for mortgages originated in 2005 and over 8 percent in 2006. In both cases, the reset rates would be around 11 percent. Presumably, many of these borrowers expected to refinance before they faced that prospect.\nForeclosures are clearly very difficult for the borrower. They also have broader consequences.  The Boston Fed’s analysis of the Middlesex county data shows that about a quarter of recent foreclosures involved multi-family properties. While this suggests an investor element to the foreclosure problem, it also highlights a potentially serious spillover effect: tenants of foreclosed properties can frequently be evicted on short notice, even if they are current on rent and unaware of the property owner’s financial position. Additionally, clusters of foreclosures can have adverse effects on neighborhoods, driving down property values and contributing to vandalism.\nOptions for dealing with the foreclosure problem are frustratingly limited. Borrowers must be pro-active in seeking help. Many wait too long. Borrowers who run into difficulty with their mortgage payments or who anticipate difficulties should contact the servicer of their mortgage as soon as possible. They may need to be persistent, as mortgage servicers have not been staffed to handle problems of the current magnitude. Various non-profit organizations offer referrals and anti-foreclosure counseling programs. NeighborWorks America operates a hotline that will link callers to counselors who can evaluate the household’s financial strength, look into available resources, and sometimes negotiate with lenders. This counseling is very specialized and time intensive. \nUnited Way chapters have also “211” hotlines that can provide referrals to various social services organizations, including housing assistance programs.\nIn addition, some subprime borrowers may have the opportunity to transition from a subprime loan into a better product before their interest rates reset. Although subprime loans are generally regarded as loans to individuals with weak credit histories, Boston Fed researchers found that a significant fraction of the Middlesex county borrowers had respectable FICO scores. We do not know why. They may have a subprime loan because of other characteristics of the mortgage, perhaps a high loan- to-value ratio, or they may have been misplaced and received a more costly mortgage than their qualifications justified, or they may simply have gone to a subprime lender because it seemed easy to do so. In any event, these borrowers might – by shopping around – be able to refinance into another product.\nAs previously noted, “teaser” rates on many subprime loans are actually quite high – considerably above rates on prime loans. A borrower who has regularly met these teaser mortgage payments for over a year might be a promising candidate for a prime product. Certainly, they have demonstrated a capacity to make the payments.\nFinally, some subprime borrowers have owned their homes long enough that even with the recent softening in house prices, they have accumulated sufficient equity to allow them to refinance into a lower cost loan.\nThe subprime market was predicated on borrowers being able to refinance. The softness in the housing market has made this more difficult. In addition, because of recent problems, many mortgage banks specializing in subprime loans have run into difficulty securing financing to continue their activities. Mortgage banks do not hold mortgages on their books for any length of time. In order to make new loans, they must continually sell off the loans they have just made. As delinquencies and foreclosures have risen, buyers for these mortgages have dwindled.\nIt is very important that responsible subprime lending continue.  There may also be opportunities for banks and thrift institutions, which have lost market share to mortgage banks, to play a role in helping borrowers refinance. Eric Rosengren, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, has been meeting with bankers in New England to explore the possibilities for commercial banks to play a more active role in providing liquidity to this market. Most commercial and savings banks were not involved in originating subprime mortgages to a significant degree. They are well capitalized and at least some banks seem willing to consider whether there might be opportunities for them in this situation. Subprime borrowers who have reasonably high credit scores, who have accumulated equity in their homes, and who have track records of regular mortgage payments may be candidates for re-financing with banks.  But the time to act is now.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is creating a web site to help subprime borrowers locate useful resources, and we are trying to publicize the importance of borrowers considering all the options available to them before they run into difficulty. We hope to work with financial institutions, community groups, government officials and lawmakers, and other regulators to help address a very difficult situation.  Chairman Bernanke has previously testified on the actions being taken by the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce Portland, Maine\nIt is a pleasure to be back in Maine to give my first speech as a Federal Reserve Bank president. Since leaving Maine after graduating from Colby College in 1979, I have spent the bulk of my career - as a research economist, a bank regulator, and now a policymaker - studying the ways that problems in financial markets impact the real economy; as consumers, investors, bankers, businesspeople, regulators, and policymakers interact1.\nThis morning I would like to share some background on recent economic events, and then discuss recent stresses in housing and financial markets and how these have interacted with the rest of the economy. Let me add that my primary subject today is not the experience of subprime borrowers and the human toll of foreclosures - which is nonetheless a very important issue. Today, however, I will speak mainly about the wider ramifications in credit markets and the economy. This is a somewhat less vivid story, but one that we should also understand, because of the ways that financial- and credit-market matters impact each and every one of us in the economy.\nRecent Economic Events\nAs you can imagine, recent events have made this a very interesting time to be at the helm of a Reserve Bank. Prior to July, the U.S. economy appeared to be settling into a \"sweet spot.\" Inflation was edging down to below 2 percent, and the U.S. unemployment rate - at 4.5 percent - remained near historic lows.\nTo be sure, there were significant risks to staying in the sweet spot, not the least of which was the weakening of the housing sector. In addition, rising energy prices posed a threat to stable inflation, and to consumer spending. Emerging problems in the subprime mortgage market had captured some attention - particularly the significant rise in foreclosures on adjustable-rate subprime mortgages. But at the time, the prevailing view was that despite the pain for affected borrowers, problems in this sector would remain contained, and in fact, there were few signs of spillover into other credit markets.\nAs you know, circumstances since mid-year have changed significantly. Foreclosure and delinquency rates on subprime mortgages have continued to rise; house prices by some measures have fallen; and credit markets have been turbulent. This turbulence has been reflected in increases in interest-rate spreads between commercial and government debt; a decline in the liquidity of securities linked to riskier mortgages, arising from difficulty in obtaining reliable valuations of these securities; a related decline in asset-backed commercial paper used to finance short-term assets; and an unusual rise in the spread between the cost of short-term funding in Europe and the U.S.\nAs of mid-August, the combination of higher credit costs and in some cases reduced availability of credit threatened to weaken the U.S. economy. On August 17, the FOMC announced that \"the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably,\" and signaled its willingness to take appropriate actions to mitigate those risks. It followed that statement with a cut in the primary credit rate we offer to banks that borrow from the Federal Reserve, to just half a percentage point above the federal funds rate, and of course followed with a half a percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate at the meeting on September 18.\nResidential investment has been a major source of weakness in the economy for a year and a half. Forecasters who were predicting a recovery in the housing sector by the end of this year have been revising down their forecasts to incorporate the effect of rising mortgage defaults, financial turmoil, and softening housing prices.\nParticularly notable is the decline in housing prices in many regions of the country. Consumer spending is affected by households' net worth and housing equity is an important component of wealth. While the effect of the problems in housing on consumption has been muted to date, further and more widespread deterioration in housing prices would increase the risk of a more adverse impact on consumption.\nAs a reminder, housing prices in New England, including Maine, began to appreciate rapidly in the second half of the 1990s, and through the end of 2004 price increases in the region outstripped those nationally. Over the past year, prices in the region have barely increased and are down somewhat in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Prices in Maine have been holding a bit better than in the region as a whole. When housing prices were rising rapidly in New England, the number of foreclosures initiated was very low - considerably lower, as a fraction of loans outstanding, than nationally. Beginning in 2005, however, foreclosure initiations began to rise in the region, particularly for subprime adjustable-rate mortgages. The overall rate of foreclosure initiations is now roughly the same in New England - and Maine2 - as the nation.\nHousing Problems, Financial Markets, and the Economy\nThe housing sector, and the potential \"collateral damage\" from problems in the housing sector, is a significant component in the outlook for the economy. So the balance of my comments will focus on the interaction between housing problems and recent turmoil in financial markets.\nIn the spirit of this Chamber series, I'd like to address three major issues - in the form of questions:\nFirst, how did the problems in what was previously viewed as a relatively small, well-segmented market – subprime mortgages – spread to cause credit problems in so many other markets?\nSecond, given that subprime mortgages are at the epicenter of current problems, what can we do to help those households who find themselves in difficulty, as well as to prevent such circumstances from arising again?\nThird, should we view the current developments and concerns in credit markets as a wholesale reassessment (or “repricing”) of risk by investors, and are the recent problems related to securitizing assets likely to have a longer-lasting impact on the economy or financial markets?\nFirst Question\nBefore I provide the overview, let me hint at the punch line. The recent problems in financial and credit markets reflect a pulling back from what I would call \"surrogate securitization,\" whereby investors were willing to buy debt that had been assigned high credit ratings by the credit rating agencies, regardless of the underlying assets used in the securitization. In other words, investors basically delegated due diligence to the rating agencies.\nUtilizing ratings to help evaluate the riskiness of securities is a normal part of the securitization process. But when new securities arise, investors may need to exercise more caution as rating agencies themselves learn about the appropriate risk to attach to the new instruments.\nWhy should this concern not just central bankers, but all of us? Because disruptions in the ability to securitize assets have the potential to affect a much broader set of assets than just subprime loans, and increase the cost and reduce the availability of credit that consumers and businesses rely on. Let me begin with a few points about subprime debt and the role of securitization.\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than prime loans, often because of the borrowers' credit history.3 The loans carry higher interest rates reflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime loans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans, although a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nThe subprime market has grown dramatically in the past five years but is still small, relative to all domestic financial assets - the value of outstanding subprime mortgages is around $1 trillion, while U.S. holdings of financial assets total about $44 trillion. The vehicle used to finance the growth in subprime lending was securitization, which allows for a much larger pool of investors, resulting in a greater supply of loans, benefiting many borrowers.\nSecuritization of subprime loans relied on the reasonable premise that subprime loans might be more risky than prime, but the vast majority would not default and higher interest rates and fees would compensate for the costs of handling those that did. With securitization, pools of subprime loans were structured, so that \"riskiness\" was tiered. The expectation was that likely losses would be borne first by investors in the riskiest tier. Investors in this tier were akin to equity holders. If losses exceeded expectations, then investors in the intermediate tiers - essentially subordinated debt holders - would bear the loss. Investors in the least risky, highest-quality tiers were thought to be well protected from losses. Based on historical experience, 70 percent or more of the securities were viewed as relatively safe and could carry high investment-grade ratings. Often these higher quality securities were also repackaged into new securities, such as collateralized debt obligations, making the risk tiering even less clear to the investor. The elevated defaults we have already seen on recent vintages of subprime mortgages have resulted in losses for the highest risk tiers, and have caused investors to sell higher quality securities at a discount, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the accuracy of the investment-grade rating.\nIf the ratings were accurate, highly rated securities containing subprime debt would have only a remote chance of default - similar to investment-grade securities containing prime mortgages, home equity loans, or student loans. Unfortunately, underlying assumptions for the subprime market were inaccurate for several reasons I'll describe.\nFirst and most importantly, most parties involved in the process assumed that house prices would continue rising nationally. This assumption seems to have had the biggest impact on the situation we see today. Let me show you a chart our researchers have developed, which shows foreclosures and house price growth essentially mirroring one another [Chart 1]. Now, why is this the case? Earlier subprime securitizations had been issued when home prices were rising. In a strong housing market with rising home prices, a borrower who faced the prospect of an increase in an adjustable rate mortgage could probably refinance the loan, frequently with a withdrawal of some of the appreciated equity. This is borne out by the fact that the duration of subprime loans was relatively short, suggesting that borrowers were able to refinance into another subprime or prime loan prior to their rate re-setting at a higher level - as long as prices were rising. When prices stopped rising, the option of refinancing out of a mortgage with a rising borrowing cost became less available. Lenders' expectations also seemed to assume that prices would not drop (which, of course, diminishes the collateral that secures the loan for the lender).\nSecond, the subprime market has grown very rapidly in recent years, so such widespread use of subprime mortgages is a relatively new phenomenon. This limited history made it difficult to assess the likelihood of defaults if underlying economic conditions changed.\nAnd third, the increased reliance on mortgage brokers who originated the loans but had little stake after they were securitized was a departure from the traditional buy-and-hold strategy of many financial institutions. These brokers typically are compensated based on volumes of loans made and sometimes on the rates and fees as well; as a result, the brokers have few incentives to worry about the longer-term viability of the mortgage.\nAs defaults on recently issued subprime mortgages began to increase despite low and stable unemployment, concerns mounted about the accuracy of underlying assumptions for predicting defaults. Investors and rating agencies began to reevaluate the risk associated with all parts of the securitization.\nWhile holders of the riskiest slices, or \"tranches,\" of securitizations may have been surprised by the default experience, they certainly knew they were holding relatively risky assets. However, many owners of investment-grade tranches assumed they faced very low likelihood of experiencing losses. Many of the investors had done little or no independent credit analysis - they were confident enough in the ratings agencies that they did not need to independently evaluate the securities, did not worry about the underlying asset, and did not require a significant premium to hold the securities.\nToday the situation is very different. Defaults in the subprime market have resulted in even the most secure tranches of subprime securitizations selling at a sizable discount. Investors are now questioning the appropriateness of surrogate securitization, contemplating more independent analysis of the securities and underlying assets and the need to distinguish between securitizations with different underlying assets. These are appropriate considerations, to be sure, but until they are more confident, investors have been shying away from even investment-grade securitization. The problems in securitization are highlighted by the impact on jumbo mortgage loans. Because of difficulties in securitization, the cost of these loans has risen significantly [Chart 2]. This is particularly a problem in New England where the price of housing is quite high.\nA Second Question\nNow, to our second question. Given that subprime mortgages are at the epicenter of current problems, what can we do to help those households who find themselves in difficulty, as well as to prevent such circumstances from arising again?\nSubprime mortgages were particularly dependent on securitization for funding. Mortgage lenders, working through brokers, originated loans that were then securitized so investors could buy slices of the pooled assets. Brokers rely on volume and fee income. As home values flattened, or in some cases declined, it appears that more brokers \"stretched\" underwriting standards to maintain volume. Investors, still eager for higher-yielding, and still-highly rated, subprime tranches, continued to crave these securitizations. Brokers obliged and the 2006 vintage of loans, in particular, has seen notable rises in early defaults.\nAs investors lost confidence in the ability to evaluate securities whose underlying asset are subprime mortgages, many mortgage lenders found themselves with sharply limited access to funds to finance new subprime loans or refinance existing ones. The inability to refinance has been a key component of the recent rise in foreclosures. Many subprime borrowers refinanced several times in order to avoid rate resets that would further stretch affordability; and, our research shows, some withdrew additional household equity with each refinancing - a practice that many prime borrowers followed, too. However, if housing prices stop rising or fall, or if funding for refinance is disrupted, many borrowers no longer have the option of refinancing out of increasingly difficult financial circumstances, and may experience foreclosure. Foreclosure, it goes without saying, brings great stress and difficulty to the person affected, and can have disruptive effects that ripple through neighborhoods.\nTo better understand the subprime issue, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been studying publicly-available information from the Registries of Deeds in New England states, which allows us to study the patterns of mortgages issued on a given house over time. The researchers on this project -- Paul Willen, Chris Foote, Kris Gerardi, and Adam Shapiro - are finding some very interesting results.\nA first finding is that recent foreclosures have been disproportionately related to multi-family dwellings. In Middlesex County, Massachusetts, multi-family properties accounted for approximately 10 percent of all homes, but 27 percent of foreclosures in 2007. This highlights a potentially serious problem for tenants, who may not have known that the owner might be in a precarious financial position.\nSecond, the Bank's research shows that the duration of a subprime mortgages is on average quite short - for a sample of subprime mortgages used to purchase a home between 1999 and 2004, two-thirds have prepaid within two years and almost 90 percent have prepaid within three years. Prepayment will occur if the home is refinanced or if it is sold. While some of those sales may have been under difficult circumstances, it is plausible that many borrowers who purchased homes with subprime products did benefit from the appreciation of home prices in New England that occurred over the last decade.\nAs noted earlier, default rates for subprime mortgages were relatively low when house prices were appreciating, so that borrowers could refinance into another prime or subprime mortgage or sell their house. With the recent decline in home prices in New England, however, and the drying up of funding from former investors in subprime securitizations, conditions are far less favorable for borrowers who had hoped to refinance or sell before their subprime mortgage reset.\nHowever, our research suggests at least three factors may help in finding ways to mitigate the problem:\nFirst, many subprime borrowers have respectable credit histories. LoanPerformance data from Middlesex County show that almost two-thirds (64 percent) of borrowers who received subprime loans had FICO 4 scores greater than 620, and 18 percent had scores over 700. They may have been in subprime products because they chose to make a highly leveraged home purchase, or they may have been steered to a more costly mortgage for which they might have otherwise qualified. Either way, it is encouraging to note that these borrowers could be in a position to refinance to another product.\nSecond, many subprime borrowers have held their house long enough for it to appreciate, so they may now have sufficient equity in their house to facilitate refinancing into a prime product.\nThird, many borrowers of so-called \"teaser\" 2/28 5 mortgages were actually paying a much higher rate than is found on prime loans. The average \"teaser\" rate was 7.3 percent in 2005 and 8.35 percent in 2006 for loans located in Middlesex County in Massachusetts. This suggests that if these borrowers could qualify for a prime product, they would likely see a significant reduction in their interest rate.\nTrying to mitigate the current problems with subprime mortgages requires a balance - between providing credit to borrowers who might not otherwise be able to buy a house, and ensuring that the mortgage they get is appropriate for their financial position. In our research, we looked at what happened to homeowners who used subprime loans to buy their homes and found that five years later, 90 percent were either still in their house or had profitably sold it. While our research also shows that number will likely be lower for the most recent vintages, which already exhibit elevated defaults, most subprime buyers have a positive experience with homeownership.\nSo, perhaps the most critical issue is that financing that supports responsible subprime lending continues, despite recent problems. Since the broker channel has been disrupted, as described earlier, I believe there is an opportunity for commercial and savings banks to help provide liquidity in this market. Most commercial and savings banks were not involved in originating subprime mortgages and are well capitalized, and may have profitable opportunities to explore in this market.\nRecently, I have been meeting with bankers from all six New England states to examine the opportunities for commercial banks to get back into this market to help qualified borrowers obtain mortgages. They have shown some interest in the opportunities and have agreed to examine how we can encourage borrowers to pursue opportunities with banks before they get behind in their mortgage. To the extent that some subprime borrowers have improved their FICO score with regular payments, already had a high FICO score, or have appreciated wealth in their house, now is the time for these borrowers to seek lower cost financing opportunities. We know anecdotally that some Maine institutions have been active with outreach, and have been able to work with borrowers, particularly on refinancing 2/28 subprime mortgages into a fixed-rate mortgage or more traditional ARM.\nI am hopeful that financial institutions will play an important role in providing financing for many of the borrowers facing higher rates as their mortgages reset. In the past, rate-resets may not have been as problematic as they could be now, because borrowers had an easier time refinancing or selling.6 As we look at the situation now, we want to see borrowers continue to have the option to refinance, and want to see lenders continue lending - so that resets do not become an increasing problem. As I said a moment ago, perhaps the most critical issue is that financing that supports responsible subprime lending continue.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has created several brochures that are intended to help borrowers consider all their options, and we are creating a web site to help borrowers in subprime products to get information and help looking for refinance opportunities. Working with financial institutions, city and state governments, community organizations, regulators, and others, we at the Fed hope to play a constructive role in mitigating subprime problems.\nA Third Question\nNow our third issue for this morning: Should we view the current developments and concerns in credit markets as a wholesale reassessment (or \"repricing\" ) of risk by investors, and are the recent problems related to securitizing assets likely to have a longer lasting impact on the economy or financial markets?\nI think the answer is no, investors are not reassessing risk in a wholesale way. Consider that a variety of assets that normally are impacted by investor desire for risk reduction have shown little reaction to current problems. For example, if one looks at emerging market debt, or stock prices in emerging economies, the current problems have left little trace in the data [Chart 3]. Prices for stocks in many emerging markets are close to or at their highs for the year.\nBy contrast after September 11, 2001 and during the problems triggered by Long-Term Capital Management, stocks in many emerging markets fell sharply. Similarly, emerging market debt has shown only a modest widening of spreads. Following the September 11 attacks and during the Long-Term Capital Management problems, emerging market interest rates rose sharply.\nShort-term debt markets, where relatively low risk financial assets are traded primarily between large financial institutions, are experiencing significantly reduced volumes and unusually large spreads. This is consistent with liquidity problems rather than a change in the willingness to hold risky assets in general.\nAllow me to digress for a moment to touch on some unique aspects of the recent problem that may not be widely understood, but impact many of us that borrow for our businesses or households.\nUsually the overnight Eurodollar interest rate is very close to the overnight federal funds rate. Both are overnight, unsecured, dollar-denominated loans between financial institutions. Over the past two months the funds for overnight Eurodollar have frequently been trading at a much higher rate than overnight federal funds. This highlights the difficulty that some financial institutions are having borrowing in dollars, and the wariness of credit exposure to certain financial institutions.\nAnd these difficulties worsen when we look at one- to three-month maturities, versus overnight loans [Chart 4]. Consider something which may not be a \"household term\" to the layperson, the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate or LIBOR, which involves short-term borrowing of dollars by banks in Europe. One-month and three-month LIBOR remain very elevated and - here's the rub - this tightens credit for a variety of U.S. borrowers, since many loans to businesses and many floating rate mortgages are tied to the LIBOR rate. For example, many variable-rate subprime mortgages are tied to the LIBOR rate.\nOf course, we all want to consider whether the recent problems related to securitizing assets are going to have a longer lasting impact on the economy or financial markets. Securitizations have made it possible to efficiently finance pools of assets. In particular, investors with low risk tolerance were willing to buy what they thought were investment grade securities without a detailed understanding of the underlying assets as long as they had confidence in the ratings of the securities. To the extent that these investors have less confidence in ratings, they may choose to buy government or agency securities, where they do not need to make an independent analysis of potential credit risk. In part, this accounts for the reduction in rates on government securities relative to other financial instruments over the past two months.\nAnother symptom of what you might call the \"collateral damage\" from the end of surrogate securitizations has been the asset-backed commercial paper market7, where the outstanding stock shrank from an early August peak of nearly $1.2 trillion to $912 billion as of the end of September, as investors reevaluate the risks [Chart 5]. Asset backed commercial paper, or ABCP, would be issued to these short-term investors, with assets such as investment-grade securities from securitizations used to back the commercial paper. It offered lower-cost financing to companies as it was asset-backed rather than unsecured.\nAs questions have been asked on ratings of securities, many investors have chosen not to roll over commercial paper that was not backed by solid assets and did not have liquidity provisions provided by banks. This \"freeze-up,\" of course, means problems for financing a variety of assets, including mortgages, student loans, and home-equity loans.\nSecuritizations and asset-backed commercial paper are efficient ways to provide financing for a wide variety of assets. Unlike some types of liquidity issues, confidence in the ability to evaluate risk on securitizations is likely to return gradually. Some of the most aggressive securitizations and forms of ABCP may no longer be worth the risks to many short-term investors.\nThe alternative to securitizations and financing assets with commercial paper is financing by commercial banks. Fortunately, most banks are very well capitalized and have the ability to finance these assets. In fact, bank balance sheets did expand in both August and September, reflecting in part banks holding assets on their balance sheet that have been difficult to securitize. However, while banks have the capacity to finance many of these assets, it is likely that the cost of financing for these assets will increase if they are done by banks rather than through financial markets.\nMy expectation is that over time, investors will gain more confidence in their ability to evaluate the quality of ratings, and that conservatively underwritten securitizations and asset-backed commercial paper will find acceptance by investors. A reevaluation of ratings and the models used to determine ratings, and a greater onus on investors to understand the underlying assets and securities they are purchasing is likely to make these markets more resilient. However, this process of evaluation may take some time. While we have seen improvement in financial markets over the past month, we continue to observe wider spreads and reduced volumes on securitized products, which may remain until investor confidence has been restored.\nIn Conclusion\nIn summary, the past two months have been quite unusual for financial markets. Short-term liquidity has been disrupted for almost two months, as investors have reevaluated the securitization process. I am hopeful that with appropriate underwriting, the securitization process and the ABCP will continue to be a source of financing for a wide range of assets.\nIn the meantime, it will be important for banks to provide their usual role as a provider of liquidity during times of distress. While the subprime market that was the epicenter of the problem is likely to continue to have some difficulties, I am hopeful that financial institutions will play an important role in providing financing for many of the borrowers facing higher rates as their mortgages reset.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Contactless Payment Forum\nGood morning. Welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. And welcome to the 2007 Contactless Payment Forum, organized by the Bank's Emerging Payments Research Group.\nThe national payments system, on which we all depend, always has been changing. In recent years, however, the pace of change has accelerated. Moreover, the array of payment choices available to American consumers and businesses continues to expand.\nContactless payments, which you will be exploring today, promise to add more choices, with speed and convenience that would have been unimaginable not very long ago.\nChange comes in many forms. One of the most dramatic changes in U.S. retail payments is the increasingly rapid electronification of the check collection system. The U.S. check system took root at about the time of the Civil War. Check-writing became increasingly popular, and increasingly accessible to the broad population, throughout the 20th century.\nFor all of that time, the completion of a check payment required the physical delivery of the paper check back to the check-writer's bank.\nIndeed, when Congress established the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the Act charged the Reserve Banks to establish a unified national check collection system, because of the inefficiencies that had grown up around that requirement to transport and present paper.\nAll of that is changing now, and changing quickly. The use of digital image technology, and the federal Check 21 law that became effective in October 2004, are transforming check collection.\nNow, a bank collecting checks for its business and consumer customers can capture images and send them forward electronically. If the check-writer's bank will accept check images for presentment, the payment can flow through very quickly. If not, intermediaries such as the Reserve Banks can convert an image back into paper, what we call a substitute check, and present it to the check-writer's bank. This paper-to-image-and-back-to-paper model is a transitional stage we have to move through for awhile, until all banks can send and receive images. Even so, it speeds the collection of the checks and allows significant reductions in paper-handling and transportation.\nAnother way in which paper checks are being collected electronically is through conversion into electronic payments after the check has been written. The Automated Clearing House, or ACH, is the electronic mechanism through which we receive direct deposit of pay, and which we can use to set up automatic payment of recurring bills.\nIn recent years the ACH more and more has served as the infrastructure to support new electronic payment choices, such as on-line bill payment. It also has provided options for businesses and merchants to collect check payments electronically. About two and a half billion check payments mailed by consumers each year, for credit card bill payments and the like, now are being converted into electronic ACH payments by the billers. As a result, those paper checks never hit the bank collection system, and never come back to the check-writers.\nThe ACH also offers merchants the means to take a check at the cash register, capture the payment information immediately, and hand the check back to the customer. The payment will be collected electronically.\nAnother option, just introduced in March, enables the merchant to batch the day's check payments and convert them into a batch of ACH payments for electronic collection. Here again, no paper in the banking system, and no check coming back to the check-writer.\n\nPrior to the enactment of Check 21, and the advent of these ACH options for check conversion, the U.S. was experiencing a decline in the use of checks, particularly by consumers. That decline continues. It will be interesting to see whether these changes in how checks get collected influence consumer decisions about how to make their payments in the first place.\nWith respect to the decline in check writing, the 2004 Federal Reserve Payments Study revealed significant changes in consumer payment behavior. We saw for the first time that Americans were conducting more transactions electronically than by check. They have been moving away from checks, toward electronic payments, such as debit cards, credit cards, and ACH transactions. In 2000, the number of checks paid exceeded the number of electronic transactions, 42 billion to 31 billion. By 2003, the number of electronic transactions exceeded checks paid, 44 billion to 37 billion. These changes represent a 4.3 percent annual decline in checks paid, and a 13.2 percent annual increase in electronic transactions over that period, 2000 to 2003. The Federal Reserve Banks are conducting another survey now, to gather data through 2006. We will have results to share with you later in the year.\nThese studies help the Federal Reserve to formulate long-term plans for our own payments activities. The decline in check use has prompted the Reserve Banks to reduce by half the number of offices where we process paper checks. In 2003, the Reserve Banks had forty-five check-processing offices nationwide. We have 22 today, and we have announced plans to reduce to 18 processing locations by early 2008. Further consolidations are certain, as check volumes continue to decline, and as more checks are collected electronically. Already about a third of the checks deposited for collection at Reserve Banks are coming to us as electronic images instead of paper. We may get to 50 percent before the end of next year.\nWe hope our periodic studies also help financial institutions, and industry participants such as yourselves, to make better-informed decisions, including decisions about future investments in your payments technology.\n\nLooking ahead, cash is another paper-based payment method that will experience significant shifts.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we want to understand the cash substitution effect, and the extent to which consumers are using alternative payment methods. In a complementary effort to the Retail Payments Study, our national Cash Product Office has been pilot-testing a survey to understand trends in cash payments. The purpose of the survey is to understand better the use of cash and other payment methods, particularly the number and value of payments executed with different choices. The pilot study was completed just last month, and the results will be shared with the public later this year.\nA rapid decline in the use of cash in the near future seems unlikely. However, a number of developments, including the growing volume of low-value card payment transactions, and increasing acceptance of cards and other electronic-based instruments for purchases traditionally made with cash, have reinforced the view that the use of cash for transactions may not be as intensive as in the past. Some cash displacement is happening.\nContactless payments, today's subject, have the potential to displace cash for many lower-value payments. Around the world, contactless payments are increasing speed and convenience for consumers and merchants. In the U.S., we saw the early adoption of contactless payments in 2006 by certain merchant categories and leading financial institutions, and there will be more innovations to come.\nThe Federal Reserve is a proponent of fostering innovation in the payments system, and this includes reducing barriers to payments acceptance. In that regard, the Federal Reserve Board is considering an amendment to Regulation E. Under the proposal, a retailer can waive the receipt requirement for small-dollar electronic funds transfer of 15 dollars or less. On January 30 the comment period closed for the proposed amendment, and a decision will be made later this year. If adopted, this change could have a significant beneficial impact on the use of contactless and other payment cards.\nShifts in consumer behavior, technology, and rapid innovation, along with legal and regulatory changes, are reshaping the retail payments system. These shifts bring tremendous opportunities for us to innovate and pursue new directions. Successfully navigating this period of change will require collaboration. In the Federal Reserve, we want to be better at understanding the marketplace and anticipating its needs; we intend to listen to emerging market segments; we want to be adaptive, in our thinking and our activities. Holding forums such as this one helps us, and we hope it helps you.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to have an important role within a more-electronic retail payments system. We will continue to monitor developments within the payments system to understand their implications and to help the public to understand them. As a policymaking body, we will continue to promote the integrity and safety of the payments system while also supporting improvements in efficiency and accessibility. When appropriate, the Federal Reserve will act as a catalyst to greater efficiency, safety, and accessibility, as we have been doing with Check 21.\nThe Emerging Payments Research Group here in Boston was developed to assist in this effort. We established this Group late in 2004, and in its brief existence, the Group has held two conferences on consumer payment behavior, published a paper on this subject based on a national survey of Federal Reserve employees, produced an industry reference guide from interviews with experts, and more recently published a briefing on mobile payments. All that we have published is available on our website.\nOne of the roles of the Group is to share information and experiences which can inform stakeholders, including financial institutions, businesses, and consumers. The Group plans to continue to conduct research and analysis, and to publish additional briefings on emerging payment types, and the demand side of payments. You will be hearing more about the initiatives of the Emerging Payments Research Group from my colleagues later in the day.\nI am glad all of you are with us, and I hope you enjoy the Forum, and your time at the Bank. Thank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Bankers Forum Hartford, Connecticut\nThank you for being with us this evening. I would like to offer an update on the ongoing transformation of the U.S. retail payments system.\nChange in retail payments, and in the check collection system in particular, is occurring at an accelerating rate. This change brings some disruption, but it also brings progress. You may find it interesting to compare the change we are experiencing in the check system with the prior evolution of the Automated Clearing House system.\nYou may know the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, as the electronic payment mechanism through which your banks, and your customers, deliver direct deposit of pay and make recurring payments. More and more the ACH also is serving as the infrastructure for other electronic payment options, including on-line bill payment. The ACH is a very efficient electronic mechanism. However, it was not always so.\nFor many years the electronic ACH was not very electronic. Most banks were not connected electronically with each other, or even with the Federal Reserve in a way that would enable ACH payments to flow electronically.\nInstead, we moved electronic payments by shipping reels of magnetic tape from place to place. If you had stood in the lobby of our Bank on an evening in the 1980's, you would have seen people coming in and going out carrying large metal cases, inside of which were their magnetic tapes with ACH payments. So the payments moved as fast as people could carry them.\nMoreover, for the banks at greater distances from Boston, we delivered ACH tapes on trucks, the same trucks we deployed to deliver checks.\nTo go one better, we actually printed some ACH payments onto paper, for small-volume receivers in Maine, and delivered those \"electronic\" payments in paper form. So, when ACH was not very electronic, the Federal Reserve need 37 processing locations to support ACH services. Since physical delivery mattered, proximity to a processing site mattered.\nThen, technology improved, we made significant investments, and we worked with our customers, to build an all-electronic ACH: no more tapes, no more paper, no more trucks. Instead, we moved to electronic transmissions to send and receive payments, and to an all-electronic internal operation.\nToday our ACH runs on one central computer, and we have just 2 operational support centers nationally. You probably do not know where our ACH operations are. I will be happy to tell you, but the point is, you have no real need to know. It does not matter where your processing is done, how closely or how far away, in an all-electronic process.\nOf course, today's infrastructure is a lot less expensive than the old one. ACH prices today are a lot lower than they were in the late 1980's. Funds availability for you as a bank collecting payments is better.\nThis look at how the ACH evolved is relevant because the national check collection system now is evolving in the same direction. Check collection is becoming electronic.\nActually, three big changes are occurring at the same time, and together they will transform the check collection system of the country.\nFirst, American consumers and businesses are writing fewer checks.\nSecond, check collection is going electronic, spurred by the legislation, called Check 21, that became effective in the fall of 2004. Check 21 enables banks to convert checks into images, or digital pictures, and collect them electronically.\nAnd third, billions of checks written are being converted into electronic ACH payments before they hit the bank collection system.\nI will look quickly with you at all three of these changes.\nIn recent years the Federal Reserve has published two studies on the use of checks and other retail payment choices. The first reported data as of the end of 2000, and the second had data through the end of 2003. Later this year the Federal Reserve will complete and publish a survey with data through 2006. Meanwhile, our two published studies show declining numbers of checks, and growth in every electronic alternative.\nThe fastest rate of growth in recent years has been with debit cards. Credit cards and the ACH also are growing.\nThe rate of decline in the use of checks in the period from 2000 to 2003 was about 3 percent annually. I will be surprised if we do not see a greater rate of decline in our next survey.\n\nThe checks are going away. Still, we have a lot of them; maybe 30 billion or so annually. We will have billions of checks for years to come. They will be around long enough to warrant investment in a more efficient way to collect them.\nBanks in New England and across the country are taking that step and realizing the benefits. Electronic check collection is evolving rapidly.\nIn January, 2005, just a little more than 2 years ago, the Reserve Banks were receiving for collection close to one billion paper checks per month. Meanwhile, we were receiving almost no electronic images of checks for collection since the Check 21 law had just taken effect in October, 2004.\nBy January of this year, however, paper check deposits were down, to below 700 million per month, but deposits of electronic images had grown to nearly 250 million per month. The growth on the electronic side has been phenomenal.\nBefore the end of 2008, the Reserve Banks may be receiving more image deposits than paper deposits. We expect steadily lower overall volume, with electronic deposits taking over, and fewer and fewer paper deposits coming in the door.\nWe will have less paper going out the door, too. Banks have been quicker to collect checks electronically than to receive their check presentments electronically. However, once banks and their software and service vendors take the steps to receive checks in image form, they are able to take costs out of their back room operations. They do not have to sort incoming checks anymore, for instance.\nElectronic presentment is growing rapidly now, about a year after electronic deposit started to grow rapidly. Our volumes of image presentment were very small just a year ago. Now, the Reserve Banks' monthly volume is about 100 million, roughly 14 percent of our total presentment volume. We expect our current volume to double before year-end. Within two years or so we expect to be presenting more images than paper checks.\nThese are projections for the Reserve Banks. The large correspondent banks say that they are moving in the same direction.\nAs check collection becomes increasingly electronic, we should expect our infrastructure to change, just as we saw the national ACH infrastructure change.\nYou know that last year we consolidated our Boston check operations into our Windsor Locks Office. Nationally, we have consolidated from 45 check operations to 22, with further consolidation ahead. This year we are scaling down our national air transportation network for shipping checks among the Reserve Banks, because we have fewer checks to ship, and because we can collect the checks faster electronically.\nAs we make these infrastructure changes, a bank still depositing and receiving paper will have some adverse effects from the longer distances to deliver and receive the paper, and from some reduction in funds availability. A bank depositing and receiving check images will be immune from these changes, can snooze right through them, and actually will be enjoying better funds availability and later deposit deadlines than ever were available in the paper-based system.\nSo far have seen that fewer checks are being written. We have seen that electronic check collection is growing rapidly.\nThe third big change is the conversion of checks into ACH payments. The outstanding example is the Accounts Receivable Conversion product, or ARC. This product has grown from nothing five years ago to more than 2 billion transactions in 2006.\nUnder ARC, a company with a lockbox operation to process consumer bill payments, such as mortgage and credit card payments, can receive the checks through the mail and convert them into ACH payments. Each payment is collected electronically, through the ACH, and shows up on the check-writer's bank statement as an electronic debit, usually labeled \"ARC\" , instead of as a paid check.\nIn this model, the consumer has not changed behavior; she still writes and mails a check. However, the check never comes into the bank collection system.\nThere is a new, similar ACH option just coming into the marketplace now. As of March 16 of this year, we have the Bank Office Conversion model, or BOC. This model allows a retailer to receive checks as payment, and then, in a \"back office\" operation, convert the checks into ACH payments and collect them electronically.\nThe BOC model brings to retail stores and other businesses essentially the same opportunity that the ARC model has brought to lockbox operations.\nHere also, the consumer does not have to alter her behavior. She can pay by check at the cash register as before. The payment will hit her bank account as an ACH payment.\nSome merchants have been asking for this product for quite awhile. The National Automated Clearing House Association, or NACHA, projects 3 billion BOC conversions by 2012.\nYou may have seen yet another ACH retailer option, called Point of Purchase, or POP. In this model the customer pays by check at the cash register, the check-out clerk captures the information from the bottom of the check, and the amount of the check, and then hands the check back to the customer. Again, the payment is collected electronically through the ACH.\nPOP has not grown rapidly, partly because it requires equipment at every register, partly because it can cause confusion and slow down the check-out line. However, some industry sources anticipate further growth.\n\nSo: check-writing is declining; check collection is going electronic; and checks are being converted into electronic payments.\nIt is clear that the costs to collect checks in paper form, whether through the Federal Reserve or through other channels, will increase as volumes decline. It is clear that collecting and receiving your checks electronically will save your banks money and speed the collection of funds for your customers. I encourage you to learn more about how to make use of Check 21 and gain the benefits of electronic check collection. Thank you.",

            "content": "Burlington, Vermont\nAnother January has rolled around - to me, anyway, they seem to come faster every year. The holidays are over, and the reality of a new year has set in. Thus, it's a good time to stop and reflect on where we've been and what the economy might have in store for us. In that spirit, I'll begin with a short review of the past year and say a little bit about the local situation here in Vermont. Then I'll talk about my national forecast. As always, the views I express will be my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nTo preview: the economy has come through the last year pretty well, successfully making a difficult transition from above trend growth rates early in the year to a slower pace, with solid job growth and low unemployment. Inflation has been and remains a challenge, though recent data provide a bit of assurance that price pressures may be beginning to ebb. Our best guess at the Boston Fed is that 2007 will bring continued moderate growth, with GDP at or a bit below potential, unemployment likely remaining below 5 percent, and core inflation gradually declining. Has our economy once again reflected the amazing resilience that enabled us to meet the challenges of Y2K; the tech boom and bust; 9/11; the Iraqi war; a variety of geopolitical tensions; more than one energy shock, and now a cooling housing market? Are we on a trajectory to that sought after but hard to obtain \"soft landing?\" So far, so good, though there are risks and I will talk about them.\nBut first let's start by looking back to a year ago. At this time last year, the economy was growing robustly. After strong years in ‘03 and ‘04, real GDP rose at better than 3 percent in 2005, and was on course to expand at an even stronger 5.6 percent in the first quarter of '06. On January 9, the stock market closed above 11,000 for the first time since June 7, 2001, and longer term debt yields were equally, if somewhat surprisingly, accommodative. Unemployment hit 4.7 percent in January, and remained below 5 percent for the rest of the year. The economy was cooking along nicely, although perhaps the heat was turned up a bit too high.\nAnd not all signs were positive. For one thing, oil price increases were poised to affect both growth and inflation. After rising through most of 2005, spot prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil began 2006 at about $60 a barrel, and continued to climb, exceeding $75 by mid-year before dropping back to about $60-$65, where they remained at year's end. The summer travel season saw the impact of both higher prices and seasonal demand, and anecdotes abounded about the toll high gasoline prices were taking on retailers, hotels, and recreational businesses as consumers' pocketbooks were pinched. Concerns were raised about both the potential for weakening demand, and the upward impact on prices -- virtually the recipe for a central banker's nightmare.\nOn the inflation side, core CPI, that is consumer prices net of food and energy costs, ran at an annual rate of just over 2 percent in the first quarter. Then core CPI accelerated to almost 2.5 percent in the second quarter, and to 2.8 percent in the third. The headline numbers, those including food and energy, rose even more dramatically, with headline CPI topping out at an annual pace of 5 percent in the second quarter.\nAs you know, while the costs of food and energy are important to all of us, such costs can spike temporarily due to shortages, such as those that occurred with the devastating hurricanes in the fall of 2005. What concerns policymakers is if these cost spikes feed through to the broader economy -- to prices of non-oil goods and services -- as a result of lengthy supply problems or burgeoning demand or some combination of the two. Thus, the strength in both U.S. and global demand in '05 and '06, combined with rising energy costs, heightened Federal Reserve concerns about inflation. And the rise in core price measures in early '06 did nothing to assuage those concerns. The Fed continued raising the key policy interest rate -- the overnight Federal Funds Rate -- at each of its first four meetings in 2006, a process which had begun two years earlier. By late June, the rate stood at 5.25 percent, in my view very much in keeping with the risks facing the economy.\nThis slow but steady rise in short-term interest rates, and a related gradual erosion in housing affordability, intensified a slowing in the housing market that had begun in 2005. Truth be told, however, just as \"trees don't grow to the sky\", U.S. housing markets had to cool off after a good five or more years of rapid escalation, as price growth outstripped income growth, and demographically driven demand eased off. By early '06, a number of housing construction and sales indicators were deteriorating; by second half, all were falling and certain areas saw some actual home price declines. So far, however, such decreases have not been large or widespread geographically. In fact, according to the best national measures from OFHEO, prices have only decelerated, not declined.\nBut any protracted weakness in housing can make consumers nervous-houses are, after all, a major source of most household wealth, and given the proliferation of new financing methods, have become a source of liquidity as well. Reports on housing activity have consistently come in a little worse than expected, though very recent data on home buying attitudes, new home sales, mortgage applications and slowly declining inventories of unsold homes suggest some bottoming out may be at hand. As of now, our best estimate is that the housing slowdown will shave a percentage point or so off GDP in the second half of 2006.\nOutside of housing, however, much of the rest of the economy seemed to fare pretty well. Rising corporate profits and healthy margins continued to reflect strong corporate balance sheets and productivity growth. Non-residential construction surged as industries looked to add to capacity, after some years of slow capital spending. In fact, at least until quite recently when measures of business spending weakened, non-residential construction served to offset a portion of the impact of the housing investment slowdown. And businesses continued to hire as well, with monthly job increases more than meeting the level necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force, taking into account that demographic factors probably have likely reduced that level from what it was in the late '90s. More jobs meant rising incomes. Lower oil prices by year end also increased the purchasing power of disposable income. And with the impetus of a strong stock market, real personal consumption grew at a solid 2.7 percent in the third quarter, and likely exceeded that growth rate in the fourth.\nSpending on autos was off a bit, and certainly the large domestic manufacturers -- the traditional Big Three -- have faced more than a few challenges. But Bank staff believe this took only a small toll on the economy, with the so-called \"transplanted\" firms -- the foreign auto firms producing cars in U.S. factories -- picking up market share. Inventories of manufactured goods, particularly goods related to housing and autos, rose and measures of manufacturing strength dipped in the fourth quarter as supply was trimmed in the face of cooling demand. Many suggested, however, that business purchases of high-tech goods were off, in part, as a result of the delay of the new Microsoft operating system. On the plus side, the cumulative effects of several years of dollar depreciation and relatively strong economic growth among our trading partners resulted in better net trade data, and some stabilization in measures of the country's indebtedness to the rest of the world.\nTurning to Vermont, growth appears to have been relatively subdued over the past year, with payroll employment in the state increasing at less than 1 percent from November to November, compared to U.S. growth over the year of nearly 1.5 percent. Over the past five years, however, growth in Vermont has generally tracked that of the nation. This is a markedly stronger performance than New England as a whole; Connecticut and Massachusetts, in particular, were hit hard by the 2001 recession and employment is either not yet back to the levels of the late '90s, in the case of Massachusetts, or just over it.\nIt should also be noted that the fraction of workers who are self-employed is somewhat larger in Vermont than the nation. The activities of the self-employed are not captured in the payroll employment figures. Construction workers, artists and entertainers, professional and technical people are all a little more inclined to work for themselves in Vermont than the country as a whole. With an unemployment rate of only 3.7 percent in Vermont in November, and 3.3 percent here in the Burlington area, it would seem that those who want to work can do so. Nationally, the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent in November and the regional rate was roughly the same.\nSo far, Vermont has been weathering the housing downturn better than either the nation or the rest of New England. Construction activity, as measured by housing permits, seems to be holding up better; and the OFHEO index of home prices shows continued appreciation in Vermont. The housing boom came somewhat later to Vermont than to other parts of the region, and it has not been quite as pronounced, giving some reason to be optimistic that any adjustment will also be less sharp. Beyond this, if the national economy continues to grow as I expect it will, it would seem that Vermont should as well. There are longer-term issues facing the state--very slow population growth and an aging population--just to name two. These concerns are shared elsewhere in New England, with Massachusetts and Rhode Island probably seeing the worst of the trend. But for now, Vermont seems well poised for the new year.\nSo what do I think is in store for the nation in '07? I expect growth to continue at a moderate pace through the last quarter of 2006. This reflects sustained consumer spending and business investment, offset, in part, by fallout from the housing market and the manufacturing inventory swing that is underway largely in the housing and motor vehicle sectors. Then, I expect growth to accelerate modestly as 2007 progresses, with the housing and inventory situations gradually ebbing. With a growth path at or slightly below potential, unemployment is likely to remain below 5 percent while core inflation should continue to ease.\nOf course, risks abound, both to growth and inflation. What are the chances the economy in '07 will be weaker than I have forecast? The most likely culprit would be a longer and deeper contraction in housing markets than now expected -- one that hits not only residential construction but also consumption spending harder than forecast and, through consumers, reduces business profits and spending. This could happen if home prices fall significantly nationwide, affecting not just investment in residences but also how wealthy consumers feel. A significant change here could cause consumers to spend less and save more than now expected, a good thing over the longer run given this country's savings/investment gap, but difficult over the short term -- especially given the forecast of moderate growth overall.\nAnd some have argued that new forms of mortgage financing may have exacerbated both increased spending out of rising home equity on the upside, and contraction on the downside as falling prices eliminate a major source of household liquidity. This is hard to see empirically, but some communities, where mortgage foreclosures have risen as these new forms of financing reprice, are clearly seeing the negative aspects of the broad access to credit these new instruments provided.\nAnd there are other signs beyond housing that may be flashing yellow on growth vulnerability. Certainly, many have focused on what long-term Treasury yields of 50 basis points below the overnight federal funds rate might be telling us about the probability of a downturn. There are several possible alternative explanations for this phenomenon, but it does raise one's antennae. Very recent indicators of business spending such as the inventory buildup have been less-than-sparkling. Consumer sentiment data has been more positive of late, but Gallup polls suggest the share of those who see economic conditions as good or excellent is lower than one might expect, and exit polls after the election also suggest that concerns about the economy, while not necessarily driving the election results, played a key role.\nSome consumer pessimism could stem from a sense that many workers and their families may have that they are not sharing much in recent economic growth. In the nonfarm business sector, inflation adjusted compensation growth fell short of productivity by 2 percentage points or more for several years until 2006. This slow wage growth occurred even as business profits were at historically high levels, causing worry that workers are not getting their fair share of the pie. Indeed, median household income fell in real terms in every year from 1999 to 2004, and even though it rose slightly in 2005 -- the latest year for which we have data -- it was still only at about 1998 levels. All of this begs the question -- could some combination of housing downturn and pressures on consumers produce a much slower rate of growth than now expected?\nWhile possible, in my view this is not likely for a number of reasons. First, a nationwide drop in house prices fairly measured would be unprecedented, at least for any extended period of time. Indeed, as I noted before, there are signs that the real estate market may be bottoming out and prices firming, though residential investment growth is likely to be negative for some time. Second, employment trends remain solid, and equity markets upbeat, counteracting the impact on consumer wealth and spending from flattening or even falling home prices in some areas.\nThird, the rest of the world is expected to grow at a pace that equals or surpasses the U.S. Domestic demand abroad combined with a lower dollar should continue to improve the balance of net exports. And finally, U.S. businesses continue to experience solid profits, and business spending, though affected by the inventory issues mentioned earlier, seems likely to rebound in the spring especially in high-tech. Thus, while the consumer could be harder hit than we now expect, I believe the best bet is still that the same resilience that has marked the last decade or so will continue as the economy picks up some speed in '07 and a bit more in '08.\nSo that brings up the other risk facing us -- will inflation ease off as expected, or will upward price pressures remain? Could all the positive aspects of our economy -- growing employment, supportive financial conditions, strong corporate profitability and solid worldwide economic growth -- begin to stress labor and product markets, putting pressure on already elevated rates of inflation? A couple of cautionary notes. As I noted earlier, wage growth trailed productivity for most of the last several years. This pattern changed a couple of years ago, and as a result, unit labor costs rose. This is good news for workers, and given the record-setting corporate profit margins of the past year, firms ought to be able to manage rising wage costs, particularly in the context of continued solid, if a bit slower, productivity growth. But one should not ignore the balance of supply and demand in labor markets with unemployment as low as it is. The decline in oil prices we saw last year was certainly welcome, and helped to bring inflation down from its mid-year peak. But absent further declines, lower energy costs probably won't bring about much of an additional decrease in inflation this year.\nPrice stability, so vital to stable economic growth, is a key goal for the Federal Reserve. With unemployment low, and other measures of economic capacity suggesting resources are being fully used, it is not surprising that the Federal Open Market Committee has stressed the risks to inflation in its recent statement and minutes. After all, if inflation were to escalate, restraining it could require a period of sub-par economic growth. Contained inflation expectations on the part of markets and the public contribute importantly to restraining inflation going forward. In that regard, it is encouraging to note that despite dramatic swings in headline inflation, and a steady rise in core data, inflation expectations, as best they can be measured by market and survey data, suggest markets and the public believe inflation will remain well-contained. Managing the risks around that seems to me to be the key issue facing the central bank at this juncture.\nIn sum, the past year has seen the U.S. economy make a difficult transition from higher to slower rates of growth, while maintaining a solid employment trend, good corporate profit growth, and optimistic equity markets. Similarly, the rest of the world has grown as well, even against a backdrop of significant geopolitical uncertainty. I expect U.S. economic growth to accelerate slightly this year, unemployment to remain low, and price pressures to ease a bit. There are risks to this outcome to be sure, but I believe that with the continued resilience of the consumer, and policymaking that is focused on managing inflation, my sense of cautious optimism will turn out to have been justified.",

Truth be told, however, just as \"trees don't grow to the sky,\" U.S. housing markets had to cool off after a good five or more years of rapid escalation, as price growth outstripped income growth, and demographically driven demand eased off. By early '06, a number of housing market indicators were deteriorating though starts remained positive. By the second half of the year, however, starts dropped off as did sales of both new and existing homes, and certain areas saw some actual home price declines. So far, however, such decreases have not been large or widespread geographically. In fact, according to the best national measures from OFHEO, prices have only decelerated, not declined. But any protracted weakness in housing can make consumers nervous-houses are, after all, a major source of most household wealth, and given the proliferation of new financing methods, have become a source of liquidity as well.

On the plus side, the cumulative effects of several years of dollar depreciation and relatively strong economic growth among our trading partners resulted in better net trade data, and some stabilization in measures of the country's indebtedness to the rest of the world.\nThus, as the year ended, the economy seemed to have completed that difficult down-shift in tempo, often referred to as a soft landing. On the inflation front, pressures seemed to ease a bit as November headline CPI grew at an annual pace just under 2 percent and core CPI was flat for the month. But for the 12-month period as a whole, core remained close to its third-quarter high, suggesting inflation may be slow to taper off.\nTurning to Connecticut, the state has seen slow but steady growth for over two years. This is reflected in the unemployment rate which is essentially the same as the national average and well below the state's early 2003 high of almost 6 percent. However, job growth has been slow during this period. Payroll employment in November was up only 0.6 percent compared to a year earlier, while national growth was more than double that. Manufacturing and construction employment was flat or declining, but, like the nation, services employment grew nicely -- particularly education and health services and financial activities.\nThe significance of financial activities is sometimes overlooked. Finance and insurance account for about 8 percent of employment in Connecticut, but 17 percent of labor compensation - double the share of that sector nationally and more than any other sector of the Connecticut economy. Thus, while other sectors in the state employ more people, none contributes as much to the earnings of the state. And overall, earnings and related incomes in Connecticut remain strong with the state retaining its spot as the state with the highest per capita income. Of course, a high cost of living goes along with this high income level, a concern that is shared by other New England states, most notably your neighbor Massachusetts.\nAs in the nation, Connecticut is currently experiencing a sharp decline in housing activity. The number of new housing permits in November was more than 40 percent below the level of a year ago. Sales of existing homes were also off sharply. Home prices seem to be holding up relatively well, however. According to the OFHEO index, prices in the third quarter were still 6 percent above the year before, although most of this gain took place in late 2005 and early 2006. There has been a pickup in foreclosures as there has been elsewhere in the region. But the state's foreclosure rate is less than that for New England states overall, and below that for the nation as a whole.\nFinally, let me mention an aspect of the state's longer term health that has received considerable attention -- recent demographic trends including net-out migration and an aging population. These concerns are shared to varying degrees by all the New England states, most particularly Massachusetts.\nThese concerns are clearly understandable. The state's population grew only 3 percent from 2000 to 2005 compared to growth of 5 percent nationally. But we should put this into perspective. Such growth was a relative improvement over the 1990s, when the state grew only 3.6 percent over the entire decade, while the nation grew almost 4 times faster. Despite Connecticut's recent weak employment growth, net out-migration over the past five years was half the level during the period 1995 to 2000 and immigration from abroad has been robust. And while it is true that Connecticut's population is older than the nation's, it is not older by New England standards. Maine and Vermont rank at the top in terms of median age, while Connecticut is a relatively young #8.\nI do not mean to trivialize concerns here as state leaders try to tackle the real challenges the state faces, but at least for the current cycle Connecticut seems likely to continue to benefit from the health of the national economy. Connecticut's economic performance over the past year has been quite solid; the state's businesses seem to be providing jobs for those who want work, and attracting an inflow of mature, educated workers and immigrants; incomes are high and rising, and the state stars in the important area of financial services. Nothing is without risks, of course, and there are longer-term issues both in this state and others in New England, but '06 seems to have left Connecticut well positioned for the new year.\nSo what do I think is in store for the nation in '07? I expect growth to continue at a moderate pace, in the neighborhood of 2 percent in the last quarter of 2006. This should reflect sustained consumer spending and business investment offset in part by fallout from the housing market and the manufacturing inventory swing that is underway largely in the housing and motor vehicle sectors. Then, I expect growth to accelerate modestly as 2007 progresses, with the housing and inventory situations gradually ebbing. With a growth path at or slightly below potential, unemployment is likely to remain below 5 percent while core inflation should continue to ease.\nOf course, risks abound, both to growth and inflation. What are the chances the economy in '07 will be weaker than I have forecast? The most likely culprit would be a longer and deeper contraction in housing markets than now expected -- one that hits not only residential construction but also consumption spending harder than forecast and, through consumers, reduces business profits and spending. This could happen if home prices fall significantly nationwide, affecting not just investment in residences but also how wealthy consumers feel. A significant change here could cause consumers to spend less and save more than now expected, a good thing over the longer run given this country's savings/investment gap, but difficult over the short term -- especially given the forecast of moderate growth overall.\nAnd some have argued that new forms of mortgage financing may have exacerbated both increased spending out of rising home equity on the upside, and contraction on the downside as falling prices eliminate a major source of household liquidity. This is hard to see empirically, but some communities, where mortgage foreclosures have risen as these new forms of financing reprice, are clearly seeing the negative aspects of the broad access to credit these new instruments provided.\nAnd there are other signs beyond housing that may be flashing yellow on growth vulnerability. Certainly, many have focused on what long-term Treasury yields of 50 basis points below the overnight federal funds rate might be telling us about the probability of a downturn. There are several possible alternative explanations for this phenomenon, but it does raise one's antennae. Very recent indicators of business spending such as the inventory buildup have been less-than-sparkling. Consumer sentiment data has been more positive of late, but Gallup polls suggest the share of those who see economic conditions as good or excellent is lower than one might expect, and exit polls after the election also suggest that concerns about the economy, while not necessarily driving the election results, played a key role.\nSome consumer pessimism could stem from a sense that many workers and their families may have that they are not sharing much in recent economic growth. In the nonfarm business sector, inflation adjusted compensation growth fell short of productivity by 2 percentage points or more for several years until 2006. This slow wage growth occurred even as business profits were at historically high levels, causing worry that workers are not getting their fair share of the pie. Indeed, median household income fell in real terms in every year from 1999 to 2004, and even though it rose slightly in 2005 -- the latest year for which we have data -- it was still only at about 1998 levels. All of this begs the question -- could some combination of housing downturn and pressures on consumers produce a much slower rate of growth than now expected?\nWhile possible, in my view this is not likely for a number of reasons. First, a nationwide drop in house prices fairly measured would be unprecedented, at least for any extended period of time. Indeed, as I noted before, there are signs that the real estate market may be bottoming out and prices firming, though residential investment growth is likely to be negative for some time. Second, employment trends remain solid, and equity markets upbeat, counteracting the impact on consumer wealth and spending from flattening or even falling home prices in some areas.\nThird, the rest of the world is expected to grow at a pace that equals or surpasses the U.S. Domestic demand abroad combined with a lower dollar should continue to improve the balance of net exports. And finally, U.S. businesses continue to experience solid profits, and business spending, though affected by the inventory issues mentioned earlier, seems likely to rebound in the spring especially in high-tech. Thus, while the consumer could be harder hit than we now expect, I believe the best bet is still that the same resilience that has marked the last decade or so will continue as the economy picks up some speed in '07 and a bit more in '08.\nSo that brings up the other risk facing us -- will inflation ease off as expected, or will upward price pressures remain? Could all the positive aspects of our economy -- growing employment, supportive financial conditions, strong corporate profitability and solid worldwide economic growth -- begin to stress labor and product markets, putting pressure on already elevated rates of inflation? A couple of cautionary notes. As I noted earlier, wage growth trailed productivity for most of the last several years. This pattern changed in '06, and unit labor costs rose. This is good news for workers, and given the record-setting corporate profit margins of the past year, rising wage costs ought to be manageable, particularly in the context of continued solid, if a bit slower, productivity growth. But one should not ignore the balance of supply and demand in labor markets with unemployment as low as it is. The decline in oil prices we saw last year was certainly welcome, and helped to bring inflation down from its mid-year peak. But absent further declines, lower energy costs won't bring about much of an additional decrease in inflation this year.\nPrice stability, so vital to stable economic growth, is a key goal for the Federal Reserve. With unemployment low, and other measures of economic capacity suggesting resources are being fully used, it is not surprising that the Federal Open Market Committee has stressed the risks to inflation in its recent statement and minutes. After all, if inflation were to escalate, bringing it back under control would require policy changes that restrict short term growth even further. Contained inflation expectations on the part of markets and the public are crucial to the price situation going forward. In that regard, it is encouraging to note that despite dramatic swings in headline inflation, and a steady rise in core data, inflation expectations, as best they can be measured by market and survey data, seem to suggest markets and the public believe inflation will be well-contained. Managing the risks around that seems to me to be the key issue facing the central bank at this juncture.\nIn sum, the past year has seen the U.S. economy make a difficult transition from higher to slower rates of growth, while maintaining a solid employment trend, good corporate profit growth, and optimistic equity markets. Similarly, the rest of the world has grown as well, even against a backdrop of significant geopolitical uncertainty. I expect U.S. economic growth to accelerate slightly this year, unemployment to remain low, and price pressures to ease a bit. There are risks to this outcome to be sure, but I believe that with the continued resilience of the consumer, and policymaking that is focused on managing inflation, my sense of cautious optimism will turn out to have been justified.",

            "speech_title": "Three Initiatives In Payments",
            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Bankers Forum Northampton, Massachusetts\nThis evening I would like to share some information with you about three important Federal Reserve initiatives in the payments system. All of them advance the goal of a more electronic retail payments system for the country. And the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has an active role with all of them.\nThese three initiatives are: the growth of Check 21, for electronic collection of checks; a new service to help banks to manage their risks with Automated Clearing House, or ACH payments; and the rapid growth in the use of stored value cards by the U.S. military, supported by your Boston Reserve Bank.\nEarlier this year we consolidated our check operations for all of New England into one large operation, in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Thank you for your patience with us as we worked through that transition. It was a big project for us, and it affected our customers as we took some time to train new people, straighten out transportation, and adjust to very tight nightly deadlines.\nWe have been in steady state for awhile now. However, steady state now is different from the old steady state. It takes longer for some of our customers to get their checks to us in Windsor Locks, and it takes longer for us to present checks back to them.\nThis same pattern of fewer Federal Reserve check offices and longer distances is appearing across the country. It reflects the declining use of checks in the United States, and banking consolidation as well.\nAt the beginning of 2003, the Federal Reserve had 45 check processing locations nationally. Now, we have 22. The number will continue to decline as check volumes decline. This change is hard for us to manage, but we are managing it. Moreover, we favor it, because a more electronic, less paper-bound payments system is beneficial for the public.\nFor some years to come, though, your banks, and the Federal Reserve, will have checks to collect. The job will get more challenging, and more expensive, as volumes diminish and geographic distances between processing locations increase.\nThe solution is Check 21, or electronic collection of checks using image technology. This solution really has caught on since the federal law enabling Check 21 went into effect in October, 2004.\nCurrently 98 banks depositing checks for collection with us in Windsor Locks are giving us electronic images instead of paper checks. Another 86 institutions are giving us their paper and asking us to convert their checks into images for electronic collection. On an average night Windsor Locks receives 240 thousand checks in image form, or about 18 percent of our collection volume. All of this has developed in less than two years.\nThe receipt of images from the Federal Reserve, on what we call the presentment side, has grown more slowly, since banks have more internal changes to make before they can take in and process images in place of paper. However, it is growing. Right now we are presenting 142 thousand items in image form, or about 7 percent of our daily average local presentment volume.\nNationally, the Reserve Banks are receiving about 17 percent of checks for collection in image form, and presenting about 6 percent in image form. Both numbers are growing rapidly now.\nFor institutions in Massachusetts, there is some good news. The state has changed the law, so that effective November 28, a bank no longer will be required to return cancelled checks to its customers. The law in Massachusetts has been an impediment to electronic check collection, but it no longer will be.\nThe new law includes strong protections for customers, including a requirement that the bank provide up to 25 copies of checks annually upon request, at no charge. Overall, the law will serve consumers well and help Massachusetts banks to move ahead with a more efficient payments system.\nSeveral of your banks already use Check 21. I hope all of you will make plans to do so. All of the changes to come in check collection will make Check 21 the right direction for you.\nWhile the paper check is in decline, the electronic ACH continues to grow. It supports direct deposit of pay, and direct bill payment from bank accounts, and has become the essential infrastructure for many home banking and electronic bill payment services.\nWith strong growth in transaction and dollar volumes comes some increased risk. Often banks allow their business customers, including third-party payment processors, to originate ACH payments in the name of the bank. When a bank does so, the bank is liable for the payments, even if the bank never saw the payments.\nTo help banks to manage these risks, the Federal Reserve introduced this year a new Risk Origination Monitoring Service. This service enables a bank to select which originators of ACH payments it wants to monitor; to set debit and credit \"caps\" on those originators based on expected payments activity; to receive notification, by e-mail, whenever a pending batch of payments would exceed a cap; and then to choose whether to release or reject that batch of payments.\nAt the Boston Reserve Bank we are interested in helping your banks to learn more about this service, not to be selling you something, but to help you to assess for yourselves what we believe is a valuable tool to mitigate risk.\nMy third and final topic is one in which our Bank takes great pride. Our people are playing an important role in the introduction of an electronic replacement for cash and checks: a stored value card system, which the U.S. armed forces are deploying, as part of a program led by the U.S. Treasury, and managed and supported by the Boston Reserve Bank.\nWhen the military began to deploy stored value cards in Iraq and Kuwait this summer, they were the ninth and tenth foreign countries with U.S. bases to begin to use them. Three people from our Bank went to Kuwait and Iraq to help with the introduction of the cards. I am happy to tell you they are safely home now.\nStored value cards also are used to pay all trainees at eight Army, Air Force, and Marine basic training forts in the U.S. During the past year about 180 thousand trainees were paid with stored value cards. Another 26 thousand soldiers were using the cards at their overseas bases, and that number is growing.\nWe expect the growth to continue, because the stored value cards save money for the military and the Treasury, and have proven convenient for the men and women who use them. They can pay for purchases at the PX, and at local merchants, with the card.\nA soldier also can use one of those kiosks to transfer value from his card to his bank account in the U.S., or to download value from his account.\nFrom Boston we provide the software and technical support for the stored value card program, and we manage it on behalf of the Treasury. The Treasury entrusted this responsibility to us as a result of a successful partnership with them over many years to bring important improvements to the government's payment processes, and even to the broader commercial payments system. In fact, the Boston Reserve Bank conducted seminal research and development on check image technology, on behalf of all Reserve Banks, and with the Treasury as our partner, beginning more than 20 years ago. That work helped to make today's Check 21 possible. And that successful collaboration contributed to today's collaboration on stored value cards.\nAs I hope you can tell, we are excited about this stored value card program, as we are about the ACH risk management service and Check 21. I hope all of these initiatives are of interest to you, too. Thank you.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Warsaw, Poland\nGood morning. I am delighted to be here today in Warsaw to meet with this diverse group of central bankers and education leaders from around the world. I hope in my comments today I can convey a sense of the enthusiasm and engagement with which I and my colleagues within the Federal Reserve System approach both the need for and the provision of economic and financial education. As we engage the public in current policy issues or as we and our staffs try to make the underlying concepts of our market-based economy accessible and interesting, there is, I believe, a very real commitment to this as a vital central bank activity.\nI want to thank the National Bank of Poland and the ECB for their foresight in conceiving of a conference on \"The Role of Central Banks in Economic and Personal Finance Education,\" and for the efforts of their staffs in turning that concept into a reality. I'd also like to thank my colleague Steve Malin from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for his work on the Conference and his invitation to speak. My comments today focus first on why the Federal Reserve System focuses attention on these areas, and second on some lessons I believe are important as we strive to make our efforts as effective as possible.\nAt the outset, let me say that central bank support for economic and financial education is a form of enlightened self-interest. We recognize that an informed public -- a public that understands our role in the economy -- will be far more likely to understand and accept the reasoning behind the difficult decisions that central banks sometimes have to make. Moreover, monetary policy must consider such matters as inflation expectations on the part of consumers, businesses and markets, and their confidence in central bank resolve -- so as we make and implement policy, public understanding of economic and financial matters is very helpful.\nUnderlying that, however, is an even more compelling reason for our involvement: for anyone living in a market economy, understanding basic economic concepts and making sound financial decisions are essential survival skills. These same skills also inform the decisions that individuals make as citizens. And those informed decisions help to shape sound economic growth.\nLast, but by no means least in the case of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Congress has charged us with helping to assure that financial services and access to credit are available and accessible on as broad and as fair a basis as possible. In carrying out this very important responsibility, we employ the carrot as well as the stick, as the saying goes. The stick is regulation and supervision, and the carrot involves our convening abilities and, increasingly, our capabilities in the areas of economic education and financial literacy.\nUsing our stick, we write and enforce regulations to ensure that banks treat their customers fairly and that they serve their entire communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. If examiners find that a bank's performance is lacking, that bank may find other aspects of what it is doing that are subject to regulation affected in some way.\nBut we also have carrots to go with our stick. We can convene groups to get communities and financial institutions working together on issues of fairness and access and when we invite organizations to the table they usually come. But increasingly, we see a need and an opportunity to play more of a role in advancing economic and financial literacy.\nWhat does it mean to be economically and financially literate? The answer to that key question depends on who you ask.\nConsumer advocates believe we should concentrate on teaching people to be smart consumers, shop wisely, and avoid the pitfalls of the marketplace.\nProponents of financial literacy prefer to focus on individuals making wise financial choices that will lead to using money wisely and building wealth over a lifetime.\nAnd the umbrella of economic education covers a variety of views. One school of thought favors the straightforward teaching of basic economic concepts. Another promotes the virtues of entrepreneurship. Others would use economic education to advance specific arguments: the virtues of free trade, the imperative of saving, the benefits of certain government programs, the costs of higher taxes - the list is endless.\nSo, which approach is best? Rather than spending time and effort debating a question that has no single right answer, we might do better to adopt the view of the great English economist, Alfred Marshall, who saw economics as \"the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.\" Marshall's words suggest that our best chance for success lies in helping people to make the connections between economics and the ordinary business of life -- connections that include the ability to make sound financial decisions, build wealth, safely navigate the hazards of the marketplace, and evaluate the policy decisions that face all citizens.\nAt the Federal Reserve, our commitment in this arena is deep and longstanding. Originally, much of the emphasis was on the workings of the Fed - our structure, our various functions, how monetary policy is made. The goal was to remove some of the mystery surrounding the central bank and, hopefully, build confidence in its operational excellence and the quality of its decision-making. As part of this effort, many of the Reserve Banks give tours of their facilities. A visit to the gold vault at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was always - and still is - a great hit. And both Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents feel strongly about the need to inform and educate the public about monetary policy and our various economic perspectives. I believe the resulting insights are important bulwarks to our credibility as policy-makers.\nThe Federal Reserve also has a long involvement in economic education more generally. As I already noted, a public that understands basic economic principles and how the economy works will have a better understanding of the decisions made by policy-makers, including the Federal Reserve System. They will be better informed and more effective as citizens. They will also be better informed in their individual lives as consumers, workers, business owners, and providers for their families and their own financial security.\nThe System has a number of programs and publications that focus on teaching economics, both directly and through providing support services to high school and college teachers of economics. For example, we in Boston produce an economic education newsletter for teachers, administrators and the general public. This provides clear and concise discussions of key issues that teachers can use in developing their lesson plans, as well as a wealth of references to other resources. In addition, because the writing is lively and the illustrations are colorful, many teachers provide the newsletter directly to their students. Other Banks offer very similar materials, and we increasingly work together to provide the variety of materials and formats teachers need.\nOver the past 10 years, however, there has been something of a shift in emphasis. Increasingly, the Federal Reserve System, along with other organizations, sees a need for greater attention to financial literacy as opposed to traditional economic education. As I noted before, financial literacy refers to the ability to make well informed personal financial decisions.\nAmong the reasons for the growing urgency attached to financial literacy are a proliferation of sophisticated financial products and new financial services providers. I must say that even I need a little tutoring to understand all the potential pitfalls of the new mortgages that have become commonplace offerings by banks and nonbank providers in the U.S., so I have a lot of sympathy for the first time low or moderate income home buyer. And technological change has made the lending process at once easier and perhaps less transparent. Lenders may or may not be regulated as banks, adding another layer of potential complexity.\nIn addition, changes in corporate retirement plans and health insurance systems are shifting responsibility for planning for workers' long term financial security from businesses to the workers themselves. Even relatively well educated, relatively affluent households find themselves challenged by this shift and the need to take more responsibility for their financial future.\nAt the same time, immigration patterns in recent years have brought many people to the United States who have little familiarity with our financial system. In some cases, unfortunate experiences in their home countries have caused them to distrust and avoid mainstream financial institutions. Not only are those who lack financial literacy skills more likely to make mistakes in such key financial decisions as purchasing a home or automobile, financing their education or retirement, or starting a business; but they also run the risk of exploitation.\nAs we think about how best to meet the challenges of improving economic and financial education, I see five lessons that can be drawn from the Federal Reserve's experience.\nLesson Number One: Start at the top!\nWithout support from people at the top, even the best of intentions will not translate into concrete actions. Addressing the need for economic and financial literacy takes resources, so you need the commitment of key decision-makers within the central bank. Moreover, if these programs are to be successful within schools and communities, you need support at the top there as well.\nBoth Chairman Bernanke and former Chairman Greenspan set the tone in making economic and financial education a high priority. Chairman Greenspan spoke frequently on the topic. He participated in a System-wide public service campaign to highlight the importance of financial literacy; the campaign included radio and television announcements and a toll-free number. He, along with several Reserve Bank Presidents including me, served as volunteer teachers to 7th graders in order to publicize the importance of saving and financial planning.\nChairman Bernanke is just as committed to this issue, speaking quite often on it. Just this month, when he was honored in his small home town in South Carolina, he reminded us that what underlies all the economic data are millions of citizens \"working hard, trying to better themselves economically, struggling to manage their family finances, and worrying about the price of gas and college tuition.\" Economies are made up of individuals, and the better informed and educated their economic decisions, the more likely the economy's prosperity.\nIn the twelve Reserve Banks that are the regional arms of the Federal Reserve System, the Presidents actively reinforce this message. They all devote significant resources to economic education and financial literacy. Across the Banks, more than 75 full-time staff members work to deliver a wide variety of services and products related to economics and personal finance. And we all work hard to engage school commissioners, union heads, and administrators to ensure our services and products meet their needs. Their top down support within their own organizations helps to make the work Reserve Banks do effective.\nLesson Number Two: Engage a wide array of audiences.\nFor a long time, people in economics talked mainly to one another and then wondered why the public wasn't more interested in equations and Greek letters.\nWe have learned to broaden our outlook. Experience has taught us the importance of engaging a wider public by targeting our materials and media to various (and more diverse) audiences.\nAnyone who wants to see just how far we have come, need only look at the Federal Reserve's economic education web site -- aptly named www.federalreserveeducation.org. The site offers easy access to educational resources from all the Banks and the Board of Governors -- resources that include a simple introduction to the Fed, an FOMC simulation, a Federal Reserve Kids Page, an online currency exhibit, a unit on building wealth, and much, much more. All of it is free of charge and very accessible by a variety of audiences.\nBy way of advertisement, last year, in Boston alone, we distributed nearly 100,000 free copies of publications ranging from comic books on banking basics to electronic media dealing with identify theft, to more serious studies on monetary policy issues. We also opened our doors to upwards of 12,000 local students and teachers, who participated in educational programs intended to broaden their understanding of the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, the global economy, economic growth, and personal finance. We held conferences on matters of regional public policy, and major economic significance. And more than 540,000 visits have been made to our public website. So our audience spans the range from grade schoolers to senior citizens, from the naïve to the sophisticated, and we try to engage them all.\nLesson Number Three: Collaborate as much as possible.\nExperience has taught us that we, as central bankers, cannot possibly hope to turn every citizen into a trained economist or a financial wizard; nor should that be our aim. Our most useful contribution to economic and personal finance education may lie in giving a boost to, or adding value to, the efforts of other organizations. This can take the form of creating high-quality educational resources, enlisting our economists to assist in educational efforts, or even something as simple as opening our doors for meetings and conferences.\nOne of the most effective tools we have as a central bank is our power to convene, a power that's grounded in our reputation for fairness, integrity and credibility. People respect us and trust us -- even if they do not always like us or trust one another. They know that when we bring them together, they can expect a fair and honest exchange of ideas and opinions.\nI have seen this firsthand when consumer advocates and representatives from the financial services industry have come together at our Bank -- in the same room! -- for a (mostly) non-confrontational exchange of views on issues of mutual concern. And I have seen it in meetings around our District as we sometimes bring together people on both sides of a community development issue, and it is clear they haven't had much recent interaction.\nThe Federal Reserve System collaborates with a number of organizations to deliver economic education and financial literacy programs. Some of these organizations are national in scope and some are local and some are in-between. In Boston, for example, we work with an organization called Citizens Schools, which provides after-school educational experiences in the professions to high school students. Most recently, we have collaborated with Citizens Schools in a program that provides practical guidance about planning for college or university expenses, while highlighting the importance of financial planning more generally. While Citizens Schools started in Boston, it is expanding into other parts of the country and we hope that our college program will be part of its curriculum as it does.\nAnother example: The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has had considerable success highlighting the importance of financial literacy in its District with a \"Money Smart Week.\" The Bank and almost 200 local partners, including Chicago's major newspapers, offer about 300 financial literacy programs during the week. This is an exciting collaboration and I know other Reserve Banks are interested in using this model.\nLesson Number Four: Make it teacher--friendly.\nThere are many demands on a teacher's time, and most teachers in the United States have little background in economics. Taken together, these two factors can prevent even the most motivated teacher from tackling economic and financial education.\nWith that in mind, we in the Reserve Banks strive for an educational approach that offers teachers a maximum amount of flexibility. Most of our materials are designed so that educators can easily plug them into the existing school curriculum. We also try to structure the materials so teachers can use as much or as little of the content as they see fit.\nWe endeavor to develop programs that allow students to work on their own. One of our most popular programs at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is an interactive quiz on our public web site that uses professional sports, baseball in particular, to teach economic principles. The site, called \"Peanuts and Crackerjacks\" gets tens of thousands of website hits a year. I have been told it is the second most frequently visited section of the Bank's website, surpassed only by the section on employment opportunities at the Bank. The success of this program has led us to develop another interactive game that will use the music industry to teach how markets work. This will also allow us to reach more varied audiences, through different styles of music. But both programs are fun and easy to use, as well as informative.\nWe are also mindful of the fact that teachers -- like most of us -- tend to shy away from things that are difficult to use, so we make a concerted effort to offer them support in using our resources. This summer, for example, the Reserve Banks in Boston, New York, and Dallas jointly hosted a teacher workshop on globalization. Research economists made presentations and answered questions on topics such as the emergence of China as an economic powerhouse and the effects of migration on labor markets. Judging by the evaluations we received, it was a huge success.\nOf course, when the workshop ended some of the teachers still had reservations about our transition to a global economy. But one thing seemed certain: They were now less likely to look for simple solutions or overly-simple explanations.\nLesson Number Five: Make it fun!\nMaybe you're a true believer, convinced that kids need to know more about economics. If that is the case, then go ahead. Put your convictions to the test! Walk into a classroom and start telling the \"leaders of tomorrow\" why studying economics will make them healthy, wealthy, and wise. Then launch into a discussion of basic economic principles. And, just for good measure, be sure to work in that tired old story about a factory that produces \"widgets.\" If you are lucky, no one will fall asleep and you might walk out of the room with your dignity intact.\nThis is not to say that we should give up on teaching economics to anyone under the age of 18. When we manage to spark their interest, young people often respond with enthusiasm and an intuitive grasp of economic reasoning. The challenge, of course, is to spark their interest. Sometimes we can do it with packaging. At the Federal Reserve, we have come to recognize the importance of making our publications and web-based resources informative and appealing.\nBut we have also found that adding an element of fun is crucial to success. There is absolutely no reason why economics has to be \"the dismal science.\"\nThe System has experienced great success with student competitions that give participants an opportunity to sharpen their knowledge and showcase what they have learned in the areas of consumer awareness, personal finance, economic literacy -- even monetary policy! As one example, we sponsor two, so-called Fed Challenges, in which teams of high school and college students compete with each other in mock Open Market Committee meetings. Believe me, the expertise of the winning teams is astounding to those of us who judge the competitions locally and nationally.\nIn Boston, our permanent educational exhibit, The New England Economic Adventure, has shown us the benefits of adding an element of hands-on fun to an economic lesson. Since its opening in 2003, thousands of students and their teachers have visited the Adventure, and their reaction has been so overwhelmingly positive that I would like to take a few of my final minutes to share our experience with you.\nThe Adventure uses interactive investment games, exhibits, artifacts, and activities to help students understand how 200 years of economic change and technological innovation have affected our everyday lives. And although the focus is on the stories of New England's economy, the Adventure's message has broader applications.\nOne of its main themes is that economic growth and increased productivity have had a major impact on our material standard of living. To emphasize this point, we created a display of artifacts from three different time periods -- 1810, 1890, and 1960 -- and it has served as an effective catalyst for discussions of economic issues. This display is a perfect cure for nostalgia. One look at the chamber pot from 1810 is enough to convince most people that the good old days might not have been as good as we sometimes like to think. And the mere fact that there are no cell phones, iPods, or internet connections in the 1960 display instantly persuades our student visitors that life is better than it used to be.\nTo our surprise, however, their teachers are sometimes more ambivalent on that point. They agree that our material standard of living is higher and our level of physical comfort is greater, but they sometimes wonder if our lives really are richer or more fulfilling than those of our parents and grandparents. They talk to us about their concerns over the hectic pace of modern life, stress in the workplace, increased pressures on family life, and a lower level of community involvement.\nWhile these conversations challenge the message our exhibit conveys, they also showcase economic education at its best, because when all is said and done, our aim is not to tell people what to think but, rather, to offer them a basis for making their own assessments. And if we do our job effectively, they will be able to use economics as a framework to assess the questions and quandaries of everyday life. We hope that the thousands who visit the Adventure each year come away with an enhanced appreciation of the role that their own financial habits can play both in their personal future, and the health of the overall economy.\nWhich brings me to my final point.\nThe modern world is a complicated place. We face increasingly complex economic and financial choices that require a greater level of sophistication on the part of our citizens. A basic grasp of economics and personal finance will not only improve their ability to navigate a changing job market, or to build wealth for their future. It will also help them to sensibly engage -- as voters, taxpayers, or consumers -- the big issues of our time, including those involved in monetary policy making. This, in sum, is why central banks should be concerned about and involved in economic and financial literacy.\nNeedless to say, we face a formidable challenge in raising the overall level of economic and financial literacy in the United States and in your countries. In each case it will require the support and resources of those at the top; creativity in engaging a wide array of audiences; collaboration among providers; reaching out to teachers; and most of all a commitment to making all this as much fun as possible. Difficult, perhaps, but as I look out at all the people gathered in this room, I see tremendous reason for optimism.\nThank you",

            "content": "Good morning. Let me welcome you again to Boston. It's a pleasure to have the National Association of Business Economists here in our city. And it was certainly a pleasure to entertain you last night at the Bank. As we recognize the fifth anniversary of 9/11 it seems to me to be important to assess both the state of the U.S. economy and the economic health of the world. In that regard, I know this will be a fruitful and productive conference, as there is no dearth of economic challenges on which to focus.\nI want to start my comments this morning with a thumbnail sketch of my thoughts on the current state of the U.S. economy. Following that, I want to spend most of my time on an important challenge facing us in the medium term -- the declining trend in U.S. savings, in particular the savings people need to provide for a financially secure retirement. In discussing this issue, I will draw on work done by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College headed by Alicia Munnell, who among her many past accomplishments has served as our Bank's research director. I will also talk about what the field of behavioral economics has to say about policies to increase personal savings. Behavioral economics is a new focus of the Boston Fed -- we recently formed a new center to enhance our expertise in this evolving area, and particularly to hone in on what this field has to say about macro policy formation. Finally, I want to share with you some perspectives on financial literacy as that is key to the savings question. And, of course, any thoughts I share with you are mine and not those of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nOne of the more striking features of the current economic outlook, reflected in the forecast at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston as well as in other mainstream forecasts, is how relatively benign it is. Against the backdrop of the war in Iraq, the uneasy ceasefire in the Middle East, the looming fiscal deficits driven by demographic change everywhere in the developed world, and sizable international imbalances, the forecast for the next couple of years seems quite optimistic.\nYet, as near as we in Boston can tell, the best baseline forecast is that U.S. growth will moderate from its average of around 4 percent in the first half of 2006 to something slightly below its potential of a bit less than 3 percent over the next year or so. At this pace, the growth of demand will roughly match that of aggregate supply, and lead to little change in unemployment. Moderate growth in jobs and real income is expected to sustain consumer spending, even as cooling housing markets and high energy prices take their toll.\nResidential construction has already fallen, and may well slow further. But this seems likely to be offset, at least in part, by increases in non-residential construction as businesses add needed capacity after years of sub-par spending. Solid business profits and reserves of cash also augur well for a pick-up in business fixed investment, and recent data for orders and shipments of capital equipment suggest such a pick-up is occurring. Productivity growth remains solid providing some cushion for resource utilization. Financial conditions in both debt and equity markets remain fairly accommodative, making borrowing relatively affordable and softening the impact of flattening house prices on household wealth. Globally, growth is solid as well. U.S. exports have increased and trade is at least for now marginally supportive of growth. Finally, the baseline forecast also sees inflation subsiding slowly, assuming no further geopolitical or other shocks to oil prices. But more on that later. To summarize - I see growth for the next year or so in the high 2's, approximately full employment, and core inflation subsiding. Not a bad picture, particularly given the challenges I mentioned a moment ago.\nThe next obvious question concerns risks - where are they and how likely are they to materialize? In my view, risks have grown over the summer on both sides of this forecast. Growth could be slower or inflation could be higher and more persistent -- or both. I take both of these risks seriously.\nOn the risks to growth, one obvious concern is the housing market. Trends in housing affordability and sales affect the pace of residential construction, now over 6 percent of GDP and up from its historical average of closer to 4 percent. The Bank's baseline forecast assumes a continued moderate downturn in residential construction. I'm comfortable with that baseline, but recent data on declines in starts and permits, gloomy assessments by builders, the potential for higher mortgage rates, and increased inventories of unsold homes, remind me that this assessment could well be optimistic.\nAn even larger downside could result if nominal home prices actually decline, rather than flatten out as projected, affecting household wealth and overall spending more than anticipated. Moreover, some have suggested that changes in the ease and terms of mortgage financing spurred more than normal spending during the years of rapidly rising home equity. By that logic, as financing costs rise and equity withdrawals decline, the resulting spending hit could be even greater than that suggested by wealth trends.\nThese are serious concerns. However, I take a measure of reassurance from a number of factors. First, a fall in nominal home prices nationwide would be quite an unusual event. We have never seen a sustained decline in nationwide home prices in any of the more reliable price measures. Even now, as residential construction wanes, home prices, adjusted for quality, continue to grow, albeit at a much slower pace. Second, the so-called \"wealth effect\" that links increases and decreases in house prices with rises and falls in consumer spending may not be as strong as some analysts suggest. In our estimation, the run-up in housing values over the past several years did not spur much of a bigger-than-expected increase in consumer spending - if anything, the response was a bit on the low side compared to the historical average. So we wonder about how large a spending effect one should expect to accompany a fall in housing prices, if that were to occur. Clearly mortgage equity withdrawals have been sizable during the housing \"boom,\" but many of these withdrawals were used to reduce other forms of consumer debt and to make one-time improvements in the housing stock. Indeed, as a result, overall household balance sheets today continue to look fairly strong.\nThat is not to say, however, that rising mortgage interest rates are not negatively affecting borrowers. It also does not mean that new types of mortgages won't contain more than a few nasty surprises. Of particular concern are sub-prime borrowers and perhaps some depository institutions specializing in subprime lending. Thus, there are clear risks to the baseline housing outlook. Overall, however, I continue to think the best guess is that consumption will moderate, not collapse, as the result of cooling housing markets, and that moderate employment growth, and moderately rising income and non-housing financial wealth will buoy household spending.\nAnother concern is the recent and not very favorable trend in inflation at the headline and the core. Headline CPI and PCE numbers (currently at 4.2 percent and 3.4 percent year over year, and 5.0 percent and 4.1 percent for the most recent quarter) are high and rising over the near term, mostly as the result of energy prices. These energy price increases reflect not only geopolitical shocks but also growing world demand for oil, particularly by the emerging giants, India and China. The feed-through of higher oil prices is likely one reason why core inflation also has increased markedly over the past months, though the breadth and persistence of that increase also suggest a role for pressures related to overall resource utilization. The Bank's baseline forecast assumes that if energy prices stabilize as indicated in the futures market, core inflation will gradually subside. That is my best guess at this point and, based on inflation expectations measured in a variety of ways, private-sector individuals, businesses, and financial markets appear to agree. But, as others have said repeatedly, monetary policy is about risk management. A key risk is that inflation will continue to rise or persist at high levels and embed itself in consumer and business plans. Managing that risk is clearly important, and a matter about which central banks need to be quite vigilant - as I believe the FOMC has been and will continue to be.\nWhile the near term forecast seems benign, though certainly not without risks, the medium-term presents real challenges. One of these involves the dearth of U.S. national savings, more particularly savings by households and the federal government. Let me say a couple of words about the overall numbers, and then turn to the question of personal savings and the retirement of today's workers. Given the demographics, the health and welfare of the consumers in this cohort is a vital aspect of our nation's future.\nAs many of you no doubt know, U.S. national savings, now about 13 percent of national income, is down about five percentage points since the late 1990s, and is lower in the U.S. than in any other major developed country. National savings includes both private savings by households and firms, plus public savings or the net of government spending and tax receipts. Let's start with public saving, and the federal budget deficit - which reached $318 billion in 2005. Relative to the overall size of GDP, the current budget situation doesn't look all that dire; the deficit was about 2.6 percent of GDP in 2005, a decline from 2004 and relatively low when compared to the 1980s. Indeed, the fiscal deficit as a share of GDP has declined through this year as well. But it would be a mistake, I think, to take a great measure of confidence from this short-term trend.\nOne must recognize that the deficit would be much larger, 4.1 percent for fiscal 2005, if it were not for a sizable surplus in Social Security - a surplus that is the direct result of payroll tax rates designed to prepare the Social Security system for the surge in benefit payments that will result as baby boomers retire. By 2030, almost one in five U.S. residents will be 65 years or older. Well before then, beginning in about 2018, Social Security will start to pay out more in ben­efits than it receives from payroll taxes. Even before that, -- in the neighborhood of 2010 -- Social Security will start exerting upward pressure on the unified federal budget deficit as its surplus diminishes, with a consequent reduction in net public saving, absent changes in the program itself, increased taxes, or reduced spending on other government programs.\nThe situation for Medicare is similar and, potentially even more serious. Payroll taxes to cover Medicare expenditures are currently in surplus. Over time, however, Medicare spending is expected to increase more rapidly than related tax revenues, creating a deficit prob­lem that analysts see as potentially greater in size and more difficult to deal with than that associated with Social Security. Thus, despite the relatively benign federal deficit we currently see, it is clear the situation will worsen dramatically over the next decade. And, unlike the late '80s when deficits became a national concern, there seems to be no political consensus on the nature of this problem or its resolution -- a fact that should be a concern to all of us.\nAlong with the decline in public saving, the personal savings rate is now in negative territory. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, personal saving in the U.S. was running at about 7 percent of personal income; in 1994, it dropped to 4.8 percent; by 2005 it was actually negative and remains so. A key question here is whether the U.S. consumer is saving enough for retirement, particularly given the nature of the challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. Given the country's demographics, the retiring baby boomers, faced with inadequate retirement income, could impact overall spending and place additional burdens on the government programs and tax rates. The issue is also of concern when one considers the high stakes for low- and moderate-income consumers who face the most difficulty saving and have the smallest margin for error. So for overall macro concerns, and distributional reasons, the question of the adequacy of saving for retirement is key.\nNow some have rightly pointed out that the National Income and Product Account's measurement of savings on which the personal savings rate calculation is based may not be well-suited to questions about the sufficiency of household savings for retirement. Measured NIPA savings does not include capital gains, and thus may omit what households consider an important component of their retirement resources.\nOn the other hand, there are also NIPA accounting rules that tend to overstate saving, such as the fact that interest receipts and payments are included in nominal terms and that pension contributions to saving don't net out the associated future tax liability. In addition, NIPA investment excludes spending on education, which most households surely undertake because they expect it to raise future income and add to retirement resources. So NIPA measures may not tell the whole story about the adequacy of retirement resources, and they certainly do not address distributional issues. But, one should not ignore the headline message -- personal savings need to grow.\nOthers take a different approach to measurement - one that focuses not on aggregate measures of saving but on the retirement readiness of individual households. The Center for Retirement Research (CRR) has developed a National Retirement Risk Index to measure the share of working-age households that are in danger of being financially unprepared for retirement. Their findings are sobering. They report that almost 45 percent of all such households are \"at risk\" of falling well short of the amount estimated to be necessary to maintain the household's pre-retirement standard of living. Younger households are particularly vulnerable, as are low-income households and those with neither a defined benefit pension nor a 401(k) plan. Other studies perform similar exercises and come to similar conclusions. A number of you may have been involved in such efforts in the course of your work.\nWhat accounts for the gloomy retirement picture? Part of the explanation is simply that Social Security will replace a smaller fraction of pre-retirement earnings as the normal retirement age rises from 65 to 67, assuming that people do not delay retirement. Another important part is the shift away from defined benefit pensions to voluntary defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans. Since most workers save little outside of employer-sponsored plans, they are an increasingly important part of our nation's retirement readiness. While 401(k)s and IRAs have the potential to work well, they require some expertise and discipline from workers who typically must choose to enroll, decide how much to save, and how their savings will be invested.\nAlthough the projections are worrisome, there are a number of avenues for action. For younger households especially, relatively small changes in savings behavior could substantially reduce the number of households at risk if they occur early enough. Stress tests of the CRR model show that increases in the saving rate of only 3 percent among Generation Xers could reduce the number of households \"at risk\" substantially. Good news, but this is a fix that is easy to prescribe and much harder to accomplish. How do we encourage people to save more?\nGood public policy can help. In that vein there may be some assistance from the Pension Reform Act of 2006 which Congress passed in early August with broad bipartisan support. The bill is more than 900 pages long and contains some very complex provisions, so it may be awhile before its implications are fully understood. Nonetheless, it has a number of provisions that appear likely to increase the flow of savings into both defined benefit and defined contribution plans, and to produce a modest increase in national saving. They include increasing the funding target for most defined benefit pension plans from 90 to 100 percent. And they would allow 401(k) plans to automatically enroll workers; that is, workers would have to \"opt out\" if they don't want to participate.\nThis brings me to some encouraging developments from the emerging field of behavioral economics. Behavioral economics attempts to incorporate insights from psychology and other social sciences into the study of economics, and some of its insights have been particularly helpful in studying savings behavior. For example, behavioral economists have focused on the insight that people don't always behave in a consistent fashion over time. In other words, they often have a hard time getting themselves to do in the short-run what they know is best for them in the long-run. This is true when it comes to exercise and to diet - and it is also true for retirement saving. Not surprisingly, people tend to give in to the immediate gratification of spending even though they know they would be better off in the long run if they saved. Households end up saving less than they really intend or want.\nAnother psychological phenomena addressed by behavioral economists is that people sometimes become overwhelmed when faced with a complicated decision that has many choices and options and they may respond in a counterproductive way by procrastinating or making no decision at all. Retirement planning can be complicated and anxiety-provoking for the person trying to figure out what to do. Some end up putting the decision off, maybe even indefinitely.\nOf course many people are well aware of these difficulties and adopt strategies to help them save, such as saving by automatic payroll deduction or using tax withholding to save over the course of a year. In essence, these are pre-commitment devices that make it more likely that a person's short-run impulses do not undermine their long-run goals.\nSuch insights from behavioral research are already helping design saving programs that deal with complexity and self control issues. One example is adjusting the default option in a savings program - whether people have to \"opt out\" versus \"opt in.\" People are more likely to join a 401(k) program if they are automatically enrolled and have to actively drop out than if the default is non-enrollment and they have to decide to sign up. The new pension reform bill, by explicitly allowing \"automatic opt in\" could really help companies in shaping their 401(k) programs.\nTaking this a step further are programs that automatically increase 401(k) contributions with salary increases by having staff commit to this in advance. Results from one such program showed a high proportion of those offered the plan enroll, and the majority of those who enroll stay in at least through the fourth pay raise. Average savings rates among participants almost quadrupled, from 3.5 percent to over 13 percent in the first 40 months of the program.\nA number of researchers have suggested that simplified portfolio choices might help overcome procrastination and encourage more people to enroll in 401(k) plans. In one study, allowing people to enroll using a preset contribution rate and asset allocation tripled the number of new employees enrolling in the program and increased enrollment by current employees by more than 10 percentage points. Now, these programs might also have downsides; some may feel that they are too paternalistic or worry that they encourage people to be too conservative in their investment decisions.\nBut these studies are also promising, as they point the way to more research that will resolve some of the uncertainties and help us devise even better programs in the future. Perhaps some of them will come out of the Boston Fed's new Center for Behavioral Economics and Decision-Making. The Center is an exciting innovation for us, as behavioral research has potential applications to many aspects of monetary policy and bank supervision as well as savings behavior. One new initiative from this Center is an effort by Boston Fed economist Stephan Meier to better understand the credit problems of low-income individuals and specifically study how credit counseling can improve individual credit outcomes. The Center also is co-sponsoring a conference with Boston University and the Research Foundation of the Chartered Financial Analysts Society this fall on the development of new financial products and policy to address consumer savings and investment issues.\nThis raises an area that is probably already apparent to all of you. That is the importance of financial literacy if workers and households are going to be able to save effectively for retirement. Planning for retirement has always been a complicated undertaking, requiring a fair amount of sophistication and financial skill. But a number of changes in the economic landscape - particularly the introduction of new technology and advances in financial instruments and institutions, along with the increased reliance on 401(k) saving - have really raised the bar on the level of sophistication and financial literacy necessary for effective planning. More than ever, people need to be well informed about the options they face and the potential outcomes that might arise from their decisions.\nUnfortunately most assessments of financial literacy only serve to underscore how far we have to go. One 2004 survey found that only a third of adults over 50 years of age surveyed could answer basic questions about interest compounding, inflation, and risk diversification. Fewer than one third had ever tried to devise a retirement plan - and of those who tried, many didn't succeed. In another survey, more than a third of respondents could not even guess at the amount they would need for retirement. Other studies have shown that financial literacy is a particular problem among low-income individuals, people who are especially at risk because of limited resources.\nNow again, there is some good news. We have reason to think that financial education works - that it improves knowledge and is associated with better behavior and outcomes. For example, one study suggests that high school curriculum mandates were effective at increasing students' exposure to financial education and were also associated with higher saving rates and net worth in adulthood. Others find that workplace education can increase participation in 401(k) plans and increase wealth, especially in families in the bottom of the distribution and with less education. One study even suggests the possibility that workplace training may have social spillovers to other employees, raising participation in savings programs even among coworkers who did not attend training.\nIncreasing the general level of financial literacy is also an area of special concern and involvement for the Boston Fed and the Federal Reserve System in general. To this end, the Federal Reserve undertakes a variety of financial education activities focused on increasing access to information about financial products and services, supporting and identifying best practices, and collaborating with educational and community organizations to improve financial literacy. Some of the initiatives focus on students, others on adults, and they cover a wide range of issues.\nMany either directly or indirectly try to improve savings and retirement decisions. For example, at a System level, we are active in America Saves, a campaign sponsored by nonprofit, corporate, and government groups targeted at helping low- and moderate-income individuals and families save and build wealth. In Boston, as I mentioned, among our many activities we are trying to better understand the credit problems of low-income people. We have also put a lot of effort into on-line games that make learning the basic concepts of economics fun, and have developed our own \"Economic Adventure\" at the Bank to teach the concepts behind rising standards of living in a hands-on way. We hope the over 12,000 students and others who visit the Adventure each year come away with an enhanced appreciation of the role their own financial habits can play both in their personal future, and in the health of the overall economy.\nU.S. national savings are a major concern. More attention needs to be directed at the potential medium term fiscal deficit. As the economy slows over the near term, consumers could become more uncertain about the future and save more. Indeed, most forecasts assume this will happen. But more is needed here as well. Individuals must focus more on retirement savings, given the evolving picture of corporate benefits and the challenges facing both Social Security and Medicare. We at the Boston Fed believe there is much that can be done to encourage more savings. Through innovative ideas and research, we continue to learn more about how to devise savings programs in ways that encourage people to participate and help them save more. New and better programs to more effectively reach out to improve economic education and financial literacy can also help. We also encourage you, the country's business economists, to join us and look for ways to participate in this most important endeavor. In that way, we can all look forward to a better economic future for ourselves and our country.",

            "content": "It is a pleasure to be here with you today to share my views and also to hear yours. The residential and commercial real estate markets are always key contributors to the health of the economy. But, as I am sure you all know, the real estate sector-and particularly the housing market-is one of the bigger question marks policymakers face in managing the risks to the likely course of economic activity over the next year or so. So I am especially glad to have a chance to be here and to exchange views. And, of course, the views I will share are mine and not necessarily those of others on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nThe good news is that, in my view, the short- to medium-run likely course of the economy is quite positive. Economic data taken over short periods of time are always bumpy, and the impact of hurricanes, energy shocks, and the on-again, off-again effect of auto sales incentives on consumption acted to make the end of 2005 more than normally bumpy. But overall, the four-quarter growth rate for last year was quite solid, and I and others expect 2006 to be the same. Indeed, when Chairman Bernanke addressed the House and Senate Banking Committees in mid-February, he discussed the 2006 economic projections of the members of the Board and the Reserve Bank Presidents. The central tendency was for real GDP growth of about 3-1/2 percent, unemployment in a low range of 4-3/4 to 5 percent, and core inflation at about 2 percent. Altogether, a very positive picture for a highly developed, nearly $13 trillion economy well into its fifth year of expansion. There are short-term questions to be sure -- the impact of changes in residential housing markets and the prospects for inflation are two -- but, overall, the economy in 2006 seems likely to be very well-behaved.\nBut what about the longer term? Despite our economy's resilience and relatively high rates of productivity growth, I am concerned that we have been living beyond our means. Personal savings rates have declined sharply. Using reasonable assumptions about longer-term revenue and spending streams, federal fiscal deficits, while moderating as a share of GDP in 2005, are poised to grow sharply as baby boomers retire. And, of equal concern, this country's external deficit has grown as well reflecting surging U.S. demand for imported goods. Such demand contributed significantly to the growth of foreign economies, and their continuing desire to invest their dollars in our country's debt and equity markets has helped minimize the impact that might otherwise be caused by our country's savings/investment imbalance. Indeed, just as one example of the variety of foreign investment here, there are anecdotes of significant foreign purchases of both residential and commercial real estate in some markets, and maybe you have witnessed this first hand.\nBut being the world's biggest debtor has its downsides. It puts us at risk that foreign investment desires may change, with potentially harmful effects on the stability of our financial markets. The best guess is that any such change would happen slowly given the reliance of other countries on U.S. imports for growth. But past experiences in other countries with large external deficits leaves one cautious about being too sanguine. Indeed, if our current account deficit continues to grow faster than GDP, there will be a continued deterioration in our net international investment position. That creates an obligation to pay increasing amounts to foreign owners of U.S. debts, and eats into our very ability to invest in our future. I believe the best place to start in reining in our external deficit is to increase national savings, most specifically by working to reduce government dissaving. I want to use some of my time today to talk to you about the longer-term challenges facing this country. But first, let me focus on the outlook for next year.\nAs I noted earlier, while growth was a bit slow at the end of 2005, much of this reflected relatively transitory issues. For one, the quarter suffered from post-Katrina effects, as well as a slump after incentive-driven automobile spending in the third quarter. A jump in energy costs also affected the end of the year. But energy costs have declined a bit after the Q4 jump, rebuilding after Katrina has begun, and government and private spending has strengthened. As a result, early '06 has gotten off to a strong start.\nThe economy added more than 240,000 jobs during February, bringing the average pace of job growth over the most recent three months to 186,000, in excess of the number needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force. As a result, the unemployment rate declined over the past three months to 4.8 percent, the first time it has reached that level since the late '90s.\nSustained consumer spending this year will depend importantly on sustained employment growth. This is especially the case if, as I expect, there is some flattening in the rate of increase in household wealth coming from residential real estate. Consumption is a key component to the Bank's outlook, so we were heartened to see the recovery in consumer confidence following the hurricanes and the spike in oil prices. I view this as confirmation of a solid foundation to consumption spending.\nTurning to investment, I expect businesses to continue their 2005 solid pace of spending on equipment and software, as at least some of the capital goods acquired in the spending boom of the late '90s are replaced and new capacity is added. Clearly, the \"fundamentals\" for investment spending -- expectations of productivity growth, overall business profitability, and accommodative debt and equity markets -- are there. Indeed, the data we see on shipments and orders suggest that near-term capital spending is already off to a strong start early in 2006.\nOne of the greatest areas of uncertainty in the Bank's outlook is one near and dear to you, the residential housing sector. As rising interest rates and high prices have made home buying more expensive, sales of new and existing homes have slowed nationally -- and even more so in the Northeast. Despite slower sales, construction of new homes, while receding from record highs, continues at quite high levels, a situation which has been the subject of many news reports.\nThe resulting rising stock of unsold new homes will likely bring about a modest decline in construction, probably accompanied by a gradual flattening of house prices. As construction of new homes slows and the pace of growth in housing wealth eases, economic activity will be restrained. The question is \"How much?\" Residential investment is now slightly over 6 percent of GDP, a higher fraction than in the past 10-15 years. Most forecasters -- FRB Boston included -- expect that share to decline somewhat as the construction of new homes tails off. Obviously, such a contraction in residential investment will slow GDP growth over what it might have otherwise been.\nOf more significance, perhaps, is the effect on consumption of a decline in the growth rate of household wealth related to a change in house prices. Housing equity is under a third of total household net worth, but recently the relatively rapid growth in house prices has accounted for much of the upward movement of overall wealth. Generally speaking, when household wealth increases, consumption does as well, on the order of 3-4 cents on the dollar of increased wealth. Thus, most analysts believe U.S. consumption over the last several years has been bolstered by increases in household wealth brought about by rising home prices.\nWhat happens if home prices flatten or even decline? The theory would suggest that consumers will reduce their spending by about 3-4 cents for every dollar of wealth reduction that ensues, all other things being equal. Moreover, some have argued that mortgage market conditions in general, and new types of mortgage instruments in particular, have made borrowing out of home equity easier. This may have augmented consumption as house prices rose -- thought this is difficult to see in the data -- and as prices flatten or decline, might contribute to a larger contraction in spending than might otherwise be the case.\nFrom a macro perspective, it makes sense to worry about the potential impact on overall GDP growth of a combination of a reduction in housing construction and a decline in household wealth. The Bank's baseline forecast takes what might be seen as a rather conservative perspective here. We see construction diminishing somewhat and real estate prices flattening, not declining, and those assumptions are built into the solid GDP growth rate I referred to earlier. Clearly, however, we could be wrong on the magnitudes. Real estate prices could actually decline (though this has never happened for the nation as a whole at least on a nominal basis) and construction activity could retrench more than we expect. And rising mortgage rates could impede consumption more than our forecast predicts. Thus, changes in residential real estate present a source of downside risk to growth. I should also note here that in recent times residential real estate markets have often outperformed expectations, a fact with which this audience is more than familiar.\nBut the risks are not all in the direction of slower growth. Stronger growth and somewhat higher inflation are well within the realm of possibility as well. Consumption could be less affected by waning real estate markets than we expect, particularly if more consumers are working. With unemployment rates at their recent levels, some possibility exists that labor costs will begin to rise faster than productivity, which in turn could put pressure on inflation. That hasn't happened yet in the aggregate and we expect healthy productivity growth to continue after its Q4 drop-off. Indeed, at the Boston Fed we have begun to hear anecdotes about skilled labor being even harder to find and more expensive than earlier, but this is usually in the context of a continuing emphasis by businesses on working harder and smarter in the face of keen competition. It is also true that rather low labor force participation nationwide could suggest labor markets are less tight than the unemployment rate suggests. However, judging the precise extent of resource utilization is difficult and there is a need here for some vigilance.\nMoreover, worldwide GDP growth in 2006 is expected to maintain the robust levels of recent years, with resulting resource pressures. Demand from the rapidly growing developing nations, especially China and India, has pushed up commodity prices, though overall non-oil import price growth has been moderate. Even before the hurricanes, energy prices were rising, reflecting world demand. While prices are generally off their hurricane peaks, they remain high simply as a result of the pressure of demand over available supply. Given the current geopolitical unrest in oil producing regions, new energy price spikes are clearly possible, though this is understandably hard to predict. In our baseline forecast, high productivity, healthy profit margins, and well-anchored inflation expectations are expected to keep core inflation growth around 2 percent. There are risks to this inflation forecast to be sure, just as risks exist that growth will be slower. As a result, I believe monetary policymakers need to watch how evolving economic activity affects the balance of these risks to assess what actions are necessary.\nTo end our economic overview closer to home, the New England economy ended 2005 with employment levels just a bit above year-end 2004. Massachusetts accounts for about half of the region's jobs, and was particularly hard hit by the end of the late '90s telecom bubble and the overall slowdown in the tech sector. This state has seen slower employment and income growth than the rest of the country since 2001. Still, as of January, state unemployment rates in New England are all at or below the national average. While manufacturing in the region continues to lose jobs, as it does most everywhere in the U.S., employment across New England is expanding solidly in professional and business services, financial activities, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality. And recently, we have also begun to see some life in the Boston downtown and suburban commercial real estate markets, as class A vacancy rates have come down somewhat and rents have begun to increase.\nIs New England likely to feel the sting of cooling residential housing in a more significant way than the rest of the country? To be sure, home prices in New England are higher than most of the rest of the country, and the pace of appreciation has been greater here at least until the last couple of years. However, unlike the late '80s, residential construction has not boomed, and there has been little speculative building. Various studies of the New England market do see some overvaluation relative to fundamentals such as personal income, density, and environmental restrictions, but the amount is relatively small. The question is how much will prices fall? So far, the data on this are not clear. In one set of monthly numbers, Massachusetts residential real estate prices fell in early '06; other data suggest only a sharply slower pace of growth. But even in the early nineties, home prices fell much less than they had appreciated in the decade earlier.\nI should also point out here that much has been written about the new forms of mortgage financing that have been rapidly increasing as a share of mortgage originations. As key players in residential real estate markets, I am sure you have seen interest-only loans, and loans whose low initial required payment amounts can create negative amortization. Many are worried that the combination of these new mortgage instruments and borrowers who may be both highly leveraged and low to moderate income could result in real problems as interest rates escalate in conjunction with softening prices. There is no doubt that some potential exists for consumer hardship. At present, both national and regional bank credit quality and foreclosures remain at historically very low levels, though a very recent slight deterioration is evident. Indeed, recent bank supervisory guidance issued for comment by all the federal regulators has suggested caution on the part of both residential and commercial lenders in assessing credit quality of borrowers, the appropriateness of the loans extended and loan concentrations. I am concerned about the impact on some consumers of mortgages that become too costly, and the possible implications for lenders and markets. However, at this point, I do not view this as likely to be a major issue to the overall New England economy. My sense is that Massachusetts and New England will experience some sustained cooling in real estate markets, and some flattening of prices, but this trend is not likely to affect the region overly negatively, and likely not more than the nation as a whole.\nSo, if we are at all accurate, 2006 will be a year of solid growth, perhaps faster in the first half as Katrina rebuilding occurs and energy prices stabilize, and slower later on as hurricane-related fiscal stimulus ebbs and housing activity tapers off, but strong overall. There are risks to be sure, but as you know monetary policy is all about risk management.\nSo that's the good news for the next year or so. Now I would like to look out in time a bit farther and talk about the potential consequences of running large federal budget and current account deficits. Let's start with the federal budget deficit, which reached $318 billion in 2005, a large and somewhat sobering number.\nTo begin with, it's probably more informative to measure the deficit relative to the overall size of the economy's productive capacity or GDP. Just as a household can safely handle more debt as its income rises, the U.S. economy can generate the extra tax revenue needed to pay the interest on its debt without raising tax rates as long as national income is also growing in proportion. From this perspective, the budget situation seems less dire; the deficit was about 2.6 percent of GDP in 2005, a decline over 2004 (when it was 3.6 percent of GDP) and relatively low as compared to 1983 (when it was 6 percent of GDP).\nUnfortunately, several factors make today's fiscal situa­tion much more serious than indicated by the current ratio of the deficit to GDP. First, the deficit would be much larger, 4.1 percent for fiscal 2005, if it were not for a sizable surplus in Social Security -- a surplus that is the direct result of the increase in payroll tax rates designed to prepare the Social Security system for the surge in benefit payments that will result as baby boomers retire. These surpluses have been deposited into social insurance trust funds and accumulated in nonmarketable Treasury securities. In essence, the trust funds are providing a loan to the rest of the federal government - a loan that will have to be paid back with interest as baby boomers collect their Social Security benefits. The Social Security surplus is forecast to gradually diminish, and, beginning in about 2018, Social Security will start to pay out more in ben­efits than it receives from payroll taxes. Once this happens, Social Security will start exerting upward pressure on the unified federal budget deficit.\nThe situation for Medicare is similar and, potentially, even more serious. Although payroll taxes to cover Medicare expenditures are also currently in surplus, over time Medicare spending is expected to increase more rapidly than related tax revenues, creating a deficit prob­lem that analysts see as potentially greater in size and more difficult to control than that associated with Social Security.\nUnless something in this scenario changes, these forces will require a steep increase in government borrowing as expenditures will greatly exceed tax receipts. The resulting rising deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio could pose challenges to the level of private investment in this country, and to future improvements in its standard of living.\nSo far, the political process has failed to enact measures that might credibly be expected to bring the budget back closer to balance. The budget deficits of the 1980s resulted in legislative actions that by the early 1990s moved toward reducing those deficits. Indeed by 1998 the federal budget was in surplus. Since then, however, a combination of tax cuts, and new spending on a wide range of efforts -- the Iraq war and post 9/11 security among them -- have created a new deficit problem. A case can be made that the tax cuts of 2001 were well timed to facilitate the recovery from the recession. Now actions similar to those of the 1980s and early 1990s are needed to bring about the fiscal discipline required to address the demographic challenges of the next decade.\nLet me now turn to our external, or current account deficit, which is estimated at $800 billion in 2005, or 6.5 percent of GDP. This is a large deficit for a major developed country, certainly measured by size alone, and in reference to GDP as well. The current account primarily reflects the difference between the value of the goods and services we sell abroad and the value of those we import. Running a current account deficit means that domestic spending exceeds what is produced in this country. It also means that we must borrow from abroad to cover the difference. Thus, the surging U.S. current account deficit has made us increasingly dependent on borrowing from abroad in recent years.\nThe two deficits, the federal fiscal deficit and the current account deficit are often referred to as \"twins.\" As my former colleague Ned Gramlich has pointed out, they are not literally twins, but they certainly share a lot of DNA -- DNA in the form of national savings. National savings is the sum of all private savings -- that is saving or dissaving by households and businesses -- and government saving or dissaving. When national savings are low, as has been the case recently, with only business saving modestly in the black, either dependence on foreign savings increases, or national investment must decline. The growth in our current account deficit reflects the growing dependence of U.S. investment on foreign savings.\nAlthough there is considerable controversy about when, and how, narrowing of the current account and federal budget deficits will occur, there is a broad consensus that the projected growth in both deficits relative to GDP is not sustainable. We cannot continue to run a federal budget deficit that raises our debt-to-GDP ratio indefinitely, without diminishing private investment through higher interest rates, thereby reducing productivity and long term growth.\nThe current account deficit is also not sustainable at its existing size and rate of growth. If the amount we must borrow from abroad to finance spending is rising faster than GDP, at some point paying our debts will eat into our standard of living. As the U.S. issues ever larger amounts of debt, foreign purchasers would likely require higher interest rates to continue investing, threatening either investment levels or U.S growth, or both. Many argue that given the depth and liquidity of our markets, and the attractiveness of the U.S. as a place to invest, some level of U.S. current account deficit is sustainable. But even those who are sanguine about our current position are troubled about the future.\nHow to reduce the current account deficit is a matter of significant debate as well. By definition, it can only be reduced through some combi­nation of increased exports and decreased imports relative to GDP. But few if any of the paths to current account reduction are cost free since, again, by definition, a slower pace of import growth suggests a slower pace of U.S. output growth. Perhaps the closest to a \"win-win\" would entail stronger economic growth in our major trading partners, leading to an increase in demand for U.S. exports. Indeed, achieving parity in the growth rates of our major trading partners and ourselves could go a long way toward a gradual and orderly reduction of the U.S. external deficit. It would, however, require strong, self-sustaining domestic-led growth in our major trading partners, something that has proven elusive, at least for the Euro-zone and Japan.\nIt is also true that the current account deficit would be reduced if foreigners decided they were no longer willing to invest their U.S. dollars in our country -- in other words, they could stop lending to us to make up for our lack of national savings. This could have serious consequences. Indeed, when developing countries have run external deficits of this relative size the results have usually involved major financial and economic crises.\nOf course one should not make hasty comparisons between the United States and developing economies. The strength and resilience of our economy, and the fact that our external debt is largely in our own currency should help to ward off the most significant negative consequences going forward. Moreover, the benefits of international trade accrue to both sides. U.S. consumers and businesses have benefited from buying foreign goods; foreigners have benefited as well from access to our liquid markets to purchase debt and equity with a desirable balance of risk and return. Thus, it is in U.S. interests, and in the interests of our major trading partners, to address trade imbalances in reasonable ways. But rec­ognizing this, how can policy help ensure such an outcome?\nThere are no easy answers here. Suffice it to say that policies aimed at increasing national savings are the best response to both rising fiscal and current account deficits. Given the expected waning of housing activity, consumers may well begin to save more. To be sure, that would be a good thing but it won't be enough. A great additional step would be to narrow the prospective federal fiscal deficit -- that is, reduce government dissaving -- through bringing the federal budget into balance. The federal deficit should be reined in before it begins to balloon as a share of GDP reflecting demographic change. While this is not a perfect solution, and it has real near-term costs, in the end it may be the only way to engineer a gradual way out of our debt burdens.\nIn sum, the short-run picture is a good one. With another year of solid growth at home and around the world, the economy will continue on a firm footing. The longer run poses challenges. One way to address these challenges is to increase our level of national savings. Personal savings rates need to rise, but a credible start on reining in our fiscal deficits is even more important. It won't be cost-free to be sure, but now is the time to start.",

            "highlights": "",
            "content": "Allied Social Science Associations Meeting\nIt's a pleasure to be here today with my two distinguished fellow panelists, John Taylor and my colleague Richard Fisher. Our topic – how monetary policymakers cope with uncertainty – is an important one given the impact that monetary policy can have on growth and inflation in the short run, and price stability over the longer term. Almost by definition, central banks operate in an uncertain world. Monetary policy works with a lag -- a long and variable lag as they say, though I wonder whether the reaction of financial markets in recent times may have made that lag somewhat shorter and perhaps less variable. Indeed, the significant moderation in economic volatility since the mid-80s, and the recent incredible resilience of the U.S. economy to a wide range of challenges suggests uncertainty may be smaller now, though the causes for these changes and how permanent they might be are matters of keen debate.\nNonetheless, making policy will always involve dealing with uncertainty as to both the economic outlook, and the effect of policy. How central banks manage this is critical to their success and critical to a variety of issues that have surrounded the practice of central banking for most of the last quarter century. Given the uncertainty in the sources of economic fluctuations and the transmission of monetary policy to the economy, how can the public hold central banks accountable for their policy decisions in the way that it might like to, given the high stakes involved? Should policymaking follow rules, and, thereby, reduce uncertainty about current and future policy? In the same vein, should central banks announce targets for inflation or other goals? And how should communication tools be used to convey what central banks are doing, or even what they are likely to do? I am not going to address all or even most of these questions, but I mention them to give a sense of the pervasiveness of the issues related to uncertainty in monetary policymaking.\nObviously, the views I will share with you about how policymakers cope with uncertainty are mine alone and not those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston or the System more broadly. I have been a member of the Federal Open Market Committee for 12 years. As many of you know, I came to the presidency of the Boston Fed after a career spent in Reserve Banks “making things work” broadly speaking, with plenty of experience helping to manage a variety of financial crises fraught with uncertainty. So I come to this topic as a practitioner, not a theoretician, though I have learned a great deal from the tremendous scholarship that has been devoted to this general area over the years.\nUncertainty affecting the setting and conduct of monetary policy arises in two forms. The first of these involves macro-economic and financial uncertainties that have the potential to affect the achievement of policy goals. This can involve such mundane matters as ambiguity about what current data are telling us about the future. It is never clear, for example, whether a stronger or weaker than expected employment report will be sustained or reversed by later data, and that unknown could bear on the near-term policy decision. There are reasonably clear frameworks for thinking about this sort of uncertainty, for asking \"what-ifs\" and modeling the results. Of a more substantive nature are uncertainties related to trends that could affect the performance of the economy over the medium term. What is the potential for an oil shock to feed through into core inflation? What is the yield curve telling us? What is the potential for current account imbalances to affect the macro-economy in a significant and negative way? For such uncertainties, \"what-ifs\" and models may be less effective and a more judgmental approach to policy setting is required.\nThe second form of uncertainty stems from major shocks that have the potential to threaten financial stability. These are unusual to be sure, but not unknown in my 12 years. Such events can stem from several sources — more or less traditional financial crises such as the Mexican and Russian debt problems or the LTCM crisis in the fall of 1998; the potential for severe operational disruption as in the face of Y2K, and, most recently, and tragically, the geopolitical and human horror of 9/11. Here judgment becomes all-important. What actions are necessary to limit the spread of systemic problems, and reduce the uncertainty that could paralyze markets?\nToday, I want to address how monetary policy copes with both types of uncertainty. I would also like to end with a few words on the important and related issue of how central bank communication is evolving as a tool with which to both explain the sources of uncertainty and reduce its level.\nCoping with uncertainty is both one of the most difficult aspects of being part of the FOMC, and the part that makes it so satisfying, as it involves an intellectual challenge as well as the performance of a public service. One highly important element in dealing with uncertainty is the strength of the Committee itself. In that regard, it is perhaps fashionable to deride committee decision making in general as bureaucratic and cumbersome. My view is that in situations where there are many possible philosophical approaches and a lot at stake, a committee helps its members to both see all aspects of the issue, and weigh the risks and costs of a particular decision. As with other vital institutions, like the Supreme Court, there is value to a committee decision on policy versus one taken by a single executive.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee brings together a diverse group of skilled policymakers with a wide range of perspectives and experiences to address the policy choice. It ensures that policymakers benefit from a range of views and economic frameworks that represent information culled from a broad swath of the economy. And the Committee works to create a consensus around policy choices – a consensus that, in my view, aids in communicating decisions. Moreover, the Committee's regional membership helps to create public acceptance of the sometimes difficult choices that are involved. So I view the structure and functioning of the Committee as a key first step to policy-making.\nWhen FOMC members gather to evaluate the information available and make a policy decision in the face of macroeconomic and financial uncertainty, they have plenty of tools at their disposal: numerous indicators and measures of economic activity, arguably the best economic models, and forecasts to put that information into an organized structure, and the lessons of history to guide them. All of this helps in assessing the current and prospective state of the U.S. economy.\nBut data and models aren't perfect and they never will be. Important indicators are imperfectly measured. There are always bands of uncertainty around the key relationships in the economy. And these relationships rarely stand still, as the effects of changing demographics, institutions, and technological progress alter previous regularities in household and business decision-making. As incoming data are evaluated, decisions about whether surprises are an aberration, a measurement problem, a temporary blip, or a sign that it's time to fundamentally reevaluate some aspect of an overall economic framework figure into each policymaker's calculus.\nPerhaps the most important of recent examples has been the uncertainty around trend productivity growth and technological change. For about a twenty-year period ending in the mid 1990s, productivity growth averaged only about 1.5 percent a year. As information technology and the power of computers expanded dramatically, many reasonably expected the economy to exhibit an increase in productivity. Yet for a relatively long time, none could be observed in the aggregate data, prompting Robert Solow's famous quip: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics”.\nBy the latter half of the '90s a substantial rise in measured productivity growth was seen and appreciated, first and foremost by Alan Greenspan. But there was a great deal of uncertainty about the source of the measured change. Was the apparent jump in productivity a temporary response to short-run demand surges that brought unused capacity back into production? Or was it likely to be permanent (or at least long-lived), reflecting the long-awaited fruits of years of investment in high-tech hardware, software, and process improvement? If the outsized surge was temporary, would productivity then revert back to the lower rates of the 1970's and 1980's as the expansion aged, or would some of the increase persist into the next century? The answers to these questions have important implications for sustainable economic growth without inflation, and thus for monetary policy. In this case, productivity growth has continued for a relatively long period of time, but at the time this was by no means certain, and it is no less uncertain today.\nHow have I as a policy maker learned to deal with such elements of uncertainty? In part, by setting a couple of standards for myself, and, in part, by using common sense and judgment. My first priority has been to maintain a focus on the important long-run goal of the central bank – price stability. Actions that sacrifice that goal, or have a clear potential to do so, will be quite costly. The hard won credibility of the central bank might suffer, with all that could mean for inflation expectations and price-setting in the economy. So – first things first. But, as we have seen, inflation — particularly measures of core inflation — has been slow to build in recent years. Thus, for much of my time on the Committee, my focus has been on striking the right balance between growth and price stability. How fast could the economy grow without waking the inflation giant? How much is globalization affecting the sense businesses have of their pricing power, and how long could the productivity boom insulate the economy from pressures related to rising compensation and unit labor costs? The answers to these questions and others were never patently obvious, so my preference has been to move with care, in steps that taken individually would have a small impact, but over time could build if that became necessary. So, for me, dealing with uncertainty means following two basic standards – “first things first” and \"move with care\"; that, to me, is the essence of a common sense approach to policy.\nAs an extension, it seems to me that a good policy has to be as informed as possible. This means depending on as many and as wide-ranging sources of information as one can. So my own view is that one should never rely on a single set of measures; look at multiple data sources for each economic process. And talk to or hear from as many people from as wide a variety of economic and geographic circumstances as you can. The structure of the Federal Reserve System and the Committee provides many opportunities to hear from a diverse group of people, both within the FOMC and among the Reserve Banks' varied outside contacts. Contacts and Committee members bring diverse backgrounds and experiences from a host of sectors, viewpoints, and regions.\nCommon sense also suggests to me that uncertainty means there is always a vital role for judgment in setting monetary policy. While the need for judgment will be most acute and obvious in times of systemic crisis, it always plays a key role in setting policy. To me this involves an eclectic approach to economic theories, rather than a reliance on any one specific doctrine; at times, aspects of all of them are useful. This does not mean that I do not appreciate the value of “policy rules”, most famously the “Taylor rule.” Such rules, which summarize the systematic response of monetary policymakers over long periods of time, are extremely useful as benchmarks or guidelines when making policy. In their various forms, rules can help a policy maker understand what a rigorous application of historical responses to various economic data might suggest for the stance of policy. This is instructive, but in my view not determinative, as a variety of things about the current economy may not necessarily be captured well by history or by simple rules. Finally, and in many ways most importantly, one has to judge both the balance of risks in any given stance of policy and what the costs of policy action or inaction might be. \"What-if\" scenarios can be helpful here, as I noted earlier, but in the end it is the policymaker's own sense of risks and costs that determine how he or she perceives the right policy choice. As Chairman Greenspan has noted, making monetary policy is about risk management, and, in my view, managing risks has an important judgmental component.\nThis brings us to the second combination of uncertainty and policy response that I noted earlier, the much more difficult uncertainty posed by unique, systemic financial shocks that threaten the very heart of the economy. Every once in a while -- actually more often than one would like -- the nation and policymakers at the Fed have to deal with an unexpected, major disruption. As I noted earlier, these have occurred with some frequency over the last 12 years, with one of the most recent examples being 9/11.\nThe events of September 11, 2001 were certainly unexpected and raised enormous fears for the nation and its economy. Watching the World Trade Towers crumble on national television was psychologically devastating — and the physical damage and security concerns closed the New York Stock Exchange and many firms with offices in lower Manhattan, with effects threatening to ripple throughout the economy. How do policymakers deal with these most dramatic and ultimately most threatening events?\nIn such extraordinary times, while the same standards of \"first things first\" and \"moving with care\" are important, judgment and timing become vital. Timeframes for action can be short and the pressure intense. The Committee can meet by phone between meetings to discuss issues and make policy changes if needed, and this has been done a few times during my tenure. In such circumstances, it is even more important than usual to gather information from diverse sources and from multiple perspectives. For example, during the days immediately following 9/11, staff at the Boston Fed were in touch with major market participants in the First District on a nearly round-the-clock basis, sorting out problems and helping the financial system work again after that tragedy. Boston was far from unique here; such intense activity occurred at Reserve Banks around the country, with New York and Washington taking the lead as policymakers coped with the aftermath of the tragedy.\nCrisis situations by definition imply that time is at a premium. Judgments need to be made about whether or not the system is in jeopardy, and making such judgments and assessing the probable outcomes is quite hard. The first and foremost important consideration for the Fed in these instances has to be the stability of the financial system. Knowing that, the first response must be a consideration of whether heightened liquidity is needed so that financial markets can function more or less normally. If such a decision is made, the provision of liquidity has to be temporary, but it is the key to market stability.\nIn the case of 9/11, the wholly appropriate decision of supplying extraordinary liquidity reflected the effect of the destruction of significant market infrastructure and the potential for market gridlock. Reserve balances swelled by almost $200 billion in the period following September 11th as the Fed flooded the markets with liquid assets. To offset the impact of a lack of air transportation, Reserve Banks gave credit for check deposits without immediately charging the payor, adding nearly $20 billion in reserves all by itself, and supported so-called “off-line” electronic transfers of funds and securities well into the night to help settle markets. As the crisis subsided, the unneeded reserve balances were withdrawn, but their presence was vital in stabilizing the situation.\nThe crisis also prompted a change in the stance of policy. At the time of the tragedy, the U.S. economy was already in the midst of what turned out to be a mild recession, although it had not formally been classified as such at that time. The federal funds rate had been cut seven times that year, taking it from 6 to 3.5 percent. In the face of the crisis, prospects for real GDP declines in the fourth quarter were significant, raising real issues of economic strength. The FOMC's response was to cut the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points, a decision made during a special telephone meeting on the Monday of the following week, and announced the same day. Remarkably, the economy proved much stronger than expected over the next several quarters, but at the time the possibility for lasting economic damage seemed very real.\nFinally, let me say a word about how the FOMC has begun to use communication with markets as a way of minimizing uncertainty. Attitudes regarding communicating central bank policy changes have evolved considerably over the 30+ years I have worked in the Federal Reserve System, and I believe there can be no doubt this has been a good thing. Until 1994, FOMC decisions were not made public until the publication of the minutes of the meeting, six to eight weeks afterward, although it was clear the market was quite adept at inferring the direction and size of funds rate changes within hours. Since that time, in several steps the Committee evolved to its present policy of announcing its action after every meeting, disclosing the vote and any dissents, and publishing the minutes of the meeting after three weeks. In my view, this level of communication has helped the public understand Fed policy, and has been useful recently in assuring jittery markets that policy accommodation could remain for “a considerable period”, and then be removed at “a measured pace”.\nIn a way, the last couple of years have been the exception that proves the rule about the uncertainty involved in setting monetary policy -- there has been considerable economic uncertainty globally and in the U.S., but not much uncertainty about the needed direction of U.S. monetary policy. Short-term interest rates needed to rise, but the question was when to begin, and how long to continue. While the Committee is still working on an answer to that last question, I believe the overall process -- including communicating as we did -- has had both advantages and perhaps raised some reasons for caution. On the positive side, it has aided in a rather smooth transition from an economy functioning with lots of support from both monetary and fiscal policy, to one that appears to have solid, non-policy-driven, forward momentum, though the smoothness of this transition likely owes something to the overall moderation in economic volatility I noted at the start of my comments. In recent years, in part guided by statement language, markets have helped to keep financial conditions supportive of growth. The U.S. as an economic engine figured importantly in world-wide growth over the period as well.\nA possible reason to be cautious involves both the power communication can have and the certainty it can foster. It is clear that communication by policymakers, whether in the statement itself or in speeches or testimony, can be quite powerful. Even when carefully crafted, it risks the interpretation of a pre-commitment to action when that is not the intent. I recognize forward-looking language from a central bank can help to anchor markets, but, absent unusual circumstances, I wonder whether the resulting sense of policy certainty that can be conveyed is appropriate given the fact that often the next move of the Committee is not a foregone conclusion. Is there a risk that such communication will limit the flexibility of monetary policy setting? Or, conversely, could such communication produce policy inertia? I do not know the answers to these questions but they do nag at me.\nAnd, in my view, we may be entering a period in which policy changes are even more dependent than they have been on current readings of the economy, with all the uncertainty such readings can bring. So, as the Committee's minutes have suggested and its recent policy statement confirms, its communication is evolving. In that regard, I believe it will be important to consider how best to convey what the Committee did and why in the context of the uncertainty involved in future policy action. Of course, making such fine distinctions can be quite difficult particularly as markets now vigorously deconstruct every aspect of the Committee's policy statements.\nIn sum, policymaking always occurs surrounded by a cloud of uncertainty. I view the standards of focusing first on price stability, moving with care, and using common sense and judgment about risks as critical to making policy in such an environment. In extreme circumstances, calming markets and restoring confidence with an ample but temporary supply of liquidity is vital in addressing market uncertainty. Finally, I believe as FOMC communication evolves, as it inevitably will, policymakers should move carefully in recognition of the power such communication can have.",
