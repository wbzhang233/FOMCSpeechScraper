2024 UNCW Economic Outlook Conference
Wilmington Convention Center
Wilmington, N.C.

• The FOMC cut the fed funds rate 50 basis points at our September meeting. This cut
came largely because of the progress we’ve made on in�ation.
• At times, in the past, the FOMC has made such a signi�cant rate cut in response to a
troubled economy. Happily, that is not the case today.
• I see our September decision as a recalibration to a somewhat less restrictive stance.
• Victory means di�erent things to di�erent people, and — while we have made real
progress — there remains signi�cant uncertainty on both in�ation and employment.
• As we decide how fast to move and how far to go during this rate reduction cycle, we
are just going to need to be attentive and learn as we go.

Thank you for that kind introduction. I thought today I might talk about how I see the
economy and where it may be headed. I’ll then turn it over to you, and I look forward to
your questions and comments. I should caution that these are my thoughts alone and not
necessarily those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the
Federal Reserve System.
As you’ve likely seen, the FOMC cut the fed funds rate 50 basis points at our September
meeting. This cut came largely because of the progress we’ve made on in�ation. Twelvemonth headline PCE in�ation is now 2.2 percent, well down from its peak of 7.1 percent in
June 2022. Core is at 2.7 percent. Near-term in�ation expectations are back in line with our
2 percent target. If we look at the most recent data, the in�ation picture is even better:
Three-month core in�ation is only slightly above target at 2.1 percent. Importantly, the

decline in in�ation appears to be broad-based, not just limited to goods as we had seen
previously.
Consumers are driving this drop. Frustrated by high prices, they have become increasingly
price conscious. They’re still spending, but they’re choosing: trading down from beef to
chicken, from sit-down restaurants to fast casual, from brand names to private label.
They’re waiting for promotions: opting for the $5 value meal at McDonald’s or jumping on
discounts at Target. This is how it is supposed to work! The old saying is that the solution to
high prices is high prices. And that’s what we are �nally seeing. Their choices are pressuring
price-setters to �nally moderate price increases.
At times, in the past, the FOMC has made such a signi�cant rate cut in response to a
troubled economy. Happily, that is not the case today. As in�ation has moderated,
economic activity has remained robust. GDP came in at 3 percent in the second quarter, a
more than healthy growth rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent
of GDP, has risen at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent in the last two months, supported by
low unemployment, higher real wages and high valuations. Thanks in part to this strong
spending, the U.S. economy has returned to its pre-pandemic GDP trend, a feat that we
never achieved after the Great Recession and that most other advanced economies can’t
claim.
The labor market has remained in good shape as well. We’ve added an average of 116,000
jobs over the last three months. Unemployment has ticked up but remains low at 4.2
percent, near most estimates of its natural rate. Given how overheated the labor market
was just a few years ago, some normalization was to be expected.
Why did the FOMC reduce rates so signi�cantly if we are not seeing a troubled economy or
weak labor market? I see our September decision as a recalibration to a somewhat less
restrictive stance. After over a year at a 5.3 percent fed funds rate, headline in�ation had
come down closer to target while unemployment was near its natural rate. The number
that now seemed out of sync was the fed funds rate, which no longer needed to be as
restrictive given the progress that’s been made. Going forward, the median member of the
FOMC forecasted another 50 basis points in cuts this year, assuming the data come in as
expected. This dial back in restraint just takes a little bit of the edge o�.
I assume many of you were happy to see us start to bring rates down. But please
remember that our focus has never been on the rates themselves but on in�ation. High
rates are merely a tool to get in�ation under control, and I’ve been glad to see that we have
done so with limited collateral damage to date.
Does this cut signal that we are declaring victory? Let me start with some history. “Let’s
declare victory and go home” is a pretty cynical phrase traced back to the 1960s, when Sen.
George Aiken proposed that the United States should call Vietnam a win and begin to deescalate, regardless of the realities on the ground. As an aside, it’s never good to adopt a
strategy from the Vietnam era.

So, I’m not yet con�dent nor cynical enough to declare victory. I’ll walk through three
reasons:
First, victory means di�erent things to di�erent people. I talk to many people for whom
victory would be returning to 2021 interest rates or to pre-pandemic price levels. Both
would be challenging absent a signi�cant recession, which I venture to say would not be a
win. Some de�ne victory as a stock market that continually moves up, but of course, we
can’t and don’t seek to control the stock market. And you may yearn for the stability of the
2010s, when GDP and employment grew consistently and in�ation barely moved. That
decade, however, was unique in recent history. So declaring victory seems bound to
disappoint.
Second, there is still work to do on in�ation. While down from its high, in�ation remains
above our 2 percent target. I don’t expect 12-month core in�ation to drop much further
until 2025, as we are still lapping low in�ation numbers from late last year.
Forecasting in�ation going forward is challenging. On the positive side, we may continue to
get help from supply-side factors like immigration, increased labor force participation and
productivity, as well as from global factors like disin�ation coming from China and
increased energy production. Last I saw, per-barrel oil prices were down in the $70s. On the
other hand, I just got my homeowner’s insurance renewal, and it reminded me that
in�ationary pressures have not fully disappeared. Recent union actions or a pullback in
labor supply could drive higher wages. Health care cost trends could raise premiums
further. Deglobalization could increase import prices. The con�ict in the Middle East could
worsen.
I am paying particular attention to the potential impact of our recent rate move on pricing
for houses and cars. Buyers will welcome lower rates, but there is a risk that demand is
stimulated in excess of available supply. Remember, it takes time to get new houses built
and move cars onto lots. Locked-in homeowners may well start to list their homes as
mortgage rates drop, but these sellers will also be buyers, increasing demand while they
are adding to supply.
So it remains di�cult to say that the in�ation battle has yet been won.
A third reason not to declare victory is risk to the labor market. The levels, as I mentioned,
look healthy, but the trends bear watching. Job gains are being continually revised down,
and those sectors (like health care) that have been catching up from pandemic shortages
are moderating their growth. In fact, the hiring rate has dropped down to 2013 levels. But
while employers aren’t hiring, they also aren’t �ring: The layo� rate is near 25-year lows and
initial claims remain muted. Cautious employers are allowing head count to drift
downward, but largely through attrition. I hear very few employers planning layo�s (and
layo�s do take planning).
This low hiring-low �ring environment is unlikely to persist, but again I could make a case
that it could evolve in either direction. Of course, a cycle of layo�s could start given pro�t

pressures and the excess sta�ng many have chosen to keep after their pandemic-era
shortages. But demand remains healthy and lower rates could add momentum. Those
employers running lean could well �nd themselves short again, particularly if labor force
growth starts to slow. At some point you have to hire to serve your customers.
You might notice that I’m wearing a suit, not a “mission accomplished” bomber jacket. It’s
not that I’m particularly humble (or formal). I’m just realistic. Victory means di�erent things
to di�erent people, and — while we have made real progress — there remains signi�cant
uncertainty on both in�ation and employment. And while we are working hard to deliver
for the U.S. economy, we almost certainly won’t get it perfect. Perfection would be a high
bar when we operate in an environment fraught with uncertainty, under a mandate
requiring trade-o�s, with a primary tool — the federal funds rate — that works with long
and variable lags and without a �nish line. So as we decide how fast to move and how far to
go during this rate reduction cycle, we are just going to need to be attentive and learn as
we go. I’m hoping to start that process with your questions and comments today.
