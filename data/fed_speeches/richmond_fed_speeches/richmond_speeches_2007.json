        "content": "Thank you very much, Henry. It's a pleasure to return to Charlotte again at the end of the year to discuss the economic outlook.1\n\nI'll begin by discussing current conditions in a bit more detail, before going on to discuss the outlook for the coming year. Before we begin though, let me note that the usual disclaimer applies – the views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\n\nClearly, the severity of the housing market downturn, along with the attendant financial market fallout, has been the dominant macro-economic development of the past year. After a 10-year expansion, residential investment peaked in late 2005. Since then, construction and sales have fallen fairly sharply, first in large metropolitan areas that had seen the strongest booms, and then spreading this year to other markets where housing price increases were less pronounced. Despite the falloff in construction, inventories of unsold homes have risen sharply. These swollen inventories are currently depressing home prices and new construction.\n\nSpeaking of prices, home prices increased significantly during the long boom, particularly in local markets with restricted supply. Existing home prices increased about 90 percent between 1995 and 2005 for the nation as a whole. In the Washington, D.C., market, prices increased 148 percent from 1995 to 2005 and rose another 11 percent in 2006. Here in Charlotte, prices climbed by 49 percent over the same 10-year period and increased by another 17 percent since then. Of course, rapid increases in real quality-adjusted prices are not indefinitely sustainable for any asset, and in the case of housing, potential buyers eventually get priced out of the market. In many markets, prices changed course quickly, but in others prices have continued to increase. Average prices for the nation as a whole fell in the third quarter of 2007 by 0.4 percent, which is the first national price decline since 1994. And in formerly hot markets, the declines have been larger, with prices falling over 5 percent in San Diego, for example. Prices have also fallen significantly in areas with weak regional economies, like Michigan and northern Ohio.\n\nDevelopments in housing finance arguably have played a substantial role in the behavior of housing markets. Here the long-term story is the technology-driven wave of innovation in retail credit delivery that dramatically expanded access to mortgage credit over the last decade, just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer credit earlier on. Technology also has contributed to innovation in securitization and other forms of intermediation of credit flows, which also helped lower borrowing costs. As with any new product or service innovation, however, some experimentation and risk was involved.\n\nFuture research may quantify the extent to which credit market innovations contributed to a boom in housing market activity by expanding the pool of potential homeowners. In any event, when the growth in housing demand came to an end, home prices peaked and began falling in many markets. In hindsight, it seems clear that the success of new methods of lending to riskier borrowers was to some extent dependent on sustained home price appreciation, which provided strained borrowers with the ability to refinance, thus masking the effects of more inclusive underwriting. It takes some time, however, for the likely ultimate loss experience of a mortgage portfolio to become evident. While observers were raising concerns early on – the late Federal Reserve Governor Ned Gramlich, for example 2\n– it wasn't until this year, after home prices had peaked in some major markets, that more quantitative evidence began to emerge regarding the substantial extent to which mortgage loans made in 2006 would underperform previous vintages. The ensuing adjustment in underwriting standards further contributed to the decline in housing demand.\n\n\n\nThe story behind this year's unfolding drama in credit markets is the continuing re-assessment of the fundamental value of nonprime mortgages. Demand fell for financial securities exposed to those assets, as well as a range of related securities. Many of these securities were the liabilities of entities with explicit or implicit bank lending guarantees. Many banks that provided such guarantees have had to either meet large funding demands or bring the impaired assets onto their balance sheets. Uncertainty about the scale of such adjustments has generally meant higher funding and capital costs, although risk premia have increased far more for some institutions than for others.\n\nIn the last several weeks wholesale funding markets have increasingly shown the effects of heightened uncertainty surrounding financial institutions' adjustment requirements. Term funding spreads relative to expected overnight rates have become quite elevated for some banks, differentiation in rates across institutions has become more pronounced, and the volume of term funding appears to have contracted. Increases in interbank interest rates associated with year-end, balance-sheet considerations have occurred in the past, but market participants appear to expect low overnight rates over the year-end this time. This suggests that term funding premia reflect assessments of counterparty risk rather than expectations that the funds rate may spike.\n\nCredit terms have tightened for non-financial borrowers as well. Mortgage rate spreads have increased significantly for riskier borrowers and riskier products, and many lenders are requiring larger down payments. Spreads for high-yield debt and commercial mortgage-backed securities have risen sharply. On the other hand, sound businesses with negligible exposure to housing markets have seen little change in the terms on which they can access credit. The strong differentiation in the response of lending spreads across borrower classes suggests that increasing spreads have been driven mainly by changing risk assessments rather than bank funding pressures.\n\nHow will all this affect the economy going forward? Higher risk spreads and generally tighter lending terms will tend to restrict spending in the near term. But short- and long-term Treasury rates have fallen in the last few months, providing a partial offset to higher spreads. The net effect is lower rates for low-risk borrowers, but higher rates for riskier borrowers.\n\nThe housing sector has been and will continue to be affected by the tightening we've seen in lending terms. Home construction and sales are unlikely to bottom out before the middle of the year, and I expect housing to continue to be a drag on growth well into 2008. Business investment is likely to continue to grow, but less robustly than in 2007, as some firms face a higher cost of capital and many firms see more uncertainty in the demand for their products. Exports will be a source of strength next year, as a weaker dollar and strong economies overseas support demand for U.S. goods and services. Accordingly, the trade deficit is likely to continue to narrow, providing a modest boost to real GDP growth.\n\nThe main story in the forecast, though, remains household spending, which accounts for 70 percent of GDP. Higher energy prices and falling home prices are cited often as factors that could dampen consumer spending, and these are legitimate concerns. At the same time, though, I have learned not to underestimate the resilience of the American consumer, and here I see some reasonably encouraging signs. Job growth has slowed this year, but even so, payroll employment has expanded by an average of 100,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Moreover, wage gains are outpacing inflation now, and thus real incomes are continuing to expand. I believe the most-likely scenario, therefore, is for reasonably solid income growth next year that will support further gains in consumer spending.\n\nPutting it all together, I expect growth to be very weak for several more months, but to improve as we move through 2008. So if I had to guess – as my host, Henry, insists – I would write down that real GDP growth will be between 2 and 2 ¼ percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008. This represents a growth rate somewhat below long-run trend. I would agree that the most cogent risks to the growth outlook are on the downside – for example, the possibility that household and business spending could come in lower than I expect. Nevertheless, I believe the most likely outcome is for growth to continue and to improve over the course of next year. My baseline outlook is more benign than some others that I am aware of, but I should note that it does not depend on an overly sanguine view of financial market conditions, which are, after all, a significant source of uncertainty right now. Much remains to be learned about the magnitude of ultimate losses in various mortgage market segments and on various related securities. Episodes of turmoil could recur in response to new information. But I believe that financial market participants will find ways to work through problems as the year progresses. Financial intermediaries will re-adjust balance sheets and replenish capital as needed, and investors' desire for transparency will help shape the next generation of financial innovations.\n\nLet me conclude by discussing the inflation picture. As measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price index, inflation was 3.5 percent ending in June 2006. That measure of inflation fell to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Similarly, core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices, was 2.5 percent in August 2006, and then declined to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Those declines were heartening, and when the financial market turmoil intensified in August the improving inflation picture allowed even an inflation hawk to endorse an easier monetary policy stance. Since August, however, the inflation picture has deteriorated. In September and October, the overall PCE price index rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate, and the core index rose at a 2.6 percent rate. Judging by the closely related consumer price index, the numbers for November will be even worse. Now these numbers do display transitory swings, so I wouldn't extrapolate them forward indefinitely. Still, I have to say that I am uncomfortable with the inflation picture, and disappointed that the improvement we saw earlier this year was not more lasting.\n\nI am also troubled by the lengthy divergence we've seen between overall and core inflation. Some of you may recall that core inflation was devised in the 1970s to filter out some of the more volatile consumer prices to get a better read on inflation trends. For several decades, core inflation seemed to work well due to the fact that food and energy prices had no clear trend relative to the overall price level. In the last few years, though, overall inflation has been persistently above core inflation, and few observers expect oil prices to go back below $20 per barrel. Because the job of a central banker is to protect the purchasing power of currency, it is overall inflation that we need to keep down, not just core inflation. Going forward, markets expect oil prices to back off slightly from their current level, and I hope they are right. If energy prices fail to decline, monetary policy decisions will be that much more difficult in 2008."

        "content": "By now I'm sure the events of this past summer are very familiar to most financial market professionals.1\n Since these events form the backdrop for my discussion of the central bank's role in credit markets, I will begin with a quick review. As the housing downturn that began early in 2006 deepened, delinquencies, defaults, and loss rates rose on high-risk mortgages, particularly more recent vintages. In response to unfolding events — including rating agency downgrades and losses and insolvencies at various intermediaries — participants in markets for instruments with mortgage debt exposure revised downward their assessments of the likely future returns on the underlying assets. At times investors had difficulty discerning the magnitude of their counterparty's vulnerability and thus distinguishing among various instruments. This became particularly acute in early August following a suspension of fund redemptions by a large European intermediary, and for several days thereafter many markets were roiled as investors appeared to pull back from a broad range of asset classes.\n\n\n\nAs market participants sorted out the implications of these developments, concerns centered on the segment of the asset-backed commercial paper market with exposure to high-risk mortgage debt. Revised risk assessments gave rise to large portfolio shifts among money market mutual funds and Treasury bill markets, and significantly reduced many investors' willingness to pay for mortgage-backed securities and related asset-backed commercial paper. Many ABCP issuers were unable to refinance their positions on terms as advantageous as before. As a result, many banks that sponsored or provided back-up support to commercial paper conduits have faced large potential funding draws and the possibility of substantial hits if poorly performing assets come onto their balance sheets. Revised risk reassessments also affected markets for other structured finance products.\n\nThe substantial shift in some banks' funding outlooks has had tactical implications for their participation in the interbank money market and has led to increased rate volatility and heightened term lending spreads. In response, the Fed has acted to help ensure the smooth operation of the federal funds market. On August 10, a day of notable volatility, the New York Fed's open market desk engaged in larger than usual operations, intervening on multiple occasions and adding $38 billion that day, the largest amount since the days following September 11, 2001. Unusually high volatility in the federal funds market persisted, however, which complicated the desk's operations in the days thereafter. On August 17, the Fed reduced the discount rate, the rate on our collateralized loans to banks, cutting the spread between the lending rate and the federal funds target rate in half from its typical 100 basis points. We usually look to the discount rate to provide a cap on the cost of overnight funds for sound institutions, so reducing the cap helped limit funds rate volatility. In addition, the Fed's August 17 action provided for term lending (up to 30 days) through the discount window, motivated by the elevated level of term premiums.\nAt times of market tumult, people look to the central bank to assure financial stability. But sometimes there is uncertainty about what actions, if any, the central bank can or will take in response to market events, and there are legitimate differences of opinion about the appropriateness of alternative responses. While several central banks were visibly adding unusual quantities of reserves this summer, the Bank of England stood out in its resistance to taking drastic actions in providing extraordinary credit to banks experiencing difficulties. Even there, however, the central bank did act when a large mortgage lender, Northern Rock, experienced a run by its depositors.\n\nUsing this summer's events as a test case, I'd like to discuss the role of the central bank in credit markets. In doing so, I'll suggest that central banks face a fundamental dilemma. The provision of central bank credit, for instance through the discount window, is typically understood as one of the means by which a central bank provides the financial system with liquidity, in this case meaning central bank account balances. One rationale for central bank credit provision is the notion that, absent sufficient liquidity, financial assets may trade at prices below their fundamental values. The dilemma is that when we see assets trading at prices that seem below normal, or when we see the volume of trading activity fall below what we think of as normal levels, we can almost never be sure whether these shortfalls reflect a shortage of liquidity or simply a re-evaluation of fundamental values by market participants. And these two different interpretations have very different implications for the appropriateness of central bank actions.\n\nAs I examine this dilemma, I'll take what might seem like a detour by talking about this year's Nobel Prize in economics, which was awarded to Leo Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, and Roger Meyerson for contributions to something called \"mechanism design theory.\"2\n Given the way the press covered the award, this might seem like an abstruse subject, at best remotely connected to my main topic for today. But they are quite intimately connected because this field of economics really supplies the best tools we have for thinking coherently about financial institutions, financial innovation, and the incentives created by the complex and ever-changing array of financial contracts available to investors, businesses, and consumers. In fact, mechanism design is the theoretical foundation of the work of credit risk specialists like yourselves as you analyze the features of modern credit-related contracts. You might say that mechanism design is where one would find the tools to build a formal theory of what you actually do.\n\n\n\nAt its core, mechanism design is about determining what kind of contractual arrangements will work best in the situations that market participants might find themselves in. While these tools may not always provide definitive answers to important questions, they do provide a way of thinking systematically about the right questions. As I'll discuss, this seemingly arcane body of knowledge has important implications for how to think about the dilemmas associated with the role of the central bank in credit markets, particularly during periods of market turmoil. This is when central banks are forced to make judgments about what impediments, if any, are interfering with the normal operation of credit market mechanisms, and how policy actions might or might not be capable of overcoming those impediments.\n\nFinancial Markets, Intermediaries and Innovation\n\nFinancial markets, instruments, and institutions play an essential role in the allocation of resources in a modern economy. By channeling funds from ultimate savers to ultimate borrowers, they facilitate the movement of resources to their highest-valued uses — from households and firms with relatively low demand for current resources (consumption or investment today) to households and firms whose present needs and wants are more pressing. At the same time, the financial system allocates the ultimate returns on those investments among the savers who contributed to them. Some savers may seek safe returns, while others may tolerate more risk. Hence, the allocation of returns serves to allocate the risks associated with investing resources.\n\nThe simple textbook model of the funds-channeling function envisions a supply curve representing the availability of funds from savers at different interest rates, and a demand curve representing people's willingness to borrow. The market-clearing interest rate is the one that equates the two. But this description assumes that financing flows directly from those firms and households that are savers to those that are borrowers. While this might be a reasonable abstraction for some types of financial transactions — such as the issuance of corporate bonds or equities — for others (and even for corporate obligations), the allocation of financial resources is facilitated by one or more types of intermediaries. The simple textbook approach is poorly equipped to handle questions about the structure of intermediaries or the source of their comparative advantage.\n\nWe usually think of intermediaries as solving problems associated with limited information — savers may have neither the ability nor the inclination to make granular distinctions regarding the credit risk associated with the widely varying borrowers seeking funds. So they place their funds with intermediaries — banks or investment funds — to whom they essentially delegate the responsibility for evaluating and monitoring borrowers. In this way, financial market intermediaries exist because they can improve upon the allocation of resources among savers and borrowers that can be achieved using a direct investment market alone. The harder it is for savers to get direct, reliable information about borrowers, the greater the role intermediaries will play in the financial system.\n\nMechanism design theory provides an approach for addressing precisely these questions about how institutions arise and adapt in response to incentive and information problems. This approach then allows us to study and compare the diverse institutions that exist in an economy and play a role in the allocation of resources — markets, firms, banks, clearing houses, and even central banks and governments. More precisely, these contractual and institutional arrangements all constitute alternative mechanisms for allocating resources, and the approach is to study the properties of the best possible resource allocations that any mechanism is capable of achieving. For example, how well does it do at funding appropriate investments and allocating the attendant risk? One can then compare how close alternative mechanisms come to achieving those allocations. If one set of arrangements can achieve superior allocations, but others cannot, then one has a candidate explanation for why such an intermediary might exist.\n\nAny set of institutional or contractual arrangements — any mechanism — will naturally be constrained by the initial availability of resources and technologies, but they also will be constrained by the degree to which information is limited and dispersed. For example, if you want to allocate credit to the highest quality borrowers, you need a way of determining who the highest quality borrowers are. If you want to share with a broad set of investors the risks associated with lending to a large pool of mortgage borrowers, someone needs to be able to keep track of the performance of the actual loans, and investors need to trust that that task will be performed effectively and honestly. These are examples of limited information in resource allocation problems.\n\nClassical economics was based largely on the notion that markets were a particularly effective institution for efficiently allocating resources, and especially adept at aggregating the diverse information held by large numbers of widely dispersed market participants. An earlier Nobel laureate — George Ackerlof — described a specific informational problem that can hamper a market's effectiveness. He labeled this the \"Lemons Problem,\" and it occurs when a good can come in varying qualities, and when sellers, but not buyers, can distinguish high from low quality prior to a transaction occurring.3\n Buyers of used cars can't easily distinguish good from bad, so higher quality cannot easily command a higher price and would-be sellers of higher quality cars keep their cars off the market. This is a specific example of a general phenomenon known as \"adverse selection,\" which also applies to the credit market problem of figuring out who are the best borrowers. Other types of informational problems that can be relevant in the allocation of credit include \"moral hazard\" — the problem that a lender cannot always monitor or precisely prescribe the actions to be taken by a borrower — as well as the general problem that a borrower may be in a position to misrepresent the outcome of his use of funds.4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe constraints imposed on achievable outcomes by informational asymmetries should be common sense to this audience. An array of commonly observed contractual features appear aimed at limiting a debtor's moral hazard — for example, material adverse change clauses and other debt covenants limit the distortion to risk-taking incentives. More broadly, mechanism design supports our traditional understanding of banks as specialists in the information-intensive aspects of finance. The modern version of that understanding is that bank-like intermediaries are an efficient mechanism for the organization of credit markets in the face of adverse selection or other informational frictions. A number of advances in the economics of financial intermediation have taken this approach.5\n\n\n\nIt's important to realize that real-world financial institutions are much more complex than in the typical model studied by mechanism design. So this theory is not yet ready to give us precise answers about how to design institutions in practical applications. But as a set of theoretical tools it helps us to understand, in a careful and internally consistent way, how the institutional arrangements we actually observe arise as adaptive responses to important characteristics of real-world resource allocation problems.\n\nThinking about financial markets and institutions in terms of mechanism design also can help us understand the process of financial innovation. I have spoken elsewhere, as have many other observers, about the wave of innovation in financial instruments and practices that swept through the economy in recent decades.6\n Improvements in communications and computing technology lowered the cost of transmitting and analyzing information, and appeared to reduce informational constraints and expand the set of attainable outcomes. Achieving improved allocations required new economic mechanisms — new types of financial instruments and new types of financial institutions.\n\n\n\nBut finding the arrangements that reaped the benefits of the expanded opportunities made possible by new technologies required some experimentation in economic mechanisms. The realization of opportunities for improvement is rarely certain, because the use of mechanism design in actual financial market practice sometimes does not proceed as neatly as it might on the theorist's whiteboard. In order to know whether a new contractual form or institutional arrangement represents an improvement, it must be tried. Its success or failure provides information that will inform future efforts at innovation.\n\nThe Credit Market Tumult of the Summer of 2007\n\nThe story of how we got to where we found ourselves this summer — circumstances that induced the Federal Reserve to alter credit terms at the discount window — is a story about financial innovation, a story of experimentation in economic mechanisms. Application of information technology to the gathering and analysis of data on borrowers' financial histories resulted in finer assessments of credit risk and expanded access to home mortgage credit for borrowers with riskier credit profiles. The improved assessment of credit risk, along with other advances in information technology, also facilitated the broad development of markets in which individual loans are pooled and securitized, thus allowing these pooled exposures to be priced in active capital markets.\n\nThe decisions of participants in these innovative financial arrangements — including borrowers, originators, securitizers, funding providers, rating agencies, and of course investors — all embodied implicit judgments regarding the likelihood of success. As housing markets slowed beginning in early 2006, delinquencies and defaults on subprime and some nontraditional mortgages rose more rapidly than had been anticipated. With hindsight those original expectations appear to have been disappointed along several dimensions. Home price decelerations and downturns across a number of regions meant that many borrowers with little or no home equity at purchase would have an incentive to skip payments in the event of financial stress. And anecdotal reports suggest that the ability of loan originators to contain the incentive of borrowers or mortgage brokers to falsify documentation on so-called \"no-doc\" or \"low-doc\" loans was overestimated.\n\nThe bottom line, then, was that aggregate conditions in the housing market had led to greater than anticipated losses on many of the new mortgage products. This meant inevitably that at least some of the securities derived from these products would underperform as well. But the complexity of the securitization process, as well as the process by which securities were re-intermediated in commercial paper programs or collateralized debt obligations, made it hard to sort out where that underperformance would surface. This opacity appeared to create a general distrust — a lemons problem — which often depressed trading activity in markets for mortgage-related instruments. This problem was particularly acute at times, such as in mid-August, when risks were being reassessed fairly rapidly.\n\nAlthough the complex web of contractual financing arrangements in mortgage finance are somewhat beyond our ability to model formally, mechanism design theory does provide useful perspectives. For example, the strain experienced by many financial institutions suggests that one of the lessons from this recent experiment in applied mechanism design is that a mechanism that we expect to work well in normal circumstances may disappoint if the unexpected happens.\n\nThe Role of the Central Bank in Credit Markets: Regulating Credit\n\nThere are two related, but distinct roles that the Federal Reserve has to play in relation to credit market mechanisms. First, the Fed is a regulator with supervisory authority over significant parts of the financial system. A financial regulator has a fine line to walk regarding innovation and experimentation of the type recently seen in credit markets. We usually think of innovation and experimentation as being good things, and I believe this is true in financial markets as well. But the existence of the financial safety net for depository institutions does mean that there may be some contingencies to which private market participants pay less than optimal attention. Experimentation is a form of risk taking after all. And like any risk-taking activity, there is a legitimate supervisory interest in assessing the prudence with which institutions undertake innovative activities or products.\nWhat makes striking this balance difficult is that, by its nature, assessing the risks associated with an innovative activity does not lend itself as neatly to quantitative risk measurement tools. Quantitative risk assessment requires data from reasonably comparable circumstances, which is often lacking when we are talking about a new activity or product. For example, there was no obvious historical parallel to the scale of subprime lending in recent years — certainly not over an entire cycle of expansion and contraction in housing market activity. Rather than resisting financial innovation wholesale, supervisors should look at this kind of activity in the broader context of an institution's systems and processes for evaluating risks and making decisions, as well as the institution's capital position.\n\nPrudential regulatory regimes can exert an independent influence on the direction and character of financial innovation. Indeed, at times financial innovations appear to derive a portion of their benefits from their ability to bypass regulatory constraints and capital levies on the activities of covered intermediaries. This does not mean that such innovations are necessarily undesirable, but it does imply that supervisors need to assess the extent to which a particular innovation expands the set of allocations the financial system is capable of delivering, and should scrutinize such innovations to try to ensure consistent and uniform treatment of economically equivalent arrangements.7\n\n\n\nThe Role of the Central Bank in Credit Markets: Extending Credit\n\nBeyond its role as a regulator, the Fed, like other central banks, also has the role of lender of last resort. Through their discount windows, the Federal Reserve Banks offer collateralized loans to qualified depository institutions. The traditional view of a central bank's role as a lender of last resort dates back 200 years to the English economist Henry Thornton. Later in the 19th century, his ideas were elaborated upon by Walter Bagehot, and it is from Bagehot that most modern thinking on the topic derives.8\n The prescription stemming from this tradition can be stated simply — in times of financial stress, the central bank should lend freely at a penalty rate, on good collateral, to sound institutions. Current Federal Reserve policy conforms well to classical lender of last resort doctrine; the discount rate is set at a fixed spread above the target federal funds rate, and solvent depository institutions are free to borrow up to the amount of the collateral they have pledged. Collateral haircuts are applied to provide cushion against loss, and to avoid distorting markets for the underlying collateral.\n\n\n\nThis traditional view of central bank lending aims for a balance between potential costs and benefits. The benefits stem from the central bank's ability to provide liquidity to financial markets. Without an adequate supply of reserves, financial markets might not function effectively, resulting in increased costs of credit and reduced economic activity. But in this regard, it is important to remember that 19th century observers wrote at a time when lending really was the only way the central bank provided liquidity. Indeed, when the Fed was founded in 1913, discount window lending was envisioned as the primary means of providing reserves to the banking system. Today, the Fed's primary means of supplying reserves is through open-market operations, which is how the federal funds rate is kept at the target rate. In fact the effect of discount window loans on the overall supply of liquidity is automatically offset, or \"sterilized,\" to avoid pushing the federal funds rate below the target. So it is important to distinguish carefully a central bank's monetary policy function of regulating the total supply of reserves from central bank credit policy, which reallocates reserves among banks.9\n\n\n\nThere can be situations in which impediments prevent the market from effectively redistributing reserves among banks. In such situations, central bank lending can be useful because it can provide liquidity to specific institutions that would otherwise be unable to obtain it directly from other banks. A prime example is the period just after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when operational problems constrained interbank funds transfers.10\n\n\n\nThe potential cost of central bank lending is that it can distort private credit markets. This cost can apply in both the short run and the long run. The potential long run cost is the familiar problem of moral hazard. That is, central bank lending, to the extent that it lessens the pain felt by institutions in a particular event, could reasonably create an expectation that similar relief would be forthcoming in similar events in the future. Such an expectation can affect the exposures that market participants are willing to take on in the future. This potential for a long run cost in the form of incentive distortions exists even if the central bank's action is beneficial on net in the short run.\n\nEven in the short run, central bank lending can interact with private credit evaluation in a potentially costly way. A central bank that is willing to lend against a particular type of collateral on terms more favorable than are available in the market could raise the market value of that collateral above what it otherwise would be. Whether this effect is desirable depends on whether the market's price is \"right.\" By right price, when talking about asset prices, we usually mean in line with fundamentals — that is, with an unbiased assessment of the risks and expected returns available from holding an asset.\n\nTo take a concrete example, this summer we saw a dramatic decline in the trading of mortgage-related assets, particularly those tied to subprime or other nontraditional mortgages. Market participants seeking to sell or borrow against such assets could do so only at steep discounts. One possible interpretation of these events is that the market for these assets was suffering from a loss of \"liquidity\" — the market froze up, and in effect, nobody was trading because nobody else was trading. Under this view, what trades did occur took place below the \"fundamental value\" of the assets. This view implies a potentially beneficial role for a credit policy intervention, in the form of central bank lending to help relax constraints on liquidity supply and allow prices to move toward fundamental values.11\n\n\n\nAn alternative interpretation of depressed asset prices is that the fundamentals had changed. Realizations of growing losses on the underlying class of mortgages caused the true economic value of these assets to fall. In this view, overall market liquidity was adequate, as evidenced by the significant amount of funds that had been shifted out of mortgage-related assets and in principle were available to reinvest at appropriate prices. In other words, prices weren't distorted by a lack of funds in the hands of informed investors. Under this view, central bank lending against the assets at above-market terms would risk undermining the private market's risk assessments.\n\nThis highlights the dilemma that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, namely, the difficulty of discerning in a meaningful way whether assets are trading below their \"fundamental\" values. The usual presumption in normal times is that an asset's market price is the best available estimate of its fundamental value, a presumption that flows from a robust understanding about the functioning of market mechanisms. In contrast, the notion of assets trading below fundamental values is based on alternative models in which some impediments distort traded asset prices. Whether central bank lending would relax those constraints appears to depend delicately on the particular model in hand.\n\nThis illustrates a fundamental question, motivated by the insights of mechanism design, which is useful to keep in mind when contemplating central bank credit policy: In what way would central bank lending improve the set of attainable resource allocations in financial markets? For example, is the central bank any better than private market participants at distinguishing between good and bad assets? Is the central bank better able to discern the fundamental value of an asset?\nIt is possible that a central bank with a substantial supervisory role could have an informational advantage over market participants, but in many cases any such advantage is likely to be small, I think. The task of differentiating among mortgage-backed securities for example, would seem to require looking closely at the characteristics of the underlying mortgages. That's a costly process, and I'm not sure it would be any less costly for the Fed than for a private counterparty.\n\nThis discussion points back to my foray into mechanism design theory. Understanding the role of the central bank in credit market mechanisms starts with an understanding of just what it is that a central bank can do that other participants cannot. The central bank can increase the amount of reserves held by the banking system or by particular banks. One of the ways it can do this is by extending credit at terms at which private counterparties will not. Ultimately, the evaluation of a Fed action depends on why it is that lending from private counterparties was only available at less attractive terms. Was it a shortage of liquidity, or was it a change in fundamental valuations? This is a hard judgment to make in the crush of events and answers may only become apparent long after the fact. But this ambiguity is what makes the prudent, traditional prescription for central bank lending — lend freely at a penalty rate, on good collateral, to sound institutions — an attractive dictum. By standing ready to lend, and fixing a rate above the normal market rate, the central bank can limit the impact of market disruptions while also limiting its own need to make credit judgments. In effect, the central bank offers a line of credit to banking institutions. Just as the private provider of a line of credit imposes conditions and constraints on its customers, so should the central bank seek to provide such a credit facility in a way that avoids interference with private market risk assessments.12\n\n\n\nAs I said, it may be some time before we have a full understanding of this summer's events. But my reading of the evidence is that the episode was less about liquidity than it was simply about a dramatic change in the valuation of a class of credit exposures. Even with the Fed's reduction in the spread between its federal funds target and its primary credit discount window rates, and its encouragement to banks to come to the window, the amount of borrowing did not rise very much. So I think there's a good chance that, when all is said and done, we will be able to say that the Fed did the right thing. We stood ready to lend — on good collateral at a penalty rate — but did not interfere with the market's assessment of risks."

        "content": "I am pleased to be with you here today to discuss my views on the economic outlook. 1\n\n When this date was arranged many months ago, I was looking forward to delivering my remarks during the sleepy dog days of summer. Instead, we meet during fairly tumultuous times in financial markets. Over the last several weeks, we have seen substantial revisions in market participants' assessments of the fundamental value of securities related to sub-prime and other non-standard mortgages, financial distress related to mortgage finance at several entities, considerable widening of credit spreads, and significantly larger swings in asset prices. This turbulence makes assessing the economic outlook more challenging than usual, and of course makes central bank policymaking especially challenging.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of this recent turbulence, the predominant concern for macroeconomic policy revolves around the potential effects on real spending by consumers and businesses. It is quite possible for financial market developments like we have seen over the last few weeks to have just minimal effects on real activity. On the other hand, there are several channels by which such episodes could cause a weakening of spending. Indeed, the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement last Friday morning noted that \"the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.\" With the situation still unfolding, a fair amount of uncertainty remains, however, and I will be scrutinizing the incoming data very closely for clues about the evolution of the outlook for inflation and growth.\n\nMy remarks today will focus on how recent developments affect the outlook for inflation and growth. I will begin by reviewing the events that have roiled financial markets in recent weeks, and then discuss the economic outlook as it appears right now, beginning with inflation and then turning to the prospects for growth in aggregate spending by households and firms. Along the way, I will comment on the potential implications, and I should emphasize potential, of recent financial market turbulence for the outlook. As always, these remarks are my own personal views, and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\n\nFinancial markets\n\nJust as housing plays a leading role in the outlook for the real economy, housing finance has played a leading role in current market turbulence, so it's worth briefly reviewing the recent evolution of housing-related credit markets. The expansion of home mortgage credit in the last several years to borrowers with riskier credit profiles – either because of their credit histories or because of the types of non-traditional mortgage contracts with which they financed their home purchases – was part of a longer and broader wave of retail financial innovation.2\n\n At the heart of this wave was the application of information technology to the gathering and analysis of data on borrowers' financial histories. This allowed more differentiated assessments of risk at the level of the individual borrower. Ultimately, this made possible the tailoring of products to borrowers with different risk characteristics and broadened access to credit for many riskier borrowers who otherwise would have been unable to borrow. These developments appeared first in the market for unsecured consumer credit and then spread to housing finance, especially in the last decade.\n\n\n\nThe improved assessment of credit, along with other advances in information technology, also facilitated the broad development of markets in which individual loans are pooled and securitized, which allowed these pooled exposures to be priced in active capital markets. The role of the capital markets in securitized lending to households can be thought of as complementary to the role of the institutions that originate the loans. Since securities pool the risks of individual borrowers, the realized return on such pools will be dominated by aggregate risk factors – that is, factors affecting broad segments of borrowers. Investors in such securities will require compensation for the relevant aggregate risk factors affecting the average return on the pooled loans, but not for the idiosyncratic risk associated with any particular loan. Capital markets accumulate the perspectives of many investors and produce a collective assessment of these aggregate risks that is then reflected in the interest rate and terms that the originating institution offers to borrowers.\n\nNote that market assessments of securitized portfolios also embody assessments of the effectiveness of the originating institution at managing the risks inherent in the underwriting process. For example, anecdotal reports suggest that mortgage companies that originated and sold so-called \"no-doc\" or \"low-doc\" loans may have been especially vulnerable to falsification by their brokers. While the extent of such fraud is not known, such vulnerabilities are a form of aggregate portfolio risk to the extent that they are capable of influencing the relative returns of different mortgage pools, and capital market pricing embodies an implicit view on the magnitude of such risks.\nAs housing markets slowed beginning in early 2006, delinquencies and defaults on subprime and some nontraditional mortgages rose more rapidly than had been expected by investors in the related securities, particularly on the most recent origination vintages. The concentration of rising delinquency rates among subprime adjustable-rate mortgages suggests that borrowers who just met qualification criteria were most likely to experience repayment problems. And the coincidence of rising delinquencies with the end of housing price appreciation, along with the fact that auto and credit card delinquencies have not risen nearly as much, suggests that minimal housing equity has been a significant influence on the propensity of borrowers to miss payments. The fact that newer loans are performing markedly worse than more seasoned credits also supports this view.\n\nThe realization of greater-than-anticipated losses lies at the center of much of the recent financial market volatility. While we normally think of capital markets as effective at assessing and pricing risks, there is a general impression that markets got it wrong in the case of sub-prime and other nontraditional mortgage finance. It might seem obvious that market participants were – perhaps naively – too optimistic about mortgage credit quality during the housing expansion. But thinking of the expansion as driven by financial innovation provides a useful perspective as well, I believe. Any innovation brings with it considerable uncertainty about how big of a change from past behavior it will bring about. In particular, much of what was new in mortgage lending had not been through the test of a significant slow-down in home sales and home prices. Assessments of how such mortgage portfolios would perform in such scenarios relied less on data from similar episodes and more on extrapolation and inference from normal times, and thus were inherently more uncertain. All product or service innovations rely to a similar extent on extrapolation. In this regard, misjudgment about the prospects for losses in this new wave of innovative mortgage financing is similar to misjudgments made in the late 1990s about the rate at which demand for telecommunications bandwidth was going to grow.\n\nThe housing downturn has revealed information that now is feeding the process of reassessing and repricing risk. Market participants as diverse as mutual funds, hedge funds, banks and broker-dealers have struggled to re-evaluate the risks associated with various segments of the mortgage market. As those risks have been reassessed, the prices of mortgage-backed securities have adjusted accordingly. In some cases, the prices buyers are willing to pay are below the prices at which originators are willing to sell, and quantities traded have sunk to near zero.\n\nThis reassessment has gone somewhat beyond subprime mortgages and nontraditional mortgages. More broadly, securities related to a range of so-called non-agency mortgages, even to borrowers with high credit scores, have seen a widening of spreads. Some institutions whose profitability depends heavily on securitizing the mortgages they originate have seen their credit spreads widen significantly as well, especially compared to institutions that are better positioned to absorb new originations on their own balance sheets. Market participants also appear to be re-evaluating the mortgage-related exposures of a range of intermediaries. And credit spreads have widened as well for many corporate borrowers below the highest credit ratings.\n\nThese market adjustments place many participants in difficult positions. Some have experienced significant losses or have gone bankrupt. Entities that issue commercial paper or other instruments to fund their ongoing flow of originated mortgages are finding it difficult to continue that funding at rates they find satisfactory. In some cases, they are diverting their pipeline to their own balance sheet; in other cases, issuers are drawing on backup lines of credit. More generally, sizable shifts in market valuations are leading other participants to seek to adjust their portfolios substantially, adding to market volatility in a range of assets. The breadth of risk assessments has enhanced the relative attractiveness of, and driven down the yield on, highly liquid instruments such as U.S. Treasury securities, particularly at short tenors. The market for asset-backed commercial paper has been particularly stressed by these developments.\n\nIn the days leading up to the FOMC meeting on Aug. 7, many observers, citing the turbulent market conditions, called on and expected the Fed to lower its target interest rate. As you know, the Committee did not do that, but instead held the federal funds rate at five-and-a-quarter percent. In its statement, the Committee recognized that recent financial volatility had raised the risks to real activity, but emphasized that the fundamentals for broader household and business spending continue to look fairly sound. The Committee also emphasized in that statement that risks to inflation remained a predominant concern.\nEven without a change in the interest rate target, the Fed has tools at its disposal that can help the market make necessary adjustments in times like these. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, acting on behalf of the System, uses open market operations to keep the overnight federal funds rate at or close to the FOMC's target rate. This has had the effect of automatically expanding the supply of reserves to the banking system as the demand for liquidity has risen during this market turbulence. The week before last, the desired levels of reserve holdings rose at many banks, which tended to put upward pressure on the price of overnight loans of reserves in the federal funds market. The New York Fed offset this increase in the demand for reserves by adding a significant amount of funds on Friday, Aug. 3, through its open market operations, so as to keep the funds rate near the five-and-a-quarter percent target. Since then, reserve demand has been especially variable, and thus the effective federal funds rate has been correspondingly more variable from day to day around the Committee's target.\n\nLast week, financial market volatility intensified as news emerged regarding important market participants and commentary suggested heightened anxiety about the evolution of financial conditions in certain markets. On Thursday evening, Aug. 16, the Federal Open Market Committee convened by video conference and adopted a revised statement regarding the economic outlook. In a separate action, the Board of Governors accepted the requests of two Reserve Banks for a reduction in the discount rate from 6 ¼ to 5 ¾ percent. The 10 other Reserve Banks requested similar discount rate reductions the following day, which the Board accepted. This decision was noteworthy because, since 2002, the Reserve Banks have set their discount rates as a penalty rate, 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate. Lowering the spread over the funds rate target reduces the premium banks pay to obtain credit at the discount window. The Board's statement also announced a change in the Reserve Banks' usual practices to allow the provision of term financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower. The Board noted that these changes, which are temporary, are designed \"to provide depositories with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding\" and \"(t)o promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets.\" The Board's announcement also stated that \"(e)xisting collateral margins will be maintained,\" so lending will be on good collateral with prudent haircuts, consistent with classic lender of last resort doctrine.3\n\n Sound discount window policy, I believe, should aim at supplying adequate liquidity without undermining the market's assessment of risk. Conservative collateral requirements and charging a penalty rate are important prerequisites for that policy objective.\n\n\n\nThe Real Economy\n\n\n\nThe Committee's action last week underscores an important point. Financial market volatility, in and of itself, does not require a change in the target federal funds rate, in my view. Interest rate policy needs to be guided by the outlook for real spending and inflation. Financial turbulence has the potential to change the assessment of the appropriate rate if it induces a sufficient revision in growth or inflation prospects.\n\nEven before the recent stint of financial market turbulence, the predominant concern on the real side of the economy was the outlook for housing activity. Residential investment fell rapidly over the last three quarters of 2006, but then the rate of decline slowed in the first half of this year. The question in my mind a couple of months ago concerned whether home-building would bottom out soon or continue declining. Recent data on actual housing market activity have dampened my optimism, however. Housing starts and residential building permits, which earlier this year looked as if they might be stabilizing, have both softened in the last couple of months. Broader measures of sales activity are also showing a pronounced downward trend.\n\nWhile the housing market implications of the recent financial market turmoil are quite unclear at this stage, there is a possibility that it will result in further increases in retail mortgage rates for some borrower classes and thus further dampen residential investment. Mortgage rate spreads have risen substantially for subprime borrowers, as one would expect given what has transpired, and for any borrowers with low down payments and low documentation. In the last few weeks, rates have moved up for jumbo mortgages as well. It is not yet clear, however, to what extent some of these increases will persist or to what extent they represent transitory responses to temporarily heightened uncertainty.\n\nBusiness investment spending has been an impressive source of strength over much of this expansion. Real spending on equipment and software increased at a healthy 6.2 percent annual rate from the first quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2006. Spending on structures picked up at the end of 2005, increasing at a 13 percent rate since then. Business investment faltered late last year, with weaker sales of autos and construction materials apparently playing important roles. Most of the fundamentals for business investment are still quite positive, however; profitability is high and the cost of capital is still fairly low, despite recent financial market developments. Thus investment could well maintain momentum this year, I believe, and we have been seeing some favorable signs. For example, manufacturing production increased by 2.2 percent from March through July.\n\nIt is worth noting here that there is one area in which financial market events could affect business investment spending. One of the market segments in which activity has slowed dramatically in recent weeks is in the financing of leveraged buy-outs used to take companies private. Here, as in the mortgage-backed segment, we have seen rising credit spreads, especially for instruments below investment grade, and significantly reduced issuance. These transactions seem to have been motivated more by restructuring liabilities and governance arrangements and less by a need to fund near-term capital spending. Given the other strong fundamentals for business spending, it is not clear that the rising cost of buy-out financing should have significant effects on real investment.\n\nSome observers have questioned the outlook for consumer spending, often citing statistics that lead them to believe that consumer debt is too high or consumer saving is too low. I won't argue with the data – by the usual measures, saving is quite low, with the widely cited personal saving rate clocking in at a meager 0.6 percent for the second quarter. But keep in mind that the personal saving rate has been on a downward trend from about 10 percent in the early 1980s. A number of forces could potentially be at play here, including, for example, the significant credit market innovations that have taken place over that period.4\n I understand how historical averages can exert a gravitational pull on the forecasts of variables like the saving rate, and I don't believe the downward trend in the saving rate is likely to persist indefinitely. But having said that, it's not obvious to me why we should expect that long-term trend to reverse itself anytime soon.\n\n\n\nAn alternative perspective on savings and consumption is that the recent growth in household spending indicates confidence in future income prospects, rather than any fundamental recklessness. The labor market is reasonably tight, with the unemployment rate at 4.6 percent. Earnings are growing at about a 4 percent rate. The working age population is growing at a 0.9 percent annual rate, and payroll employment has grown significantly more rapidly, at a 1.6 percent rate for the last few years. While employment growth won't be above average forever, prospects for real income growth look pretty good. Moreover, household net worth was a relatively high 5 2/3 years of disposable personal income as of the first quarter, and has been rising during this recovery, which suggests that savings, properly measured, might not be so low after all. As always, real wage growth will tend to track gains in labor productivity, and while productivity growth was fairly strong for the first several years of this decade, the recent slowdown is a negative risk for consumer spending.\n\nFinancial market turmoil has the potential to make households apprehensive and thereby cause a precautionary pullback in consumer spending. We have numerous experiences in the past several decades, however, of declines in household financial net worth, and experience suggests that the effect on household spending tends to be small. Evidently, consumer expectations regarding their future income prospects is a stabilizing influence on their spending plans.\n\nAn alternative channel through which recent financial market developments might conceivably affect consumer spending is through an increase in interest rate spreads. So far, however, consumer interest rates have risen appreciably only in selected segments of the mortgage market, and other rates have held steady. As a result, I believe the likelihood of the recent turbulence inducing a slowdown in consumer spending is relatively small at this point.\n\nOn balance, then, I still expect consumer spending to be reasonably healthy, and for business investment to continue to expand. But I expect overall growth to come in somewhat below its long-term trend for the remainder of this year, based on my expectation that the drag from housing will continue for some time. The most plausible downside risk is that financial market developments will lead to higher mortgage rate spreads and will further depress housing activity. Other finance-related risks to economic growth appear to be relatively minor.\n\nThe Inflation Outlook\n\nAs recently as its Aug. 7 meeting, the FOMC identified its \"predominant policy risk\" as \"the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.\" I believe that this risk remains relevant, although some recent reports have been encouraging. Since February, 12-month core inflation has eased down, falling below 2 percent in June. While the most recent months' figures have been encouraging, it is still too soon to be confident that the moderation we have been seeing represents a downward trend. A similar moderation that occurred in the last months of 2006 was followed by a subsequent uptick.\n\nThe FOMC often talks about inflation in terms of core measures – leaving out the prices of energy and food products. This focus has the potential for causing some confusion. If we are seeking to stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar, and I believe we are, why leave out purchases on which people spend significant sums? Before addressing this question, let me first note that the story of what has happened to inflation recently is broadly similar if we look at overall inflation. Inflation rose from 2004 to 2005, reaching a peak of 3.9 percent, year-over-year, in September of 2005 as energy prices spiked. Since then, year-over-year overall inflation has fluctuated more widely than core but has generally trended down from its peak. In recent months, overall inflation has been slightly above core inflation, with June coming in at 2.3 percent, year over year, down from 3.5 percent a year earlier.\n\nMonetary policy requires looking forward at where inflation is headed. So while measures of overall inflation gauge well where inflation has been, the question is how best to determine the likely trend in inflation – that is, what is the most likely behavior of inflation in the very near future?\n\nThere are many ways – many statistical tools – to try to extract a trend from data on inflation. One simple approach is to use the standard measure of core inflation. The justification for this approach is based on the historical behavior of food and energy prices. These two components of overall price indexes have typically proven to be very volatile. They move around a lot due to movements in temporary factors affecting supply and demand in the markets for food and energy products. More precisely, current movements in food and energy prices do not appear to alter the expected future rate of increase in these prices. If this supposition is correct, then the trend in core inflation might be the best forecast of trends in overall inflation. In this case, stabilizing the trend in core inflation and stabilizing overall inflation amount to the same thing, since swings in non-core inflation will not affect the outlook for the overall inflation trend.\n\nThe bottom line is that monetary policymakers most definitely care about overall inflation, but they tend to talk about core inflation measures because they are viewed as more informative about future trends in overall indexes. And by either measure, the most recent news on inflation trends has been favorable.\n\nHaving said that, I believe there are still reasons to remain concerned about the risks to the inflation outlook. First, there are indications that the recent improvement may have been transitory, and that we may see inflation remain at this level, or perhaps even move up again. Second, the public's expectations of future inflation – an important determinant of inflation trends – appear to be inconsistent with further reductions in inflation. Survey measures of inflation expectations – such as the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of professional Forecasters or the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Survey – have recently been indicating long-term expectations ranging from 2.4 percent at a 10-year horizon (SPF) to 3.1 percent at the 5- to 10-year horizon. Similarly, measures of expectations of inflation 5 to 10 years forward, derived from the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), have remained near or above 2.5 percent. All of these expectations measures are for the CPI. Taken together, they imply long-run expectations for PCE inflation perhaps slightly above 2 percent, which is greater than the most recent year-over-year readings we've received.\n\nAlthough these long-run expectations suggest trend inflation is above where I would like it to be, it is encouraging that they do not appear to be rising in response to recent financial market developments. Market participants have marked down their expected path for the federal funds rate, and a coincident rise in inflation expectations would have raised significant policy concerns. I believe central banks should be careful to conduct policy during periods of financial market distress in ways that are consistent with their long-run goals, both for price stability and economic growth.\n\nTo summarize, a great deal of uncertainty remains about if and how recent developments will alter the outlook for the real economy and inflation. As events continue to unfold, I will be watching for signs that changes in the cost of credit might be having broader effects on spending than we have seen or seem likely so far. I will also continue to monitor the indicators of inflation and inflation expectations. Going forward, I think there are two key principles that should inform policy. First, the provision of liquidity to financial markets should seek to not interfere with the market's assessment and pricing of risk. And second, federal funds rate adjustments in response to changes in the outlook for inflation and growth should continue to endeavor to stabilize inflation expectations. Conduct of policy guided by these principles can minimize the real effects of financial market volatility."

        "content": "Early childhood development may seem like an odd topic for a Federal Reserve Bank president.1\n The public policy responsibility for which the Fed is best known is the nation’s monetary policy – a macroeconomic subject that would seem to stand in sharp contrast to the more microeconomic focus of Governor Kaine’s summit today. But as a regional Reserve Bank in a federated central banking system like the Fed, we spend a good deal of time trying to understand the economies that make up our District, which, as you may know, includes Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas. We supplement formal data on the national economy with information we gather from numerous sources – both formal and informal – about economic conditions in our region. This process gives us an opportunity to observe and learn about the economic trends and challenges facing the people of our District. It also allows us to observe the range of public policies and private initiatives undertaken across the District aimed at promoting local and regional economic growth.\n\n\n\nOur interest in growth derives directly from our mandate, which includes both maximizing employment and ensuring price stability. Although it is now widely known that the best contribution monetary policy can make to growth is to keep inflation low and stable,2\n understanding the wellsprings of growth is essential to our work. More broadly, to an economist, comparative economic growth makes an irresistible topic. The magnitude of the differences in economic well-being across cities, states and nations – differences that stem directly from decades of historical differences in growth rates – can be staggering. Indeed, one prominent economist has written that once one starts to think about these differences, “it is hard to think about anything else.”3\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicymakers at the national, state and local levels generally look for ways to enhance economic growth in their jurisdictions. In keeping with our status as a nonpartisan institution, Federal Reserve officials tend to avoid commenting on controversial policy proposals, especially when such policies benefit some but disadvantage others. On such issues, I prefer to restrict myself to pointing out what economists know about a policy’s costs and benefits that may have been overlooked in the public debate. On many issues, the economics of the question are not decisive, though economics does tend to spotlight the often-overlooked costs associated with many otherwise seemingly attractive ideas.\n\nOn some questions, however, economic research sends a fairly clear message. I believe that early childhood development is such an issue. I will elaborate in my remarks here this morning on why I believe this to be the case, but simply stated, my position is that if government is going to invest in education at all, it should invest in enhancing early childhood development. For me, this is an economic growth issue. The continual enhancement of skills over time is essential to sustained growth in economic well-being, and research indicates that early childhood development is critical to the life-long development of skills. I need to mention at the outset, however, that although my views on early childhood development owe much to what I have learned from my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System, my remarks represent my own personal views.\n\nI come to this conclusion from an understanding of the economics of growth. A moment ago, I mentioned the disparities in economic well-being across regions. At any point in time, some nations, states and cities are wealthier, per capita, than others, and over time, some grow faster than others. Efforts by economists to account for these differences in growth point pretty convincingly in one direction – human capital, that is, the skills, abilities and knowledge people possess.\n\nNow it probably sounds like simple common sense to say that a person’s economic well-being is related to the economic value of their skills. And while skills are difficult to measure precisely, the measures we do have – on levels of education and work experience, for instance – show that people with these characteristics tend to have significantly higher incomes. I’ll have more to say later on about the relationship between skills and income at the level of the individual worker or household. But first, I want to talk about the role of human capital in the broader phenomenon of economic growth, particularly at the level of regions within the United States.\n\nData on the growth of income per person across the United States and across cities and metropolitan areas reveals that at least one important measure of skills is consistently correlated with future growth. That measure is education, and a typical finding is that the share of the population of a U.S. city or state that had a college degree in 1990 is positively associated with growth in family income between 1990 and 2000.4\n In other words, the more highly educated the population, the greater the subsequent growth in economic well-being. Furthermore, population growth in U.S. cities and metropolitan areas is correlated with education levels, suggesting that places with highly skilled populations create opportunities that attract newcomers. Similar results have been found in research that covers different time periods and different geographical designations (for example, cross-country analyses).\n\n\n\nThe link between an area’s level of educational attainment at a point in time and its subsequent growth suggests that the relationship could be causal – that having a greater skills base enables an area to grow faster. Causality is sometimes hard to establish, and a great deal of research has been aimed at this question. While such research often is not as conclusive as one would hope, I think it is fair for us to take as a lesson from the scientific literature that human capital is an important determinant of a region’s economic growth.\n\nNote that it is not obvious that the average level of human capital in a region should be related to future economic growth. One would expect higher average skill levels to be associated with higher current income, but one might expect regions to grow thereafter at the same rate, independent of their starting point.5\n What is striking about the empirical evidence is that higher current skill levels predict faster future growth, all else equal. One possible interpretation of this fact is that skills, in addition to boosting current income, enhance an area’s ability to further build its skill base – “human capital begets more human capital,” you might say.  Economists have identified two distinct ways this might come about. One is the straightforward notion that certain general skills make people better at learning new skills. Another involves what economists call “externalities” or “increasing returns,” meaning that a skilled worker is more productive in a marketplace or work environment with other skilled workers. The basic idea is simple, though: there is a bonus when you invest in human capital – you get greater productivity in producing goods and in producing more human capital.\n\n\n\nThe idea that human capital promotes growth is, perhaps, not too surprising. After all, and as I mentioned earlier, it’s quite natural to think of differences in skills as explaining a substantial part of the differences in income between individual people – why shouldn’t this logic extend to communities, cities, states, and so on? At the level of individual workers, in fact, there is abundant evidence that the importance of skill to one’s economic well-being has grown over the last several decades. This is seen in a growing gap between the average wages earned by high school graduates and those with college or advanced degrees.\n\nThe growth in this pay differential, or “skill premium,” is a major factor behind the increase in income inequality that has received so much attention of late. The apparent reasons for this widening dispersion are germane here. Wages paid to workers at any particular skill level generally reflect how productive those workers are – how much economic value their work creates. If the wages of higher-skilled workers have grown more rapidly than the wages of the less-skilled, then it must be the case that the work environment has changed in a way that has made the productivity of higher-skilled workers rise more rapidly.\n\nOne change that has had a tremendous effect on the way people work in recent decades is the application of information technology. And this change appears to have had differing effects on the productivities and wages of workers at different skill levels. It’s become commonplace to talk about jobs that have been replaced by automation. These tend to be relatively low-skilled jobs – involving tasks that you can program a machine to perform, for example. On the other hand, jobs that require judgment and adaptability to changing conditions do not lend themselves as easily to automation. In fact, the application of information technology is likely to enhance the effectiveness of people in such jobs by relieving them of routine aspects of their jobs.\n\nSo technological change has enhanced the productivity of high-skilled workers relative to low-skilled workers – economists call this “skill-biased technological change.” It can be thought of as a shift in demand from low- to high-skilled workers. The resulting increase in the wage premium associated with higher levels of workplace skills provides an incentive for workers to acquire more education and skills. And college enrollments have been trending up, which would tend to increase the relative supply of skilled workers and dampen the increase in the skill premium. The fact that the skill premium has continued to rise essentially means that the (relative) supply of higher skilled workers has not kept pace with demand.\n\nIt is worth noting that the skills that have become most valuable over time seem to be the general types of skills that come with higher levels of education – as opposed to the very specific skills that one can gain through experience in a particular job or occupation. This is an important distinction. It means that moreso than ever before, the path to economic success lies in education rather than in on-the-job work experience. And if these sorts of general skills are the key to success, it follows that a lack of skills presents a formidable barrier to success – for an individual, a community, a state or a nation.\n\nBuilding a skilled workforce requires investments at several levels, and one important public policy question involves getting the right mix of public and private responsibilities for those investments. After all, the evidence that education pays off in the form of higher lifetime wages means that people should have a strong private incentive to invest in their own skills.\n\nBut there are good reasons why relying on individuals to finance their own investments in human capital might not be sufficient. One is that, as I alluded to earlier, an individual’s education benefits society at large, beyond the individual’s increased earning power. Economists call this type of broader benefit an “externality,” and the traditional case for public funding of education at various levels rests in part on such effects.\n\nUp to now, I’ve been talking about the role of human capital and investment in skills in the process of economic growth. Let me summarize the general points. Skills are a key determinant of individual economic well-being and broader economic growth. Recent trends in technology have amplified the importance of skills, especially the general skills that come from education through the post-secondary level. And there are good reasons for people’s own financing of human capital investments to be supplemented by public support.\n\nWhat does this have to do with early childhood? I mentioned earlier that acquiring skills improves one’s ability to subsequently acquire further skills. Could this logic extend back to the earliest investments in human capital – those that occur between birth and age 5? I believe the evidence indicates that the answer is “yes.”\n\nSpecifically, there is substantial evidence that differences in early childhood treatment have long-lasting effects in school performance as well as in a variety of other indicators of social success.6\n Some of these findings come from studies of experimental or pilot programs in which children receiving different early educational experiences were tracked over a long time. Two of the most famous of these studies are Michigan’s Perry Preschool Project and North Carolina’s Abecedarian Program. The Perry Preschool Project began with a sample of children from low-income families in the 1960s and has followed their experiences well into adulthood. The study featured random assignment – half of the sample population was placed in a high-quality preschool program and half was not. Random assignment greatly enhances our confidence in the validity of the findings, because it minimizes the extent to which different outcomes may be due to extraneous differences in sample groups. The Abecedarian Program, begun in the 1970s, also featured random assignment and the assessment of outcomes over a long period – through age 21.\n\n\n\nIn both of these studies, program participants were found to show greater success along a number of dimensions. They generally completed more years of schooling, showed better scores on standardized tests, and were less likely to need special education services. In addition, participants had lower rates of involvement in crime and out-of-wedlock births, and higher rates of employment and home ownership – this last indicator being specific to the Perry Preschool Project, which followed participants to age 40. In very broad terms, then, the average participant had a demonstrably better life than the typical member of the control group. Such striking results appear to give convincing evidence that well-targeted, high-quality early childhood services can yield benefits well in excess of their costs.\n\nIn addition to these and other relatively small studies, a number of somewhat larger studies suggest that the benefits from quality early childhood education can be realized on a larger scale and that the results of studies like Abecedarian and Perry were not merely due to the specific communities in which they were conducted. For example, a study in Chicago examined the educational and social experiences of nearly a thousand Chicago youths from poor households across the city, some of whom had and some of whom had not participated in the Chicago Child Parent Centers Program when they were very young. As with the other studies, those having received the early childhood treatment showed better educational attainment and lower incidence of delinquency and other social problems.\n\nThe association in these studies between enhanced early childhood environments and improved life outcomes appears to be consistent with the emerging understanding of the dependence of a child’s early brain development on their exposure to intellectual stimulation, but that topic is a good deal beyond my area of expertise.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are aspects of early childhood development programs that deserve further research. The most convincing results come from small programs targeted at particular at-risk populations. One would expect the benefits of such programs to be greatest for these populations. Returns might be less dramatic for more universal programs, since presumably they would include more children who are likely to succeed without a program. Details of program implementation deserve further scrutiny as well. In particular, the skills and training of the staff seem to be important to a program’s success, which suggests paying close attention to the design of appropriate qualifications and standards for early childhood education professionals. All this implies that broader investments in early childhood education should allow for experimentation with alternative programmatic models, and should be accompanied by continuing research that tracks the experiences of participating children over time.\nEconomists like to think about investment in terms of rate of return, and there is reason to think that the rate of return on early childhood investment could be particularly high. In fact, Art Rolnick and Rob Grunewald of the Minneapolis Fed have used the results of the Perry Preschool Project to estimate that the average annual inflation-adjusted rate of return on investments in early childhood education, targeted to at-risk populations, is in the neighborhood of 16 percent.7\n This compares very favorably with real rates of return implied by financial markets of around 3 percent, for instance, on long term Treasury securities. Like any investment in human capital, some of the return accrues directly to the individual in the form of increased life-time earning ability. But a substantial share of the return – perhaps as much as three-quarters of the total – is a broader, social benefit, coming from such sources as reduced costs of remediation and other special services in primary and secondary school, as well as from the reduced incidence of the array of social problems often associated with low educational achievement.\n\n\n\nThere are many explanations for the apparent high economic returns to early childhood education, but let me briefly highlight one. A key difference between early childhood investments and investments at primary and secondary education levels is the potential for compounding that I mentioned earlier. That is, enhancing early childhood development appears to improve a child’s ability to learn at later stages. This means that the return on early education comes not just from the direct effects, say on the development of cognitive ability, but also from the fact that these early investments increase the productivity of later educational investments. This is a point the Nobel prize-winning economist James Heckman has emphasized in his writing on early childhood education.8\n\n\n\nThis compounding effect means that disparities in early childhood development have the potential to exacerbate inequality within our society. People with limited means are more likely to have difficulty providing their children with a high-quality early childhood environment, leaving those children less able to benefit from later investments in human capital. This possibility creates, I believe, a legitimate public interest in helping people of modest means find and afford quality early childhood education. It holds the promise of expanding the development of human capital more broadly across our society and in so doing, widening our potential for skill-based economic growth.\n\nSo I tend to think of the benefits of early childhood education as providing children in less-advantaged families and less-developed communities with better preparation for acquiring the education and skills that expand economic opportunity. For decades, substantial efforts have been made to improve economic outcomes for disadvantaged populations by enhancing access to formal educational institutions. The widening of the skill premium in recent decades demonstrates that those efforts have had only limited success, and widespread evidence indicates that variations in per-pupil spending have only limited effects. Parental inputs into a child’s education, on the other hand, explain a substantial portion of the variation in educational preparedness and outcomes.9\n The promise of early childhood education is that it can begin to address disparities in educational outcomes, and thus economic outcomes, at a more fundamental level.\n\n\n\nHaving said all that, I should note that the problems facing disadvantaged communities –problems that limit the realization of human capital potential – are multifaceted, and no one policy initiative offers a panacea. This is not the place to survey the broader array of challenges in such communities. I do believe, however, that the new attention to early childhood development presents a unique opportunity in the area of public policy aimed at economic development. By broadening the development of human capital, early childhood education can add to our capacity for growth while also creating opportunities for the benefits of that growth to be shared more broadly."

        "content": "I am very pleased to be with you today to discuss my views on the economic outlook, with particular emphasis on the outlook for inflation.1\n In its most recent statements, the Federal Open Market Committee has identified \"the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected\" as its \"predominant policy concern.\" This places current inflation and the inflation outlook squarely at center stage in thinking about the economy and monetary policy. So in my remarks today, I will take a closer look at inflation's recent behavior and the prospects for its future behavior. In doing so, I'll discuss the interplay between real activity and inflation expectations. As always, these remarks should be taken as my own personal views, and not necessarily those of any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\nRecent Inflation\n\nTo put the current situation in context, recall that under Chairman Paul Volcker the FOMC brought inflation down to below 4 percent in the mid-1980s. (Throughout my remarks today, unless otherwise noted, I will be referring to inflation measured by the 12-month growth rate in the price index for core personal consumption expenditures.) Under Chairman Alan Greenspan, core inflation fluctuated between 3½ percent and 5 percent until 1992, but fell to near 2 percent in 1994, and below 2 percent in March 1996. Inflation then remained between 1 percent and 2 percent more or less continuously until April 2004. The exception was several months during the second half of 2001 as the economy slipped into a recession.2\n For those years, core PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent, and was between 1 percent and 2 percent for more than 90 percent of the time.\n\n\n\nIn early 2003 inflation fell, and for some months inflation was reported to be below 1 percent at an annual rate.3\n This led to concern about the possibility of excessive disinflation, and in response the FOMC statement at the May meeting cited the risk of \"an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.\" At the June 2003 meeting, the FOMC reduced the target federal funds rate to 1 percent. While the Committee had not then, and has not since, established an explicit numerical target range for inflation, the May 2003 statement was taken to many observers as establishing an implicit lower bound on the range of inflation rates the Committee would find acceptable.4\n\n\n\n\n\nCore inflation has increased since 2003. It rose to more than 2 percent in April 2004, and has fluctuated between 2 percent and 2.4 percent ever since. Monthly readings have exhibited wider swings recently, and 12-month inflation has fluctuated accordingly, falling to 2.1 percent in November but then rising 2.4 percent again for February. The most recent reading, for April, came in at 2.0.percent. But given the repeated swings we've seen, it is difficult to pick out a definite trend, and in fact, no statistically significant moderating trend has emerged yet, an issue I will say more about later in my talk. About all one can say with confidence is that year-over-year core inflation is now fluctuating around 2¼ percent.\n\nChairman Ben Bernanke, in his March 28 testimony to the Joint Economic Committee, said about core inflation that \"recent readings have been somewhat elevated and the level of core inflation remains uncomfortably high.\" In addition, I and several other FOMC participants have expressed dissatisfaction with the current level of inflation. Even though, as I noted earlier, the Committee has not established an explicit numerical objective or range for inflation, some observers have taken recent comments as indicating an upper bound on the range of desired inflation rates, analogous to the way the Committee's May 2003 statement was taken as marking a lower bound on the Committee's desired inflation rate.\n\nThe central question, then, regarding the outlook for inflation is whether core inflation will \"moderate\" to an acceptable rate in coming quarters? Some forecasters are expecting inflation to decline this year and next, and many of them link this decline to the expectation that real growth has been weak and is expected to remain below trend over the next few quarters. So let me review some important components of final demand.\n\nReal Activity\n\nHousing construction is the component of aggregate output that has understandably attracted the most attention lately. The recent weakness followed a decade-long period of sustained growth in housing activity, which was driven by favorable fundamental factors such as: improving prospects for real income growth, unusually low inflation-adjusted mortgage interest rates, increasing population, and the favorable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing. By the end of 2005, though, demand appeared to have been largely satiated in most local markets. Since then, although some markets continue to show steady growth, many markets have seen sharp reductions in construction and homes sales and a slowdown in housing price appreciation. Indeed, in some locations prices have begun to decline. The fact that housing data are typically somewhat noisier in winter months is making it difficult to gauge whether housing demand has reached bottom as yet. Even if it has, however, the need to work off an overhang of new homes inventories is likely to depress new construction spending for several months to come.\n\nOne prominent feature of the expansion of housing activity was a dramatic advance in lending to subprime borrowers, and the recent increase in delinquencies and defaults in this sector has raised concerns. This is not the time for a thorough review of the subprime mortgage market – that would be a separate speech.5\n If you're interested, Chairman Bernanke just gave an excellent one. All things considered, macroeconomic effects of recent developments in the subprime market are likely to be relatively limited, and I do not expect any significant spillovers to the rest of the economy.\n\n\n\nBusiness investment spending has been an impressive source of strength over much of this expansion. Real spending on equipment and software increased at a healthy 8.7 percent annual rate from the first quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of 2006. Spending on structures picked up at the end of 2005, increasing 14 percent in the four quarters ending in Q3. Business investment faltered late last year though, with weaker sales of autos and construction materials apparently playing important roles. Most of the fundamentals for business investment are still quite positive, however; profitability is high, the cost of capital is fairly low, and funds for new investment are readily available on favorable terms. Thus I expect investment to re-gain momentum this year. Indeed, we are already seeing some encouraging signs that this is taking place.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has been another source of strength in this economic expansion. That growth has been underpinned by solid real income growth during the recovery and favorable prospects for future income growth. Many observers hypothesized that the drag from weakening housing markets would spill over and dampen consumer spending. That hasn't happened. Last year real consumer spending rose 3.6 percent, and in the first quarter it increased at a 3.8 percent annual rate.\n\nSome observers have questioned the outlook for consumer spending, often citing statistics that lead them to believe that consumer debt is too high or consumer saving is too low. I won't argue with the data – by the usual measures saving is quite low, with the widely cited personal saving rate clocking in at negative 1 percent for the first quarter. But keep in mind that the personal saving rate has been on a downward trend from about 10 percent in the early 1980s to about minus 1 percent now. A number of forces could potentially be at play here, including, for example, the significant credit market innovations that have taken place over that period.6\n I understand how historical averages can exert a gravitational pull on the forecasts of variables like the saving rate, and I don't believe the downward trend is likely to persist indefinitely. But having said that, its not obvious to me why we should expect that long-term trend to reverse itself beginning precisely next quarter.\n\n\n\nAn alternative perspective on savings and consumption is that the strong recent growth in household spending indicates optimism about future income prospects, rather than any fundamental recklessness. And there are good reasons for households to be relatively optimistic. The labor market is reasonably tight, with the unemployment rate at 4.5.percent. Average earnings are growing at about a 4 percent rate. Employment growth has slowed a bit from the above average pace of the last several years, but still continues to be rapid enough to absorb the ongoing growth we expect in the labor force. Prospects for real income growth, then, look pretty solid. Moreover, household net worth is up to 5¾ percent years of disposable personal income, and has been rising during this recovery, which suggests that savings, properly measured, might not be so low after all. As always, real wage growth will tend to track gains in labor productivity, and while productivity growth was fairly strong for the first several years of this decade, the recent slowdown is a negative risk for consumer spending. On balance, though, I expect consumer spending to remain reasonably healthy.\n\nPutting this all together, I expect overall growth to come in below trend in the first half of this year, but to return to trend by the end of the year, based on my expectation that the housing market is likely to find a bottom some time this year and no longer be a drag on top line growth, business investment will pick up, and consumer spending will remain healthy.\n\nThe Phillips Curve\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, many commentators base their belief that inflation will moderate on their belief that output growth will be below trend for the next few quarters. This connection is based on a popular – though I will argue incomplete and potentially misleading – understanding of the relationship between inflation and real economic activity. This relationship is usually described by the \"Phillips curve,\" which typically shows an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment or the \"output gap.\"7\n One way of thinking about the Phillips curve is to see it as describing a set of options facing policymakers – as if to say, \"You can have less inflation with more unemployment or less unemployment with more inflation.\"\n\n\n\nModern monetary economics now understands the relationship between inflation and real activity differently. In the new version of the Phillips curve, current inflation is related to expected future inflation as well an indicator of current economic activity, such as unemployment or the \"output gap.\" But to state it this way – as an equation with inflation on the left hand side depending on a real variable plus inflation expectations on the right hand side – is entirely arbitrary. One could just as well write the relationship the other way and say that unemployment, for example, depends on inflation and expected inflation.\n\nIn fact, what we know is that inflation and real economic activity are the joint outcome of decentralized decisions, made by participants in the economy, regarding demand, supply, prices and wages. So it is just as correct (or rather incorrect) to say below-trend growth will drive inflation down, as it is to say that falling inflation will keep growth below trend. Because inflation ultimately depends on the actions of the central bank, those decentralized decisions will depend on past, present and expected future central bank policy choices. Thus it is central banks, not the labor market, that drive inflation down.\n\nThe behavior of inflation expectations is vitally important to a central bank that is attempting to reduce inflation. If inflation expectations are low and consistent with the reduction in inflation that the central bank wishes to bring about, it will be important to assure that they do not drift higher during the disinflation process. If inflation expectations have become elevated, a sustained reduction in inflation will require bringing inflation expectations down as well.\n\nInflation expectations embody assumptions –either explicit or implicit –about how the central bank is going to conduct monetary policy in the future. Public understanding of the central bank's long-run goals and of how the central bank would respond to various potential economic disturbances helps anchor inflation expectations.\n\nInflation Expectations\n\nIf inflation expectations are a key determinant of the inflation outlook, then what do we know about the recent behavior of inflation expectations? There are a variety of indicators and as you might expect, none of them is perfect. Survey measures have the longest track record. The Philadelphia Fed compiles and publishes the Survey of Professional Forecasters every quarter. Their most recent compilation, published just last week, reports a mean expectation for core PCE inflation of 2.1 percent through the end of 2009. You may also have heard of the Blue Chip forecasters survey. Their average forecast for core CPI inflation (not PCE inflation) is 2.4 percent in 2007, and 2.3 percent in 2008, The CPI and the PCE inflation indexes are based on slightly different methodologies, and they tend to differ by about four-tenths on average. So the Blue Chip forecast of 2.4 percent and 2.3 percent for CPI translates into 2.0 percent and 1.9 percent respectively for the core PCE, a bit lower than the Philadelphia survey. Consumer surveys, in contrast, yield much higher figures. Among respondents to the Reuters - University of Michigan survey, the median expected inflation over the next year is 3.2 percent and the median expected inflation over the next ten years is 3.1.percent. Economists typically discount data from such consumer surveys in which respondents have little or no economic incentive to forecast well. Professional forecasters presumably perceive a pecuniary benefit to having a documented record of accuracy. So I would favor the figures obtained from professional forecasters. Better yet would be readings on inflation expectations derived from traded market instruments. Fortunately, such measures can be derived from the spreads between indexed and non-indexed U.S. Treasury securities –the so-called TIPS spread. The implied expectation of CPI inflation over the next five years was around 1½ percent in early 2003, rose to near 2½ percent in 2004, and has been trading around 2.3 percent in recent weeks. Taking off four-tenths for the average PCE-CPI spread, this translates to around 1.9 percent.\n\nAnother place to look for evidence on inflation trends is the growth in labor compensation. Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector accelerated from below 4 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2006. This is consistent with the broad acceleration in average hourly earnings shown in the Employment Report, and the upswing in the Employment Cost Index. Inflation-adjusted compensation gains should (and generally do) track labor productivity gains fairly closely. This is algebraically equivalent to saying that the markup over unit labor costs should be fairly constant. If so, the growth in unit labor costs should provide a gauge of expected inflation trends, the idea being that workers and firms set current wages based on their near-term expectations for real productivity gains and inflation. Productivity growth was relatively high early in this decade, but has decelerated recently and averaged 1.6 percent last year. As a result, unit labor costs have accelerated and have averaged 2.4 percent over the last two years. The markup has been relatively steady at an elevated level over those two years, which with rising unit labor costs is consistent with the rise in inflation we've seen.\n\nIf unit labor costs continue to advance at recent rates, either inflation will keep pace with unit labor costs, or the increase in labor costs will be absorbed by firms lowering their markups. It is true that the aggregate markup implied by the productivity and unit labor cost numbers has been high by historical standards, which accords well with the recent strength in business profits, but our understanding of aggregate movements in the markup is limited. The markup has tended to revert to its mean, but it can deviate for long stretches of time. So while it is possible that the markup might fall to offset a rise in unit labor costs, if we don't know why the markup is elevated now, its hard to have much confidence in a forecast that it is going to come to our rescue just in the nick of time. If the markup remains relatively high, and unit labor costs continue to advance at or above 2 percent, then we are likely to see inflation continue at about 2 percent.\n\nCorroborating evidence on inflation expectations is provided by recent work by James Stock and Mark Watson.8\n They estimate a model of postwar US inflation that allows them to decompose inflation into \"trend\" and \"transitory\" components, each with their own time-varying volatility. The time-varying volatility feature allows for changes over time in the portion of the variability in inflation that is due to long-lasting swings in trend inflation, as we saw in the Great Inflation of the 1970s, as opposed to short-run transitory movements in inflation. They find that the variability in the trend component of inflation has fallen dramatically since the 1970s, consistent with other research that has documented a fall in the \"persistence\" of inflation since then.9\n\n\n\n\n\nStock and Watson's methodology implies that the best forecast for future inflation is the current estimated value of the trend component, which their method puts at 2.1 percent (for core PCE inflation) as of the first quarter of 2007. This measure of trend inflation has been above 2 since the fourth quarter of 2004, and peaked at 2.2 percent in the second quarter of 2006. Interestingly, their measure of trend was between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent for over eight straight years from 1996 to 2003.\n\nThe Stock and Watson framework provides a natural way to assess whether any moderation in core inflation is evident yet. Their measure of trend inflation fell by 6 basis points from the peak (2.17 percent) in the second quarter of last year to the first quarter of 2007 (2.11 percent). Given the shape of the probability distribution around their estimates, this decline does not appear to be statistically significant.\n\nInflation Outlook\n\nA variety of expectations measures then, point to expectations for core PCE inflation of about 2 percent right now. What does this imply about the outlook for actual inflation? The current level of inflation expectations is likely to exert a gravitational pull on actual inflation, provided that monetary policy actions are not inconsistent with those expectations and no concerted effort is made to shift expectations. Policy actions at variance with those expectations –for example, significant easing at a time of elevated or rising inflation –would likely call those expectations into question and lead to a change in assessments regarding future inflation. But as long as policy actions appear to be plausibly consistent with movement toward 2 percent inflation and nothing else acts to alter inflation expectations, that's likely to be the best forecast for where inflation is headed.\n\nCould inflation fall below 2 percent, say to 1½ percent? That depends. Without a prompt fall in inflation expectations, a reduction in inflation below 2 percent is likely to be temporary and hard to sustain. With expectations left alone, that is, if nothing is done to try to shift expectations, the remaining mechanism for bringing down inflation is the old-fashioned Phillips curve mechanism, that is, an increase in real interest rates that slows aggregate demand and reduces both inflation and real activity. This could be costly in terms of foregone real growth.\n\nThe prospects for bringing inflation down below 2 percent thus hinge on the extent to which a reduction in inflation expectations can be brought about. How difficult would that be? Using changes in the target interest rate alone, the process is likely to be difficult and time-consuming.\n\nOne natural approach to bringing inflation expectations down more expeditiously, should that be the desire, would be a strategy of clear communications about policymakers' intentions. Just how responsive would inflation expectations be to such communications? General conclusions are unlikely, because the results will depend on the nature of communications, the nature of the accompanying actions, and the context in which they are received. There are many historical examples of significant shifts in monetary policy expectations; examples include the fiscal reforms accompanying the ends of hyperinflations, the governance changes accompanying the adoption of explicit inflation objectives in other countries, and the operational regime shift adopted by the Volcker FOMC in 1979.\n\nThese examples involved fairly dramatic and sizable shifts in the conduct of monetary policy, however. Shifting inflation expectations from 2 percent down to 1.5 percent or 1 percent represents a far smaller change in policy, and thus ought to be less difficult. In fact, exactly the opposite transition was made 3 years ago. As I noted earlier, core inflation was between 1 and 2 percent from 1996 through early 2004, and then since early 2004 core inflation has been between 2 and 2½ percent. Inflation expectations seem to have shifted up accordingly; for example the TIPS spread was around 1½ percent in 2003. The fact that core inflation so recently spent eight years between 1 and 2 percent suggests that convincing the public that we were returning to such a period would not be that difficult, especially in light of the fact that the Committee did not, during that earlier period, announce an intention to keep core inflation within that band.\n\nIn many recent instances, FOMC actions or statements appear to have induced simultaneous short-run movements in market participants' expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate and inflation. For example, following the heavy hurricane season of 2005, and during the spring of 2006 in response to energy price increases, inflation expectations rose, but were subsequently tamped down by Committee member communications. In both cases, the movement in inflation expectations was relatively contained, but these short run spikes suggest a pliability of inflation expectations in the current environment.\n\nThe outlook for inflation, then, is to an important extent contingent on the extent to which it appears worthwhile to engineer a reduction in inflation expectations, to return them to a level more closely consistent with our price stability mandate. In any event, there is little disagreement about the central importance of inflation expectations for the conduct of monetary policy and the outlook for inflation.\n\nThank you."

(Translating the April CPI report suggests that core PCE inflation will step up to 2.2 percent.) Given these repeated swings, it is not surprising that it is difficult to pick out a definite trend, and in fact, no statistically significant moderating trend has emerged yet, an issue I will return to later in my talk. About all one can say with confidence is that core inflation is now fluctuating around 2¼ percent.\n\nChairman Ben Bernanke, in his March 28 testimony to the Joint Economic Committee, said about core inflation that \"recent readings have been somewhat elevated and the level of core inflation remains uncomfortably high.\" In addition, I and several other FOMC participants have expressed dissatisfaction with the current level of inflation. Even though, as I noted earlier, the Committee has not established an explicit numerical objective or range for inflation, some observers have taken recent comments as indicating an upper bound on the range of desired inflation rates, analogous to the way the Committee's May 2003 statement was taken as marking a lower bound.\n\nThe central question, then, regarding the outlook for inflation is whether core inflation will \"moderate\" to an acceptable rate in coming quarters. Some forecasters are expecting inflation to decline this year and next, and many of them link this decline to the expectation that real growth has been weak and is expected to remain below trend over the next few quarters. The relationship between real activity and the inflation outlook, which I will discuss in more detail later on, is important enough to warrant a look at selected components of final demand.\n\nReal Activity\n\nHousing construction is the component of aggregate output that has understandably attracted the most attention lately. The recent weakness followed a decade-long period of sustained growth in housing activity, which was driven by favorable fundamental factors, such as improving prospects for real income growth, unusually low inflation-adjusted mortgage interest rates, increasing population, and the favorable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing. By the end of 2005, though, demand appeared to have been largely satiated in most local markets. Since then, although some markets continue to show steady growth, many markets have seen sharp reductions in construction and homes sales, and a slowdown in housing price appreciation. Indeed, in some locations prices have begun to decline. The fact that housing data are typically somewhat noisier in winter months is making it difficult to gauge whether housing demand has reached bottom as yet. Even if it has, however, the need to work off an overhang of new homes inventories is likely to depress new construction spending for several months to come.\n\nOne prominent feature of the expansion of housing activity was a dramatic advance in lending to subprime borrowers, and the recent increase in delinquencies and defaults in this sector has raised concerns. This is not the time for a thorough review of the subprime mortgage market – that would be a separate speech.5\n All things considered, the macroeconomic effects of recent developments in the subprime market are likely to be relatively limited, and I do not expect any significant spillovers to the rest of the economy.\n\n\n\nBusiness investment spending has been an impressive source of strength over much of this expansion. Real spending on equipment and software increased at a healthy 8.7 percent annual rate from the first quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of 2006. Spending on structures picked up at the end of 2005, increasing 14 percent in the four quarters ending in Q3. Business investment faltered late last year though, with weaker sales of autos and construction materials apparently playing important roles. Most of the fundamentals for business investment are still quite positive, however; profitability is high, the cost of capital is fairly low, and funds for new investment are readily available on favorable terms. Thus I expect investment to gain momentum this year, and we are already seeing some favorable signs.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has been another source of strength in this economic expansion. That growth has been underpinned by solid real income growth during the recovery and favorable prospects for future income growth. Many observers hypothesized that the drag from weakening housing markets would spill over and dampen consumer spending. That hasn't happened. Last year, real consumer spending rose 3.6 percent, and in the first quarter it increased at a 3.8 percent annual rate.\n\nSome observers have questioned the outlook for consumer spending, often citing statistics that lead them to believe that consumer debt is too high or consumer saving is too low. I won't argue with the data – by the usual measures saving is quite low, with the widely cited personal saving rate clocking in at negative 1 percent for the first quarter. But keep in mind that the personal saving rate has been on a downward trend from about 10 percent in the early 1980s to about minus 1 percent now. A number of forces could potentially be at play here, including, for example, the significant credit market innovations that have taken place over that period.6\n I understand how historical averages can exert a gravitational pull on the forecasts of variables like the saving rate, and I don't believe the downward trend is likely to persist indefinitely. But having said that, it's not obvious to me why we should expect that long-term trend to reverse itself beginning precisely next quarter.\n\n\n\nAn alternative perspective on savings and consumption is that the strong recent growth in household spending indicates optimism about future income prospects, rather than any fundamental recklessness. The labor market is reasonably tight, with the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent. Earnings are growing at about a 4 percent rate. The working age population is growing at a 0.9 percent annual rate, and payroll employment has grown significantly more rapidly, at a 1.6 percent rate for the last few years. While employment growth won't be above average forever, prospects for real income growth look pretty solid. Moreover, household net worth is up to 5¾ years of disposable personal income, and has been rising during this recovery, which suggests that savings, properly measured, might not be so low after all. As always, real wage growth will tend to track gains in labor productivity, and while productivity growth was fairly strong for the first several years of this decade, the recent slowdown is a negative risk for consumer spending. On balance, though, I expect consumer spending to remain reasonably healthy.\n\nPutting this all together, I expect overall growth to come in below trend in the first half of this year, but to return to trend by the end of the year, based on my expectation that the housing market is likely to find a bottom some time this year and no longer be a drag on top line growth, business investment will pick up, and consumer spending will remain healthy.\n\nThe Phillips Curve\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, many commentators base their belief that inflation will moderate on their belief that output growth will be below trend for the next few quarters. This connection is based on a popular – though I will argue incomplete and potentially misleading – understanding of the relationship between inflation and real economic activity. This relationship is usually described by the \"Phillips curve,\" which typically shows an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment or the \"output gap.\"7\n One way of thinking about the Phillips curve is to see it as describing a set of options facing policy makers – as if to say, \"You can have less inflation with more unemployment or less unemployment with more inflation.\" This characterization is very much in keeping with one of the earliest expositions of the Phillips curve as a tool for economic analysis and policy. In 1960, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow estimated a Phillips curve for U.S. data, following A.W. Phillips' earlier exercise for the United Kingdom, and indicated that this curve described the set of options available to policy makers \"in the years immediately ahead.\"\n\n\n\nThis traditional view of the Phillips curve sees the relationship between the real growth and the outlook for inflation as a structural part of the economy, that is, as invariant to alternative approaches to policymaking. Under this view, growth below trend causes a growing amount of \"slack\" in the economy, which in turn eases price pressures. And conversely, of course, price pressures build up when aggregate demand runs ahead of the economy's capacity for growth, making labor and commodity markets tight. This view sees policymakers as controlling inflation by using interest rates to engineer the appropriate amount of slack.\n\nBut this view of the Phillips curve is out of date and can be seriously misleading. As a purely empirical relationship, it broke down entirely during the 1970s, when inflation and unemployment were both simultaneously elevated. Modern monetary economics now understands the relationship between inflation and real activity as resulting from the decentralized price- and wage-setting decisions of firms and workers facing frictions that make very frequent price re-adjustments suboptimal. Firms set prices based on their expectations regarding the marginal cost of production and the rate at which overall nominal demand will change over their planning horizon. Aggregating across sellers, one finds that the current overall price level, and thus current inflation, depends on expected future inflation and real marginal cost. Under certain assumptions, real marginal cost moves one-for-one with a measure of aggregate economic activity such as the output gap or the unemployment rate.8\n\n\n\nThe result is a version of the Phillips curve in which current inflation depends on expected future inflation and an indicator of current economic activity, such as unemployment or the \"output gap.\" But to state it this way – with inflation depending on a real variable – is entirely arbitrary. One could just as well write the relationship the other way and say that unemployment, for example, depends on inflation and expected inflation. In fact, inflation and real economic activity are the joint outcome of decentralized decisions made by participants in the economy about demand, supply, prices and wages. So it is just as correct (or rather incorrect) to say below-trend growth will drive inflation down, as it is to say that falling inflation will keep growth below trend. Because inflation ultimately depends on the actions of the central bank, those decentralized decisions will depend on past, present and expected future central bank policy choices. Thus, it is central banks, not the labor market, that drive inflation down.\n\nThe behavior of inflation expectations is vitally important to a central bank that is attempting to reduce inflation. If inflation expectations are low and consistent with the reduction in inflation that the central bank wishes to bring about, it will be important to assure that they do not drift higher during the disinflation process. If inflation expectations have become elevated, a sustained reduction in inflation will require bringing inflation expectations down as well.\n\nInflation expectations embody assumptions – either explicit or implicit – about how the central bank is going to conduct monetary policy in the future. One possibility is that expectations are the result of past experience – that people simply extrapolate the recent behavior of inflation into the future. Statistically, this approach to expectations may work reasonably well for people most of the time, especially if the fundamental behavior of the central bank is not changing much. People taking this approach would tend to not adjust their expectations for future inflation until they saw movements in actual inflation. In this case, a successful disinflation that brings down both actual and expected inflation could be protracted and costly. With inflation expectations tied down by past experience, the remaining mechanism for bringing down inflation is just the mechanism of the original Phillips curve – an increase in real interest rates that slows aggregate demand and reduces actual inflation.\n\nAlternatively, people may take a more forward-looking approach. They may believe that current inflation has deviated temporarily from its long-run trend, and so they may discount recent observations. Moreover, they take into account that inflation will behave differently in the future if the behavior of the central bank changes. This is likely to be particularly important if the central bank communicates convincingly its intention to behave differently. For example, in many countries inflation expectations seemed to shift when the central bank adopted inflation targeting. Public understanding of the central bank's long-run goals and of how the central bank would respond to various potential economic disturbances helps anchor inflation expectations.\n\nInflation Expectations\n\nIf inflation expectations are a key determinant of the current behavior of inflation, then what do we know about the recent behavior of inflation expectations? There are a variety of indicators and as you might expect, none of them is perfect. Survey measures have the longest track record. The Philadelphia Fed compiles and publishes the Survey of Professional Forecasters every quarter. Their most recent compilation, published just last week, reports a mean expectation for core PCE inflation of 2.1 percent through the end of 2009. The average forecast for CPI inflation from the Blue Chip survey is 2.4 percent for core Consumer Price Index in 2007, and 2.3 percent in 2008, which based on an assumed gap of four-tenths between PCE and CPI inflation translates into 2.0 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, a bit lower than the Philadelphia survey. Consumer surveys, in contrast, yield much higher figures. Among respondents to the Reuters - University of Michigan survey, the median expected inflation over the next year is 3.2 percent and the median expected inflation over the next ten years is 3.1 percent. Economists typically discount data from such consumer surveys in which respondents have little or no economic incentive to forecast well. Professional forecasters presumably perceive a pecuniary benefit to having a documented record of accuracy.\n\nMeasures of expected inflation can be derived from the spreads between indexed and non-indexed U.S. Treasury securities – the so-called TIPS spread. The improvement in recent years in the depth and liquidity of the market for indexed securities provides at least some confidence that such measures reflect a reasonable aggregation of market participants' inflation expectations. The implied expectation of CPI inflation over the next five years was around 1½ percent in early 2003, rose to near 2½ percent in 2004, and has been trading around 2.3 percent in recent weeks. Taking off four-tenths for the average PCE-CPI spread, this translates to around 1.9 percent. Expectations for five-year inflation beginning five years from now have been running recently between 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent.\n\nAnother place to look for evidence on inflation trends is the growth in labor compensation. Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector accelerated from under 4 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2006. This is consistent with the broad acceleration in average hourly earnings shown in the Employment Report, and the upswing in the Employment Cost Index. Inflation-adjusted compensation gains should (and generally do) track labor productivity gains fairly closely. This is algebraically equivalent to saying that the markup over unit labor costs should be fairly constant. If so, the growth in unit labor costs should provide a gauge of expected inflation trends, the idea being that workers and firms set current wages based on their near-term expectations for real productivity gains and inflation. Productivity growth was relatively high early in this decade, but has decelerated recently and averaged 1.6 percent last year. As a result, unit labor costs have accelerated and have averaged 2.4 percent over the last two years. The markup has been relatively steady at an elevated level over the two years, which with rising unit labor costs is consistent with the rise in inflation we've seen.\n\nIf unit labor costs continue to advance at recent rates, either inflation will keep pace with unit labor costs, or the increase in labor costs will be absorbed by firms lowering their markups. It is true that the markup implied by the productivity and unit labor cost numbers have been high by historical standards, which accords well with the recent strength in business profits, but our understanding of aggregate movements in the markup is limited. The markup has tended to revert to its mean, but it can deviate for long stretches of time. So while it is possible that the markup might fall to offset a rise in unit labor costs, if we don't know why the markup is elevated now, its hard to have much confidence in a forecast that it is going to come to our rescue just in the nick of time. If the markup remains relatively high, and unit labor costs continue to advance at or above 2 percent, then we are likely to see inflation continue at about 2 percent.\n\nCorroborating evidence on inflation expectations is provided by recent work by James Stock and Mark Watson.9\n They estimate a model of postwar U.S. inflation that allows them to decompose inflation into a \"trend\" and \"transitory\" components, each with their own time-varying volatility. The time-varying volatility feature allows for changes over time in the portion of the variability in inflation that is due to long-lasting swings in trend inflation, as we saw in the Great Inflation of the 1970s, as opposed to short-run transitory movements in inflation. They find that the variability in the trend component of inflation has fallen dramatically since the 1970s, consistent with other research that has documented a fall in the \"persistence\" of inflation since then.10\n\n\n\n\n\nStock and Watson's methodology implies that the best forecast for future inflation is the current estimated value of the trend component, which they put at 2.1 percent (for core PCE inflation) as of the first quarter of 2007. This measure of trend inflation has been above 2 since the fourth quarter of 2004, and peaked at 2.2 percent in the second quarter of 2006. Interestingly, their measure of trend was between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent for over eight straight years from 1996 to 2003.\n\nThe Stock and Watson framework provides a natural way to assess whether any moderation in core inflation is evident yet. Their measure of trend inflation fell by 6 basis points from the peak (2.17 percent) in the second quarter of last year to the first quarter of 2007 (2.11 percent). Given the shape of the probability distribution around their estimates, this decline does not appear to be statistically significant.\n\nOutlook\n\nA variety of expectations measures then, point to expectations for core PCE inflation of about 2 percent right now. What does this imply about the outlook for actual inflation, which is now running at about 2¼ percent? The current level of inflation expectations is likely to exert a gravitational pull on actual inflation, if monetary policy actions are not inconsistent with those expectations and no concerted effort is made to shift expectations. Policy actions at variance with those expectations – for example, significant easing at a time of elevated or rising inflation – would likely call those expectations into question and lead to a change in assessments regarding future inflation. But as long as policy actions appear to be plausibly consistent with movement toward 2 percent inflation and nothing else acts to alter inflation expectations, that's likely to be the best forecast of where inflation is headed.\n\nCould inflation fall below 2 percent, say to 1½ percent? That depends. Without a prompt fall in inflation expectations, a reduction in inflation below 2 percent is likely to be temporary and hard to sustain. With expectations left alone, the remaining mechanism for bringing down inflation is the traditional Phillips curve mechanism, that is, an increase in real interest rates that slows aggregate demand and reduces both inflation and real activity. If expectations do not adapt to lower inflation, a sustained reduction in employment and output would be required to push inflation down.\n\nThe prospects for bringing inflation down below 2 percent thus hinge on the extent to which a reduction in inflation expectations can be brought about. How difficult would that be? Using changes in the target interest rate alone, the process is likely to be difficult and time-consuming. Costly reductions in real incomes and employment would be required until inflation expectations adapt. Without information suggesting a change in the pattern of monetary policy conduct or clarifying the intentions of policymakers, market participants could well interpret policy moves as the continued implementation of past strategy.\n\nOne natural approach to bringing inflation expectations down more expeditiously, should that be the desire, would be a strategy of clear communications about policymakers' intentions. Just how responsive would inflation expectations be to such communications? General conclusions are unlikely, because the results will depend on the nature of communications, the nature of the accompanying actions, and the context in which they are received. There are many historical examples of significant shifts in monetary policy expectations; examples include the fiscal reforms accompanying the ends of hyperinflations, the governance changes accompanying the adoption of explicit inflation objectives in other countries, and the operational regime shift adopted by the Volcker-led FOMC in 1979.\nThese examples involved fairly dramatic and sizable shifts in the conduct of monetary policy, however. Shifting inflation expectations from 2 percent down to 1.5 percent or 1 percent represents a far smaller change in policy, and thus ought to be less difficult. In fact, exactly the opposite transition was made three years ago. As I noted earlier, core inflation was between 1 and 2 percent from 1996 through early 2004, and since early 2004 core inflation has been between 2 and 2½ percent. Inflation expectations seem to have shifted up accordingly; for example the TIPS spread was around 1½ percent in 2003. The fact that core inflation so recently spent eight years between 1 and 2 percent suggests that convincing the public that we were returning to such a period would not be that difficult, especially in light of the fact that the Committee did not, during that earlier period, announce an intention to keep core inflation within that band.\n\nIn many recent instances, FOMC actions or statements appear to have induced simultaneous short-run movements in market participants' expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate and inflation. For example, following the heavy hurricane season of 2005, energy prices surged, policy expectations initially softened, and measures of inflation expectations rose. Shortly thereafter, core inflation also increased. Expectations were subsequently realigned after a number of speeches and statements by FOMC members, but similar sequences occurred in early 2004 and the spring of 2006. A similar episode occurred in the spring of 2006 in response to another round of energy price increases. Inflation expectations rose, but were subsequently tamped down by Committee member communications. In both cases, the movement in inflation expectations was relatively contained, but these short-run spikes suggest a pliability of inflation expectations in the current environment.\n\nThe outlook for inflation, then, is to an important extent contingent on policymakers' assessments of their ability to influence the evolution of inflation expectations. Such assessments will inevitably be inexact. Although there may be no precise historical analogs for communication and actions to reduce inflation expectations in circumstances like the present, my sense is that clear communications accompanied by consistent actions could bring about a relatively prompt and low-cost reduction in inflation.\n\nBut in any event, there is little disagreement about the central importance of inflation expectations for the conduct of monetary policy. Inflation expectations are an outcome of monetary policy, not an autonomous help or hindrance, and central banks are as responsible for the behavior of inflation expectations as they are for the behavior of inflation.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "* this is a revised version of the March 29, 2007 speech to the Virginia Association of Economists\n\nLet me begin by telling you about some recent experiences. I had the opportunity earlier this year to guest-teach a couple of business school economics classes. I opened my discussions with a pair of questions, asking students to put themselves in the place of a monetary policymaker choosing a target for the federal funds rate. First I gave them a set of hypothetical facts about the state of the economy: a slowdown in housing in the wake of multi-year housing boom; rising mortgage default rates; preliminary indicators of a slowing in business investment. And then I asked them: \"What are you going to do?\" The students dutifully responded that this situation could call for a reduction in the funds rate. They'd obviously been doing their homework.\n\nNext, I gave them a set of hypothetical facts about inflation: core PCE inflation, on a year-over-year basis, has been above 2 percent for nearly three straight years; after some signs of moderation, recent months' inflation numbers have moved higher; energy prices have been fluctuating around historically elevated levels and labor compensation is rising after a relatively flat period. Same question: \"What are you going to do?\" Once again, their response came right out of the textbook: an increase in the funds rate is needed to counter rising inflation, other things equal.\n\nThe trick of course is that both sets of hypothetical facts are drawn from the same period – basically right now. My objective was to underscore the fact that sometimes monetary policy decisions are not obvious, and that figuring out the appropriate policy action requires as complete a picture as possible of the state of the economy. Interpreting that picture and drawing policy conclusions from it can be a challenging task.\n\nThe situation I presented to the students represents a policymaking dilemma. The actions needed to bring down inflation could work against our desire to see the real outlook solidify. The facts would appear to present the policymaker with a tradeoff. You can address one – inflation or real growth – but that puts the other at risk. The obvious approach might be to decide how much \"weight\" one puts on each – low inflation and low unemployment – and then try to conduct policy so as to minimize the weighted average of the two. There is a superficial attraction to this popular view of the situation as a simple tradeoff. But that characterization is also, I think, an extreme over-simplification and can be highly misleading. I'd like to devote my remarks today to the relationship between inflation and the real side of the economy and to what I think that relationship implies for policymaking. As always, the views expressed are my own, and not necessarily the same as others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe relationship between inflation and the real economy can be described in terms of a number of alternative measures of real activity. Perhaps the most popular is the unemployment rate, because it captures the extent to which the expansion in employment generated by growth in real output is rapid enough to absorb additions to the labor force. As an indicator of the economy's use of its resources, the unemployment rate is commonly used as rough measure of the extent to which real activity is giving rise to \"inflation pressures,\" but I will have much more to say about this later on.\n\nUnemployment and inflation have, together, been at the center of macroeconomics for at least as long as there has been a field called macroeconomics. The relationship between these two variables is usually summarized by what's called the Phillips curve, named for A.W. Phillips, the economist who in 1957 documented an inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation in nearly 100 years of data for the United Kingdom.1But the notion that rising inflation might at times be associated with rising real growth and falling unemployment had been recognized and discussed by early economists, a fact that has been emphasized by many scholars, including Robert Lucas in his Nobel lecture and by my long-time Richmond Fed colleague, Thomas Humphrey, who retired in 2005.3\n\n\n\nSince Phillips' original paper, his curve has played a critical role in the evolution of thinking about macroeconomics and monetary policy. It captures the notable correlations between inflation and unemployment, although those correlations vary over time in important ways. But more importantly, it embodies compactly a theoretical understanding of the interplay between inflation and real economic forces. Because of its importance, and because the modern version of the Phillips curve is in some respects starkly different from the early edition, I think it will be worthwhile to briefly review some of the Phillips curve's history, before examining the role it plays today in thinking about monetary policy.\n\nA.W. Phillips' curve\n\nThe Phillips curve began as an atheoretical relationship drawn to fit the data. The form with which people are most familiar – linking unemployment to price inflation – was first set down in 1960 by Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow for U.S. data.4\n Following Samuelson and Solow, the Phillips curve was interpreted as describing a set of choices available to society each time period. According to this view, if the data suggested that price stability tended to coexist, on average, with 5 percent unemployment, we would have to live with higher inflation to enjoy unemployment persistently lower than 5 percent. This thinking led to descriptions of policy as either stimulating real activity at the cost of rising inflation, or fighting inflation by restraining the real economy. This understanding of the Phillips curve seems to have contributed to a political sentiment that, at least when inflation was relatively low, the costs of a little more inflation were worth the return in reduced unemployment.\n\n\n\nBut an alternative understanding of the Phillips curve was emerging in the 1960s. Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, separately, focused on the role of expectations in the relationship between inflation and unemployment.5\n Specifically, they argued that while inflationary policy actions that were not anticipated by the public could have a temporary stimulative effect on the economy, fully anticipated inflation would not affect real activity. Similarly, surprise disinflation could have a temporary contractionary effect but fully anticipated disinflation would not. This meant that the observed correlation in the data between inflation and unemployment must have come largely from episodes in which changes in the inflation rate were not expected by the public.\n\n\n\nAccording to the expectation-augmented Phillips curve developed by Friedman and Phelps, changes in inflation, and by implication monetary policy, could not have persistent, lasting effects on real economic activity. Over the medium to long run, economic growth and unemployment would tend to return to rates that were determined by productivity growth, population dynamics, and other characteristics of the markets for goods and labor.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose a policymaker consults a Phillips curve estimated from historical data that tells him that 3 percent unemployment can be achieved at 5 percent inflation. If the policymaker then eased interest rates in order to bring unemployment down, the policy might initially have the intended effect, provided the public continues to expect the lower previously prevailing inflation rate. But, the Friedman-Phelps framework argues, a sustained effort to reduce unemployment by maintaining inflation at 5 percent would ultimately lead the public to adjust their expectations for inflation. In the long run, unemployment would rise again to its \"natural\" level consistent with the real structure of the economy. Monetary policy can only have a transitory effect on unemployment.\n\nIn retrospect, many observers have labeled the Friedman-Phelps analysis prescient. They point to the 1970s as a confirmation of the implications of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, because the period of high and volatile inflation in the 1970s brought no sustained improvement in real economic activity. In fact, not coincidentally, the general performance of the real economy during that period was poor.\n\nThe analysis of Friedman and Phelps focused attention on the critical macroeconomic role of expectations. They assumed adaptive expectations, meaning that households and firms based their expectations of future inflation on their observations of recent past inflation. (For example, models of that era frequently represented inflation expectations as a simple weighted average of past inflation.) In this view, an increase in the inflation rate may catch people by surprise, but over time they would learn about the altered policy stance. But why wouldn't people try to look ahead and foresee what the central bank was likely to do, rather than rely on the mechanical adaptive-expectations forecasting formula? For example, why wouldn't they expect the central bank to try to exploit a short-run Phillips curve, even before inflation rises? Such anticipation could rob inflationary policy of even its short-run stimulative effects.\n\nIn 1972, Robert Lucas provided an alternative, rational expectations analysis of the relationship between inflation and real activity. Under rational expectations, people's expectations are based not just on their past observations, but also on their assessment of how the economy is likely to behave, including their knowledge of the process driving policymakers' choices. The rational expectations analysis retained the Friedman-Phelps implication that only unexpected inflation would be associated with falling unemployment. But rational expectations implies that the public's reaction to policy is more forward looking than in the case of adaptive expectations.\n\nIn separate work, Lucas also showed how rational expectations presented a challenge to making policy choices based on statistical estimates of such relationships as the Phillips curve.6\n In what has famously become known as the Lucas Critique, he showed that shifts in the pattern of policy behavior would cause such relationships like the Phillips curve to shift as well, so that statistical estimates from historical data would no longer be relevant for predicting the economy's response to changing policy.\n\n\n\nLater in the 1970s, Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott built on Lucas' work and analyzed the problem faced by a policymaker when the public is forward-looking.7\n They studied the temptations faced by a central bank choosing policy period-by-period. In any given period, what the public expected the central bank to do has already been determined. Given those beliefs, the policymaker can pull down unemployment with a little more unanticipated inflation. But people understand that the policymaker will be tempted to induce unanticipated inflation, and thus they don't believe prices will be stable – the inflation will be anticipated. The result is higher inflation with no gain in real activity. What the policymaker would like to do is find a way to commit to price stability, that is, commit to not give in to the temptation to attempt to reduce unemployment by inducing unanticipated inflation. The work of Kydland and Prescott highlighted to role of a central bank's credibility, in other words, the extent to which the public believes their commitment to price stability. Their work highlights the extent to which establishing credibility requires, indeed is virtually identical to, sacrificing future flexibility.\n\n\n\nThe linchpin of the link between inflation, unemployment and monetary policy is thus the public's expectations for inflation. If a run-up in inflation has been correctly anticipated, then it up will have little or no effect on unemployment. Similarly, if people expect falling inflation, then unemployment will not increase as much as it would if the disinflation were unanticipated. Thomas Sargent demonstrated this dramatically in his analysis of the ends of hyperinflations in a number of countries.8\n Very large reductions in inflation were achieved at much less cost than would be predicted by a standard Phillips curve, when those reductions were part of a comprehensive package of monetary and fiscal reforms.\n\n\n\nThe role of expectations figured prominently in the disinflation that took place in the early 1980s under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. The Fed had delayed taking strong enough action against inflation before Volcker took office in 1979, in part out of a belief that the slope of the Phillips curve was such that a fairly large increase in unemployment would be required to reduce inflation. The cost of the Volcker disinflation turned out to be substantially less than predicted however. The recent release of the FOMC transcripts from that era reveals that the public's inflation expectations were quite prominent in the Committee's discussions.9\n\n\n\nThe Modern Phillips Curve\n\nPrior to the 1970s and 1980s, a significant methodological divide separated macroeconomics and microeconomics. That divide broke down when economists learned how to study models of the aggregate economy that were built on sound microeconomic foundations – general equilibrium models, in other words – but were also capable of addressing macroeconomic issues. The latter required models that were dynamic, because investment and interest are central to macroeconomics, and stochastic as well, because business cycle fluctuations seem to be to some extent unanticipated.10\n The first generation of such models had no substantive interaction between inflation and real economic activity, and they displayed business cycles that were driven entirely by real phenomenon. The challenge was to build models that captured the inflation-unemployment link in a compelling way.\n\n\n\nThe modern Phillips curve emerged out of one approach to understanding the links between inflation and real economic activity in such well-grounded models. The approach involves specifying price-setting frictions that make a firm's choice of the price of its goods a dynamic decision that depends on expectations of future inflation. In addition, a monopolistic competition feature provides firms with the scope for meaningful price setting decisions. Under common forms of this friction, only a fraction of sellers reset their prices each period. Anticipating a length of time before the next opportunity to adjust their price, sellers will choose a price depending on what they think will happen to the overall level of prices during that interval. Aggregating across sellers, one finds that current prices (and thus current inflation) depend on expected future inflation.11\n\n This comports with common sense intuition – money has value only because it is expected to have value in the future. So the value of money today depends on value it is expected to have in the future.\n\n\n\nIn this class of models, current inflation also depends on real economic variables, particularly the real marginal cost of production, since relative prices are set as markups over marginal costs. Under certain heroic assumptions, a one-for-one relationship emerges between the real marginal cost of production and a measure of the scale of aggregate economic activity, like output or the unemployment rate. That case results in an equation one could describe as a Phillips curve, relating current inflation to current real activity and expected future inflation.12\n\n\n\nAlthough this approach has broad acceptance, in fairness I should note that it is not without its critics. Some economists view the price-setting frictions that are at the core of this approach as ad hoc and unpersuasive. Moreover, there are alternative frictions, such as spatial separation and limited information, that can also rationalize monetary non-neutrality. Nonetheless, a Phillips curve derived from price-setting frictions has become the leading model for applied central bank policy analysis.\n\nThis modern form of the Phillips curve closely resembles the expectations-augmented Phillips curve I discussed earlier, and thus shares many of the same properties. For example, a marked movement in inflation will be associated with a move in unemployment only if the inflation is different from what the public expected.\n\nFurthermore, inflation expectations in these models are forward-looking, so expected inflation, just like inflation itself and unemployment, is an endogenous variable determined by the interaction of the conduct of monetary policy with private sector decisions and shocks to the economy.\n\nWhen economists take this new Phillips curve to the data, they often find that past inflation helps explain inflation dynamics, even after attempting to control for expected inflation. This finding has led some to formulate versions of the Phillips curve in which both forward-looking and backward-looking price-setting behavior play a role.13\n Backward-looking price-setters are assumed to form expectations as a weighted average of past inflation, consistent with the old adaptive expectations assumption in Friedman and Phelps, or else set prices using a simple rule of thumb based on recent inflation which amounts to the same thing.\n\n\n\nThis so-called \"hybrid\" Phillips curve implies an intrinsic persistence to inflation, beyond that implied by the persistence of external shocks, the effect of expected inflation on current inflation, or the conduct of policy. Moreover, in the presence of significant backward-looking price-setting behavior, inflation would be prone to respond more slowly to changes in policy. Consequently, a backward-looking component implies that the real economic costs of bringing down inflation may be higher than would the case with a purely forward-looking Phillips curve. For the same reasons, backward-looking features would mean that inflation does not respond as rapidly to a change in policy as it otherwise might, even if that change itself is well explained by the policymaker and well anticipated and understood by the public.\n\nIn these so-called \"hybrid' Phillips curves, the extent to which price-setting and expectations are backward looking can matter a great deal for monetary policy. As a result, a small cottage industry of economists is now devoted to estimating hybrid Phillips curves to try to find the appropriate weight to put on backward-looking price-setting. Common estimates are that around 25 percent of agents form expectations in a backward-looking fashion, although estimates of up to 60 percent have been obtained. Many such estimates assume that the conduct of monetary policy has been constant over this period, in the sense that it was guided by a single consistent pattern of behavior. If instead one allows for the possibility of shifts in monetary policy, then the estimated weight on a backward-looking component in the Phillips curve is far lower – in fact, often zero. The intuition is straightforward. By not allowing persistent swings in monetary policy, the standard approach can mistakenly attribute inflation persistence to backward-looking expectations. The observed persistence of inflation thus might arise from forward-looking behavior combined with uncertainty in the public's mind about policy trends. If people are uncertain about the policymaker's objectives or strategy, then their inflation expectations will adjust more slowly as they learn about these features of policy by observing actual policy outcomes.\n\nPolicy\n\nWhile there is reasonably strong statistical evidence of shifts in monetary policy, the premise that inflation expectations are forward-looking and that the conduct of monetary policy has evolved over time is also broadly consistent with the postwar history of U.S. monetary policy. Moreover, that history is intimately intertwined with the evolution of our understanding of the relationships embodied in the Phillips curve.14\n\n Widely held views about the Phillips curve in the 1960s suggested that tolerating a small amount of inflation would allow permanently lower unemployment. As trend inflation steadily rose into the early 1970s, the public came to expect higher inflation to persist and the Phillips curve shifted out. Policymakers had overlooked the endogeneity of inflation expectations, and their influence on future inflation outcomes. In the 1970s, policymakers were reluctant to attack inflation aggressively out of a belief, based on the estimated slope of the Phillips curve, that high sustained unemployment would be required to reduce inflation. Belief in backward-looking expectations led policymakers to underestimate the extent to which they could influence the evolution of expectations and thereby reduce the cost of disinflation. Unemployment did increase during the disinflation that Chairman Volcker initiated in 1979, but by substantially less than had been predicted by backward-looking Phillips curves. On several occasions after that, identified as \"inflation scares\" by my former colleague Marvin Goodfriend, inflation expectations rose and the Fed responded aggressively by raising real interest rates above what otherwise would have been warranted.15\n These episodes helped gain credibility for the Fed's commitment to low inflation. Realized inflation fell in the 1990s. Between November 1995 and March 2004 (except for a six-month period around September 11, 2001), 12-month core PCE inflation was between 1 and 2 percent. The stabilization of inflation expectations at low levels was crucial to that success.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have given you an overview of the evolution of economists' understanding of the Phillips Curve, that is, the links between inflation and unemployment. To briefly summarize, the Phillips curve began life as an atheoretical relationship, drawn to fit historical correlations. It then became a static menu of inflation-unemployment options available to policymakers. But that approach neglected the dynamic, forward-looking nature of the decisions underlying the observed statistical relationship. The static Phillips curve broke down in the late 1960s and 1970s, just when policymakers began to rely on it, and in fact partly because they began to rely on it. The Phillips curve relationship was rebuilt from first principles in 1980s and 1990s. In the resulting modern Phillips curve the forward-looking expectations of price-setters plays a dominant role.\n\nThe modern Phillips curve has several important implications. First, the conduct of monetary policy is best understood as a pattern of behavior, or a \"rule\" in the broad sense of the word, not necessarily an algebraic formula. This contrasts with the view of monetary policy as a sequence of one-shot choices of policy rate that was inherent in the early version of the Phillips curve and the way my students were thinking about it. The reason it makes sense to think of policy this way is that expectations about future policy play a key role in the decisions people make today.\n\nAn immediate corollary is the importance of credibility, because low and stable inflation today requires that people believe inflation will be low and stable in the immediate future. And it deserves emphasis that credibility means giving up some flexibility in the future. Another immediate corollary is the value of central bank communications, especially communications aimed at helping people understand likely future outcomes for inflation. The value of communications is what has led several central banks to announce explicit numerical objectives for inflation.\n\nThe central theme, however, is that just as central banks are now widely acknowledged to be responsible for the behavior of inflation, they are just as responsible for the behavior of inflation expectations, because expectations are central to inflation dynamics. Related, central banks should not take expectations for granted by acting in ways that are inconsistent with those expectations, without taking into account that those expectations may change as a result. For example, economists have detected a decline in inflation persistence – that is, an increase in the tendency for inflation to return to trend after a deviation from trend. One might be tempted to count on inflation to return to trend more rapidly now, and infer that less policy response is needed when inflation departs from trend. But the fall in persistence surely reflects the fact that policy reacts more forcefully than before. Thus, a more rapid reversion to trend may be predicated on an implicit belief that the Fed will act to bring that about. Failing to do so risks a shift in expectations that makes inflation less likely to revert to trend.\n\nThe modern Phillips curve is particularly relevant to the dilemma I posed for my business school students, that is, for evaluating alternative policy strategies for restoring price stability. Would reducing inflation require large increases in unemployment? Again, the key is the behavior of inflation expectations, which now seem to hover between 2 and 2-1/2 percent, a bit below inflation itself, and somewhat higher than rates consistent with price stability. One might be pessimistic about the Fed's ability to reduce inflation below 2 percent without significant increases in unemployment if one takes the current level of inflation expectations as given. On the other hand, a strategy of clear and forceful communications about policy intentions, if successful, could bring inflation and inflation expectations down at significantly less cost. In this case, a more rapid return to price stability could be achieved, and would require less unemployment and less policy tightening than would otherwise be the case.\n\nHow responsive are inflation expectations to policymaker influence? General prescriptions should not be expected, since results will depend on the nature of central bank communication, the actions that accompany them and the context in which they are received. There are many examples of significant shifts in expectations induced by convincing people of a break from past practice. Examples include the fiscal reforms accompanying the ends of hyperinflations I mentioned earlier, the operational regime shift adopted by the Volcker FOMC in 1979, and the adoption of explicit inflation objectives by several foreign central banks. In many recent instances, FOMC actions or statements have induced short-run movements in market participants' expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate and inflation. Fall 2005 and spring 2006 stand out as noteworthy examples. Although there may be no precise historical analogs for potential communications and actions to restore price stability in circumstances like the present day, these examples suggest, to me at least, that policymakers can have a significant effect on inflation expectations.\n\nIn any case, the centrality of inflation expectations in the modern Phillips curve reinforces the importance of consistency and credibility in monetary policymaking, since these are traits that reduce people's uncertainty about future policy and stabilize expected inflation. Central banks should not underestimate the degree to which they are capable of influencing the evolution of inflation expectations. To paraphrase the late Milton Friedman, inflation is always and everywhere an expectational phenomenon. To put it another way, inflation expectations are an outcome of monetary policy, not an autonomous help or hindrance. Central banks are as responsible for the behavior of inflation expectations as they are for the behavior of inflation. That recognition is the key to sound monetary policy.\n\nAgain, thank you for inviting me to speak here today."

        "content": "I recently had the opportunity to guest-teach a couple of business school economics classes. It was great to be back in the classroom. Don’t get me wrong – I like my current job. But it was nice not to have to vote on anything.\n\nI opened my discussions with a pair of questions, asking students to put themselves in the place of a monetary policymaker choosing a target for the federal funds rate. First I gave them a set of hypothetical facts about the state of the economy – a slowdown in housing in the wake of multi-year housing boom; rising mortgage default rates; preliminary indicators of a possible slowing in business investment. And then I asked them: “What are you going to do?” The students dutifully responded that this situation could call for a reduction in the funds rate. They’d obviously been doing their homework.\n\nNext, I gave them a set of hypothetical facts about inflation – core PCE inflation, on a year-over-year basis, has been above 2 percent for nearly three straight years; after some signs of moderation, recent months’ inflation numbers have moved higher; energy prices have been fluctuating around historically elevated levels and futures markets predict further increases to come; and labor compensation is rising after a relatively flat period. Same question: “What are you going to do?” Once again, their response came right out of the textbook – an increase in the funds rate is needed to counter rising inflation, other things equal.\n\nThe trick of course is that both sets of hypothetical facts are drawn from the same period – basically right now. My objective was to underscore the fact that sometimes monetary policy decisions are not obvious, and that figuring out the appropriate policy action requires as complete a picture as possible of the state of the economy. Interpreting that picture can be a challenging task.\n\nThe situation I presented to the students represents a policy-making dilemma. The actions needed to bring down inflation could work against our desire to see the real outlook solidify. The facts appear to present the policymaker with a tradeoff. You can address one – inflation or real growth – but that puts the other at risk.\n\nThere is an element of truth to characterizing this situation as a tradeoff. But that characterization is also, I think, an extreme over-simplification and can be highly misleading. Monetary policy actions today are capable of affecting inflation and unemployment both now and in the future. Consequently, it is a mistake to view policy decision-making as a sequence of one-shot trade-offs. Some understanding of how inflation and unemployment interrelate over time is essential. I’d like to devote my remarks tonight to the relationship between inflation and the real side of the economy and to what I think that relationship implies for policy-making.\n\nThe relationship between inflation and the real economy can be described in terms of a number of alternative measures of real activity. Perhaps the most popular is the unemployment rate, because it captures the extent to which the expansion in employment generated by growth in real output is rapid enough to absorb additions to the labor force. As an indicator of the economy’s use of its resources, the unemployment rate is commonly used as rough measure of the extent to which real activity is giving rise to “inflation pressures,” but I will have much more to say about this later on.\nUnemployment and inflation have, together, been at the center of macroeconomics for at least as long as there has been a field called macroeconomics. The relationship between these two variables is usually summarized by the Phillips curve, named for A.W. Phillips, the economist who in 1957 documented an inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation in nearly 100 years of data for the United Kingdom.1\nBut the notion that rising inflation might at times be associated with rising real growth and falling unemployment had been recognized and discussed by early economists, a fact that has been emphasized by many scholars, including Robert Lucas in his Nobel lecture and by my long-time Richmond Fed colleague, Thomas Humphrey, who retired in 2005.2\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSince Phillips’ original paper, his curve has played a critical role in the evolution of thinking about macroeconomics and monetary policy. It captures the notable correlations between inflation and unemployment, although those correlations vary over time in important ways. But more importantly, it embodies compactly a theoretical understanding of the interplay between inflation and real economic forces. Because of its importance, and because the modern version of the Phillips curve is in some respects starkly different from the early edition, I think it will be worth our time to briefly review some of the Phillips curve’s history, before examining the role it plays today in thinking about monetary policy. As always, the views expressed are my own, and not necessarily the same as others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nA.W. Phillips’ curve\n\nThe Phillips curve began as an atheoretical relationship drawn to fit the data. The form with which people are most familiar – linking unemployment to price inflation – was first set down in 1960 by Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow for U.S. data. Following Samuelson and Solow, the Phillips curve was interpreted as describing a set of choices available to society each time period. According to this view, if the data suggested that price stability tended to coexist, on average, with 5 percent unemployment, we would have to live with higher inflation to enjoy persistently lower unemployment. This thinking led to descriptions of policy as either stimulating real activity at the cost of rising inflation, or fighting inflation by restraining the real economy. This understanding of the Phillips curve seems to have contributed to a political sentiment that, at least when inflation was relatively low, the costs of a little more inflation were worth the return in reduced unemployment.\n\nBut an alternative understanding of the Phillips curve was emerging in the 1960s. Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, separately, focused on the role of expectations in the relationship between inflation and unemployment.3\nSpecifically, they argued that while inflationary policy actions that were not anticipated by the public could have a temporary stimulative effect on the economy, fully anticipated inflation would not affect real activity. Similarly, surprise disinflation could have a temporary contractionary effect but fully anticipated disinflation would not. This meant that the observed correlation in the data between inflation and unemployment must have come largely from episodes in which changes in the inflation rate were not expected by the public.\n\n\n\nAccording to the expectation-augmented Phillips curve developed by Friedman and Phelps, changes in inflation, and by implication monetary policy, could not have persistent, lasting effects on real economic activity. Over the long run, economic growth and unemployment would tend to return to rates that were determined by productivity growth, population dynamics, and other characteristics of the markets for goods and labor.\nTo illustrate, suppose a policymaker consults a Phillips curve estimated from historical data that tells him that 3 percent unemployment can be achieved at 5 percent inflation. If the policymaker then eased interest rates in order to bring unemployment down, the policy might initially have the intended effect, provided the public continues to expect the lower previously prevailing inflation rate. But, the Friedman-Phelps framework argues, a sustained effort to maintain inflation at 5 percent would ultimately lead the public to adjust their expectations for inflation. In the long run, unemployment would rise again to its “natural” level given by the real structure of the economy.\n\nIn retrospect, many observers have labeled the Friedman-Phelps analysis prescient. They point to the 1970s as a confirmation of the implications of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, because the period of high and volatile inflation in the 1970s brought no sustained improvement in real economic activity. In fact, not coincidentally, the general performance of the real economy during that period was poor.\nThe analysis of Friedman and Phelps focused attention on the critical macroeconomic role of expectations. They assumed adaptive expectations, meaning that households and firms based their expectations of future inflation on their observations of recent past inflation. This made it very natural to think of an increase in the rate of inflation as necessarily catching people by surprise; only over time would they learn about the altered policy stance. But why wouldn’t people try to foresee how the central bank would behave rather than rely on the mechanical adaptive-expectations forecasting formula? For example, why wouldn’t they expect the central bank to try to exploit a short-run Phillips curve, even before inflation rises? Such anticipation could rob inflationary policy of even its short-run stimulative effects. In 1972, Robert Lucas provided an alternative, rational expectations analysis of the relationship between inflation and real activity. Under rational expectations, people’s expectations are based not just on their past observations, but also on their knowledge of how the economy is likely to behave, including their knowledge of the process driving policymakers’ choices.\n\nThe rational expectations analysis retained the Friedman-Phelps implication that only unexpected inflation would be associated with falling unemployment. But under rational expectations, the policymaker lacked the ability to systematically exploit even a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.\n\nIn separate work, Lucas also showed how rational expectations presented a challenge to making policy choices based on statistical estimates of such relationships as the Phillips curve. In what has famously become known as the Lucas Critique, he showed that shifts in the pattern of policy behavior would cause such relationships like the Phillips curve to shift as well, so that statistical estimates from historical data would no longer be relevant for predicting the economy’s response to changing policy.\n\nRational expectations imply that the public’s reaction to policy is more forward-looking than in the case of adaptive expectations. Also in the 1970s, Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott analyzed the problem faced by a policymaker when the public is forward-looking.4\nThey dissect the temptation faced by a policymaker choosing inflation period-by-period. They study a setting that features a natural rate of unemployment and in which the best possible policy is one that achieves price stability. In any given period, what the public expected the central bank to do has already been determined. Given those beliefs, the policymaker can pull down unemployment with a little more inflation.  But people understand that the policymaker will be so tempted, and thus they don’t believe prices will be stable. The result is higher inflation with no gain in real activity. What the policymaker would like to do is find a way to commit to price stability. The work of Kydland and Prescott highlighted to role of a central bank’s credibility; that is, the extent to which the public believes their commitment to price stability. Their work highlights the extent to which establishing credibility requires, indeed is virtually identical to, sacrificing future flexibility.\n\n\n\nSo the linchpin of the link between inflation, unemployment and monetary policy is the public’s expectations for inflation. If a run-up in inflation has been correctly anticipated, then it up will have little or no effect on unemployment. Similarly, if people expect falling inflation, then unemployment will not increase as much as it would if the disinflation were unanticipated. Thomas Sargent demonstrated this dramatically in his analysis of the ends of hyperinflations in a number of countries.5\nWhen part of a comprehensive monetary and fiscal reform, very large reductions in inflation were achieved at much less cost than would be predicted by a standard Phillips curve.\n\n\n\nThe role of expectations figured prominently in the disinflation that took place in the early 1980s under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. The Fed had delayed taking strong enough action against inflation before Volcker took office in 1979, in part out of a belief that the slope of the Phillips curve was such that a fairly large increase in unemployment would be required to reduce inflation. The cost of the Volcker disinflation turned out to be substantially less than predicted however. The recent release of the FOMC transcripts from that era reveals that the public’s inflation expectations were prominent in the Committee’s discussions.6\n\n\n\nThe Modern Phillips Curve\n\nPrior to the 1970s and 1980s, a significant methodological divide separated macroeconomics and microeconomics. That divide broke down when economists learned how to study models of the aggregate economy that were built on sound microeconomic foundations – general equilibrium models, in other words – but were also capable of addressing macroeconomic issues. The latter required models that were dynamic, because investment and interest are central to macroeconomics, and stochastic as well, because business cycle fluctuations seem to be to some extent unanticipated.7\nThe first generation of such models had no substantive interaction between inflation and real economic activity, and they displayed business cycles that were driven entirely by real phenomenon. The challenge was to build models that captured the inflation-unemployment link in a compelling way.\n\n\n\nThe modern Phillips curve emerged out of one approach to understanding monetary non-neutrality in (otherwise) general equilibrium settings. The approach involves specifying price-setting frictions that make a firm’s choice of the price of its goods a dynamic decision that depends on expectations of future inflation. In addition, a monopolistic competition feature provides firms with the scope for meaningful price setting decisions. Under common forms of this friction, only a fraction of sellers reset their prices each period. Anticipating a length of time before the next opportunity to adjust their price, sellers will choose a price depending on what they think will happen to the overall level of prices during that interval. Aggregating across sellers, one finds that current prices (and thus current inflation) depend on expected future inflation.8\n \n\n\n\nIn this class of models, current inflation also depends on real economic variables, particularly the real marginal cost of production, since prices are set as markups over marginal costs. Under certain heroic assumptions, a one-for-one relationship emerges between the real marginal cost of production and a measure of the scale of aggregate economic activity, like output or the unemployment rate. That case results in an equation one could describe as a Phillips curve, relating current inflation to current real activity and expected future inflation.9\n \nAlthough this approach has broad acceptance, I should note that it is not without its critics. Many economists view the price-setting frictions that are at the core of this approach as ad hoc and unpersuasive. Moreover, there are alternative frictions, such as spatial separation and limited information, that can also rationalize monetary non-neutrality. Nonetheless, a Phillips curve derived from price-setting frictions has become the workhorse for applied central bank policy analysis.\n\n\n\nThis modern form of the Phillips curve closely resembles the expectations-augmented Phillips curve of Friedman and Phelps, and thus shares many of the same properties. For example, a marked movement in inflation will be associated with a move in unemployment only if the inflation is different from what the public expects to prevail in the near future. Furthermore, inflation expectations in these models are forward-looking, so expected inflation, just like inflation itself and unemployment, is an endogenous variable determined by the interaction of the conduct of monetary policy with private sector decisions and shocks to the economy.\n\nWhen economists take this new Phillips curve to the data, they often find that past inflation helps explain inflation dynamics, even after attempting to control for expected inflation. This finding has led some to formulate versions of the Phillips curve in which both forward-looking and backward-looking price-setting behavior play a role.10\nBackward-looking price-setters are assumed to form expectations as a weighted average of past inflation, consistent with the adaptive expectations assumption in Friedman and Phelps, or else set prices using a simple rule of thumb based on recent inflation.\n\n\n\nThis so-called “hybrid” Phillips curve implies an intrinsic persistence to inflation, beyond that implied by the persistence of external shocks, the effect of expected inflation on current inflation, or the conduct of policy. Moreover, in the presence of significant backward-looking price-setting behavior, inflation would be prone to respond more slowly to changes in policy. Consequently, a backward-looking component implies that the real economic costs of bringing down inflation may be higher than would the case with a purely forward-looking Phillips curve. For the same reasons, backward-looking features would mean that inflation does not respond as rapidly to a change in policy as it otherwise might, even if that change itself is well explained by the policymaker and well anticipated and understood by the public.\n\nA small cottage industry of economists is now devoted to estimating hybrid Phillips curves to try to find the appropriate weight to put on backward-looking price-setting. Common estimates are that around 25 percent of agents form expectations in a backward-looking fashion, although estimates of up to 60 percent have been obtained. Many such estimates assume that the conduct of monetary policy has been constant over this period, in the sense that it was guided by a single pattern of behavior. If instead one allows for shifts in monetary policy, then the estimated weight on a backward-looking component in the Phillips curve is far lower – in fact, often zero. By not allowing persistent swings in monetary policy, the standard approach can mistakenly attribute inflation persistence to backward-looking expectations. The observed persistence of inflation thus might arise from forward-looking behavior combined with uncertainty in the public’s mind about policy trends. If people are uncertain about the policymaker’s objectives or strategy, then their expectations will adjust more slowly as they learn about these features of policy by observing actual policy outcomes.\n\nPolicy\n\nWhile there is reasonably strong statistical evidence of shifts in monetary policy, the premise that inflation expectations are forward-looking and that the conduct of monetary policy has evolved over time is also broadly consistent with the postwar history of U.S. monetary policy. Moreover, that history is intimately intertwined with the evolution of scientific understanding of the relationships embodied in the Phillips curve.11\nWidely held views about the Phillips curve in the 1960s suggested that tolerating a small amount of inflation would allow permanently lower unemployment. As trend inflation steadily rose into the early 1970s, the public came to expect higher inflation to persist and the Phillips curve shifted out. Policymakers had overlooked the endogeneity of inflation expectations, and their influence on future inflation outcomes. In the 1970s, policymakers were reluctant to attack inflation aggressively out of a belief, based on the estimated slope of the Phillips curve, that high sustained unemployment would be required to reduce inflation. Belief in backward-looking expectations led policymakers to underestimate the extent to which they could influence the evolution of expectations and thereby reduce the cost of disinflation. Unemployment did increase during the disinflation that Chairman Volcker initiated in 1979, but by substantially less than had been predicted by backward-looking Phillips curves. On several occasions after that, identified as “inflation scares” by my former colleague Marvin Goodfriend, inflation expectations rose and the Fed responded aggressively by raising real interest rates above what otherwise would have been warranted.12\nThese episodes helped gain credibility for the Fed’s commitment to low inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs realized inflation fell in the 1990s, available measures of expected inflation fell as well, and since then they have been fairly low and stable. But this apparent stability, relative to the wide swings they displayed in prior decades, should not be cause for complacency, particularly with inflation currently running uncomfortably high. Some observers, for example, have noted that the decline in the persistence of inflation in recent decades makes it more likely that inflation will soon decline toward its recent trend. This much is unobjectionable, but they go on to argue that policymakers can be more patient as a result, relying on the “gravitational pull” of inflation expectations rather that interest rate increases that might push unemployment up. But the decline in persistence is most likely a consequence of the way policy has generally responded when inflation rises. If so, then failing to respond is inconsistent with the expectations underlying the recent tendency for inflation to return to trend. This takes current expectations for granted, and runs the risk of eroding credibility.\n\nThe nature of the Phillips curve is particularly relevant to evaluating alternative policy strategies for restoring price stability. Would reducing inflation require large increases in unemployment? Again, the key is the behavior of inflation expectations, which now seem to hover between 2 and 2 ½ percent, a bit below inflation itself. If expectations are backward-looking, tied to past experience, one might favor a very gradual decline in inflation so as to minimize the effect on unemployment. Forward-looking expectations, however, suggest a strategy of attempting to influence expectations directly through clear and forceful communications. If such a communication strategy were successful, a more rapid return to price stability would be feasible and would require less policy tightening than would otherwise be the case.\n\nHow responsive to policymaker influence are inflation expectations? General prescriptions are unlikely, because results will depend on the nature of central bank actions and communication, and the context in which they are received. There are many examples of significant shifts in expectations induced by convincing people of a break from past practice. Examples include the fiscal reforms accompanying the ends of hyperinflations, the governance changes accompanying the adoption of explicit inflation objectives, and the operational regime shift adopted by the Volcker FOMC in 1979. In many recent instances, FOMC actions or statements have induced short run movements in market participants’ expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate and inflation. Although there may be no precise historical analogs for potential communications and actions to restore price stability in circumstances like the present day, these examples suggest that significant shifts in inflation expectations are possible.\n\nIn any case, the centrality of inflation expectations in the modern Phillips curve reinforces the importance of consistency and credibility in monetary policy making, since these are traits that reduce people’s uncertainty about future policy and stabilize expected inflation. It suggests that central banks should not take inflation expectations for granted by acting in ways that are inconsistent with expectations but assuming expectations will not change. Moreover, central banks should guard against underestimating the degree to which they are capable of influencing the evolution of inflation expectations. To paraphrase the late Milton Friedman, inflation is always and everywhere an expectational phenomenon. To put it another way, inflation expectations are an outcome of monetary policy, not an autonomous help or hindrance. Central banks are as responsible for the behavior of inflation expectations as they are for the behavior of inflation.\n\nJohn Weinberg contributed to these remarks."

        "content": "On behalf of the Federal Reserve System, I would like to add my welcome to the fifth Community Affairs Research Conference. These biennial meetings are a unique opportunity for academics, policy makers and community development professionals to gather together and consider new research findings that can inform our judgments on a variety of issues. I applaud the organizers for compiling such an interesting and provocative program.\n\nThis year's conference, on the financing of community development, focuses squarely on the ability of credit markets to deliver benefits to a broad spectrum of borrowers. This topic could not be more timely. The slowdown in the housing market we experienced in 2006, together with the increase in delinquencies on recent-vintage adjustable rate subprime mortgages has brought the difficulties experienced by many subprime borrowers and lenders into the spotlight. This has led some observers to question whether the expansion of credit we have experienced in recent years has been beneficial at all. The passionate commentary that these developments have provoked highlights, I believe, the value of careful, objective research on consumer financial markets.\n\nI have spoken elsewhere of the secular expansion of consumer credit, including mortgage credit, and have argued that it has been the result of a broad wave of innovation. The evidence strongly suggests that most of this expansion of credit can be accounted for by falling transaction costs associated with lending and borrowing.1\nIf instead consumer credit rose because of attitudinal shifts that reduced consumers' aversion to debt, then we would have seen rising risk premia (the additional interest rate consumers pay to cover default risk), which is contradicted by the evidence that risk premia have been trending down over the last several decades.\n\n\n\nThe cost reductions that have driven the growth of consumer credit can best be understood as the result of improvements in the ability of lenders to collate and analyze information about consumers, which in turn has allowed lenders to differentiate more finely among borrowers. As innovations progress, the allocation of credit moves \"down the demand curve.\" The new borrowers brought into the market by these developments will, on the whole, have higher than average risks.\n\nFinancial innovation, like other sorts of innovation, creates opportunities for people to do things that they previously could not do. But innovation is also risky. There will inevitably be some uncertainty about the outcome of offering a new loan product, or of offering a loan product to a new set of borrowers. In some cases, loan losses will fall short of expectations. In other cases, loan losses will exceed expectations. Either way, lenders will engage in some amount of experimentation and learning over time, as with any new product rollout.\n\nSome borrowers, too, will at times be uncertain about how suitable a new lending product is for them. New financial arrangements will be unfamiliar and hard to understand for some users, and there inevitably will be some amount of learning required to use them appropriately. New classes of borrowers drawn into the market by innovative lending practices – first-time homeowners for example – may be less prepared to evaluate intricate mortgage products. So financial innovation might generate more frequent mistakes by borrowers, particularly when the new products and practices are more complex than the old. This problem is exacerbated to the extent that disclosure requirements are not well adapted to the new products and critical contractual features are buried in fine print.\n\nThese same conditions of uncertainty about innovations also create opportunities for the intentional exploitation of consumers' unfamiliarity. These opportunities may be even more prevelant in the case of innovative loan products, because of their complexity, than for other services or goods. As financial innovation expands the set of borrowers and the variety of borrowing instruments, unscrupulous lending and outright fraud may become more prevalent.\n\nSo there are really four interrelated narratives for explaining why an expansion of credit is followed by a rise in delinquencies and defaults – new classes of borrowers are genuinely higher risk, lenders may have difficulty assessing the risks associated with new products, new borrowers may be more prone to making mistakes with unfamiliar financial products, and new borrowers may be more vulnerable to exploitation and abusive practices. One important challenge for research in this area is to devise ways of determining the relative contributions of these factors to the market outcomes we observe. This is a difficult task, and one on which researchers have to date made limited progress. But the evident interest of the public in these issues implies that the social value of such research would be high.\n\nNote that these four perspectives on the expansion of consumer credit have distinctly different policy implications. This isn't the occasion to go into these implications in any depth, but I will say that, in my opinion, the growth and development of the financial literacy of our general population has lagged behind the evolution of the financial markets they encounter. Everyone involved in the retail credit industry – policymakers, bankers, and industry critics alike – has an interest in increasing consumers' understanding of financial products and skill at managing their financial affairs. The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to the goal of improved financial literacy and better consumer understanding of financial market opportunities and risks. Financially literate consumers choose more wisely and make markets more effective.\n\nIn my opening remarks to the 2005 conference, I included one of my pet appeals to the research community. I talked about the essential value of research that sheds light on borrowing and other household financial decisions from an ex ante point of view. This does not mean that we should ignore the ex post outcomes – including adverse outcomes – resulting from household participation in credit markets. Rather, it means that we should try to get as complete a picture as possible of the full distribution of outcomes, and the relative likelihood of those outcomes. This is the only coherent way to understand whether any particular choice made by a consumer was reasonable at the time and whether any particular credit market product or practice is beneficial on net. Moreover, such a perspective is essential for evaluating proposed measures to reduce the incidence of adverse outcomes. If, as is sometimes the case, such measures restrict the availability of credit to borrowers who would not have suffered adverse outcomes, then one faces a trade-off. Does the benefit of preventing adverse outcomes for some outweigh the cost of restricting beneficial credit to others? We would do well to recognize the limits to our ability to make such judgments.\n\nThis is really just another way of saying that we should seek to understand credit market behavior in the context of a broader field of study, which John Campbell has labeled household finance in his presidential address to the American Finance Association. Household finance is the study of the full range of consumer savings and borrowing decisions and seeks to understand them in the context of the theory of a consumer trying to maximize the lifetime benefits of the consumption of goods and services, under conditions of uncertainty about the course of income over his or her lifetime.\n\nMuch of the work to be presented here over the next two days adds to our understanding of the distribution of outcomes from household financial behavior, both from the point of view of households themselves and from the point of view of lenders' credit granting and pricing decisions. This relates to another theme I sounded at the last conference. It is people, not neighborhoods or loans, that matter to our assessment of the effectiveness of credit markets. One implication of this premise is that viewing credit markets through the lens of lender data would always be inherently limiting, because such datasets do not, by themselves, provide information about outcomes of household credit market experiences. I commented two years ago that further refinements of HMDA data were unlikely to yield information that is of much use in making inferences about the well-being of individual households or the effectiveness of credit markets. Although the new HMDA pricing data have produced some fascinating information, I view the experience with that data thus far as confirming my earlier pessimism about the policy usefulness of expanded quantities of such lender-supplied data.\n\nWhile longitudinal data on household financial experiences is obviously ideal, a potentially worthwhile alternative research strategy would be to collaborate with credit rating bureaus in ways that respect the privacy of individual consumers and the proprietary interests of the companies. This could be particularly valuable because the files underlying credit scores and lending decisions comprise much of the borrower-specific information that is missing from studies based on lending-outcomes data, like the HMDA reports. Merging these files with household data from other sources would provide a much more consumer-centric and policy-relevant view of credit markets. My understanding is that there is work of this type under way at the Board of Governors.\n\nSuch problems with measurement present formidable challenges to the field of household finance, which is to say they represent opportunities for productive further research. I am reasonably confident that the community of dispassionate researchers and practitioners will find new and innovative ways of shedding light on borrower and lender behavior, and will thereby further our understanding of the costs and benefits of market practices and government interventions. The fact that popular policy discussions in this area are so prone to error also points to the social value of good solid research.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we are deeply committed to understanding the functioning and effectiveness of the financial sector. Credit markets clearly play an important role in community development. The Community Affairs offices of the Federal Reserve Banks were founded to gather and disseminate information about community development, and to foster contacts between lenders and community organizations. As the community development industry has grown and matured, it seems natural for the Fed's Community Affairs functions to focus increasingly on promoting and disseminating good credible research into the fundamental forces that affect the credit market behavior and the well-being of the people who make up the communities of interest. Conferences like these play a constructive and vital role in that endeavor. So I will watch the work discussed at this and future conferences with great interest.\n\nJohn Weinberg contributed to these remarks."

        "content": "I have to admit that I was apprehensive when Steve and Anil asked me to participate in this Forum and comment on a report on inflation dynamics, especially when I found out that one of the authors was going to be an old friend, Mark Watson. Mark is a pre-eminent time-series econometrician, so my first thought was that I was going to need to brush up on unit-root asymptotics. When the report arrived, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find a wide-ranging and insightful review of the historical behavior of inflation in the G-7 countries along with a thoughtful examination of alternative explanations of those dynamics. I think the Report makes a very useful contribution to applied monetary economics and illuminates well some of the key challenges in monetary policy today. The usual disclaimer applies here, however; the views I express are my own and not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA glance at historical plots of G-7 inflation strongly suggests that the dynamics have changed over time in consequential ways. Section 3 of the Report provides a clear and parsimonious way of characterizing changes in the dynamic behavior of inflation. Estimating the standard time-invariant autoregressive process clearly would leave little scope for understanding how inflation dynamics might have evolved over time.\n\nThe usual method of stepping away from the standard time-invariant approach is to look for shifts from one fixed regime to another at discrete points in time. The authors set off in a different direction, however, one that allows more range of variation in the underlying dynamics and is more agnostic about the timing of transitions. They decompose inflation into a time-varying trend and a transitory component, where both components are allowed to have time-varying volatilities. The results confirm in a very precise way our general sense of what's happened with inflation over the last 40 years: There was a broad increase in trend inflation and inflation volatility in the 1970s followed by a return to more stable behavior in the decades since. The authors show that the rise and decline was sharp and synchronized across the G-7 countries. Moreover, their technique attributes much of the observed rise in inflation volatility in the 1970s to increased volatility in the inflation trend. Trend inflation, of course, is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, so to me these results immediately imply that the conduct of monetary policy has varied substantially over this period.\n\nThe author's careful modeling of the time series behavior of inflation is, by itself, of limited use in thinking about how alternative approaches to policy-making might alter inflation behavior. To do this, a structural model is required — that is, a model in which the parameters do not vary when one varies the conduct of monetary policy. The authors trot out a popular workhorse macroeconomic model and use it to draw some lessons from their empirical work. They do not fit the model to the full set of variables, which makes sense because the model has policy following a fixed reaction function, and their empirical analysis indicates that inflation dynamics have undergone significant shifts. Instead, they look for parameter values that allow the model to best replicate the autocorrelation of the change in inflation.\n\nThe authors' focus on the autocorrelation properties of inflation is motivated by recent research suggesting that inflation has become less persistent since the early 1980s. Some observers have suggested that the decline in measured persistence implies that inflation will moderate more rapidly in the next year or two than would otherwise be the case. The model calibrations reported here, however, demonstrate the extent to which the autocorrelation properties of inflation depend on how monetary policy is conducted. (See Figure 6.3, for example.) This implies that policymakers should be quite wary of interpreting the fall in persistence since the 1980s as something monetary policy can exploit. If persistence has declined because policy now responds more strongly to inflation, for example, achieving a more rapid moderation in inflation may require tighter policy.\n\nThe reported model calibrations strongly suggest that inflation expectations are forward-looking. What does this mean? One of the equations of the workhorse model links current inflation to a measure of real marginal cost (or real activity) and people's expectations of future inflation. This is commonly referred to as a \"Phillips Curve\" and it was prominently featured last month in a front-page article in the Wall Street Journal. A key question regarding the modern Phillips Curve is how people form expectations regarding future inflation. The conventional approach to this question is to assume that a fraction of prices in the economy are set by forward-looking agents that make their best current estimate of future inflation, while other prices are set based on a backward-looking moving average of recent inflation experience, and then to let the data tell you the appropriate weight to put on backward-looking price-setting. Common estimates are that around 25 percent of agents form expectations in a backward-looking fashion. The authors find that their model fits the data much better if price-setters are nearly entirely forward-looking, in the sense that the fraction of prices set by backward-looking agents must be quite low — close to zero.\n\nBy itself, this evidence might not convince a skeptic. I say that because the stylized fact they seek to match — the autocorrelation of changes in inflation, not the autocorrelation in inflation — does not strike me as a sharply-drawn fact. It's just one correlation among many in the time series, and one could expect more robust results by fitting the model to more dimensions of the data. Fortunately, there is a burgeoning literature that does just that. A series of recent papers estimate full structural models of the type from which the reduced-form workhorse model is derived, and they consistently point to less backward-looking behavior than is found in single-equation estimates of the Phillips Curve. (Lubik and Schorfheide 2004, Rabanal and Rubio-Ramirez 2005)\n\nWhile it may be too soon to declare this research issue entirely settled, my sense is that the preponderance of empirical evidence suggests that price setting is predominantly forward-looking. Why does this matter? Common implementations of models with forward-looking price setting endow people in addition with a great deal of information about prospective policy setting. The typical assumption is that people see the central bank as following a policy algorithm in which trend inflation is a fixed, time-invariant parameter. A \"Taylor Rule\" is a popular example in which inflation is always expected to return to a target that is widely known and constant. In contrast, I am persuaded that at times there are aspects of policy-making, including trend inflation, about which the public is uncertain. This is consistent with the main assumption underlying the authors' decomposition of inflation into trend and transitory components; namely that the conduct of monetary policy evolves over time, and that the future evolution of that conduct is, at times, subject to significant uncertainty.\n\nThe notion of uncertainty about the future conduct of monetary policy might seem strange in an era in which inflation expectations are often characterized as \"anchored.\" But there is uncertainty and then there is uncertainty. I am fairly confident that the public places an extremely low probability on the Federal Reserve allowing inflation to average 10 percent over the next decade. (Presumably one could document this using financial market data, though I have not done so.) On the other hand, I suspect that market participants place some probability on inflation remaining at around where it is now — a 2 ¼ percent core PCE price index, for example — rather than moderating to 1 ½ percent. In that sense, one might question whether inflation expectations are anchored close enough to the price stability shore. Three-quarters of a percent might seem like a relatively small difference in inflation rates, but sustained over a decade or two, it would amount to a material difference in purchasing power.\n\nActual measures of inflation expectations can provide some evidence on this question. The Report examines survey and other measures of inflation expectations and shows that they do a poor job at predicting inflation trends in the period after the Inflation Moderation of the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, the market for inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury securities is not old enough to allow fruitful empirical tests using measures of the inflation compensation implied by nominal Treasury yields. Casual inspection of fluctuations in implied inflation compensation, however, suggests larger and more frequent movements in inflation expectations than displayed by survey-based measures. Moreover, the observed volatility in implied inflation compensation many years ahead seems inconsistent with a world in which the central bank's inflation objective is a fixed, time-invariant parameter.\n\nThe inability to forecast trend inflation using available measures of inflation expectations leads the authors to caution policymakers against relying too heavily on them. The Report does not say that inflation expectations are unimportant to the determination of inflation — their calibration exercise argues exactly the opposite, in fact — only that our available measures provide imperfect indicators. The stability of expectations measures, the authors argue, might mask potential instability in actual inflation expectations. With this I wholeheartedly agree; as I noted a moment ago, one can see measures of inflation expectations as in some sense \"anchored\" without being either satisfied with where they are anchored or sanguine about their stability.\n\nThe broader lesson to take away from this Report is that inflation dynamics have evolved significantly over the last 50 years, and inflation expectations appear to be forward-looking. To again paraphrase the late Milton Friedman, inflation is always and everywhere an expectational phenomenon. The intuition should be clear: the current value of money depends on value people expect it to have in the near future, and thus the current inflation rate depends critically on what people expect inflation to be in the near future. To put it another way, inflation expectations are an outcome of monetary policy, not an autonomous help or hindrance. Central banks are as responsible for the behavior of inflation expectations as they are for the behavior of inflation.\n\nThe relevance of these lessons is well illustrated, I believe, by recent experience. On several occasions in the last few years, market participants have shown some uncertainty about how the Fed would respond to sharply higher energy prices. For example, following the heavy hurricane season of 2005, energy prices surged, policy expectations initially softened and measures of inflation expectations rose. Shortly thereafter core inflation also increased. Expectations were subsequently realigned after a number speeches and statements by FOMC members, but similar sequences occurred in early 2004 and the spring of 2006. Now there is no intrinsic reason why energy price increases need to cause core prices to accelerate. Relative prices change all the time in a healthy dynamic economy, and price stability means that the average price level is not materially affected.\n\nThese recent examples of core inflation following movements in energy prices seem to reflect fluctuations in the public's beliefs about the current and future conduct of monetary policy, and thus about trend inflation. In a world where expectations are in play, the cost of bringing inflation down depends on one's ability to move expectations, and thus it matters a great deal whether inflation expectations are viewed as a policy outcome or an independent process. If expectations are backward-looking, policymakers naturally will be less forceful about returning inflation to a desired rate. If expectations are forward-looking, a central bank has the opportunity to move expectations in the right direction through clear communication reinforced by appropriate actions, and a more rapid return to price stability would be warranted. In my view, this Report, along with abundant other recent research in monetary economics, clearly points in the direction of forward-looking price setting. We should not, therefore, underestimate our capacity to influence the public's understanding of the conduct of policy."

        "content": "It’s a pleasure to be here again this year for what has come to be called the “Broaddus Breakfast.” I am honored to be invited back for a third appearance. Before I begin, I owe you the usual  disclaimer that these views are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues around the Federal Reserve System. But for those of you who have followed my voting record, this should come as no surprise.\n\nIn considering the economic outlook, it’s important to bear in mind the broader transition that is taking place. In the three-year period leading up to the middle of last year, we’ve seen above average growth. Real gross domestic product – our best measure of total production in the economy – grew at a 3 ¾ percent annual rate. To appreciate the strength of that performance, note that the trend rate of GDP growth – by which I mean the rate consistent with trend growth in productivity and the labor force – is more like 3 percent. Labor market conditions improved significantly over that period, with 5.4 million new jobs created and the unemployment rate falling by a full 1 ½ percentage points. With jobs increasingly plentiful, household spending surged – real per capita consumption rose at a robust 2.6 percent annual rate. And even as their spending increased, consumers continued to build wealth; household net worth increased by 31 percent to reach a level equal to five years of personal income.\n\nBut since we’re not in Lake Wobegon, we can’t be above average all the time. Indeed, in the second quarter of last year, real GDP only grew at a 2.6 percent rate. In the third quarter, growth dropped to a 2.0 percent rate, and growth is likely to remain below average in the current quarter. Since growth clearly has slowed, the question on many people’s minds is, “What’s next?”\n\nFor some guidance, we can look back to similar episodes in the past. The long expansions of the 1980s and the 1990s resemble our current expansion in several key respects. Both were unusually long, by historical standards. Both saw substantial increases in production, employment and wealth. And in both cycles, there was a somewhat bumpy transition between an early, high-growth phase and a period of several years of more average, trend-like growth. For example, the cyclical expansion of the 1990s was the longest in our nation’s history, and yet in the midst of this period of strong, sustained growth, there was a two-quarter period in early 1995 in which real GDP increased by only 0.9 percent at an annual rate, driven in part by weakness in housing investment. That barely perceptible growth was followed by an additional three quarters of growth at a subpar rate, but then real GDP accelerated and grew quite rapidly for the next four years. This example suggests that we should not be discouraged this time around by an uneven transition from rapid to more sustainable growth.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the current transition is the magnitude of the adjustment in the housing market, which comes at the end of what has been an amazing, decade-long run. The homeownership rate increased by 4 full percentage points from 1995 to 2005, and the number of houses built per year increased by 46 percent over that 10-year period.\n\nSome observers have called this extraordinary behavior of the housing market in recent years a bubble. I don’t find that term useful or particularly accurate, since the behavior of housing appears to have been based on solid fundamentals.\n\nFirst, there were good reasons for the homeownership rate to rise and for homeowners to spend more on housing. Before 1995, the prevailing view was that productivity, and by implication real per capita income, was likely to increase at about 1 percent annually. But since then, as is well known, productivity growth has been dramatically higher – about 3 percent in the nonfarm business sector, for example. People base their investment plans on current and anticipated income growth, and it is not surprising that households would move increasingly from renting to buying their own home.\n\nSecond, inflation fell to below 2 percent in the mid-1990s, and over time, financial market participants became more confident that inflation would remain low and stable; that confidence, in turn, led to low mortgage interest rates. Thus, at the beginning of 1995, the 30-year mortgage rate was above 9 percent; by 2003, it had fallen below 6 percent, reducing the relative price of housing services and contributing to the increase in demand.\n\nSatisfying the growth in housing demand required new construction and new land. While the supply of construction services appears to be fairly elastic, in some localities geography and zoning regulations can severely limit the supply of buildable lots. Consequently, the overall supply of housing can be highly inelastic. Increases in demand in such locations generate significant price increases, and those priced out of the market look for homes in locations with less desirable features – for example, with longer commutes.\n\nThis is well illustrated within the Fifth Federal Reserve District. In Charlotte, population, income and employment grew rapidly from 1995 to 2005. With ample supplies of usable land, 224,000 new building permits were issued, and the price of an existing home increased by a relatively modest 4.2 percent per year. The Washington, D.C., area also had rapid growth in population, income and employment; and 395,000 new houses were built. Unlike Charlotte, however, the supply of new lots was much more limited in the Washington area, and accordingly the average price of an existing home increased 10 percent per year from 1995 to 2005. Richmond’s experience has been in between those of Charlotte and Washington.\n\nThe secular increase in housing demand in recent years was apparently satisfied in many markets by the end of 2005. Nationwide, new home sales have fallen by 23 percent through November of last year. The pipeline of new projects under construction was not scaled back as rapidly, however, and we now have excess inventories of new and existing homes in most localities. Production of new homes will have to undershoot demand for a time in order to work off the backlog. Indeed, new housing starts have fallen 24 percent through November. The inventory overhang that remains suggests that homebuilding will be below demand for several more months.\n\nLooking ahead, there are tentative signs that the demand for housing has stabilized. New home sales have bumped around the 1 million unit annual rate for the last several months, and new purchase mortgage applications have risen over 12 percent since the late summer. If these tentative signs are confirmed by more complete data, then new home construction only needs to lag new home sales long enough to work off the current bulge in inventories. I would expect housing starts to realign with sales around the middle of 2007. Should new home demand deteriorate instead, the adjustment could take longer.\n\nIn any event, the weakness in housing will continue to be a drag on overall economic activity in the first half of this year, with the effect gradually waning as the year progresses. But I seriously doubt it will be enough of a drag to tip the economy into recession. My doubts stem from the fact that residential investment accounts for about 6 percent of GDP, while household consumption accounts for 70 percent, and the outlook for household spending looks quite strong right now. For the first three quarters of last year, consumer spending has increased at a healthy 3.4 percent annual rate, and it looks like the fourth quarter will see something similar. That growth in spending has been underpinned by a strong labor market and solid income growth. Labor markets are fairly tight, overall, as indicated by the 4.5 percent unemployment rate. Real disposable income increased at a strong rate in the third quarter, and there are signs that real wage gains are improving – wages and salaries, as measured by the employment cost index, increased at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the second and third quarters, the best two-quarter increase in almost five years.\n\nCould weakness in the housing market spill over and weaken consumption spending as well? As residential investment contracts, construction employment will certainly decline. So far, residential construction employment has shed 134,000 jobs since the peak in February. At the same time, however, other segments of the economy have been doing well and overall payrolls actually expanded by 1.5 million jobs. This again reflects the small size of the residential construction sector relative to the overall economy. Although the outlook is for construction employment to continue to weaken for at least several more months, a decline commensurate with the fall-off we’ve already seen in housing starts still would have only a minor effect on total employment.\n\nAs I have said before, consumer spending is largely determined by current and expected future income prospects. Consumer incomes, in turn, will depend on job market conditions. I expect the overall job market to continue to expand, even after accounting for further job losses in homebuilding. It’s worth noting that even as GDP growth slowed in the last half of 2006, the economy generated 160,000 new jobs per month, on average. That compares favorably with the 120,000 new jobs per month that would be needed to simply keep pace with population growth. The rapid growth in hiring pushed the unemployment rate down to a low 4.5 percent, and also allowed the labor force participation rate to increase modestly. The tight labor market has also led to healthy wage gains. Last year, the rate of growth in average hourly earnings increased by a full percentage point. I expect the labor market to remain tight, and therefore expect solid wage and salary growth this year. Thus, with income prospects looking good for 2007, it seems a pretty safe bet that consumer spending will do well, and again, that’s by far the largest part of the economy.\n\nWe’ve discussed residential investment, but what about business investment spending? Here the fundamentals look favorable as well. Business profitability is high and the cost of capital is low. In many industries, demand looks strong and capacity utilization is high. With these fundamentals in mind, it should be no surprise that real business investment grew at a robust 9.3 percent annual rate in the first three quarters of 2006. Especially noteworthy was investment in nonresidential structures, which increased at a remarkable 14.8 percent annual rate over that time period. Some leaders in new construction were hospitals, which increased 15 percent; offices, which increased 20 percent; stores, which increased 21 percent; and hotels, which increased 47 percent. Adding to this momentum in new nonresidential construction, many analysts expect to see a burst of new investment in computers and related products as the new Microsoft operating system is adopted in homes and offices. All in all, it seems reasonable to expect business investment to continue to contribute positively to growth in overall economic activity.\n\nThe outlook for real growth in 2007, then, is for continued strength in consumer spending and business investment to be partially offset, particularly early this year, by the drag from the housing market. Growth will start the year on the low side, but should be back to about 3 percent by the end of the year. So my best guess right now is that real GDP growth will average between 2 ½ and 2 ¾ percent in 2007. A month or two ago, this forecast would have been somewhat higher than the consensus of widely quoted analysts. But the data since then have been stronger than most observers expected, particularly the very robust data on consumer spending and employment. As a result, many analysts have marked up their forecasts, and so the projections I’ve presented today are now fairly mainstream.\n\nTwo risks to this outlook deserve mention. First, it’s impossible to be sure that housing demand truly has stabilized, so one downside risk is of a further deterioration in the housing market. However, we don’t see any signs of this now. Second, I’ll note again the substantial uncertainty surrounding oil prices. This is likely to be with us for some time to come, and it cuts both ways, as our recent experience has demonstrated.\n\nWhat about inflation? Last year was disappointing on this score as well. Inflation, according to our generally preferred measure – the core PCE price index – has been running above 2 percent since early 2004, and has run 2.3 percent through November of last year. Forecasters have been hoping for a moderation in core inflation, but until recently evidence of such moderation was scant. The November inflation reports, however, have provided some tentative evidence suggesting a moderating trend. For example, the three-month average rate of change in the core PCE price index fell to 1.8 percent in November. That inflation measure has exhibited substantial oscillations, however – it fell to 1.8 percent in February of last year before rising to 2.9 percent within three months when energy prices surged. In view of the recent record, it will take several months worth of data to provide statistically convincing evidence of a moderation in inflation. In the meantime, the risk that core inflation surges again, or does not subside as desired, clearly remains the predominant macroeconomic policy risk.\n\nLet me add a footnote here regarding wage rates and the inflation outlook. Some observers have viewed robust wage growth as a cause of inflationary pressures; I do not share that view. We can have healthy wage growth without inflation as long as we see commensurate growth in labor productivity. In fact, over time, real (inflation-adjusted) compensation tracks productivity growth fairly well, though they do not move in lockstep from quarter to quarter. I would note that the rate of growth of productivity shifted higher beginning in the middle of the 1990s, and while productivity is hard to forecast, I believe that reasonably strong productivity gains will continue and will warrant reasonably strong real wage gains. What would concern me – and we have not seen this as yet – would be a persistent increase in wage growth that was not matched by a commensurate increase in productivity growth. Ultimately this would result in higher inflation.\n\nAgain, thank you. It’s been a pleasure to be here."
