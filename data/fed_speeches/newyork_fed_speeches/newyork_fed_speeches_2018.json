    "content": "I would like to start by thanking Tharman for the invitation to participate in this panel of esteemed current and former policymakers.  I am also pleased to continue the long tradition of hosting the Group of Thirty at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and very much look forward to this morning\u2019s discussion.\n\nIn my remarks, I will focus on the following question:  What long-run monetary policy strategy is best suited to anchor inflation expectations, foster price stability, and promote maximum employment?  I emphasize the phrase \u201clong-run\u201d because I will focus on the features of a systematic policy framework, rather than tactical policy decisions.  This topic is not only of academic interest:  As was recently announced, the Federal Reserve is embarking on a review of its long-run monetary policy framework.1  I will argue that the global decline in the neutral rate of interest over the past quarter century poses significant challenges to maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations in a standard inflation-targeting regime.  I will then lay out some alternative policy strategies that have the potential of providing a solid anchor for inflation expectations\u2014even with a very low neutral interest rate\u2014while preserving broad continuity with current inflation-targeting practice.  Now that I am already way out on a limb, I should emphasize that my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs a starting point, it\u2019s useful to travel back in time to the 1980s and 1990s, when inflation targeting was introduced.  The problem at the time was high and variable inflation that contributed to macroeconomic instability and unmoored inflation expectations, which in turn fueled high and variable inflation.  To break this vicious cycle, numerous central banks instituted inflation targeting, or variants thereof, with a focus on bringing inflation down to a low level and fostering the establishment of stable, well-anchored inflation expectations.\n\nThis strategy worked extraordinarily well in the decade preceding the global financial crisis, as central banks were able to achieve remarkably low and stable inflation, leading to a positive feedback loop between low inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations.\n\nToday, we face an altogether different set of problems stemming from a very low neutral interest rate\u2014that is, the short-term real interest rate consistent with an economy operating at its potential alongside low and stable inflation.  Ironically, the problem we need to solve these days is the risk of inflation that is persistently too low, rather than too high. \n\nToday\u2019s low neutral interest rates reflect the culmination of trends extending back 25 years.  A quarter century ago, a typical estimate of the neutral rate in the United States was 2 or 2\u00bd percent\u2014consistent with historical averages over the preceding half century.  Since then, however, there has been a clear downward trend in neutral interest rates in the United States and other advanced economies, with current estimates ranging from 0 to 1\u00bd percent.2\n\nThree main global trends appear to account for the bulk of the decline in the neutral rate over the past quarter century.3   One is demographics: populations are aging as people live longer and birth rates have fallen. The second is productivity growth, which has slowed around the world. The third is the heightened demand for safe and liquid assets, which has led to a wider wedge between yields on safe government securities or central bank reserves and yields on riskier assets such as corporate bonds.\n\nImportantly, the onset of these trends preceded the global financial crisis and they have continued even as countries have recovered.  Although there is a great deal of uncertainty about the neutral rate, and conditions may change, a reasonable assumption is that it will remain low\u2014not far from current levels\u2014for the foreseeable future.4\n\nWhat does a low neutral rate mean for monetary policy and the anchoring of inflation expectations?  When a recession hits, central banks may not be able to reduce interest rates well below their neutral level to stimulate the economy as warranted because of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates.  This shortfall of monetary accommodation would result in less desirable economic outcomes during the recession and recovery.  In particular, inflation would typically undershoot its desired target during these episodes.  The persistence of below-target inflation rates in many advanced economies over the past decade is a testament to this dynamic.\n\nAs a result of the inherent asymmetry introduced by the lower bound on interest rates, an inflation-targeting central bank could experience inflation that is below target, once we consider the average inflation rate over periods when policy is constrained and those when it is not.  With inflation on average below the target level, inflation expectations will likely slip below the target rate as well.5\n\nA simple example helps illustrate this problem.  Say that 80 percent of the time, the lower bound on interest rates does not constrain policy and the central bank aims for a 2 percent target inflation rate.  During these \u201cgood\u201d times, an inflation-targeting central bank aims to keep inflation near 2 percent.  But, 20 percent of the time, the economy falls into a recession that\u2019s severe enough that the lower bound constrains policy. Assume that during these periods, inflation averages only 1 percent.  So, 80 percent of the time inflation averages 2 percent and 20 percent of the time inflation averages 1 percent.  The resulting average rate of inflation is about 1.8 percent.  As a consequence, inflation expectations are likely to become anchored at the long-run average of 1.8 percent, below the desired 2 percent target.\n\nBut, that\u2019s not the end of the story.  This downward shift in inflation expectations has a second-round effect on real interest rates, the economy, and inflation.  When policy is constrained by the effective lower bound, the downward shift in inflation expectations raises the real interest rate, further diminishing the degree of monetary stimulus, making the downturn worse and reducing inflation even more.  Even in times when policy is not constrained, the expectation of below-target inflation in the future affects current decisions, putting additional downward pressure on inflation.  In other words, monetary policy is always swimming upstream, fighting a current of too-low inflation expectations that interferes with achieving the target inflation rate.\n\nA number of alternative monetary policy frameworks have been proposed that aim to tackle the problems associated with the lower bound on interest rates.  Although they differ in many ways, it is useful to divide these proposals into three broad categories.  The first option is to maintain the basic framework of inflation targeting and to rely on a combination of aggressive conventional and unconventional policy actions when facing economic downturns to limit the deleterious effects of the lower bound.  This carries with it the risk that inflation expectations become anchored at too low a level.\n\nThe second option is \u201caverage-inflation targeting,\u201d whereby the central bank purposefully aims to achieve an above-target inflation rate in \u201cgood\u201d times when the lower bound is not a constraint.  Properly designed and implemented, such an overshoot can offset the inflation undershoot during \u201cbad\u201d times so that the longer-run average inflation rate and inflation expectations are in line with the target.\n\nThe third option is price-level targeting, including its various offshoots, such as nominal GDP targeting and temporary price-level targeting.  In such a regime, the central bank commits to keep the price level near a steadily growing target path.  Like average-inflation targeting, this strategy promises to overshoot the target inflation rate in \u201cgood\u201d times to make up for the inflation undershoot when policy is constrained.\n\nIn theory, both average-inflation and price-level targeting can solve the problem of anchoring inflation expectations at the target rate while maintaining a low inflation target rate amid low neutral rates.  Although price-level targeting is a bigger leap from inflation targeting than average-inflation targeting, each can be implemented in ways that are very similar to standard inflation targeting, either in terms of forecast-targeting or a policy rule.6  Importantly, neither will likely be effective in practice unless communicated clearly and carried out consistently over time.  More broadly, all of these proposed strategies face potential costs and benefits\u2014in terms of macroeconomic performance, communication, and robustness to uncertainty\u2014which require careful study.  \n\nIn considering alternative monetary policy strategies, academic experts, policymakers, and others from around the world have an important part to play, sharing and discussing ideas and comparing experiences to help all of us to think through these issues.  This process of careful study and discussion proved highly valuable during the development and implementation of inflation targeting in decades past, and will be equally valuable in the present debates.\n\nThank you."

    "title": "Four Questions on the State of Cyber Resilience and Endpoint Security",
    "date": "Nov 26, 2018",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/dzi181126",
    "content": "I want to thank The Clearing House for this generous invitation and, especially, for assembling such a compelling and topical program.\n\nThe relationship between The Clearing House and the Federal Reserve is multi-faceted across at least three planes: as competitor, as collaborator, and as overseer and overseen. When it comes to the resiliency and security of our infrastructures, however, there is no ambiguity in role or relationship: we rise, or fall, as one.\n\nStanding before an audience like this never fails to elicit a visceral sense of accountability. When the subject is the resiliency and security of the foundational elements of our nation\u2019s financial system, on which market function and economic vitality ultimately depend, that sense of accountability resonates even more keenly.\n\nI had the privilege of hearing General Michael Hayden, former head of the NSA and CIA, address a payments symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago a few years ago. In that venue, General Hayden spoke of the tectonic shifts affecting the global landscape, and their prospective impact on cyber, terror, and geopolitical threats.\n\nHis basic message, in two parts: keep your seat belts on, it promises to be a volatile century (yes, century); and when it comes to our critical financial market infrastructure being subject to attack, it is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d. Responding to the current threat environment represents the challenge of our generation; these are days of preparation.\n\nI will posit that a fundamental distinction exists between cyber resiliency and traditional resiliency: what works for us in conventional resiliency scenarios, namely the automatic and instantaneous replication of data, works against us in cyber scenarios, reflecting risks that a pernicious malware, or a severe data corruption, or even an application failure propagates itself across primary, secondary, and tertiary operating sites, rendering a systemic infrastructure functionally inoperable. In other venues we have therefore elaborated upon the need for a new paradigm for resiliency, one that endeavors to mate traditional precepts of geographic dispersion of infrastructure and human capital with new realities compelling technological diversity, and a platform for recovery, should the core of a financial market infrastructure (FMI) become corrupted.\n\nWe have also expounded upon new realities in endpoint security, borne of painful experience, in which endpoint breaches can have serious implications for public confidence in the integrity of a network as a whole, even in circumstances when an operator\u2019s infrastructure, applications, and security perimeter have not been compromised. Historically, market infrastructures have operated on the presumption that endpoint security is principally the responsibility of the endpoint, and infrastructure security is principally the responsibility of the operator. In the present threat environment, that bifurcation in responsibility is no longer so clear: the fates of operator and endpoint are inextricably linked.\n\nOur local efforts to strengthen resiliency and enhance endpoint security remain a consuming preoccupation, inspired meaningfully by international policy guidance promulgated by the Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). I want to commend our colleagues in the policy realm for their clarion call and practical guidance which have goaded the industry to action across both of these critical fronts and resulted in demonstrable progress. Rather than provide mere updates on the status of our local resiliency and security initiatives in response to this charge, which have been the focal point of prior remarks, I hope instead to frame a few forward oriented, even provocative, questions to advance the industry discourse and to consider measures to meet the present challenge.\n\nMy perspective in pursuing these questions is not as overseer, or as policy maker, but as practitioner. Recall that following the designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) of eight private sector financial market utilities as systemically important in 2012, the Board of Governors, acting in its oversight capacity (and inestimable wisdom!), committed to hold the wholesale services operated by the Reserve Banks to \u201cas high or higher a standard\u201d as it holds these private sector utilities; I assure you, we are experiencing, appropriately, that \u201cor higher\u201d side of the spectrum.\n\nLike our infrastructure peers we are challenged to maintain the integrity of existing operations while contending with a brave new world; constrained by the demands of cost recovery and limited resources; challenged by the multiplicity of risk and compliance frameworks with which to comply and governance and stakeholder bodies to satisfy; conscious that we have to defend across an extended front while our adversary need only find a single point of entry; and keenly aware that we must be perfect every day, our foe successful but once. These are heavy burdens; I speak not to you, but of you.\n\nWith that context these remarks (I assure) reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. (The best aside I ever heard in such a disclaimer came from former Supreme Court Justice Scalia, who was speaking to the Economic Club of New York, coincidentally the same week of his untimely passing. Upon noting that the views expressed do not necessarily represent those of the Supreme Court or the Government of the United States he added, slyly, \u201cthey rarely do!\u201d This may be one of those occasions.)\n\nProvocative Question Number 1: To what extent might the 2-Hour recovery time objective (known in industry parlance as the \u201c2-Hour RTO\u201d) alter the incentive structure and reaction function of an FMI responding to an \u201cextreme but plausible\u201d event, precipitating sub-optimal outcomes?\n\nEncouraging timely recovery following a severe disruption is a difficult thesis with which to argue, and our policy brethren are to be commended for urging financial market infrastructures to examine critically their recovery capacities. This supervisory impulse has already yielded rich dividends in encouraging the wholesale services operated by the Reserve Banks to question assumptions, to consider out-of-the-box solutions, and to prioritize the achievement of technical diversity and the assurance of data integrity as anchor elements of our resiliency regime. At the same time, I wonder if specifying a two-hour threshold, notwithstanding its noble intent, may alter the incentives and the reaction function for a financial market infrastructure when responding to an extreme event.\n\nCould it, for example, encourage an FMI under duress to invoke prematurely contingency and failover procedures before an accurate diagnosis has been rendered? Alternatively, could it encourage an FMI to endeavor to return to normal operations prior to assurance of complete confidence in and sanitization of a production environment? To put it plainly: could the 2-Hour RTO unwittingly exacerbate rather than assuage the impact of a severe disruption and/or impede prospects for recovery?\n\nReflecting upon these important questions, allow me to offer the following practitioner\u2019s interpretation, which I hope maximizes the value of the intent of the 2-Hour RTO while minimizing the downside risks of its mis-application. Rather than spending valuable time and industry resources re-litigating established supervisory guidance, we should consider the 2-Hour RTO as a vital organizing objective for planning purposes in peacetime, an aspiration to mobilize our best critical thinking to achieve, rather than an inviolable requirement that must be met in all circumstances recognizing the fog of war.  A common understanding of this nuance across policy makers, supervisors, and operators strikes me as an important step forward both to focus our resiliency preparations in advance of an extreme event and to promote sound decision making in its remediation.\n\nProvocative Question Number 2: To what extent does the proliferation of risk management and information security frameworks to which FMIs must comply risk creating a \u201ccheck the box\u201d mentality to security and resilience that diverts resources and management attention from other critical initiatives?\n\nIn framing this question, I asked my team to identify the cascading elements of supervisory guidance, oversight requirements, compliance regimes, and maturity frameworks with which we must contend related to risk management and information security. Their list in reply included 17 elements, admittedly some of which are self-induced and at different states of maturity and implementation.  All are well intended, all are well designed, and all seek to address different and meaningful dimensions of the control environment. At the same time, compliance across this waterfront has become a consuming pre-occupation, and arguably one that if we are not careful can intrude upon the more tangible actions, and commitments, to increase the resiliency of our infrastructures and enhance the security of our networks.\n\nMake no mistake: some form of risk management and control framework and corresponding policy and oversight guidance is absolutely essential to ensure a necessary discipline and accountability. This is not a call for a collective policy/supervisory/industry confab to craft a consolidated and harmonized uber-framework applicable to all parties in every circumstance--that would be as na\u00efve as it is impractical. Indeed, the proliferation of frameworks can serve as a useful prism to ensure that no stone is left unturned in the development of an FMI\u2019s resiliency and security regime.\n\nIt is an appeal for awareness among standards bodies, supervisors, directors, and other organizational hierarchies that their individual actions, as rational and defensible as they may be, can have a suffocating effect in the aggregate. It is also an appeal for application of a time-honored managerial principle: greater autonomy and discretion of local management to develop a tailored approach that balances risk, complexity, and effectiveness appropriate for the needs of a particular institution, and a corresponding accountability upon local management for the results. Absent this sensibility I will state my fear plainly: beware the risk management industrial complex.\n\nProvocative Question Number 3: To what extent might the invocation of manual procedures in \u201cprotracted outage\u201d scenarios exacerbate rather than assuage from a financial stability perspective?\n\nAs you know, the CPMI-IOSCO cyber guidance exhorts financial market infrastructures to consider alternatives for processing critical transactions in the event automated means of recovery are not successful. We are therefore compelled to consider not merely \u201cstar wars\u201d resiliency but also \u201cstone age\u201d contingency.\n\nLocally, this work proceeds across multiple fronts, including analyzing and parsing our transaction flow to identify systemic activity, developing procedures and tools to facilitate operations in a manual mode, and conducting simulation exercises with systemically important customers and interfacing financial market infrastructures to test our hypotheses and procedures.\n\nI would be remiss, especially in recognition of our Clearing House venue, not to herald our partnership to support each other in the event either the Fedwire Funds Service or CHIPS experiences an operational disruption from which it cannot recover on a same day basis. While the two services are not perfect substitutes, these preparations include, for example, ensuring that the Fedwire Funds Service has sufficient capacity to accommodate the full complement of Chips activity, even on peak volume days, and that CHIPS can support all CHIPS-eligible Fedwire Funds traffic.\n\nArguably we have made greater progress advancing this body of work than in prior iterations, for which policy makers and supervisors deserve enormous credit. The application of critical thinking related to protracted outage has also yielded rich dividends in greater understanding of the end-to-end transaction flow and identification of potential points of vulnerability. These benefits are not to be dismissed.\n\nBut let us not delude ourselves: no matter how mature our framework for responding to protracted outage scenarios, no matter how sound our procedures, no matter how tested our protocol, we never want to rely on these measures from a contingency perspective. The ultimate lesson for any market infrastructure (and for directors, governing bodies, and supervisors), is to so invest in resiliency and security in the core of its operation that it never finds itself in such a state.\n\nThe unintended consequences of a systemic infrastructure invoking protracted outage procedures in the event of a severe disruption are unknowable, and potentially raise reasonable questions as to whether the remedy may prove more toxic than the disease. Might it be preferable in select cases for a systemic infrastructure to declare a settlement holiday, unpalatable as that may be, or to work with relevant industry associations to declare that select markets are closed? Are the operational challenges of conducting manually activity that is fundamentally dependent upon automation a bridge too far? Do reconciliation challenges that become exponentially more complex as a disruption event extends in duration risk prospects for an orderly return home? Might industry dialogue to agree on the accepted circumstances and corresponding practices for dealing with a settlement holiday in a pre-meditated manner prove to be a superior course? These questions are not easy to answer, but it is very important in the present evolution of industry discourse that they are asked.\n\nProvocative Question Number 4: To what extent do measures to address endpoint security risks, such as anomaly detection and assurance regimes, compel a new paradigm for the attribution of liability in the end-to-end payment transaction flow?\n\nThe reality that endpoint security breaches can undermine confidence in a network even when an operator\u2019s infrastructure has not been violated has spawned a novel body of work, including initiatives to enhance assurance that external endpoints are operating in adherence with an operator\u2019s strict security requirements, and the development of application tools such as anomaly detection to enhance a participant\u2019s management of fraud risk. As this work has progressed, it has been hard to ignore the concern that these initiatives and tools might shift the attribution of liability between participant and operator in a manner that could challenge an operator\u2019s ability to take appropriate precautionary measures to protect the network.\n\nFor example, if an operator becomes aware of security deficiencies at a participant as part of an assurance program, and the participant subsequently experiences a breach, does the operator incur some measure of liability for any loss? In such a circumstance, what degree of latitude does an operator realistically possess to deny a participant access to services that are essential to the participant\u2019s ongoing viability? Moreover, if an operator detects potentially anomalous transactions coming from a participant, and does not intervene to prevent a transfer that is in fact fraudulent, does the operator assume a measure of liability for the resulting loss?\n\nOne way in which we have endeavored to manage these concerns is to provide tools and services to participants to manage their endpoint security risks locally, and in a manner that does not inappropriately shift liability from participant to operator, but admittedly these are difficult questions that compel novel thinking to ensure that the legal framework supporting the payment system is sufficiently robust and responsive to the escalating threat environment.\n\nAn additional, but not incidental, point on endpoint security: I observe a reluctance across the industry to share information about endpoint security experiences for fear that such transparency may expose an individual institution to concerns about its internal information security control environment. This is an understandable but parochial response which, collectively, has the potential to expose a network to considerable risk, especially if it inhibits socialization of known threat vectors and techniques. A solution to this vexing dynamic could be industry-led, operator-led, or supervisory-led. The impulse does not particularly matter; developing a venue for the coordinated sharing of endpoint intelligence and experience across the industry matters profoundly, and represents a fundamental mutual interest, compelling both leadership and collaboration.\n\nConclusion\n\nI do not presume answers to these questions, and merely observe that they are important ones to inspire reflection in the collective pursuit of resilience and security for the anchor elements of our nation\u2019s financial system. What better venue than The Clearing House\u2019s payments symposium and annual conference to continue this discussion?\n\nIn response to this generational challenge, let us be sure not to construct an inflexible Maginot line whose rigidities are easily subverted by a creative and nimble adversary. Let us instead develop a coherent and integrated system that relies upon the classical elements of defense, but none of them exclusively: perimeter security to keep the adversary outside of the environment; defense in depth to safeguard our most critical assets; sophisticated intelligence to understand the adversary\u2019s tactics; robust surveillance to monitor for intrusion and ensure environmental integrity; rapid response to fend off attack; effective collaboration with allies to enhance information sharing and collective security; and a strategic reserve to respond deftly in the event of loss.\n\nMake no mistake: as it relates to the wholesale services of the Federal Reserve Banks, we aspire not merely to a commercial standard of resiliency, or even a supervisory standard, but something approaching national security grade. We proceed on this trajectory from a position of strength, reflecting a record of experience that has endured the most severe terror attack in our nation\u2019s history, a financial crisis of historic proportion, and an array of extreme weather events. But in this sphere, either intentionally we are progressing, or inevitably we are regressing: there is no idleness.\n\nThank you for your generous attention today. I\u2019d be pleased to respond to a few questions.\n\n*January 2, 2019: Text updated with minor revisions."

    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/gut181113",
    "content": "Good morning and welcome to the New York Fed for this important conversation on \u201cDemographics are not Destiny: Fostering Conditions to Advance Latino Business Growth.\u201d My name is Jack Gutt and I am fortunate to head the New York Fed\u2019s Communications and Outreach group.\n\nI\u2019d like to thank all of my colleagues and our partners from the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI) and Interise for their efforts in developing the report, \u201cLatino Owned Businesses: Shining a Light on National Trends,\u201d issued today, and for organizing this conference.\n\nI\u2019d also like to thank all of you for joining us and our panelists for their participation. This is an impressive group and I, and my colleagues, very much look forward to hearing and learning from you.\nBefore going any further, I need to point out that what I say here today reflects my own views and not necessarily that of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs I said at the outset, this is an important conversation. Why? Because, for the first time since launching the Small Business Credit Survey, we are able to identify and discuss the specific experiences of Latino small business owners. And that, in turn, matters as Latinos are the fastest growing demographic in our nation and Latino-owned businesses are growing in number and importance.\n\nThe total Latino population in the United States was around 18 percent in 2017 and that number is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. Amid lagging business start-up rates, immigrant and Latino business expansion has bolstered small business growth nationally, outpacing that of other demographic groups.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, Latino-owned businesses grew by 13% compared with less than 3% for non-Latino businesses. Today, one in four new businesses is Latino owned, contributing more than $700 billion in annual sales and employing millions of workers. On top of that, the Latino population is among the youngest of all demographic groups and its entrepreneurial class is equally young. In fact, nearly half of Latino owned businesses were started less than six years ago, all of which points to the continued growth and importance of this entrepreneurial sector.\n\nBut why do we care about small business in the first place? Well, it\u2019s quite simple. The Federal Reserve System, as the nation\u2019s central bank, has important roles to play in supporting the vitality of our economy and promoting community development. Small businesses are the primary driver of job growth in the United States, they create economic opportunity in local communities, and they help drive innovation across the economy.\n\nThe New York Fed and fellow Reserve Banks are supporting small business in a number of ways. First, by producing the annual Small Business Credit Survey, which is fielded by all 12 Reserve Banks, to provide timely information on the sector, how they are doing, their financing needs and their access to credit. Second, by providing a one-stop resource of all of our insights and analysis to policymakers, community leaders, and service providers through the Fed Small Business website. Third, through regular meetings of our small business advisory councils, to get an understanding of real conditions on the ground. Fourth, through our Access to Capital Workshops, which provide technical assistance on access to credit for small businesses, covering topics like traditional lending, alternative and emerging sources of capital, and export financing. And, finally, through meetings like these.\n\nSo, since small businesses matter to the health of our economy, and Latino-owned small businesses are the fastest growing, what do we know about them? The report, which will help inform much of today\u2019s discussion, combines the results from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Small Business Credit Survey, SLEI\u2019s Survey of US Latino Business Owners and interviews conducted by SLEI and Interise, to offer a unique and unprecedented perspective into this entrepreneurial class. The report examines the business conditions and credit environment for Latino-owned businesses, and compares Latino firms to non-Latino firms, as well as how their experiences vary across major metro areas.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t want to get ahead of my colleague, Claire Kramer, and our partners from SLEI and Interise who will present the results of the report shortly, there are a couple of themes that caught my attention.\n\nFirst, Latino small business owners face significant financial barriers even after accounting for performance factors, including a disproportionate reliance on high-interest credit products. Those impediments manifest themselves at all stages of the business growth, from start-up to scale-up and beyond.\n\nSecond, Latino small businesses are more concentrated in a few industries and significantly underrepresented in the professional, scientific and technical services sectors, which also tend to be the most lucrative.\n\nThird, the size of the Latino population in a given metro area does not mean that there is a larger share of Latino-owned businesses in the same\u2014which is, to me, somewhat counterintuitive.\n\nDigging into and understanding the causes of these issues and identifying possible paths forward is not only an imperative but an opportunity, and of course the focus of much of today\u2019s agenda. It is clear that there is a pressing need for expanding technical support, diversifying sources of financing, especially at the micro level, and, in the case of the geographic conundrum, further collaborating on policy and community advocacy.\n\nI very much look forward to today\u2019s discussion and thank you again for your participation.\n\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Nancy Lee of Interise, Marlene Orozco from SLEI, and Claire Kramer from the New York Fed."

    "title": "Welcoming Remarks at the Investing in America's Workforce Book Launch Event",
    "date": "Nov 9, 2018",
    "speaker": "John C. Williams",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/wil181109",
    "content": "Welcome\n\nGood morning.  I am very pleased to welcome you all to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the launch of Investing in America\u2019s Workforce: Improving Outcomes for Workers and Employers.  I would like to thank our colleagues across the Federal Reserve System, the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, the Ray Marshall Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research for collaborating with us on this initiative.\n\nMy colleagues and I are proud to co-sponsor this event today and appreciate everyone who contributed their time and effort to making the Investing in America\u2019s Workforce publication a reality.\n\nWith over 100 contributors, pulling this together was not an easy feat.  I recognize the value of sharing knowledge and resources and am pleased that we can help facilitate this effort.  I congratulate my colleagues and our partners for this accomplishment and believe this is just the beginning of our work to support the workforce field.  There is a tendency to try to re-invent the wheel and overlook past experience, but by taking a step back and learning from one another, we can have a much greater positive impact in our communities.\n\nRoadshow Workforce Experience\n\nSustainable economic growth and thus broad-based prosperity is dependent on a healthy job market, one in which employers can find the skills they need and workers find jobs that allow them to grow and move up the economic ladder.  The challenge is developing a system that encompasses both and is accessible to all those seeking a job.  Our workforce development initiative aims to promote dialogue and a greater understanding of promising policies and programs that allow workers, especially those in low and moderate-income communities, to develop in-demand skills and connect them with employers.  We can achieve this by connecting with workforce stakeholders through policy forums, roundtable discussion sessions, and examining areas through our research and outreach.\n\nOne of the best aspects of my job is the opportunity to visit communities across our Second District.  The skills gap and the uneven economic recovery among different communities are consistent themes I hear, not just in the Second District but also in my previous job on the West Coast.  I also have heard about a variety of policies and programs that seem to be making an impact and could have broader potential that are worth sharing.\n\nEarly in my tenure I visited Brooklyn P-TECH and met with a dedicated and focused group of young students learning IT skills for middle-skill jobs. This partnership between IBM Corporation, the New York City Department of Education, the City University of New York, and the NYC College of Technology, provides an instructive model. It takes kids from high school through an associate\u2019s degree with corporate support and real-life experiences.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s working.  Their first class of 91 students entered the program in September 2011 and almost all have since earned their high school diplomas and about half have earned an associate\u2019s degree in a STEM field.  IBM has hired 23 graduates and continues to offer paid summer internships.1\n\nIn a few weeks, I will be visiting Per Scholas, a tuition-free workforce training program in the Bronx and in other parts of the country. It seeks to break the cycle of poverty by providing free technology career education, training, placement, and advancement services to people in underserved communities.  Approximately 90% of Per Scholas trainees are people of color, with the large majority representing Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino individuals -- groups with historically low representation in IT and the financial services industry.  \n\nThis workforce program is unique in that it seeks to re-train adult workers for successful careers as technology professionals and works with employers in crafting unique training programs for their business.  In 2017, Per Scholas NY enrolled 502 students and 406 graduated, of which a substantial majority reported being placed with an employer with an average starting wage of more than $20 an hour.2\n\nEarlier this year, the New York Fed partnered with Per Scholas NY to support our own Diversity & Inclusion efforts focused on career paths in IT, cybersecurity, and data science in the financial services industry. I am proud to say that the New York Fed was recognized by Per Scholas as a Major Partner in its recent 2018 annual update report.\n\nI mention these two examples as they reflect the theme of today\u2019s event and the book\u2014workforce development is about investing in work, workers and systems leading to greater employment opportunities for all.\n\nEmployer Engagement by Community Colleges in New York State\n\nAnother important issue is the role of employer engagement with community colleges.  By working directly with local employers, community colleges can more effectively prepare students for available jobs, and at the same time, help employers find and retain workers with the skills they need.\n\nIn an effort to better understand the level and types of employer engagement activities taking place in our region, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently conducted a survey of all of the community colleges in New York State. Next Wednesday, we will be releasing a report that details our findings.\n\nOur report does show that employer engagement by community colleges in New York State has become the norm.  The typical community college engages with more than 100 employers, spanning a broad range of industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, and tourism, just to name a few.  It is also quite common for community colleges to actively assess local labor market needs, often with the help of local employers.  \n\nAs part of these engagement efforts, employers provide a wide range of education and training support to community colleges, offer various forms of work experience, and help students prepare for the job market. Employer engagement is a promising and important undertaking for community colleges, local employers, students, and workers.\n\nInvesting in America\u2019s Workforce\n\nThese are just a few examples of the work being done across the Federal Reserve System and beyond, which is one of the reasons we have come together under the Investing in America\u2019s Workforce umbrella.  This initiative started in 2017 as a way to identify new approaches, opportunities, and challenges in the various areas of workforce development.  Led by the Federal Reserve System alongside other educational and nonprofit institutions, Investing in America\u2019s Workforce has encompassed 52 regional meetings held across the country last year, a capstone conference held in Austin, TX last October, and a three-volume book highlighting workforce development efforts as investments for economic and community growth, which the Fed and our partners are releasing today.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, the New York Fed held seven regional meetings in our District, and one in Orlando, FL in partnership with our Atlanta Fed colleagues after the influx of Puerto Ricans to the mainland post-Hurricane Maria.  We found that all of these communities shared certain needs, including to: develop training programs that lead more directly to available jobs; make the public workforce system less complicated; and find a consistent way to document and collect data on individuals who participate in training to assess the effectiveness of the programs.\n\nI hope this book will help find solutions, recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution or approach.  \n\nSo what\u2019s in the book? Investing in America\u2019s Workforce: Improving Outcomes for Workers and Employers is a collection of more than 65 essays from national and regional workforce experts about systemic barriers to employment and how further workforce investments can overcome those barriers. Staff from the New York Fed contributed two chapters in the publication. One piece\u2014on partnership development as a key workforce strategy\u2014 includes a look into how three employers in New York and Puerto Rico developed partnerships with post-secondary institutions to make progress in overcoming the skills gap issue. By detailing some of the factors that contributed to employers\u2019 partnering with educational institutions, this chapter aims to provide insight to employers seeking to engage with educational partners to address labor market concerns and support the development of skilled industry talent. The second piece examines the high child poverty rate in Puerto Rico and its impact on the long-term economic sustainability of the island and its ability to recover from Hurricane Maria. The island\u2019s child poverty rate is almost three times higher than that of mainland, and has remained stagnant even during times of economic growth, suggesting the issue is not just rooted in labor demand. This chapter discusses the dual programmatic and policy strategy of the Boys and Girls Club of Puerto Rico and its sister organization the Youth Development Institute.\n\nBefore I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide a quick overview of today\u2019s sessions. First, my colleague Patrick Harker, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, will discuss key shifts in perspective needed to see workforce development as an investment. Then there will be three panel sessions, each dedicated to the overarching focus of a volume in the publication \u2013 investing in workers, investing in work, and investing in systems. The day will then end with a luncheon panel discussion where speakers from various sectors will discuss what needs to happen to realize the goal of seeing workforce development as an investment in inclusive economic growth that benefits workers, employers, and communities.\n\nI am thrilled that we can bring together national and regional leaders representing the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to engage in a dialogue that can inform workforce development programming across the country and learn from one another about the opportunities for investing in America\u2019s workforce. We look forward to a productive day and continuing the conversation after the event. Thank you."

    "title": "Supervisory Implications of Rising Similarity in Banking",
    "date": "Nov 1, 2018",
    "speaker": "Kevin J. Stiroh",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/sti181101",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you very much for the invitation to speak at the \u201cU.S. Banking Forum.\u201d It is a pleasure to be here to talk about the continued evolution of the U.S. financial sector. Before proceeding, I will emphasize that the views expressed today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nIt is now a decade since the financial crisis and the U.S. banking industry has made tremendous progress in terms of repairing its aggregate balance sheet and building greater resilience. Capital ratios are higher, liquidity pools are deeper, and we\u2019ve seen fundamental improvements in risk management and governance. While there are still areas for continued progress, all of this should help financial firms provide critical intermediation services across a range of macroeconomic and financial market conditions. This progress reflects both the recognition by financial institutions of the need for greater resiliency in order to insulate themselves from shocks and a stronger, more comprehensive, forward-looking regulatory and supervisory framework.\n\nOver the same period, we\u2019ve seen continued evolution of the underlying business models for some of the largest U.S. financial firms in response to external forces. Firms are navigating statutory changes and a suite of new regulations that are still evolving and being implemented;2 responding to investor pressures for higher returns in a rising rate and more competitive environment; and seeking to capitalize on fundamental technological advances, while managing the risks associated with cybersecurity and greater competition from potentially disruptive new entrants.\n\nOne recent observation is that the largest firms in the U.S. appear to be growing increasingly similar in terms of their underlying business models and strategies. This has implications for balance sheet structure, earnings profile, and organizational structure. For example, some firms traditionally focused on capital market activities, are shifting into lending activities, while other more traditional banks, are expanding capital markets activities. In both cases, this serves to diversify the individual firms, while also making them more similar in terms of the business strategies they pursue, the products they offer, and the customers they serve.\n\nIf firms are responding to the same exogenous forces, this might not be surprising. Indeed, similar observations were made in the late 1990s as the deregulatory forces that culminated in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) led to predictions of a few \u201cfinancial supermarkets\u201d that would offer the full range of financial services to all customers. More recently, industry analysts and commenters have pointed to the range of capital and liquidity regulations that may be pushing firms toward the same target state business model where large firms provide a wider range of financial services.\n\nIf true, an obvious follow-up question is whether this should be a concern from a supervisory and regulatory perspective. Today, I will discuss the premise that large banks in the U.S. have indeed become more similar and then consider some reasons why this might be a topic of interest for the official sector. I can think of several compelling microprudential and macroprudential reasons why this would be the case: the need for an appropriate risk management framework that is commensurate with evolving risks; the need for supervisors to ensure that our assessments are proactive and flexible enough to evaluate evolving firms; the potential for similar firms to become \u201csystemic as a herd,\u201d where a given shock leads to correlated responses and large-scale disruption in the provision of financial services; and the potential for firms to move away from areas of comparative advantage, which could diminish the overall efficacy of the financial sector.\n\nI\u2019ll conclude with some implications for our supervisory regime.\n\nEnvironmental Context\n\nThe performance of financial firms in the decade since the financial crisis has been influenced by a broad range of external forces. I\u2019ll focus on three factors impacting how financial services are provided and their impact on large firm similarity: the regulatory response to the financial crisis, the interest rate environment, and technological innovation.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe U.S. official sector has taken meaningful steps since the financial crisis to promote greater resiliency and stronger risk management at the largest firms.3 This includes: a greater focus on both the quantity and quality of loss-absorbing capital; standards that focus on both short-term and long-term liquidity management and positions; activity restrictions; enhanced risk management standards and expectations; and new resolution and recovery regimes.4\n\nI will focus on the capital side, where the largest banks face a number of regulatory standards and supervisory expectations that impact both capital positions and the firms\u2019 capital planning process. The standards include point-in-time regulations that target a simple leverage ratio and risk-based ratios. They also include forward-looking standards for both types of ratios that reflect estimates of potential capital needs across a range of plausible, but severe macroeconomic and financial conditions. These forward-looking estimates that result from our Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program are now an integral, and some would say leading, part of the post-crisis capital regime.5\n\nThe fact that firms must manage against multiple capital constraints has both intended and potentially unintended consequences. On the intentional side, this framework enhances robustness. Risk assessment approaches and models are imperfect and a capital regime that relies on a range of assessment techniques can increase robustness and mitigate the inherent uncertainty around risk measurement. It also provides a check against potential regulatory arbitrage.\n\nA potential unintended consequence is pressure toward greater homogeneity of the largest banks. Think about a simple example of a firm with a low-risk balance sheet where the leverage ratio currently is binding, but the risk-based capital ratio is not. This firm may have incentives to shift out of low-risk assets into higher-risk assets in order to optimize its balance sheet and the corresponding risk-adjusted return on equity.6 A key point is that different firms face different marginal capital requirements for holding the same asset, depending on the other attributes of their balance sheet and business model.\n\nThis type of response can impact both the size and the composition of a bank\u2019s balance sheet. Of course, the world is much more complicated than this simple example. Optimizing firms likely consider a number of capital factors such as the current point-in-time ratios, current post-stress ratios, and the potential impact of both types of ratios in the future, as well as other balance sheet influences such as liquidity ratios and the recovery and resolution regime.\n\nRecent academic work has begun to explore this topic and I think it is an important area where regulators and supervisors concerned with optimal regulatory design can learn from the theoretical literature. Research suggests that in a world with multiple capital constraints, e.g., a leverage ratio and a risk-based capital, banks face incentives to do the same thing rather than specializing in areas where they each have a natural competitive advantage.7 This type of academic work provides a conceptual framework for understanding how optimizing behavior against multiple constraints might lead banks to pursue similar strategies and become more homogenous over time.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nA second dominant theme over the post-crisis period has been unconventional monetary policy, both in the U.S. and around the world, which has direct implications for the profitability and returns of U.S. commercial banks. The low rate environment experienced through 2015, for example, constrained bank earnings, particularly net interest income earned through traditional banking activities over this period. More recently, current and expected future returns on equity for large banks have improved, in part reflecting higher interest rates and net interest margins, as well as other factors such as lower tax rates and expectations for a stronger economy.\n\nDespite recent improvements, earnings pressures over most of the post-crisis period have pushed banks to reassess business strategies. For example, some banks attempted to enhance returns by building capacity and reach in new businesses; some looked to benefit from scale and scope activities by leveraging existing infrastructure, technology, and processes to offer a broader set of services at lower cost; some looked to reduce risk through greater diversification, and others pulled back from activities outside of their core focus.\n\nIt is unclear what the net impact will be, but if all firms pursue the same strategies in search of higher risk-adjusted returns, greater similarity could result. This pressure is potentially stronger now than in the past due to the highly competitive nature of banking and this is an area for further study.\n\nTechnology\n\nA third theme is the emergence of \u201cfintech\u201d, which I think of as the intersection between technological innovation and the provision of financial services. While innovation has always been a competitive driver in banking, there is a sense that both the pace of change and the potential impact have become more pronounced. As prices for technology services and capacity continue to fall and technological opportunities expand, more firms are able to adopt and leverage the latest technological breakthrough.\n\nScale is likely to remain a relevant factor in the deployment of the latest technology, but, at least among the largest firms, the playing field may be leveling as firms have the opportunity to benefit from direct investments, consultants, and third-party vendors offering the latest services. If the largest financial firms are responding to the same technological forces and pursuing the same opportunities, one might expect their resultant strategic choices to contribute to greater similarity over time.8 Again, this is an empirical question that deserves further inquiry.\n\nNext Steps\n\nAn important next step is to look at the data to assess whether recent industry trends are consistent with the premise that large banks are becoming more similar. We examined a range of balance sheet and income statement items, market indicators, and organizational structure data to draw some preliminary conclusions. The results, reported in the appendix, are generally supportive of the notion of greater homogeneity among the largest banks, but a more rigorous assessment of these preliminary conclusions would be a fruitful area of investigation.\n\nWhy Do We Care?\n\nI now turn to a final question \u2013 does this matter for supervisors and regulators? I think it does. I will consider four potential reasons why this shift is relevant for the official sector\u2019s concern for safety and soundness and efficient financial intermediation: a firm\u2019s risk management approach, the evolution of supervisory focus, the development of macroprudential risks, and allocative efficiency of financial services.\n\nI\u2019ll begin with our core microprudential focus on ensuring that banks develop and implement the appropriate risk management infrastructure for their evolving risks. While this is more linked to the changes in business models than greater similarity, the underlying drivers are the same.\n\nAs banks respond to environmental factors by expanding into new activities or shifting their strategic focus, they naturally face new risks and must adapt their risk management infrastructures along with their evolving business models. This entails ensuring the appropriate level of expertise about the new businesses; assessing that all relevant risks are identified, monitored, measured, and managed for each business line and the firm as a whole; and establishing the appropriate interaction with the enterprise risk management functions and Boards of Directors. These are core parts of supervisory expectations for traditional risk management and banks need to ensure that they are applied appropriately as they evolve.\n\nMoreover, expansion into new activities can bring entirely new risks beyond the direct risks of each specific business. For example, a firm that expands by offering a broader set of products to its existing base of customers. This has the potential to introduce greater correlation of business line results and a different type of shock if a financial firm potentially loses multiple revenue streams should a single customer face distress. Alternatively, a firm might be inclined to use one business line to cross-subsidize another, which makes measuring and managing risks and allocating capital more difficult from a business line perspective. In both cases, the potential risks would need to be managed at the enterprise level to reflect these cross-business linkages.\n\nA second implication is the need for the supervisory community to be responsive to the evolution of firms\u2019 strategies and business models. As firms evolve and pursue new strategies, supervisors need to understand those changes and assess firms accordingly. We must constantly evaluate the strategic focus of the firms we supervise and assess whether our approach and perspective are appropriate for the new activities. In a world with a core of diversified firms that are more similar, for example, cross-firm exams and horizontal analysis increase in value and supervisors might require broader skills.\n\nMoving beyond individual firms, there is the potential for microprudential risks to transform into macroprudential ones. If firms expand, diversify and become more similar, each might become safer individually. The industry as a whole, however, might not be any safer or more resilient. If all firms are effectively the same, they could become \u201csystemic as a herd\u201d and susceptible to the same shocks in a way that leaves the aggregate provision of financial services more volatile.9 The propagation mechanisms for an industry with a set of similar firms with a wider range of activities may be very different from one where firm heterogeneity can offset and smooth the impact of shocks. This suggests that supervisors and regulators should be concerned not just with the firm as an entity, but with the industry as a portfolio of firms where aggregate outcomes reflect both each firm\u2019s individual contribution and correlation properties across firms.\n\nFinally, supervisors are concerned about the efficient provision of financial services and the ability of the financial industry to support the real economy. If firms\u2019 mix of activities is overly determined by the regulatory environment, firms will have incentives to expand into activities where they do not have a comparative advantage. As a result, the potential gains of specialization would be lost. This could make the provision of financial services less efficient overall.\n\nJudging the cumulative impact of these changes in a comprehensive way that includes an assessment of costs, benefits, and risks is challenging, but seems an important goal for optimal policy design.\n\nConclusion\n\nA fundamental challenge for effective supervision is that the landscape is constantly evolving and adapting in response to a wide range of regulatory, financial, and technological forces. This type of dynamism is normal and inherently productive for the industry as firms continue to optimize in order to serve customers efficiently and satisfy investors, but it does raise issues that supervisors must consider. As I\u2019ve discussed, one recent type of evolution is the trend toward greater similarity of the largest financial firms in the U.S.\n\nIn response, supervisors and regulators must continue their focus on taking a broad perspective on supervision and risks. It is not enough to look at individual business lines or products, but we should continue to focus on enterprise risk management that reflects each business and the interdependencies among them. Moreover, supervisors should be dynamic and continue to evolve as the supervised firms do. Finally, supervisors should continue to develop an industry-wide, macroprudential perspective to understand the impact of the continuing evolution of the U.S. financial industry.\n\nTo do this, supervisors need to continue to leverage our cross-firm, horizontal perspective to better understand how the industry is evolving and what it might mean for our objectives around safety and soundness of individual firms and the efficient provision of financial services for the economy as whole.\n\nAppendix"

    "date": "Oct 29, 2018",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/tes181029",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. Let me extend a warm welcome to all of you to the United States and to the city of Boston. This is the 19th annual LBMA precious metals conference, and only the second time that the conference has taken place in the U.S., the first time being in San Francisco in 2002. Although Boston is among the oldest cities in the U.S., widely known as the birthplace of the American Revolution, it has continued to evolve from its colonial roots. It is a truly dynamic American city and today stands as a preeminent center of higher education and innovation, home to world-class universities and companies on the leading edge of industries like healthcare, technology and finance.\n\nAs always, the views I will express here today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLBMA & LPPM\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to thank Paul Fisher for inviting me to speak today and Ruth Crowell for her leadership of the LBMA. I\u2019d also like to thank LPPM Chairman Tim Pearce for his leadership of the LPPM. This annual conference presents a vital forum for exchanging insights among market participants in the precious metals industry, and I am excited to be a part of it.1\n\nI\u2019d like to acknowledge the critical functions performed by the LBMA as the preeminent global standard setting body for the wholesale precious metals market. Its Good Delivery Lists for gold and silver are universally acknowledged as the de facto standard of quality assured and assayed bullion. I would like to call out in particular the LBMA\u2019s important work in defining best practices for conduct in precious metals markets through its recent launch of the Global Precious Metals Code.2 In the same vein as the recently released FX Global Code, the Global Precious Metals Code is an important step toward promoting fair, effective, transparent and responsible engagement within the global precious metals market.3 Likewise, the LBMA\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Initiative, designed to strengthen standards around refiners\u2019 due diligence procedures, will help underpin the integrity of the precious metals market going forward. In general, the Federal Reserve supports efforts to bring transparency and integrity to market pricing, trade reporting, and trading and settlement practices, and specific to precious metals, I would encourage market participants to carry forward these efforts to ensure continued public confidence in precious metals markets.\n\nThe history of the United States itself is linked inextricably with gold. Early on, the California gold rush drove settlers west and led to the settlement of what would later become the western U.S. Later, the gold standard\u2014particularly whether or not to adhere to it\u2014stood at the crux of some of the most intense political debates of the 20th century. It was the subject of one of the most famous speeches in US political history, when, in 1896, prospective US presidential nominee Williams Jennings Bryan railed against the gold standard, proclaiming that mankind should not be crucified \u201cupon a cross of gold.\u201d4 With the role of gold in U.S. economic affairs significantly diminished following the end of convertibility in 1971, gold still retains its unique socio-cultural importance. It remains a necessary part of well-diversified portfolios, a vital industrial input, and an important store of value for many nations.\n\nThe Federal Reserve & Gold Custody\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s history with gold dates to its earliest days and tracks the seismic shifts in world history and the international monetary system over the past century. Today, the Federal Reserve\u2019s involvement with gold is solely as a provider of custody services to the global official community. The Fed does not hold gold on its own books, nor do we provide services beyond long-term storage of official gold. Yet, the large amount of gold held for safekeeping in the New York Fed\u2019s vault\u20146,223 tons [$216 billion at current market prices]5 \u2014is a powerful legacy and symbol of the U.S. and New York as a financial safe harbor.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s gold custody services began in 1916 when the New York Fed received its first deposit in the form of $46.8 million of gold coins from a European central bank, worth approximately $1.3 billion in today\u2019s dollars. The First World War was raging and the hazards of navigating trans-Atlantic sea lanes made the physical delivery of gold bullion increasingly perilous, which gave rise to the practice of earmarking gold for trade settlement and other purposes. The current headquarters of the New York Fed at 33 Liberty Street in lower Manhattan had not yet been erected, and gold held on behalf of foreign central banks was placed in the vaults of the New York Clearing House at 77 Cedar Street, across the street from modern-day Zuccotti Park.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until several years later that the New York Fed built its own gold vault around which its current headquarters was constructed. The vault is anchored deep within the bedrock of Manhattan, one of the few foundations able to support the 230 ton weight of the vault, not counting the weight of the gold inside.6 Its construction was described as \u201cone of the most difficult and exacting pieces of engineering ever undertaken\u201d at the time, partly on account of the undulating surface of the bedrock underlying the structure.7 When finally opened in 1924, the vault was the deepest basement in Manhattan, descending 80 feet below street level.\n\nGold balances at the New York Fed have fluctuated considerably, driven by war, the ebb and flow of global economic activity, and changes in the international financial architecture. Although the initial amount deposited at the time of the vault\u2019s opening was small, holdings rose strongly during the economic expansion that took place in the US over the 1920s, driven by high US interest rates and speculation by foreigners in the US stock market. Just as soon as holdings peaked in 1931, however, they contracted sharply with the onset of the Great Depression. The slump in world trade and erosion of investor confidence prompted many nations to repatriate their gold. By the mid-1930s, however, the threat of war in Europe reversed the trend of Depression-era withdrawals, and gold holdings at the New York Fed more than doubled between 1935 and 1940. Following the war, as European economies began to recover and exports to the US rose, the US balance of payments deficit began to expand. Nations running trade surpluses with the US accumulated dollars, and often exchanged these dollars for gold. Indeed, during the Bretton Woods period, the dollar was, for all intents and purposes, \u201cas good as gold.\u201d Gold holdings expanded to the point that the Fed was obliged to build an auxiliary vault to accommodate the additional bullion, which flowed in from the US Treasury\u2019s Assay Office in New York when foreign governments and central banks exchanged dollars for gold at the \u201cgold window.\u201d Custody balances increased steadily until 1971, the year that President Nixon broke the link between the US dollar and gold. Gold holdings peaked shortly thereafter, at 12,000 tons [or over $400 billion at current prices], in 1973. Since that time, the New York Fed has experienced a gradual but steady decline in overall holdings due to gold sales by the official sector and geographical repositioning of holdings of certain central banks. Nonetheless, the vault remains the world\u2019s largest known depository of monetary gold.8\n\nToday, in addition to our gold custody services, New York Fed offers banking and financial services to approximately 200 central banks, governments and international official institutions. These account holders maintain about $3.7 trillion in investments (excluding gold) mostly in US Treasury securities and short-term money-market type instruments.9 As my colleague Simon Potter discussed in his keynote address last year at the centennial commemoration ceremony for the Fed\u2019s dollar account services, the safety, confidentiality, and reliability of these services, including the Fed\u2019s gold custody services, provide important benefits that enable central banks around the world execute on their public mandates.10\n\nTransparency\n\nGiven the importance of the New York Fed as a gold custodian, let me say a word about the role of transparency in the global precious metals market. Transparency is critical to engendering greater confidence among precious metals investors, ultimately supporting improved price discovery and higher levels of market efficiency. In general, I applaud market participants\u2019 efforts to improve transparency in the global precious metals market within the limits of customer confidentiality obligations. Consistent with this posture, the Federal Reserve System releases monthly summary statistics on gold custody holdings and has been doing so for over 30 years.11 Similarly, we recognize efforts undertaken by the LBMA to promote greater transparency in the global precious metals market, for instance, through its recent efforts to systematize OTC trade reporting and to begin, along with the Bank of England, publishing the holdings volumes of London\u2019s gold and silver vaults.12\n\nConclusion\n\nIn closing, I\u2019d again like thank the LBMA for organizing this conference. I expect that the LBMA will continue to serve as the leader in standard-setting for the global wholesale precious metals market and advance innovative efforts to ensure that global bullion trade is marked by the highest levels of integrity, transparency and quality. I\u2019m looking forward to some fascinating panels and discussions over the coming days, and wish all of the participants a pleasant stay in Boston and the United States."

    "title": "U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization is Proceeding Smoothly",
    "date": "Oct 26, 2018",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/pot181026",
    "content": "Thank you for the invitation to participate in today\u2019s discussion about post-financial-crisis monetary policies.1 \n\nMy remarks today will focus on the implementation of monetary policy normalization.2 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has carefully developed and articulated a clear and transparent normalization strategy and is implementing that strategy. This approach has instilled confidence\u2014a key to maintaining market stability, which has supported the orderly functioning of the broader set of dollar money market rates that are important to policy transmission and financial conditions.3 \n\nAgainst this backdrop, the FOMC has increased the federal funds target rate from the 0 to \u00bc percent range that had been in effect between December 2008 and December 2015, to 2 to 2 \u00bc percent at its last meeting. Additionally, since late last year, when the Federal Reserve began a program to reduce its securities holdings by reinvesting principal maturities only to the extent that they exceed gradually increasing caps, the FOMC has reduced the size of the portfolio holdings from nearly $4.3 trillion to about $4.0 trillion.4 Notably, this month, the principal payments from the agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) portfolios are below the level of the redemption caps. As a result, after nearly $2.1 trillion of agency MBS reinvestment purchases\u2014due in large part to refinancing activity among U.S. homeowners\u2014there will be no agency MBS reinvestments for the first time since September 2011.\n\nIn my remarks, I will first review progress on the FOMC\u2019s program to normalize the stance of monetary policy, which so far has shown that the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy implementation framework continues to provide appropriate control over the federal funds rate and other short-term rates. I will focus on the balance sheet and discuss the drivers of the long-run balance sheet size and composition. Next, I will review the relationship between reserve levels, which fall as the portfolio declines, and short-term interest rates. Then, I will discuss the technical adjustment to the rate of interest paid on reserves (IOR), which the Federal Reserve made in June to provide greater comfort that the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) would remain within the target range set by the FOMC.5 I will discuss how this adjustment had exactly the intended effect on money market conditions, and how it has reinforced my certainty that the Federal Reserve is well positioned to maintain the public\u2019s high confidence in its ability to appropriately control overnight interest rates.\n\nAs always, the views I will express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by reviewing where we are in the normalization process. The Federal Reserve began its efforts to remove policy accommodation with its overnight policy rate at the zero lower bound and with a large portfolio of long-duration securities. Normalization, therefore, has two parts: increasing the overnight rate, and reducing securities holdings.\n\nShort-Term Rate Normalization\n\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss overnight rates. The current monetary policy implementation framework relies on providing the market with two overnight investment opportunities to help steer short-term interest rates: interest on reserves (IOR), which is the Federal Reserve\u2019s main tool to control interest rates, and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, a secondary tool.6 This framework has proven to be extremely effective at controlling federal funds rates. As shown in Figure 1, it has maintained the EFFR within the FOMC\u2019s target range on all but one day.7 Looking at the distribution of traded rates within both the federal funds and eurodollar funding markets, as shown in Figure 2, it is also clear that the framework has broadly fostered trading at rates well within the target range. Indeed, the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the rate distribution has consistently remained very tight over the course of rate normalization.8 \n\nOf course, monetary control does not stop at the federal funds market: our framework must ensure that the stance of monetary policy is passed through into other money markets. It has also been very successful in this sense. Figure 3 shows a broad selection of secured and unsecured overnight money market rates; it is clear that increases in the target range for the federal funds rate have passed through fully and immediately to the other rates, as expected and intended.\n\nMoreover, I have been very encouraged by the relative stability and high degree of co-movement among short-term money market rates. Figure 4 shows that the dispersion between various unsecured and secured overnight rates\u2014another metric that could reflect the efficacy of policy pass-through\u2014has declined and that these rates have largely converged within the upper portion of the target range since the end of last year.9 This is due, at least in part, to a large increase in the supply of Treasury bills, which supported the rise in repo rates to levels closer to unsecured rates. This also suggests that the framework continues to perform well along this dimension and perhaps is improving in effectiveness as reserve levels decline. Consistent with the broad availability of higher-yielding alternatives, ON RRP take-up remains muted, falling to a record low of $10 million in early September.10\n\nBalance Sheet Normalization\n\nLet me turn now to the second part of normalization: the balance sheet.11 The Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet grew markedly over the past decade as a result of large-scale asset purchase programs, which were undertaken to support the economic recovery by easing financial conditions to a greater extent than could be achieved solely through reducing the federal funds rate. Starting late last year, the Federal Reserve began a program to reduce its securities holdings by reinvesting principal maturities only to the extent that they exceed gradually increasing caps.12 This gradual and predictable approach is intended to reduce the balance sheet\u2019s size at a measured pace while supporting good market functioning and mitigating the risk of sharp or outsized asset price reactions. \n\nThe charts in Figure 5 show the realized and estimated cash flows from the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities portfolio. The length of the darker bars show the actual amounts of Treasury securities and agency debt and MBS principal that matured or paid down; only the amounts above the cap were reinvested. Since October 2017, the Federal Reserve\u2019s domestic securities portfolio has decreased by nearly $300 billion to about $4.0 trillion.13 \n\nThe lighter bars in Figure 5 show the projected cash flows through the end of next year. Notably, the caps reached their maximal values this month. Going forward, reinvestment of Treasury securities will nearly exclusively occur in the middle month of each quarter. As had been expected in the design of the caps, principal repayments from the agency MBS portfolio have now begun to come in below the level of the maximum cap. Consistent with the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, when this occurs in a given month, no reinvestment occurs, and the portfolio size declines by the amount of principal repayment. In the future, mortgage principal repayments, which are sensitive to various factors, especially long-term interest rates, could conceivably rise above the level of the cap, particularly if interest rates were to decline. If this were to occur, those amounts above the cap would be reinvested. It is this cap mechanism that keeps the decline in the balance sheet at a gradual and predictable pace. The New York Fed\u2019s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) will conduct operational readiness exercises during periods of no reinvestment to ensure it remains prepared to reinvest if needed.14\n\nThe FOMC\u2019s approach to balance sheet normalization\u2014and its transparency and clear communication about the normalization principles and plans prior to its implementation\u2014was designed to mitigate the risk of sharp or outsized asset price reactions to the decline in the portfolio\u2019s size over time. Desk surveys corroborate market commentary describing a relatively limited impact from the reduction in holdings on Treasury yields and MBS spreads thus far. As shown in Figure 6, comparing a matched sample of survey respondents in our July 2017 surveys to the September 2018 surveys, the expected impact on 10-year Treasury yields and 30-year MBS option-adjusted spreads (OAS) during the two-year period following implementation of the change to the reinvestment policy has declined, likely in part reflecting expectations for the balance sheet to normalize at a larger size.15 Looking forward, the median respondent currently anticipates the cumulative impact over the next two years to be 17 basis points for the 10-year Treasury yield, and 12 basis points for the 30-year MBS OAS.\n\nThis gradual expected increase contrasts with the experience of the so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d in 2013, which showed that markets can have outsized and sharp reactions to changes in balance sheet policy even before they happen. The expected impact of balance sheet reductions on Treasury yields and agency MBS OAS reflects the FOMC\u2019s gradual and predictable approach to balance sheet normalization, but could also reflect additional factors. Some argue that robust credit extension by the private sector given the strong economic environment helps to offset the yield impact from a declining balance sheet. Furthermore, there are likely some spillover effects across fixed-income markets globally from asset purchase programs abroad that could affect U.S. term premia.\n\nThe Balance Sheet in the Long Run\n\nFor many years, the FOMC has indicated its intention that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it will hold primarily Treasury securities.16 Also, in the June 2017 addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the FOMC noted that reducing the Fed\u2019s securities holdings will result in a declining supply of reserve balances, and that it anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances to a level \u201cappreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.\u201d\n\nWhile the FOMC has articulated how the balance sheet will be reduced, there remains uncertainty about the long-run size and composition of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet. Importantly, the size and composition will depend on growth in the various non-reserve liabilities, demand for reserve balances, and the future monetary policy implementation framework. The FOMC has not made any decisions about the long-run monetary policy implementation framework; however, the minutes from the July/August FOMC meeting suggest that the Committee will likely resume a discussion of operating frameworks in the near future.17 It is also not known how non-reserve and reserve liabilities will evolve going forward; however, our regular surveys give us a sense of how some market participants are viewing many of these components, which we show in Figure 7. In particular, the surveys ask respondents about their expectations for the size and composition of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, on average, in 2025, under the assumption of no return to the zero lower bound. The responses serve as a good proxy for expectations about the long-run size of the balance sheet. The median expectations are for the balance sheet to be $3.6 trillion on average in 2025 and for reserve balances to be $750 billion, or about $1 trillion below their current level.\n\nOn the asset side of the balance sheet, the normalized size of the securities portfolio is one consistent with the longer-run trends in currency and other liabilities. However, even after the Fed normalizes the size of its balance sheet, the composition of its securities portfolio will not yet be \u201cnormal,\u201d as it will not consist primarily of Treasury securities. As you can see from Figure 8, market participants expect that the domestic securities portfolio could contain roughly $700 billion in agency MBS on average in 2025.\n\nThe Dynamics Between Reserve Levels and Short-Term Rates\n\nAs the portfolio shrinks and the level of reserve balances declines, how will we know if we are transitioning from an environment characterized by abundant reserves to one characterized by scarce reserves?18 To address this question and understand how the level of reserves is related to short-term interest rates, we need to review some fundamentals. In the academic literature on monetary policy implementation, models for the behavior of the overnight interbank rate generally boil down to its relationship with the stock of bank reserves.19 These models generally find that as reserve balances decline, the overnight interest rate goes up, but not uniformly. At high levels of reserves, the responsiveness of rates to changes in reserve levels is fairly low, and the demand curve is said to be \u201cflat.\u201d As excess reserve levels decline, the responsiveness of rates increases. At low levels of excess reserves, the overnight rate responds sharply to small adjustments in the level of reserves, and the demand curve is considered \u201csteep.\u201d20 \n\nDespite some of the recent upward moves in overnight rates, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve reached the \u201csteep\u201d portion of the demand curve, where aggregate reserves are scarce. Let\u2019s run through some places where evidence of aggregate reserve scarcity might be found. To begin with, if we were closing in on the \u201csteep\u201d part, I might expect to see substantial above-IOR lending in the unsecured overnight markets, as at least some banks each day found themselves short of reserves and had to borrow them from other banks. In fact, the current amount of such above-IOR lending remains low as a share of the overnight bank funding market, as shown in Figure 9.21 I might also expect to see shifts in bank payments behavior\u2014for example, more daylight overdrafts or more effort by banks to \u201coptimize\u201d their payment flows\u2014but I have not seen this either. Most fundamentally, I might have observed a day-to-day relationship between shifts in the stock of reserves and overnight interest rates. Figure 10 shows a scatterplot of daily changes in reserve balances against daily changes in the spread between the IOR rate and the effective federal funds rate; there is no visible relationship.\n\nRecent experience supports my belief that we are not at the \u201csteep\u201d portion of the demand curve and aggregate reserve scarcity. On one day in mid-September, there was a large drop in reserves\u2014of nearly $75 billion\u2014as the Treasury increased its cash holdings at the Federal Reserve as a result of third-quarter tax receipts, as shown by the red point in Figure 10. As a result, reserve balances fell to one of their lowest levels in a number of years apart from quarter-ends and were close to some private-sector estimates of where reserve scarcity might appear. Based on a wide range of indicators, and as suggested by the chart, there was no evidence of reserve scarcity on an aggregate basis; indeed, based on the metric shown, rates were little changed on this day.\n\nIt seems highly likely that we are still on the \u201cflat\u201d part of the curve, where rates move little in response to shifts in reserves. However, it is still possible that the decline in reserves might be putting some upward pressure on rates. Even in the \u201cflat\u201d part, the slope of the demand curve, while small, might be nonzero. This could be true if, for example, the balance sheet costs of the marginal borrower in overnight money markets were upward-sloping with respect to that bank\u2019s balance sheet size. I see this as a reasonable possibility, and therefore I think it might be possible that the decline in reserve balances has pushed up overnight rates a bit over time.22 Figure 11 provides some evidence of this dynamic; as the level of reserve balances has declined, the spread between the rate of interest paid on reserves and the volume-weighted average federal funds rate has narrowed. In addition, Figure 9 shows that as average rates in the unsecured markets have increased, trades at lower rates have declined, the whole rate distribution has shifted up toward the IOR rate, and the share of trading above the IOR rate has slightly increased. Figure 9 also reveals that the upward pressure in the federal funds market relative to that in eurodollars is more pronounced. This likely reflects unique dynamics in the federal funds market, rather than an aggregate shortage of reserves. These dynamics include banks taking into account the regulatory impact with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) benefit when borrowing from Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in the federal funds market.23 There is also borrowing by smaller domestic banks at relatively higher federal funds rates to fund loan portfolios; these banks generally have limited access to the eurodollar market or other short-term funding sources.24\n\nFlexibility When Needed: The Technical Adjustment\n\nWhen overnight rates\u2014including rates on federal funds transactions\u2014edge higher, what tools does the Federal Reserve have to ensure that they generally remain within the target range when reserves are abundant? The federal funds target range is an important feature of the FOMC\u2019s public communications, and maintaining control of the federal funds rate and other money market rates is therefore taken quite seriously. Public confidence in our ability to maintain rates within the target range is important for ensuring that expectations for the FOMC\u2019s future policy stance are properly incorporated into the term structure of interest rates, and thereby appropriately affect financial conditions and the broader economy. At the March 2015 joint FOMC Board meeting, it was decided that in a situation of abundant reserves, the Federal Reserve intends to \u201cadjust the IOER rate and the parameters of the ON RRP facility, and use other tools such as term operations, as necessary for appropriate monetary control, based on policymakers' assessments of the efficacy and costs of their tools.\u201d25\n\nEarlier this year, rates paid on the bulk of federal funds trading had ticked up, although they remained within the FOMC\u2019s target range. The uptick in the federal funds rates raised a question as to whether the effective federal funds rate might print above the FOMC\u2019s target range, absent a change in our operational settings.26 To address the rise in the overnight rate within the range, a technical adjustment to the IOR rate was made at the June FOMC meeting: the IOR rate was raised by 20 basis points while the FOMC raised the target range by 25 basis points. Following that change, all rates paid on federal funds borrowings, as well as in other money markets, rose by about 20 basis points. This made it less likely that the EFFR would be above the target range. At the September FOMC meeting, the IOR rate and target range were each increased by 25 basis points, maintaining the five-basis-point spread between the IOR rate and the top of the target range, as shown earlier in Figure 4.\n\nSince the June technical adjustment, rates on federal funds transactions have continued to edge higher in the range, and most recently the EFFR has risen to the IOR rate, or five basis points below the top of the target range.27 It is possible that the EFFR could fluctuate around the IOR rate or exceed the IOR rate. However, I don\u2019t believe that this upward pressure on the EFFR signals that we\u2019ve reached balance sheet normalization or that we are at the \u201csteep\u201d portion of the reserve demand curve, where reserves are scarce. This is supported by the lack of evidence across a range of indicators signaling aggregate reserve scarcity. Let me be clear: Observing the EFFR and other rates above the IOR rate is not a sufficient condition for reserve scarcity.28 In the last few days, even amid upward pressure in overnight funding rates, we still have not seen the range of signs I described earlier that would indicate reserve scarcity, such as significant interbank volumes trading at rates above the IOR rate, increased overdraft activity, shifts in bank payments behavior, or a day-to-day relationship between shifts in the stock of reserves and overnight interest rates. As discussed earlier, the upward pressure in EFFR likely reflects the premium on borrowing from FHLBs in fed funds relative to other funding sources. In addition, it also likely reflects bargaining dynamics among banks with limited access to alternative short-term funding sources. Let me also note that the question of the appropriate longer-run balance sheet size, the point at which the Federal Reserve holds no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, is a related, but distinct policy judgement upon which the FOMC has made no decision as yet.\n\nWe will be monitoring that broad range of indicators to search for evidence that we\u2019re approaching the \u201csteep\u201d slope\u2014and I have confidence that our data and analytics will help us to assess this effectively.29 We have also conducted a new Federal Reserve survey specifically designed to support our efforts to obtain a high-quality estimate of where aggregate reserve scarcity might occur, and the preliminary survey results strongly support my view that reserve scarcity is some way off.30 Finally, I am confident that the Federal Reserve has the effective tools and is prepared to take measures as appropriate to ensure that short-term rates remain well-controlled and efficiently transmit the stance of policy into broader financial markets. For example, another technical adjustment to the IOR rate, as discussed in the May FOMC meeting minutes, could be used to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC's target range.  \n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nI remain highly confident that the FOMC\u2019s framework for the normalization of the stance of monetary policy\u2014both in the overnight market and the balance sheet\u2014will continue to proceed smoothly, without unnecessary surprise, disruption, or volatility in financial markets. The monetary policy implementation framework continues to provide the FOMC with excellent control over overnight money market rates, and has proven to be flexible, including through the technical adjustment, in the face of new developments.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to the panel discussion.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "Good afternoon.  It is a real pleasure for me to be here today at the fifth annual conference on stress testing research.  As many of you know, I spent a considerable portion of my career working on stress testing issues, starting with the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009, through the initial implementation of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and the Dodd-Frank Act (DFAST) stress testing programs, as well as my personal research agenda on the impact of stress testing.  And even now, though my responsibilities have changed, I remain actively engaged in debates and discussion as the CCAR and DFAST programs evolve, and as the details of stress test modeling and design evolve with those programs.\n\nIn fact, I want to make this evolution the focus of my remarks today.  I will begin by briefly reviewing how stress testing emerged as a key supervisory policy tool, and talk about how the original goals of the SCAP, CCAR and DFAST stress tests affected modeling and design choices. I\u2019ll then talk about some of the consequences of those choices \u2013 in particular, what is missing or not well-captured in the current approach.  Finally, I\u2019ll suggest some areas where new research could help push forward the frontier of stress test modeling, both of specific elements that go into the stress test calculation and of the broader impact of the stress testing programs implemented here in the United States and elsewhere.  And of course, I need to note that my remarks today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI believe that stress testing and the CCAR program were the most significant and impactful regulatory and supervisory changes coming out of the global financial crisis.  Why do I feel that way?\n\nTo begin, it helps to remember the prevailing environment that generated the first broad-based supervisory stress tests \u2013 the SCAP \u2013 in early 2009.  It was a period of significant uncertainty \u2013 uncertainty about the stability of funding markets, about losses at individual institutions and about losses in the financial system overall.  There was a growing cottage industry in estimating global and U.S. financial sector losses on mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other positions, with projected global losses ranging as high as $4 Trillion.1  Equity prices had plummeted, especially for banks, with declines running far ahead of falls in regulatory capital ratios.  As of September 2008, the tier 1 capital ratios of the five largest U.S. bank holding companies ranged between 7.5 and 8.9 percent, well above the then-prevailing 4 percent minimum requirement. Many large banks continued to pay dividends well into 2008, even after government support was provided to the banking industry via the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), something noted in the press at the time.2   Some have argued that these continued dividend payments reflected intentional risk-shifting from equity to debt holders,3  though many institutions had stopped making share repurchases months before,4  which does not seem consistent with risk-shifting behavior.  Alternatively, in an environment of considerable uncertainty, banks may have been concerned with the negative market signal that a dividend reduction might send, hesitating to be the first to take this step.\n\nSupervisory stress testing emerged as a policy solution to address both backward-looking regulatory capital ratios and possible first-mover problems facing banks during periods of stress.  By their nature, stress tests are designed to ask \u201cwhat if\u201d in a forward-looking way.  Stress tests aren\u2019t a prediction of future events but rather hypothetical exercises intended to assess the robustness of a bank\u2019s resources against various potential future bad outcomes.  In this way, they provide additional insight into the true degree of capital adequacy inherent in a bank\u2019s current capital position and the risks embedded in its balance sheet, including its ability to continue to make capital distributions in both baseline and stressed economic conditions.\n\nFurther, by requiring banks to raise additional capital if their stressed capital ratios fell below target levels, the SCAP addressed potential first-mover problems associated with banks having to individually decide to address capital shortfalls \u2013 though there was considerable concern at the time about how market participants and bank counterparties would view public supervisory assessments indicating that certain banks needed to raise additional capital.  In fact, all but one of the banks required to raise new capital were able to do so, some of them in amounts greater than the SCAP requirements, suggesting that the SCAP created a \u201csafe\u201d environment for banks to enhance their capital positions. Following the SCAP, the CCAR program embedded supervisory stress test results into a broader assessment of a bank\u2019s internal capital planning, providing supervisors both the empirical tools and the regulatory authority to limit distributions in the face of deteriorating economic and financial market conditions.\n\nAfter many years of SCAP and CCAR stress tests, the empirical approach embedded in the calculations might feel pre-ordained, but in fact there were many design choices made along the way.  These include the focus on regulatory capital ratios, the horizon of the stress test and the calculation of the maximum impact of the stress test within this horizon.  It\u2019s helpful to review these design choices in light of the goals of the supervisory stress testing regime and to highlight which banking sector vulnerabilities are well addressed, and not so well addressed, by the tests.  In reviewing the design choices, it\u2019s also helpful to distinguish between choices about what the SCAP, CCAR and DFAST stress tests were designed to capture and how the models measure key elements of the stress test calculations. \n\nThe first and most significant design choice involved what the tests would measure:  the SCAP and subsequent U.S. supervisory stress tests measure the impact of the stress scenario on regulatory capital ratios.  Other choices were possible, of course.  The tests could have focused on modeling the market value of assets or equity (similar to the Capital Shortfall approach developed by Acharya et al.5  , or attempted to measure the value or cost of debt, or the impact on credit ratings.  But regulatory capital ratios were a natural choice, allowing the output of the stress testing exercise to map into the broader regulatory capital regime while addressing the slow adjustment of those ratios during downturns.\n\nThe focus on regulatory capital ratios resulted in a cascade of additional design choices.  To begin, since regulatory capital ratios are based on accounting definitions of earnings and capital, estimating net income and its flow through to regulatory capital became the focus of the stress test calculations. This stands in contrast to approaches that concentrate solely on projecting losses, which were the focus of much of the public discussion prior to the release of the SCAP results. In practical terms, the net income approach involves recognizing that banks will have non-credit-related expenses and earn revenues even during periods of stress.  Modeling so-called pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) was one of the innovations introduced in the SCAP and represented one of the key challenges in that exercise \u2013 and, I will argue, is a continuing challenge today.\n\nGiven the choice to model net income and regulatory capital ratios, another set of design choices concerns the horizon over which net income is calculated and how cumulative changes in net income over this horizon are incorporated into regulatory capital ratios.  The SCAP assumed a two-year forward horizon, while the subsequent CCAR and DFAST stress tests have assumed a 9-quarter forward horizon.6    Other supervisory stress test regimes have made different assumptions \u2013 for instance, the European stress tests use a three-year forward horizon.7    An alternative choice would be to project losses and income over the full lifetime of a bank\u2019s loans and other assets.  Estimating lifetime losses on particular fixed portfolios of loans and securities was arguably the prevalent approach during the financial crisis period.8    But in a stress testing context, the lifetime loss approach presents practical difficulties given the varying maturities of different types of assets, as well as the greater uncertainty inherent in more distant future points.  At the time of the SCAP, we judged that a two-year horizon was long enough to capture significant losses while remaining within what could reasonably be projected conditional on the macroeconomic scenario.9 \n\nClosely related to the scenario horizon question is how cumulative losses and revenues are incorporated to calculate post-stress capital ratios.  The DFAST and CCAR stress tests adopt a \u201cwalk-through-time\u201d approach, in which net income and capital ratios are calculated on a quarter-by-quarter basis throughout the stress test horizon.10    An alternative approach would be to apply cumulative losses and revenues in a single, instantaneous shock \u2013 this was what was done in the SCAP.  While the two approaches might be assumed to produce roughly consistent results, the walk-through-time approach may better capture true vulnerabilities, especially in cases where negative net income quarters come early in the stress test horizon but revenues accrue most strongly in subsequent quarters.  The instantaneous shock approach implicitly recognizes revenues from later in the horizon as offsets to losses that occur early in the horizon and thus may overstate true capital resources. The tradeoff is that the walk-through-time approach implies a degree of precision about the quarter-by-quarter pattern of losses and revenues that might be beyond the capabilities of existing modeling technology (this was the judgment at the time of the SCAP).\n\nBut the walk-through-time approach requires further assumptions, particularly regarding the evolution of the balance sheet.  These assumptions range from how to capture maturing loans and securities; what to assume about prepayments; what new lending occurs over the horizon (including replacement of maturing or prepaid positions); and whether to assume that the bank is actively managing its exposures by additional hedging, changes in the credit composition of its portfolios, or restriction of credit supply. \n\nAlthough some of the implementation details differ, the SCAP and DFAST/CCAR supervisory stress tests made broadly similar assumptions on these issues.  The guiding assumption is that a bank\u2019s balance sheet and the nature of its exposures do not change over the stress test horizon.  The supervisory estimates do not embed behavioral responses to the stress scenario, including additional risk mitigation or changes in business strategy.11    Further, maturing positions are assumed to be replaced on a like-for-like basis, maintaining the overall credit characteristics of the starting-date portfolios.12    Importantly, banks are assumed to maintain credit supply even as economic conditions in the hypothetical scenario deteriorate.  This is a policy judgment reflecting the objectives of the supervisory stress test regime.13    The implication of these choices is that the stress test results are conditional not just on the stress scenario but also on the policy choices embedded in the exercise, rather than being an historically unbiased projection of banks\u2019 behavior under stressed economic and financial market conditions.\n\nThese assumptions have been implemented in different ways in different supervisory stress test exercises:  in SCAP, the balance sheet was assumed to be fixed over the stress test horizon; in the recent DFAST and CCAR stress tests, supervisory models have been used (these models actually tend to result in growth in the balance sheet over the stress test horizon)14  ; and in the currently proposed Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) approach, the balance sheet would once again be held fixed.\n\nMy discussion thus far has focused on what the stress tests measure. But there is a second set of design choices about how the stress scenario impacts will be modeled.  To begin, capital ratios are measured separately for individual institutions, with no attempt to capture dynamic interactions, spillovers or specific cross-firm exposures. Similarly, outcomes for the banking sector do not interact dynamically with the macroeconomic scenarios, which are inputs to the calculations. As a result, the calculations are \u201cstand alone\u201d in the sense that the outcomes for any individual institution are independent of those for others in the set of stress-tested firms.  Results for the banking system are therefore simply the sum of results for individual institutions, rather than capturing interactions among them.\n\nThe stand-alone approach reflects the microprudential objectives of the various U.S. supervisory stress test programs, along with practical considerations.  While the SCAP and CCAR/DFAST stress tests programs have strong macroprudential elements15  , in each case the results have also been used to make firm-specific supervisory judgments about capital adequacy.  This individual firm application pushes towards measurement approaches that capture more detailed, firm-specific characteristics. At the same time, fully dynamic models that capture interactions and exposures among firms or that build in feedback from banking sector outcomes to the macroeconomic scenario can be informationally demanding, computationally intensive and, at the stage of model development prevailing during the SCAP and early phases of the CCAR/DFAST regime, generally would have involved higher level, \u201cindustry average\u201d assumptions about the performance of banks under the hypothetical stressed conditions.  Thus, the stand alone approach was in many ways the only practical choice at the time the initial supervisory stress tests were conducted.\n\nA final set of design choices affecting how stressed capital ratios are measured involves the actual models that produce the estimates of net income and capital.  The models used in the CCAR and DFAST supervisory stress tests are developed and implemented by supervisors \u2013 they are almost entirely independent of stress test models used by banks.  This is something that has evolved over time. The SCAP results were based on a variety of sources, including projections made by the banks, simple supervisory models, and historical data on bank performance. The blending of sources reflected that the SCAP was the first broad-based supervisory stress testing program, conducted in a crisis environment, with significant learning along the way.  \n\nOver time, supervisory estimates have become increasingly independent from the projections made by banks.  Supervisors and economists in the Federal Reserve System have developed models to capture the impact of the stress scenarios on various elements of net income, including different categories of loans and securities, interest and non-interest income, non-credit expenses and balance sheet evolution, as well as the flow through of net income to regulatory capital. This was a policy choice intended to provide consistency of treatment across banks involved in the stress tests and to counteract any incentives banks might have to understate the impact of the stress scenario.  Bank-specific elements \u2013 which, as noted above, are critical to the microprudential policy objectives of the CCAR and DFAST programs \u2013 are introduced by using detailed data provided by each participating institution.  Thus, results for individual banks vary based on the characteristics of their balance sheet and business focus, but not due to differences in the way particular net income or capital elements are modeled.\n\nOther choices are possible, of course, principally the choice to make greater use of bank-generated stress test results as a way of capturing institution-specific factors, as is done in supervisory stress testing programs in some other jurisdictions.  The European stress tests, for instance, are based on estimates made by the participating banks, subject to a variety of constraints on modeling assumptions and detailed review by supervisors.16 \n\nWhat I hope you take away from this review of the what and the how of stress testing is that the SCAP, CCAR and DFAST programs have involved a series of inter-connected design choices, most of which were intended to address the objectives of the stress test exercises, but none of which were inevitable or pre-ordained.  Collectively, these design choices have implications for what the stress tests capture, as well as what they miss. I want to share a few thoughts about the latter before turning to some suggestions for how additional research could help.\n\nThe most obvious place to start discussion of \u201cwhat\u2019s missing?\u201d is to note that the SCAP, CCAR and DFAST programs are by design capital stress tests and do not directly assess other areas of institutional or financial sector vulnerability, such as liquidity, funding or firesale risks.  The current supervisory stress testing regime does address these risks indirectly, to the extent that a banking sector with more robust capitalization is less likely to experience liquidity stresses, runs and the resulting firesales.  And, through the Federal Reserve\u2019s Supervisory Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR) program, large complex banking companies are subject to separate supervisory stress testing of their liquidity resources. But the current regime does not explicitly integrate capital and liquidity stress testing at the firm level, nor does it attempt to assess the probability or impact of a firesale of banking sector assets.  Nor, given the focus on capital, does the regime address firm-specific or systemic issues related to resolution, when the shock to capital is large enough that the bank can no longer survive. \n\nIn large part, the focus on individual institutions \u2013 the \u201cstand-alone\u201d design choice \u2013 accounts for this outcome.  As already noted, the CCAR/DFAST stress tests do not incorporate cross-bank exposures in a dynamic way, nor is there feedback between the outcomes for the banking sector and the macroeconomic scenario.  A stress testing regime that incorporated these feedbacks, including the potential for liquidity pressures, bank runs, and firesale risk, would be considerably more complex to implement, and would likely involve a greater degree of abstraction and simplification \u2013 and thus less \u201cprecision\u201d \u2013 than the current supervisory capital stress tests. \n\nIn that regard, the drive for precision and accuracy at the individual institution level \u2013 and the resulting complexity of the supervisory models and extensive firm-specific data inputs needed to run the models \u2013 has created other challenges.  Perhaps the most notable of these is that generating the supervisory projections is resource- and time-intensive, which limits the number of scenarios that can be assessed during any particular CCAR cycle.  Some have suggested that stress testing would be more effective if many supervisory scenarios were examined, instead of just a few.  Any individual scenario could miss important risk exposures at individual banks or in the sector as a whole.  Turning that thought around, a single scenario might not uncover true capital vulnerabilities at all institutions.  The bank-generated scenarios that are part of the CCAR program are certainly an important channel to address concerns about idiosyncratic risk, as banks are meant to self-identify the scenarios that would be especially stressful for them.  But running multiple common supervisory scenarios could provide a more robust assessment of the capital strength of the broader banking industry, at least as represented by the firms taking part in the CCAR and DFAST programs.\n\nHow can research help address these issues and, more generally, improve the overall supervisory stress testing regime?  I want to suggest two general areas of research \u2013 one tactical and the other much bigger picture and strategic. \n\nThe tactical area is research that helps improve supervisory models.  First, developing additional ways of projecting revenues and non-credit expenses in stressed environments is a particularly ripe area for additional work, in my view.  As I noted, an important innovation in the SCAP was the recognition that a comprehensive stress test focused on net income needed to incorporate projections of interest and non-interest income and non-interest expense.  While a number of models already existed for making such projections \u2013 for instance, those used by banks in their budgeting and planning processes \u2013 these were nearly all calibrated to produce projections assuming business as usual conditions, rather than the stressed environment assumed in the SCAP.  The SCAP PPNR projections were thus based on stylized supervisory models that used available historical data on bank performance during recessions.  Since then, the supervisory PPNR models have become considerably more sophisticated, but at their heart, they continue to rely on historical outcomes for revenues and expenses, rather than fully incorporating the fundamental drivers of those outcomes at the business line level.  Additional research and data collection on these fundamental drivers and their performance under stress could make the PPNR projections more robust to changing business strategies and focus.\n\nA second tactical research area concerns measuring model risk.  To begin, how do we assess errors from models intended to capture performance under stressed conditions when those conditions have not yet been realized and might not be in the historical data?  How can we assess the uncertainty or margin of error around loss and revenue projections derived from models that can be quite complex, often involving multiple estimation steps?  Further, since the final stress test calculations are derived from the combination of projections from many different (often multi-step) models, how do we assess the error around the ultimate calculation of stressed capital ratios?  How do we measure correlation in model errors in a tractable and practical way?  How much model risk owes to the decision to develop complex models for many individual pieces of the net income and regulatory capital ratio calculations instead of using simpler, \u201ctop down\u201d estimation approaches?\n\nA final tactical research area involves this last point \u2013 the role of simpler, easier to estimate models of net income and its key components.  Federal Reserve modeling teams have already developed a set of these \u201cbenchmark\u201d models that produce loss and revenue estimates as a comparison to the projections from the more sophisticated and complex production models.  Creating more of these models \u2013 including multiple benchmarks for an individual loss, expense or revenue component, benchmarks that cover the full range of detailed net income elements, and benchmarks at higher levels of aggregation \u2013 would enable more robust assessments of supervisory results both across institutions and over time.  Further, growing deviations between benchmark and production projections could highlight emerging (or declining) areas of risk.  In this regard, a related area of research could address optimal ways for supervisory to assess the signal when benchmark and production model results deviate significantly from one another. Finally, these simpler models could potentially form the basis of a more dynamic, system-focused stress test analysis that builds in the linkages and feedbacks not currently captured in the CCAR and DFAST stress testing programs. \n\nThis is a short list of what I see as some important tactical issues in supervisory stress test modeling.  But I also want to highlight some bigger picture issues where additional research could help guide the evolution of the supervisory stress testing regime.  Recall that I framed my discussion by arguing that supervisory stress testing emerged from the experience of the financial crisis to address both the backward-looking nature of regulatory capital requirements and potential first-mover problems that an individual bank might face in cutting dividends or raising new capital during periods of emerging stress.  If that\u2019s the case, how well has the stress testing regime, as incorporated into the SCAP and now the CCAR and proposed Stressed Capital Buffer approaches, addressed these problems?  Is the approach working?  Does it stand up?\n\nIt is easy to see that banks have more regulatory capital now than before the financial crisis.  There is a growing body of literature that examines the impact of stress testing and other changes to regulatory capital requirements (Basel 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0) on lending to various categories of borrowers.  This is an important area of research, but in my view, it is somewhat incomplete in its focus.  To begin, studies that focus on lending by banks participating in the CCAR/DFAST stress tests ignore the possibility of substitution of this activity to non-stress-tested banks or to non-banks.  This substitution effect could have significant consequences for both current economic activity and for systemic risk, channels that are important to understand in assessing the full impact of the programs.  Some studies have looked more broadly at these substitution effects, but more work here \u2013 especially substitution into the non-bank sector \u2013 would be very helpful.\n\nFurther, examining how lending has been impacted in the current economic environment of strong economic activity does not quite provide the full picture, as it does not address whether these programs will be successful in mitigating spillovers, credit contractions and other negative outcomes during periods of stress.  In assessing the costs and benefits of stress testing and other post-crisis regulations, it seems critical to assess not just current impact but outcomes over the cycle \u2013 something that is a challenge during a period of recovery and growth.  \n\nA related set of questions concerns how stress testing affects the cyclicality of capital requirements and what degree of cyclicality is appropriate.  The Basel countercyclical capital buffer is the primary supervisory tool to implement regulatory capital requirements that vary over the credit cycle, but stress testing has cyclical elements as well.  Both stress scenario design and the starting condition of banks\u2019 balance sheets \u2013 the credit characteristics of the loan and securities portfolios, the extent of currently non-performing loans, exposures from trading and counterparty positions \u2013 can result in differences in stress test severity over the cycle.  What is the optimal degree of cyclicality for the stress testing regime? How does cyclicality of stress testing interact with other cyclical elements, such as the countercyclical capital buffer and the incoming current expected credit loss (CECL) approach to loan loss provisioning?  How should the piece fit together?\n\nFinally, one concern that has been raised about the Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to stress testing and integration into the CCAR program is that of \u201cmodel monoculture\u201d \u2013 the idea that banks will be incented to develop models that mimic the Fed\u2019s models rather than developing their own independent approaches.17    Significant commonality in modeling approaches in the banking system could result in banks adopting similar risk exposures and hedging techniques, exposing the sector to additional systemic risk and potential future instability. How do we measure this risk?  What should we think about differences (and similarities) between bank-generated and supervisory stress test results, both for a particular stress test cycle and over time?  What disclosure and transparency policies about supervisory models can address these concerns, while still supporting insight and credibility into the DFAST and CCAR stress testing programs?\n\nThese are big questions to which I do not have answers.  But they are the questions that challenge policymakers as the regulatory and supervisory regime put in place following the crisis is re-examined and, appropriately, evolves in the wake of that re-examination.  A disciplined analytical approach to these topics is critical in weighing future design choices, such as those made during the initial implementation of SCAP, CCAR and DFAST stress testing.  Research on these topics could make substantial and meaningful contributions.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to talk about these issues and hope that my discussion spurs some ideas and new research.  Thank you."

    "speaker": "Kevin J. Stiroh",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/sti181004",
    "content": "Good morning.  Thank you for the kind introduction, and for the invitation to speak at today\u2019s forum.1\n\nWe are all here today to talk about conduct and culture in the financial services sector, so I\u2019m confident that you will agree that we have moved beyond the questions about \u201cif\u201d this an important issue and statements about \u201cwhy\u201d it is important.  Rather, the focus is \u201chow\u201d the financial industry\u2014both financial firms and the official sector\u2014can continue to make progress in improving culture and reducing misconduct risk.\n\nThe New York Fed, under the leadership of former President Bill Dudley and current President John Williams, has been a strong advocate for reform of culture in the financial industry.  Today, I\u2019d like to offer some thoughts about the progress made to date and some of the challenges that remain.  These challenges reflect, in large part, the complexity of the problem.\n\nPlease note that my comments today are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI\u2019ll begin by observing that the issue of conduct and culture reform in the financial services industry is a \u201ccomplex\u201d problem and not simply a \u201ccomplicated\u201d one.  Complicated problems have clear and relatively stable cause-and-effect patterns so that outcomes are largely predictable with the appropriate expertise and analysis.  By contrast, complex problems are typically marked by interconnectedness of a large number of factors, constant evolution, feedback loops, \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d, and unpredictable outcomes.2   Culture reform is that type of problem. \n\nA firm\u2019s culture can be defined as the shared set of norms that influences decision-making and is evidenced through behavior.  Now consider a global systemically important bank with trillions of dollars of assets; with operations that span diverse business lines, customers, counterparties, investors and regulators across multiple jurisdictions; and that competes in a global industry against similar firms.  Add in tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of employees with a wide range of motivations and goals who interact in varied but interconnected operating environments with different regional, corporate and individual values, incentives, regulations, and laws, and the inherent complexity becomes clear. \n\nThis complexity makes it virtually impossible to fully comprehend the drivers of culture or predict its behavioral consequences.  An implication is the need for a long-term, sustained commitment to addressing conduct and culture reform using a wide range of tools that are suitable for a complex problem.\n\nIn the ten years that followed the financial crisis, we have continued to see a stream of misconduct scandals and cultural failures, and a corresponding increase in significant litigation and enforcement activity, with costs estimated at an aggregate of $320 billion worldwide.3  \n\nAt the New York Fed, our work in advocating culture and behavior reform in the financial sector started in late 2013 when our former President, Bill Dudley, delivered a speech on the \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d problem.  In that speech, he argued that \u201cthere is evidence of deep-seated culture and ethical failures at many financial institutions.\u201d4   More recently, our current President John Williams concluded that \u201cwe have not yet fully addressed the root causes of many of the problems that have plagued the financial sector\u201d and that there was still a \u201csense of urgency in addressing banking culture.\u201d5\n\nOver the past five years, the New York Fed has focused on shining a spotlight on culture, behavior and conduct concerns, and pushed the industry to address these issues through a range of activities:\n\nOur white paper also summarizes work of supervisors from multiple jurisdictions around the world who are increasingly focused on the risks posed by poor culture and misconduct, and have developed a broad assortment of new tools and practices for identifying and supervising for misconduct risk.  International efforts range from the creation of specialized units of behavioral risk experts to risk culture assessment frameworks to supervisory guidance that directs supervised institutions to develop and promote a sound corporate culture.\n\nI view this variation in approach as a feature and not a bug of the official sector focus on culture reform.  There is rarely a single solution to a complex problem with many interdependencies and deep uncertainty.  Rather, the official sector must experiment and innovate; probe and adapt; and try new approaches to foster a healthy culture that promotes appropriate conduct.\n\nOne common thread of the recent innovations, however, is that supervisors can provide a horizontal perspective on culture reform that reflects broad social goals in a way that the private sector cannot.  To be clear, it is not the supervisors\u2019 job to dictate the internal culture of a firm, but when there are market failures such as externalities or information asymmetries, then there is a role for the official sector to push firms to do more to address these issues and mitigate misconduct risk.\n\nWe should be cautious, however, about our ability to influence precisely and predictably.  Public health studies, for example, document \u201cpolicy resistance\u201d where interventions are defeated by the system\u2019s response to an intervention.8   As an example, a rules-based regime that focuses on reducing conduct risk by prescriptive regulatory fiat runs the risks of creating a \u201ccheck-the-box culture\u201d where everything not explicitly banned is considered acceptable behavior.  This has the potential to facilitate exactly the wrong type of culture, conduct and risk-taking.9\n\nWhile I have spoken so far about work by the official sector, progress has also been made over the past few years by the industry in terms of senior management focus and commitment to culture reform.  Some firms have created Board-level committees looking at culture, others have introduced behavioral risk into their audit programs, and still others have developed dashboards with a range of quantitative and qualitative factors to track their efforts and outcomes.  Progress has been uneven, however, and there is still more to do.  Let me identify several areas where I think additional work is needed\u2014assessment, technology, and influence.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, measuring and assessing progress is not straightforward.  Assessment of culture and the factors needed to change it are difficult, but this should not deter us.  Managers, investors, and the official sector all want to know what is changing and whether misconduct risk has been mitigated.  The question then is, how will we really know whether change is happening and whether progress is sustainable?\n\nI don\u2019t believe that there is a \u201csilver bullet\u201d for assessing culture change\u2014no single solution, approach, or template will work for every firm in every circumstance.  That said, standardized metrics will help in assessing changes over time and across firms.  The UK Banking Standards Board (BSB), for example, provides one lens on assessing culture change for a broad cross-section of financial service firms operating in the U.K.10   I believe diagnostic tools like this are an important part of the cultural assessment toolkit.\n\nMoreover, firms and the official sector need to evaluate a wide range of behaviors, signals, and outcomes to draw the most robust conclusions about the depth and pace of culture reform.  I think it is critical for both firms and the official sector to continue to experiment with new approaches to assessing culture change, to collect and build new forms of data and measurement, to develop qualitative assessments to complement quantitative ones, to use new techniques and technology to understand how a firm\u2019s culture and conduct are changing, and to continue adapting and course correcting to a sustainable business strategy as the operating environment evolves. \n\nFostering productive behavioral change is at the heart of culture reform.  Behavior, in turn, is driven by a multifaceted set of factors including incentives, cues from peers, observations about leaders, and formal policies and procedures.  Most of us are not experts in human behavior, so I believe we should be open to incorporating lessons from behavioral economics and other social sciences into programs to mitigate conduct risk and promote cultural change.\n\nThis type of human behavior is at the core of the complexity of culture reform.  Lessons from the field have increased understanding of where decision-making can depart from economic expectations.  Sometimes, these lessons have been used to create circumstances and environments that positively influence individual outcomes by \u201cnudging\u201d individuals to better choices.11   These nudges, in turn, help reinforce acceptable behavioral norms, and ultimately a firm\u2019s culture.  How can we nudge in order to reduce misconduct risk?  More broadly, how can the financial services sector, including firms and supervisors, leverage insights from the social sciences to promote environments that foster healthy group behavioral patterns with better decision-making? \n\nThe promise of new technology and big data for financial institutions is everywhere we look.  From artificial intelligence to machine learning to natural language processing, there seems to be unlimited potential for more efficient operations, better analytics and more accurate predictions, and more personalized product development. But, how will advances in technology, particularly the adoption of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, influence the behavioral risks associated with human decision-making?  And how does technology introduce new risks that prompt a rethinking of responsibility and customer relationships\u2014especially with regard to privacy and information security?\n\nMoreover, the disruptive potential of innovation is likely to exacerbate an already complex environment as decision-making becomes more opaque and new roles and responsibilities are introduced.  For example, what will effective governance and risk management look like?  Do artificial intelligence and machine learning introduce new model risk?  Or operational risk?  Or conduct risk?  What does it mean to supervise or regulate conduct if decisions are made by self-learning algorithms?  More broadly, what culture and conduct risk will be embedded in technology-driven financial services in the future?  These are hard questions for financial firms and for the official sector, and our approach to the reform of financial industry culture will need to address them.\n\nTo return to the beginning of this discussion, culture reform in finance is a complex problem.  Causal relationships are difficult to isolate, linkages are constantly changing, and accurate prediction is impossible.  That does not mean that we are powerless, or that we should accept complexity as an excuse for not trying to foster change.  Rather, we need a long-term commitment that brings the appropriate tools and approaches to bear.  The costs and potential consequences of market failures associated with misconduct risk and culture suggests that it is vitally important that we do so. \n\nBoth financial firms and the official sector should focus attention on investigating and asking questions to better understand the underlying drivers, motivations and risks behind the behaviors of individuals and groups.  We should ensure that we look at behaviors and outcomes from multiple perspectives, so we can gain a more robust understanding of the operating environment as a whole.  No single perspective is likely to provide all of the insights.  Experimentation and iteration, use of narrative and story-telling, and innovative methods for harnessing diversity of perspective are thought to be effective ways of tackling complex problems and we all need to innovate, adapt and seek new approaches.12\n\nI think this focus on conduct and culture is entirely consistent with a traditional supervisory focus on resilience, both for individual firms and the financial system as whole.  This can be resilience of a firm\u2019s balance sheet in response to financial risk or an unexpected loss that depletes a firm\u2019s equity capital or resilience of a firm\u2019s culture in response to conduct risk or an unexpected fraud that depletes its cultural capital.13 In all of these cases, a resilient firm will be better able to adapt and evolve in order to continue to function and provide the critical financial services necessary to support a growing and stable economy. \n\nThank you."

    "date": "Aug 3, 2018",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/pot180803",
    "content": "Thank you for the invitation to participate in today\u2019s discussion about globalization and its effect on monetary policy in emerging market economies.1\n\nU.S. financial markets, and the U.S. monetary policy stance, can significantly influence global financial conditions and capital flows.2 In no small part, this reflects the extensive use of the dollar in international trade and in financial transactions conducted outside the United States. The pricing and availability of financing for business activity around the world\u2014even activity that does not directly relate to an American borrower, lender, producer, or consumer\u2014often are influenced by conditions in U.S.-dollar money markets. And, understandably, the evolution and stability of dollar funding markets are a focus of attention for many economic policymakers around the world, especially here in the East Asia-Pacific region. As always, the views I will express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMy remarks today will focus on the implementation of monetary policy normalization in the United States and its contribution toward maintaining stability in U.S.-dollar money markets. I will start by reviewing progress on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\u2019s program to normalize the stance of monetary policy. The FOMC has carefully laid out a clear and transparent normalization strategy and is implementing that strategy, and I believe that the confidence engendered by this clarity and transparency has been of great importance in maintaining market stability, both in the United States and globally. Experience so far has shown that the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy implementation framework has continued to provide appropriate control over the federal funds rate, even as the FOMC has moved to reduce the size of the balance sheet gradually and predictably. This stability has supported the orderly functioning of the broader set of dollar money market rates that are important to financial conditions in the United States and around the world.\n\nThen, I will discuss the recent technical adjustment to the rate of interest paid on reserves (IOR). The Federal Reserve made the adjustment to provide greater comfort that the effective federal funds rate would remain within the target range set by the FOMC.3 I will discuss how this adjustment has had exactly the intended effect on money market conditions, and how it has reinforced my certainty that the Federal Reserve is well positioned to maintain the public\u2019s high confidence in its ability to appropriately control overnight interest rates over the period of normalization.\n\nI will then conclude with some comments on recent developments in broader money market rates, in particular U.S.-dollar LIBOR. U.S. term money market rates are of global significance, owing to the heavy use of the dollar outside the United States and the large stock of dollar-LIBOR-linked debt issued abroad.4 The spread of LIBOR to overnight indexed swaps has fluctuated in recent years, along with similar term unsecured dollar borrowing rates, driven in part by the same factors influencing overnight rates but also by specific past regulatory and legislative changes that have impacted flows in term markets. Evidence, such as from the FX swaps market, suggests that dollar borrowing markets continue to function well.\n\nPolicy Normalization Continues As Expected\n\nI\u2019d like to start by taking stock of where we are with the normalization of monetary policy in the United States. The Federal Reserve entered this tightening cycle with its overnight policy rate at the zero lower bound and with a large portfolio of long-duration securities. Normalization, therefore, has two parts: increasing the overnight rate, and reducing securities holdings to a smaller size. The FOMC began raising the overnight rate from zero in late 2015, and it began reducing the size of the portfolio late last year.\n\nFirst: overnight rates. Due to the large supply of reserves that has accompanied the Federal Reserve\u2019s expanded balance sheet, we are employing a new and innovative framework to control money market rates.5 Before the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve followed a well-worn playbook for monetary policy implementation that was based on keeping reserve balances scarce. Nowadays, however, reserves are no longer scarce. Our current framework relies, instead, on providing the market with two overnight investment opportunities to help steer money market rates: interest on reserves (IOR), which is the Federal Reserve\u2019s main tool to control interest rates, and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, a secondary tool.\n\nThe current framework is simple and efficient to operate. In contrast, in the pre-crisis regime, hitting the target federal funds rate each day was a technically challenging exercise.6 We also have now had more than two and a half years to observe the performance of this framework, and it has proven to be extremely effective at controlling federal funds rates. As shown in Figure 1, it has maintained the effective federal funds rate within the FOMC\u2019s target range on all but one day over the entire period.7 Looking at the distribution of traded rates within both the federal funds and overnight bank funding markets, as shown in Figure 2, it is also clear that the framework has broadly fostered trading at rates within the target range. Indeed, the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the rate distribution has consistently remained very tight over the course of normalization.8\n\nOf course, monetary control does not stop at the federal funds market: our framework must ensure that the stance of monetary policy is passed through into other money markets. It has also been very successful in this sense. Figure 3 shows a broad selection of secured and unsecured overnight money market rates; it is clear that increases in the target range for the federal funds rate have passed through fully and immediately to the other rates, as expected and intended. Moreover, I have been very encouraged by the relative stability and high degree of co-movement among short-maturity money market rates.\n\nAnd second: the balance sheet.9 The Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet grew markedly earlier this decade as a result of large-scale asset purchase programs, which were undertaken to support the economic recovery by easing financial conditions to a greater extent than could be achieved solely through reducing the federal funds rate. For many years, the FOMC has indicated its intention that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it will hold primarily Treasury securities.10 Starting late last year, the Federal Reserve began a program to reduce its securities holdings by reinvesting principal maturities only to the extent that they exceed gradually increasing caps.11 This gradual and predictable approach is intended to reduce the balance sheet\u2019s size at an appropriate pace while supporting good market functioning and mitigating the risk of sharp or outsized asset price reactions. \n\nThe charts in Figure 4 show the evolution of the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities portfolio. Up to the present, the full length of the bars show the actual amounts of Treasury securities and agency debt and MBS principal that matured or paid down early. Only the amounts above the cap were reinvested. As can be seen, we have delivered a gradual and predictable reduction in the size of the balance sheet. This has been accomplished without any evidence of market disruption or volatile price movements; it has been, as former Chair Janet Yellen once said, like \u201cwatching paint dry.\u201d12\n\nThe charts in Figure 4 also show the projected progression of the portfolio for the rest of the year. Runoff from the balance sheet increases over the projection horizon, as the caps attain their terminal value later this year. As had been expected at the start of the program, principal repayments from our agency MBS portfolio are projected to eventually start coming in below the level of the caps. Based on current projections, principal payments on the Federal Reserve\u2019s holdings of agency MBS would likely be lower than the monthly cap on redemptions that will be in effect beginning in the fall of this year. Consistent with the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, when this occurs in a given month, no reinvestment occurs, and the portfolio size declines by the amount of principal repayment. It is important to remember that mortgage principal repayments are uncertain; are sensitive to various factors, particularly long-term interest rates; and could conceivably rise above the level of the cap in the future, particularly if interest rates were to decline. If this were to occur, those amounts above the cap would be reinvested. The cap-based program to normalize the balance sheet was designed at the start to operate exactly in this way: it is the mechanism by which the decline in the balance sheet is kept to a gradual and predictable pace. I expect that the Desk will conduct operational readiness exercises during periods of no reinvestment to ensure it remains prepared to reinvest if needed.13\n\nFlexibility When Needed: The Technical Adjustment\n\nAll of this news is encouraging, and it confirms the efficacy of the FOMC\u2019s plan to normalize the stance of policy. I\u2019d like to turn back to overnight rates for a moment, to speak about the recent technical adjustment to the IOR rate and try to answer a few questions that have emerged.\n\nAlthough they remained within the FOMC\u2019s target range, rates paid on the bulk of federal funds trading had ticked up, as can be seen in Figure 5. By April 2018, the effective federal funds rate was five basis points below the top of the range. This rise raised a question as to whether the effective federal funds rate might print above the top of the FOMC\u2019s target range, absent a change in our operational settings.\n\nThe target range is an important feature of the FOMC\u2019s public communications, and maintaining federal funds rates within it is therefore taken quite seriously. Public confidence in our ability to maintain rates within the target range is important for ensuring that expectations for the FOMC\u2019s future policy stance are properly incorporated into the term structure of interest rates, and thereby appropriately affect financial conditions and the broader economy.\n\nTo address the rise, the Federal Reserve made a technical adjustment to the IOR rate at the June FOMC meeting, raising it by 20 basis points while increasing the target range by 25 basis points.14 The technical adjustment worked exactly as we expected. As you can see back in Figure 2, all rates paid on federal funds borrowings, as well as in other money markets, rose by about 20 basis points. This made it less likely that the effective federal funds rate would be above the top of the target range.\n\nLet\u2019s spend a few minutes exploring what drivers might have been most significant in bringing about the rise in money market rates relative to IOR.15 Leading into the technical adjustment, a shift in flows in the Treasury market had the effect of pushing both Treasury bill yields and repo rates higher in February and March. Figure 6 shows cumulative net Treasury bill issuance since the beginning of last year, as well as projections through the third quarter of this year as reported by a private-sector forecaster. The substantial run-up in net bill issuance over the past few quarters, along with other factors, contributed to notable growth in securities dealers\u2019 inventory of Treasury securities, shown in Figure 7\u2014inventories that likely required financing in the repo market. Before these developments, Treasury bill yields and repo rates had been well below federal funds rates. The increases created an attractive alternative investment opportunity for federal funds lenders, including the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which make up about 95 percent of current overnight lending in the federal funds market. Figure 8 shows that as repo rates rose relative to federal funds rates, volumes of FHLB lending in the repo market increased as some of the FHLB activity shifted into this market. As federal funds borrowers competed for this reduced pool of funds, rates rose.\n\nYou may notice on Figure 1 that the federal funds rate had been rising within the range well before these recent shifts in Treasury market flows. This gradual and slow rise coincided with the ongoing decline in reserve balances that is a part of balance sheet normalization, which has raised the question of whether the decline in reserves might be putting upward pressure on overnight rates.\n\nIn the academic literature on monetary policy implementation, models for the behavior of the overnight interbank rate generally boil down to its relationship with the stock of bank reserves.16 These models generally find that as reserve balances decline, the overnight interest rate goes up, but not uniformly. At high levels of reserves, the responsiveness of rates to changes in reserve levels is fairly low, and the demand curve is said to be \u201cflat.\u201d As excess reserve levels decline, the responsiveness of rates increases. At low levels of excess reserves, the overnight rate responds sharply to small adjustments in the level of reserves: the demand curve is \u201csteep.\u201d\n\nIt seems highly likely that we are on the \u201cflat\u201d part of the curve, the part where rates move little in response to shifts in reserves. But this does not quite answer the question on whether the decline in reserves might be putting perhaps some upward pressure on rates. Even in the \u201cflat\u201d part, the slope of the demand curve, while small, might be nonzero. This could be true if, for example, the balance sheet costs of the marginal borrower in overnight money markets were upward sloping with respect to that bank\u2019s balance sheet size. I see this as a reasonable possibility, and therefore I think it might be possible that the decline in reserve balances has pushed up overnight rates a bit over time.17\n\nAt this point, I see no evidence that we are at, or close to, the \u201csteep\u201d portion of the demand curve.18 Let\u2019s run through some places where evidence of such a possibility might be found. To begin with, if we were closing in on the \u201csteep\u201d part, I might have expected to see more above-IOR lending in the unsecured overnight markets, as at least some banks each day found themselves short of reserves and had to borrow them from another bank. In fact, the amount of such above-IOR lending remains low as a share of the overnight bank funding market, as shown in Figure 9.19 I might also have expected to see shifts in bank payments behavior\u2014for example, more daylight overdrafts or more effort by banks to \u201coptimize\u201d their payment flows\u2014but I have not seen this either. But, most fundamentally, I might have observed a day-to-day relationship between shifts in the stock of reserves and overnight interest rates. Figure 10 shows a scatterplot of daily changes in reserve balances against daily changes in the spread between the IOR rate and the effective federal funds rate; there is no visible relationship.\n\nLet me offer some caveats to these observations. Money markets have been and are now changing quickly in response to regulatory, technology and business model incentives.20 At the same time, reserves in the system have been abundant because of the asset purchase programs\u2014perhaps smoothing through the effects of some of these changes. Staff at the Federal Reserve has been using new data sets, analytics, and extensive market intelligence to deepen our understanding of the impact of these changes on money market dynamics. What follows is an illustration of this enhanced understanding.\n\nIn the pre-crisis monetary policy framework, banks\u2019 regulatory obligation to hold reserves was primarily driven by the required reserves framework, set forth in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D.21 This framework involved banks meeting their requirement over a 14-day reserves maintenance period, as well as various other incentives that promoted short-term, but not extremely high-frequency, bank balance sheet management activity to maintain reserves at required levels\u2014and the Federal Reserve had built analytics to provide good visibility into it. Today, while the Regulation D framework is still around, it is no longer likely to be the binding constraint on reserve levels for most large banks.22 The new factors driving reserves demand appear to vary by financial institution, and seem to depend on a complex interplay of numerous new features of the financial system. On the regulatory side, these include the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), banks\u2019 internal stress tests of their liquidity adequacy, supervisory expectations related to banks\u2019 ability to monetize their liquidity portfolios during periods of financial stress, and the incorporation of liquidity into resolution planning. Other important factors include increased bank aversion to incurring intraday overdrafts, higher bank investor and creditor expectations for liquidity, and a lower opportunity cost of holding reserves relative to before the crisis.23\n\nNot only will this system likely mean that banks\u2019 binding constraint on reserve levels will be different from before the crisis, but also that bank behavior when reserves decline will likely be different. For example, in comparison to the 14-day maintenance period I mentioned earlier under Regulation D, many of these new constraints are measured quarterly, while some are measured daily for certain purposes. This means that signs of reserve scarcity may emerge differently and on a different timescale than they would have in the old system. Moreover, banks have various ways to meet their obligations under this system: their choices are not limited to simply holding more reserves. As a result, reserve scarcity may be accompanied by shifts in market pricing and flows that we might not have seen in the old framework. Finally, the old system provided a degree of stability over time through its ability to reallocate scarce reserves among banks in response to shocks through interbank lending in the federal funds market. This interbank activity largely dried up following the crisis and has not meaningfully returned\u2014in part due to regulatory incentives, but also because banks report that they are now less interested in taking on financial exposure to other banks.24 As a result, it is possible that a regime of less abundant reserves may now be accompanied by an element of increasing volatility or periodic turbulence in money markets.\n\nOne new way in which scarcity might manifest itself going forward is through effects related to the LCR. Very generally, the LCR is designed to ensure that banks hold a sufficient reserve of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to allow them to survive a short-term period of significant liquidity stress. Now, balance sheet normalization involves reducing the private sector\u2019s holdings of one type of LCR HQLA, reserves, and increasing others\u2014Treasuries and agency MBS\u2014by an equal aggregate amount, so normalization does not make HQLA writ large more scarce.25 However, within the universe of HQLA, reserves are especially liquid: they can be used to make payments at any time without the need to sell or finance an asset in financial markets, which in a stressed environment might be difficult or costly. As a result, as the aggregate stock of reserves declines over balance sheet normalization, competition among banks may intensify for ways to bolster their measured liquidity position.26\n\nSuch increasing competition could affect money markets by increasing the differential between different types of money market borrowing based on its treatment under the LCR. The LCR determines a bank\u2019s expected cash outflows by multiplying the outstanding balances of various categories of liabilities by various supervisory \u201crunoff rates,\u201d which are meant to reflect the relative \u201cstickiness\u201d of that type of liability.27 Borrowing cash in overnight wholesale markets from another financial institution, such as a bank or a money market mutual fund, does not help a bank\u2019s liquidity position as measured by the LCR, because the rule assumes this funding completely runs off during periods of financial stress.28 However, borrowings from certain other kinds of lenders, such as public-sector entities, foreign central banks, and nonfinancial corporations, receive lower runoff rates, as the LCR rule considers these types of lenders to be \u201cstickier.\u201d In particular, borrowing from the FHLBs, the predominant lenders in the federal funds market, is one example of LCR-favored wholesale borrowing. So, if banks were becoming more interested in improving their LCRs, they might seek out, and pay up for, loans from the FHLBs and other LCR-favored lenders.\n\nRecent data indicates that LCR-related demand has pushed up the effective federal funds rate at times, notably in June. Looking at the distribution of federal funds rates this year, Figure 11 shows that the rates paid by domestic banks has increased relative to the rates paid by foreign banks. Last year, these two types of firms paid fairly similar rates. My read is that the foreign banks are generally borrowing in the federal funds market primarily to earn a spread between the IOR rate and the rate they pay to borrow funds, while some of the domestic banks, while also sensitive to the rate they pay, are borrowing in these markets to improve their LCRs. It seems like this more motivated borrowing activity helped bid up rates a bit. Figure 12 shows that, since June, we have seen small and brief divergences between rates in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets, which reflects transitory pricing of a premium on LCR-friendly borrowings around a period of heavy payment flows due to a federal tax payment due date.29 This small effect is a minor illustration of the transitory money market \u201cturbulence\u201d I mentioned earlier. However, since these effects have been small and short-lived, I don\u2019t see them as signaling that we are at or close to reserve scarcity.\n\nTaking a step back, it is hard to be definitive on the recent drivers of moves in short-term money markets. The markets have economically complex structures, and in particular, a high degree of concentration within some money market segments. Further, the prevalence of standing business relationships has seemed to mean that in practice transitory shocks can have more permanent effects on pricing. Indeed, despite a recent decline in repo rates, the effective federal funds rate has remained fairly stable at nine basis points below the top of the range.30 Moreover, there have been various other recent shocks that may have influenced money market flows and structure, such as those from recently enacted tax reform measures.\n\nThere are various opinions in the market on how things go from here. Some believe that we might see federal funds rates remain at a similar spread to IOR or rise somewhat closer to it\u2014for example, due to a forecasted seasonal increase in net Treasury bill issuance heading into the end of the year. Others see the recent tightening of federal funds to IOR as overly large relative to historical experience, and think this will retrace somewhat.\n\nBased on what I know now, it seems like a strong possibility that rates paid on borrowing in the federal funds market will remain within the target range for now with the current settings of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy toolkit. But, more importantly, I am confident that the Federal Reserve has the capacity to ensure that it will continue to achieve its goals, such as through another technical adjustment, should such action seem appropriate. What matters to the public and for broad financial conditions is the effective stance of monetary policy, which at the Federal Reserve is communicated by the target federal funds range and its transmission to other money markets.\n\nFluctuations in Term Money Markets\n\nLet\u2019s shift gears and talk about term dollar money markets. As I just discussed, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy target is the federal funds rate, which is an overnight rate of interest in the wholesale market. While the goals for monetary policy are maximum employment and price stability, the economic decisions of households and firms generally don\u2019t depend directly on the federal funds rate, since these parties do not participate in that market. Instead, their decisions depend on broader financial conditions, including the interest rates on home mortgages and corporate bonds, the performance of the stock market, and the foreign-exchange value of the dollar. As a result, for monetary policy to achieve its objectives, markets must function well enough to transmit the stance of policy, both from the markets in which the Federal Reserve directly transacts to its policy target, and then onward from that target to other money markets, and eventually to asset prices (bond yields, mortgage rates, equities, and exchange rates) that more directly affect real activity in the U.S. economy.\n\nBecause the various money markets are important to achieving the Federal Reserve\u2019s macroeconomic mandate, we monitor developments in them closely. In recent months, we have observed notable fluctuations in some term money market rates relative to the expected average level of the effective federal funds rate over the same horizon. This has been particularly true of the spread between three-month dollar LIBOR and equivalent-tenor expected future federal funds rates, as measured by overnight indexed swaps, or OIS, as shown in Figure 13, but is also the case with rates paid on borrowings such as commercial paper.\n\nThese longer-term money market rates are important to U.S. domestic activity to be sure, but they are also of significance abroad, especially in countries with highly trade-oriented economies. In this regard, we have seen continued growth in recent years in the stock of loans linked to U.S.-dollar LIBOR made to non-U.S. firms. As shown in Figure 14, the Desk estimates that U.S.-dollar cross-border bank loans to non-U.S. residents that could be directly or indirectly impacted by U.S.-dollar LIBOR\u2014the sum of the three columns in the panel\u2014total about $8 trillion, a significant portion of which is in developing economies. This reflects both the deep, liquid, and global nature of U.S. financial markets, as well as the dollar\u2019s role as a reserve currency and the primary currency used for international trade.\n\nMy assessment is that the increased supply of Treasury bills and shorter-term Treasury coupon securities has played an important role in putting upward pressure on these rates at times. I think there is also evidence that other policy drivers have played an important role. For example, the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provides for \u201cdeemed repatriation\u201d of corporate profits that had not yet been subjected to taxation in the United States. It appears that some corporations that previously had significant untaxed earnings\u2014and that previously held large stocks of cash on their balance sheets\u2014have begun to alter their capital structures, either by distributing cash held on balance sheet as dividends or by investing it in other assets. Some of this activity may have resulted from the passage of the TCJA\u2019s repatriation provisions; it may also be related more generally to the recent strength of the economic expansion and the high level of consumer and business confidence. It is hard to precisely quantify the extent to which these cash shifts have affected money markets, but it seems likely at this point that they have had an effect, at least for a time. Finally, it is important to be clear that there is no evidence that bank funding stress has contributed to this recent increase in LIBOR, in contrast to rises seen during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and 2011-2013 European sovereign debt and banking crisis.\n\nAnother important consideration in the recent fluctuations in term rates is that there is an ongoing, longer-term adjustment in U.S. money markets related to the 2016 reform of money market mutual funds (money funds). The fragility of money funds\u2014demonstrated in 2008 when a large money fund \u201cbroke the buck,\u201d other money funds were hit by runs, and the Treasury stepped in to guarantee money fund liabilities\u2014has been mitigated by this reform. It had the effect of sharply reducing the size of prime money funds, which have a broad capacity to invest across money markets, and increasing the size of government money funds, whose mandate is more restricted, as shown in Figure 15. In and of itself, this shift seems likely to have made money markets more segmented, and more prone to the \u201cturbulence\u201d in response to shocks I mentioned earlier.\n\nLonger term, this regulatory shift has catalyzed a deep and complex impact on the structure of money markets, which is still unfolding nearly two years later. These effects have included an ongoing increase in the role of FHLB advances as means of intermediation between government money funds and financial firms, as well as ongoing efforts by a wide variety of borrowers and lenders to broaden their counterparty lists and consider new operating frameworks so as to best accomplish their business objectives in the new money market environment. For example, although the FHLBs for years focused their liquidity management on the federal funds market because it provides a high degree of intraday liquidity, they are now beginning to explore greater use of bilateral repo, as that market has similar characteristics and can at times provide them with a higher return. It is likely that these ongoing shifts in money market structure have contributed to fluctuations in rates and spreads, and that they will continue to do so.\n\nI view fluctuations in term money market rates of the magnitudes seen recently as normal parts of market functioning during a period of structural change. Wholesale dollar funding, though more expensive, has remained readily available both in the United States and abroad. Importantly, there are no signs of worsened counterparty concerns among banks, and spreads in the FX swaps market in dollar and other advanced-economy currency pairs have tightened in recent months, demonstrating that foreign firms that wish to obtain dollars by providing foreign currency effectively as collateral can do so on reasonable terms.\n\nThat said, I do recognize that capital flows to emerging market economies have diminished in recent months. But, this shift appears to be largely driven by divergence in near-term growth momentum, which has supported the dollar and triggered some pullbacks in portfolio flows and reduced borrower demand, and not by general dislocations in the availability of short-term dollar funding.\n\nWe will continue to monitor developments in U.S. and global dollar funding markets closely, as we always do. In this regard, our ongoing dialogue with fellow central bankers, including through meetings such as this one, provides us with very valuable insight and perspective. As part of the New York Fed\u2019s ongoing engagement in and commitment to the region, we are pleased to be partnering with Bank Indonesia on a joint Central Banking Forum, which will take place prior to the 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group in Bali in October. This forum will highlight economic and monetary policy developments in the United States and emerging markets as well as geopolitical and technological trends and their implications for central bankers. We hope that you and members of your delegation will be able to join us for this event.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nTo conclude this discussion: I remain highly confident that the FOMC\u2019s framework for the normalization of the stance of monetary policy\u2014both in the overnight market and in the balance sheet\u2014will continue to proceed smoothly, without unnecessary surprise, disruption, or volatility in financial markets. The monetary policy implementation framework continues to provide the FOMC with excellent control over overnight money market rates, and has proven its ability, including recently through the technical adjustment, to flexibly respond to new developments. Although term money market rates have fluctuated recently in response to a variety of drivers, these markets continue to act as a deep and liquid source of wholesale funding to firms around the world while appropriately incorporating the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy stance.\n\nBefore I go, allow me to offer a few last thoughts on economic and financial stability as monetary policy normalization proceeds. The real rate of interest in the United States has been rising, and it seems that, before long, investors will be able to earn a positive real rate of return by investing even in riskless, overnight dollar assets. Now, there is nothing especially magical about \u201ccrossing the boundary\u201d between negative and positive real rates, and I do not expect anything out of the ordinary to happen when we do. But, it does seem a notable signpost on the road to a more normal monetary policy.\n\nSince the crisis, the FOMC\u2019s accommodative monetary policy stance has helped support an economic recovery and expansion both in the United States and around the world. But, it has not done this alone: it has had the support of a wide variety of policy actions\u2014most notably, but not limited to, financial regulatory reform aimed at bolstering economic resiliency and reducing the economy\u2019s propensity toward boom-and-bust cycles. Going forward, maintaining the U.S. economy on a sustainable trajectory, including through transparent monetary policy implementation and effective and efficient regulation, is our best means of contributing to prosperity both at home and in the broader global community.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to the panel discussion.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "Good morning.  It is my pleasure to make the opening remarks at this conference on post-crisis regulatory reform in the banking industry.  It\u2019s exciting to see such a distinguished group of researchers and supervisors in the room, all focused on developing a deeper understanding of the effects of the many significant regulatory changes that were put in place in response to the global financial crisis.  I hope that the day is filled with productive discussion and debate.  And, before I continue, I want to note that my comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWe are approaching the ten-year anniversary of the worst financial crisis in generations. Many regulatory and supervisory reforms have been made since, including changes to regulatory capital requirements, the introduction of new liquidity requirements, the redesign of the supervisory program for systemically important banks by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC), the introduction of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (or CCAR) program, requirements about recovery and resolution planning, and myriad other regulations under the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). \n\nIn my remarks today, I want to focus on one particular post-crisis change, the introduction of supervisory stress testing, as embodied in CCAR and the stress tests required by the Dodd-Frank Act (DFAST).  In my personal view, supervisory stress testing and the CCAR are the most significant and impactful of the many regulatory and supervisory changes implemented following the global financial crisis.  The CCAR and stress testing introduced a forward-looking perspective to capital adequacy and capital planning, something that static book-value-based regulatory capital measures lacked.  We felt this acutely during the financial crisis, when market values of bank equity plunged while book values evolved only very slowly, based on accounting measures of losses.  Aside from the stress-test-based quantitative requirements, the CCAR also requires large complex banks to do systematic capital planning, including developing criteria for when dividends and share repurchases will be made, increased or curtailed.  This is an important innovation, as banks were slow to reduce dividends during the financial crisis, even as losses mounted and share prices fell.1\n\nI want to examine supervisory stress testing through the lens of a paper I wrote in 2009 with former colleague Til Schuermann and current colleague Kevin Stiroh, now head of the New York Fed\u2019s Supervision Group.2   That paper looked at the very first set of stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve and other federal banking supervisors.  The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP, was a watershed moment in the financial crisis.  The program covered the 19 largest domestic bank holding companies\u2014firms with assets of at least $100 billion\u2014accounting for two-thirds of the assets and one-half of the loans in the U.S. banking system at that time.  Collectively, these firms spanned nearly every business area in the U.S. banking industry\u2014including commercial and consumer lending, real estate lending, trading, derivatives, custody services and investment banking.   \n\nThe key point in our paper was that the SCAP was a program that used microprudential supervisory tools to achieve macroprudential objectives.  I am sure that everyone here is familiar with these two terms, but let me provide a quick overview.  Microprudential objectives focus on the health, performance, safety and soundness of individual firms.  This was the perspective that dominated supervision prior to the financial crisis.  In contrast, macroprudential objectives focus on the stability and performance of the entire banking and financial system, emphasizing links among firms, how their activities can interact and the impact of the financial sector on the broader economy.  This perspective has become more prominent since the global financial crisis.\n\nMacroprudential objectives can themselves be divided into two distinct groups. The first is what might be called structural objectives, which focus on the impact large, systemically important institutions have on the rest of the system when they fail or become distressed.  Structural macroprudential objectives motivate regulatory tools such as additional capital requirements for systemically important banks (\u201cSIFI surcharges\u201d), which aim to reduce the probability that a large institution fails, and resolution and recovery planning, which seeks to limit the damage in the event of failure. \n\nThe second set of macroprudential objectives are cyclical objectives, focusing on the build-up of risks during credit and asset price booms and the consequent pull-back in financial intermediation during periods of stress.  Cyclical macroprudential goals motivate regulatory and supervisory tools that \u201clean against the wind\u201d in good times and \u201clean into the wind\u201d during stress, such as the countercyclical capital buffer, the design of stress test scenarios, and time-varying loan-to-value restrictions, which are imposed in some countries.    \n\nThe macroprudential objectives of the SCAP reflected both structural and cyclical concerns.  The primary goal was to ensure that large banks had sufficient capital to withstand an even-worse-than-expected economic downturn and still be able to lend\u2014a structural perspective.  Each of the 19 banks was required to raise additional capital if the stress tests indicated a shortfall relative to the supervisory target.  However, the SCAP\u2019s objectives also embodied cyclical concerns, namely, to provide confidence that banks could continue current lending (\u201cleaning into the wind\u201d) and thus reduce the likelihood of a worse-than-expected economic outcome.\n\nIn the paper, we identified six elements that we argued made the SCAP a successful macroprudential exercise:  comprehensiveness; consistency; multiple, independent estimates; diverse perspectives; transparency of process and results; and clear and predictable goals and actions.  Today I will use these elements to talk about the current supervisory stress testing regime and assess whether it continues to address macroprudential objectives.  I should note that my focus today is on the broad structure of supervisory stress testing and not on any specific set of stress test results.  As you know, the 2018 DFAST results were released yesterday and the corresponding CCAR results will be released next week.  I am not going to discuss these results or draw any inferences from them.\n\nComprehensiveness\n\nLet me start the discussion with the first of the elements:  comprehensiveness. As noted, the set of banks participating in the SCAP accounted for a large portion of the assets and loans in the U.S. banking industry and spanned nearly all significant banking industry activities.  In 2009, we argued that this comprehensiveness was essential in achieving the SCAP\u2019s macroprudential goals as the collective stress test results provided a view into a large share of the industry.  More important, through the subsequent capital raises, the SCAP helped ensure that this large segment was sufficiently well capitalized to provide a buffer to the broader economy against possible future bad outcomes. \n\nAfter the SCAP, the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the set of banking companies subject to supervisory stress testing to include all bank holding companies with assets exceeding $50 billion\u2014about another 15 to 20 firms, including the U.S. operations of many large, foreign-owned banks.  In 2018, a total of 35 firms participated in the CCAR and DFAST stress tests.  However, with the recent passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, many of these will no longer be subject to DFAST supervisory stress testing or could participate only on a periodic basis.  The very largest and most systemically important firms, including all domestic bank holding companies with assets exceeding $250 billion, will continue to be required to participate in DFAST supervisory stress testing on an annual basis.\n\nThese recent changes are consistent with an emphasis on structural macroprudential concerns, in that they focus the DFAST stress tests on the set of firms that are individually the most systemically important.  The intention seems to be to balance the burden of the supervisory stress testing regime against the negative impact that distress at one of these firms could cause to other banks and the rest of the financial system\u2014part of the broader tailoring of the regulatory framework to the size and risk profile of different types of institutions.3   At the same time, however, reducing the set of firms subject to annual DFAST supervisory stress testing seems less consistent with cyclical macroprudential concerns, as it could narrow the window that stress test results provide on the build-up of risks and the loss-absorbing capacity of the banking system.  Whether the set of banks that continue to be subject to annual DFAST supervisory stress testing represents a large enough share of the overall banking industry and sufficiently spans the range of banking activities to provide a comprehensive perspective is something that merits monitoring and analysis.\n\nConsistency\n\nThe second element we identified as contributing to the SCAP\u2019s macroprudential effectiveness was consistency.  In the SCAP, as in the current supervisory stress testing regime, all banks were subject to the same hypothetical stress scenario\u2014that is, the same set of assumptions about the path of economic activity, interest rates, asset prices and volatility over the future stress test horizon.  In SCAP, the scenarios were defined in a very parsimonious way, using just three variables (GDP growth, unemployment and housing prices).  In contrast, the current supervisory stress test scenarios involve more than two dozen variables describing U.S. and foreign economic activity, interest rates and asset prices. \n\nThen, as now, the common scenario provided a consistent framework for assessing the vulnerability not just of the individual banking companies, but of the banking system as a whole.  This consistency is especially important to address cyclical macroprudential objectives, as it provides a unified assessment of the performance of the overall industry.  And of course the stress scenarios are themselves an important cyclical macroprudential element, as they are designed to impose more stress\u2014in particular, a larger increase in the unemployment rate\u2014during periods of strong expansion.\n\nBut a single scenario will not be equally stressful for all firms.  Depending on each firm\u2019s business focus, geographic reach and customer base, any single scenario will result in variable degrees of stress, potentially undercutting structural macroprudential objectives.  In the current stress testing regime, the bank-generated stress tests required as part of the CCAR go a long way to addressing concerns that stress tests based on a single supervisory scenario will not be tailored enough to expose capital vulnerabilities at all firms.  In these exercises, banks are supposed to identify scenarios that are uniquely stressful to them.  Evaluating these scenarios to ensure that they capture firm-specific risks is a key part of the CCAR qualitative review.  This seems a very constructive way to think about consistency across firms, with the emphasis on each firm having robust risk identification and thorough consideration of the kinds of stress environments that would uniquely test its business model. \n\nMultiple, Independent Estimates and Diverse Perspectives\n\nOur 2009 paper described the benefits of the SCAP\u2019s use of multiple, independent estimates of losses, revenue and expenses, as well as bringing diverse perspectives to bear on the design and implementation of the exercise.  At that time, the technology of firm-wide stress testing was in its infancy, and the SCAP results were based on a combination of bank-generated estimates, (somewhat primitive) supervisory models, and high-level \u201ctop down\u201d estimates of possible stressed loan losses. Given the early state of the art, the SCAP team brought together supervisors, economists, attorneys, accountants, financial analysts, regulatory capital experts and others from the Fed and the other supervisory agencies involved in the program.  This kind of multi-disciplinary approach is now embedded in many aspects of supervision, including the LISCC, which includes economists, attorneys and financial market experts, as well as supervisors.\n\nThe blending of bank-generated and supervisory estimates may be the aspect of the supervisory stress testing regime that has evolved most significantly since the SCAP.  Supervisory stress test results are now based on models developed by supervisors that rely on detailed firm-specific data filed through regulatory reports, so the results now represent a fully distinct and independent supervisory view.4   And, as described above, banks are required to generate their own stress test estimates.  Public disclosure of both sets of results based on the common supervisory scenarios has provided diverse perspectives on banks\u2019 capital vulnerabilities.\n\nDiverse perspectives, especially those from outside the banking industry and supervisory community, continue to be critical in supporting stress testing\u2019s macroprudential objectives.  Academic economists can play an especially important role in helping to foster innovation and creativity by advancing thinking on stress test scenario design and on modeling techniques that better capture the impact of the external environment on bank financial condition.  A particularly ripe area for fresh thought, in my view, concerns modeling revenues and non-credit expenses\u2014so-called pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR\u2014an area that is notoriously difficult to assess.  More broadly, developing practical ways to model realistic interactions among banks and other financial institutions and between the financial and real sectors of the economy would be important advances.\n\nTransparency of Process and Results\n\nThe next element we identified as contributing to the SCAP\u2019s success as a macroprudential exercise was transparency, both of the process and, especially, of the results.  The SCAP was groundbreaking because it disclosed firm-specific supervisory estimates in detail, including loss amounts and rates on different types of loans, projections of net revenues, and the amount of capital each firm would have to raise to meet publicly disclosed supervisory targets ratios.  These disclosures formed the template for subsequent DFAST and CCAR stress test results.  Current stress test disclosures deliver not just insight into individual banks\u2019 ability to withstand stressful economic outcomes, but also provide a broader perspective about the exposure of different segments of bank lending, securities and other activities to adverse economic and financial market developments. These segment-level results, aggregated across banks, are important because they have the potential to serve as public warning signals about over-heating or a build-up of risk that can supplement other cyclical macroprudential analysis.\n\nWhile the transparency of the supervisory stress test results was a groundbreaking element of the SCAP in 2009, subsequent discussion has focused largely on the transparency of the process of generating the results, in particular, information about supervisory stress test models. The Fed discloses descriptive information about the models, including the general statistical approach and key variables, but does not release the code or detailed equation estimates.  Industry groups and individual banks have called for the Fed to release more detail about its models, including the specific formulas and equations.5  \n\nOn one level, full disclosure of the Fed\u2019s supervisory stress test models might seem like good public policy.  Such disclosures would provide insight into how the stress test calculations are made, making the results predictable to the banks subject to the tests.  Greater predictability of the stress test results could enhance banks\u2019 ability to do capital planning, because any constraints arising from the supervisory stress test results would be known ex ante.  Detailed disclosures could also enhance the credibility of the stress test regime by allowing external parties to critique the Fed\u2019s models, a form of \u201cpeer review\u201d that could lead to improved modeling techniques or identify areas of emerging risk that the Fed\u2019s models do not adequately capture.\n\nBut these benefits could come at significant cost to the broader goals of the supervisory stress testing regime.  My co-author, Til Schuermann, has argued that increased reliance on supervisory models, especially in the context of the CCAR program, provides powerful incentives for banks to abandon innovation in stress test modeling and instead devote their energy to mimicking the Fed\u2019s models. In the extreme, these incentives could result in \u201cmodel monoculture,\u201d in which all actors use very closely related models.6 This risk becomes especially acute the more is known about the details of the supervisory models.\n\nA lack of modeling diversity would be especially concerning from a macroprudential perspective, since it would mean that the entire industry would be capturing the same risks in the same way\u2014a form of collective blindness to new industry practices and products and emerging risk developments.  As important, banks have incentives to optimize around the stress test and other risk models, engaging in strategies that maximize returns while minimizing measured risk exposures.  Widespread use of very similar models could mean widespread loading on the same kind of risks and adopting the same hedging or mitigation techniques\u2014increasing systemic risk. \n\nA final concern that I want to mention is based less in economic theory and more on the practical realities of implementing and updating regulations.  The more stress test models are \u201chard coded\u201d in regulation, the more difficult it is to change them as modeling practices improve or as new risks emerge.  The models and parameters can quickly become stale and inferences from the models inaccurate.  For those interested in a real-life case study of such an outcome, I recommend a paper by Scott Frame, Kristopher Gerardi and Paul Willen about the stress test models used by OFHEO, the agency that oversaw Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the financial crisis.7   The paper documents the large understatement of the agencies\u2019 credit risk exposures stemming from \u201chard coded\u201d models that failed to capture innovation in mortgage underwriting. \n\nIn fact, the Fed has proposed additional disclosures about its stress test models, including indicative loan loss rates and loss results based on standardized portfolios.8 These enhanced disclosures aim to provide greater insight into the Fed\u2019s modeling approaches and thus to facilitate \u201cpeer review,\u201d while maintaining the rigor of the stress testing regime.  This is another area where academic economists can help enrich the debate.  There is already a literature on the impact of the disclosure of supervisory stress test results;9 that literature could usefully be extended to consider the impact of underlying model disclosure, especially in the context of macroprudential goals.\n\nClear and Predictable Goals and Actions\n\nThe final element we identified supporting the macroprudential goals of the SCAP was that the exercise had clear and predictable objectives and actions.  Our paper argued that the financial crisis environment gave the SCAP a very clear goal of providing confidence that the banking system could continue to lend even under more dire economic conditions as a way of mitigating the chance that those dire economic conditions actually materialized.  In that sense, the SCAP was very much a \u201clean into the wind\u201d macroprudential exercise.\n\nIn the current environment, I\u2019d argue that the goals of the supervisory stress testing regime are more diffuse. There are clearly microprudential \u201csafety and soundness\u201d objectives related to sound capital planning, risk identification and capital adequacy at each of the firms participating in the exercise.  These are critically important objectives.  The focus on the largest, most systemically important banks also seems consistent with the structural macroprudential channel\u2014by reducing the risk that these most systemic firms become distressed, we reduce the risk of the externalities that such distress places on other financial institutions and, most important, on consumers and businesses. \n\nWhat is less clear to me is what role cyclical macroprudential concerns play in the evolving stress testing regime.  Clearly, the design of the stress test scenarios, which embed a number of counter-cyclical features, is an important channel for \u201clean against the wind\u201d or \u201clean into the wind\u201d efforts.  However, narrowing the set of firms subject to DFAST supervisory stress testing potentially pushes away from the broader cyclical perspective. Less of the banking industry will be covered by the stress tests and assessments of the strength of the industry will be based on a smaller part of the whole. \n\nIn pointing out these implications, I am not making any judgments about whether the focus on microprudential and structural macroprudential goals is optimal from a public policy perspective.  In my view\u2014and I really cannot say this strongly enough\u2014ensuring that the largest and most systemically important banks do robust capital and liquidity planning, have strong internal controls, do good risk identification and have very healthy amounts of capital (especially common equity) and liquidity resources is fundamental to fostering a stable banking system that can perform its critical financial intermediation role in both calm and stressed economic environments.  What I hoped to do today is simply to point out that one of the key objectives of the original SCAP stress program\u2014leaning into the wind during a severe economic downturn\u2014might be getting less emphasis as the time since the financial crisis grows, the economic expansion continues, and the supervisory stress testing regime evolves.\n\nThanks for your attention this morning.  I hope that you enjoy the rest of the conference."

    "speaker": "Jack Gutt",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/gut180620",
    "content": "Good morning. My name is Jack Gutt. I am the executive vice president of the Communications & Outreach Group at the New York Fed. It is my pleasure to welcome you here today and thank you for your participation. I also want to thank our co-sponsors, Hispanics in Philanthropy, for their partnership, leadership and support.\n\nBefore I start, please note that my comments here today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday's event is part of our ongoing efforts to support Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as they seek to recover from the devastating hurricanes of 2017 and set themselves on a sustainable economic path. We firmly believe that philanthropic investments made in collaboration with community leaders, financial institutions and corporate partners can play an essential role in achieving those goals.\n\nDuring today's session we will hear more about how the economies of these two regions are faring since the hurricanes. We will also learn about existing efforts to contribute to economic growth and prosperity for the territories and their residents. These include efforts in the areas of housing, entrepreneurship, community development finance, workforce development and youth engagement.\n\nAs I said, today's event is part of our long-term commitment to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are part of the Second Federal Reserve District, which we represent. For many years, but especially in the last decade as Puerto Rico fell into a long-term recession and subsequent fiscal crisis, the New York Fed has been closely monitoring the situation in the territories, developing research, hosting meetings, and providing technical support to other government agencies.\n\nSince the hurricanes and the almost inconceivable damage they wrought, we have ramped up our efforts by developing additional and targeted research, including our latest Puerto Rico Small Business Survey, which will focus on the impacts of the storms on that critical sector. We have partnered with federal and local agencies to host a series of one-stop forums for small business owners and homeowners seeking assistance in Puerto Rico and have similar events planned for the U.S. Virgin Islands later this year. And, we are partnering to organize a training and technical assistance session for community development financial institutions and credit unions to help them raise and channel new sources of capital to aid in the rebuilding of rural and urban communities throughout Puerto Rico.\n\nIn March of this year, I had the opportunity to accompany then New York Fed President Bill Dudley and several colleagues to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where we met with private and public sector leaders and toured some hard hit areas. While it is one thing to see the devastation on a screen or on a page and to read the statistics, it is another entirely to experience it firsthand. Recognizing that our visit was a full six months after the storms and that we were exposed to just a sampling of the damage, what we saw and heard drove home just how great the needs are, not just for recovery but also to achieve the type of long-term economic health that we want for all of our citizens.\n\nBut, just like the needs and challenges are great, so too are the opportunities. We saw a fiercely proud and incredibly resilient population. We met with dedicated and innovative community development practitioners, educators, business leaders and entrepreneurs. We heard a common desire to seek a better path forward.\n\nOne unique and tangible opportunity that exists relates to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which could help deliver much needed capital to the islands. As many of you are no doubt aware, the Federal Reserve, in collaboration with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, issued an Interagency Statement on January 25, 2018 regarding the consideration of bank activities in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico under the CRA following their designation as major disaster areas. The statement allows that banks located anywhere in the country will receive consideration for community development activities that revitalize or stabilize the areas affected, as well as those that assist people displaced by the hurricanes.\n\nThis statement is similar to others that have been issued following significant disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina. The recovery and revitalization of New Orleans were made possible in no small part due to the extraordinary level of collaboration amongst foundations, financial institutions and others in the investment community.\n\nSimilarly, we now have a critical opportunity to work together to ensure that Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have the support and resources to recover and rebound.\n\nThe leaders in this room represent institutions that have the capacity and expertise to drive much-needed resources to the region. We will continue to work closely with financial institutions to help take full advantage of the CRA interagency statement. We will be listening closely throughout today's discussion to identify further opportunities for us to collaborate and support the work of the philanthropic community, especially as the region transitions towards medium- and long-term recovery.\n\nI look forward to the dialogue. Thank you for your kind attention."

    "content": "Introduction                                                     \n\nIt\u2019s a pleasure to speak at today\u2019s conference on this critically important issue, one that Bill Dudley and his colleagues have done tremendous work bringing to the forefront over the past few years. It\u2019s also an honor to be sharing a stage with Bill today, and I\u2019d like to thank him for his outstanding leadership of the New York Fed.\n\nI\u2019ve learned a great deal from this conference, especially hearing the diverse perspectives and experiences of regulators from across the globe, industry leaders, and academic experts. The speakers and discussions have already covered a lot of ground, so I\u2019ll keep my remarks brief.\n\nThis afternoon I\u2019m going to talk about the urgent need to focus our attention on banking culture in supervision and what that means in practice. Before I go any further, I have to give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express are my own, and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Good Times Are When to Get Your House in Order\n\nIn the wake of the financial crisis and ensuing economic downturn, the world\u2019s attention was trained on financial services. The crisis severely eroded people\u2019s trust in the industry, both here and abroad.  \n\nGovernments and regulators quickly got to work fixing the main deficiencies in the existing regulatory framework. These included requiring much stronger loss-absorbing capital to weather severe economic downturns, demanding greater liquidity cushions to withstand market and funding disruptions, and creating a robust resolution framework to protect both the economy and the taxpayer in the event of a failure of a systemically important firm.\n\nThese changes were appropriate and necessary. We must not lose sight of their importance in safeguarding the soundness of the financial system and in ensuring that future generations do not have to suffer the economic trauma that we lived through this past decade.       \n\nBringing us to the present day, we are in a much, much better place, in terms of both the financial sector and the overall economy. We have a more robust regulatory regime in place, and banks are well positioned to survive future storms.\n\nFurthermore, our economy\u2019s in great shape; we\u2019re in the second-longest expansion in history, and economic data from both the United States and countries around the world continue to trend upwards. As a policymaker, solid growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our target are all exactly what I want to see.\n\nParadoxically, it\u2019s precisely this sense that things have gotten so much better that worries me most. Although we have seen marked improvements in the critical areas of capital, liquidity, and resolution, we have not yet fully addressed the root causes of many of the problems that have plagued the financial sector. I am thinking of not only the excessive risk-taking and leverage in the run-up to the crisis, but also the repeated scandals related to LIBOR, FX, money laundering, sales practices; unfortunately, the list goes on and on. Underlying these scandals is often an inadequate corporate culture, where accountability and ethical conduct have fallen by the wayside.\n\nThe good times we\u2019re in can exacerbate these problems in three ways. First, there\u2019s a risk of complacency setting in\u2014an \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mentality. Second, in a strong economy, the hard numbers that we tend to focus on when examining profits, losses, capital, and liquidity can look like everything\u2019s coming up roses, even when an uncomfortable reality lies beneath. And, finally, culture is a long-run investment that takes many years to develop and requires constant reinforcement to preserve. If you let it erode, you can\u2019t go to the market and obtain a new \u201cculture\u201d overnight.  \n\nAs I mentioned, establishing a more robust regulatory framework was absolutely necessary for a healthier, more resilient financial system. But, it is far from sufficient. The danger we face today is that people may conclude that the hardened defenses are enough, and other supervisory activities around culture, conduct, and governance are superfluous. \n\nThis feeling that we\u2019ve built a strong fortress able to withstand any onslaught may create a mood of complacency and detract attention from the dangers that could be growing within the walls of financial institutions.  \n\nThis problem is aggravated by the fact that the hard numbers studied by regulators and supervisors should look great when the economy\u2019s doing well. Profits are high and loan losses low when the economy is humming along. But, strong numbers in a strong economy don\u2019t give you the full picture. They can\u2019t always tell you whether people are cutting corners, taking excessive risks, or violating rules and regulations. Even worse, they can distract you from digging into the truth and unearthing unethical business practices and misconduct that may hide below the surface.\n\nThe well-known challenge with culture is that, in contrast with things like capital and liquidity, culture feels \u201csofter\u201d and, therefore, more difficult to measure. And often in finance there\u2019s a tendency to disregard what can\u2019t be quantified. But just because it\u2019s hard to measure doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore it or downplay its importance. As we heard throughout today\u2019s conference, culture shapes every conversation, every decision, and every action; it is at the root of whether an organization performs in a manner consistent with its mission, or not.\n\nHow to Achieve a Better Banking Culture\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of culture as a long-term investment that can\u2019t be \u201cfixed\u201d overnight. Several years ago, Rich Lyons, Dean at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, spoke at the San Francisco Fed and talked about culture in a way that has stuck with me ever since. Transforming a culture is a five- to ten-year project; keeping it that way is an ongoing mission that requires strong leadership and consistent action.\n\nAs a leader of a large organization, I\u2019ve taken that message to heart. I\u2019ve found that a culture based on the principle of open and authentic dialogue, that embraces our diverse backgrounds and perspectives delivers better results. I\u2019ve found that well-defined collective values and direction lead to greater collaboration and innovation. Finally, I\u2019ve found that this work is never a finished project, but an ongoing one that constantly evolves.\n\nI started by saying that I feel a sense of urgency in addressing banking culture. So where do I see the priorities for supervision?\n\nAs supervisors, we need to ensure that bank management and boards are exerting strong and effective leadership with robust governance. That means holding management and boards of directors to high standards in terms of culture and conduct, even when the numbers look rosy. It means ensuring corporate values are clearly articulated and incentives are squarely align with a bank\u2019s strategic goals. It means identifying, communicating, and mitigating risks in a timely and effective manner. It means that employees feel empowered to raise their hands if they see wrongdoing, and that comprehensive fixes are implemented when something goes wrong.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, when times are good, we rarely feel an urgency to make changes. And these are certainly good times. But numbers can have a funny way of not revealing the whole truth. A sound spreadsheet may mask unethical behavior, a well-capitalized bank may be on the road to ruin, and a neglected corporate culture can turn toxic.\n\nWe must stay vigilant around the \u201csofter\u201d side of supervision. Strong culture and robust corporate governance are our first lines of defense. They\u2019re a critical part of the tool kit when it comes to protecting people, banks, and the economy from risk, scandal, and harm."

    "title": "The Transition to a Robust Reference Rate Regime",
    "date": "May 24, 2018",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/dud180524",
    "content": "Thank you, Mark, and thanks to the Bank of England for the opportunity to talk about the important issue of reference rates.  I will focus my remarks today on reference rate reform in the United States\u2014where we have been, where we are, and where we are headed.  In short, I will argue that while much has already been accomplished, we still have a lot more to do\u2014and it must happen within a compressed time frame.  This is an important point that Andrew Bailey usefully underscored for us last year.  Because of the great uncertainty over LIBOR\u2019s future and the risks to financial stability that would likely accompany a disorderly transition to alternative reference rates, we need aggressive action to move to a more durable and resilient benchmark regime.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nLIBOR Scandal Demonstrated the Imperative for Reform\n\nAlthough the backdrop to current reference rate reform efforts is well known here, some historical context is useful when considering the issues facing us today.  That history highlights why alternatives to LIBOR are needed.  It also illustrates the importance of continuing to focus on bank culture and proper incentives in order to support financial stability over the longer term. \n\nAt its core, the problem we face today is that the financial system has built a tremendously large edifice on a structurally impaired foundation.  While many in the industry cannot recall a time when LIBOR did not exist, in fact, it was only developed in the 1980s.  Since then, the use of LIBOR as a reference rate has exploded\u2014with the size of financial contracts referencing U.S.-dollar LIBOR today estimated at close to $200 trillion.2 The vast majority of these exposures are derivative obligations, such as interest rate swaps.  But, that tally also includes trillions of dollars of cash products, such as residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds and loans, and securitized products.  And, with new contracts referencing LIBOR still being written, this balance continues to grow significantly. \n\nBroadly speaking, reference rates are vital to efficient market functioning.  They facilitate trading in standardized contracts, which lowers transaction costs and increases market liquidity.  Robust reference rates can also reduce information asymmetries and the risk of misconduct by providing transparent, independent pricing. \n\nBut, in the case of LIBOR, the foundation had serious flaws.  Most notably, LIBOR was (and is) based on submissions from individual banks\u2014which, in turn, were based on hypothetical borrowing rates or expert judgments, and not actual transactions.  Moreover, deficiencies existed in regulatory oversight and governance of the rate-setting mechanism.  These vulnerabilities enabled the manipulation of the rate for the financial benefit of individuals and institutions.  Amid profound breakdowns in controls and compliance, individual traders conspired with rate submitters at their own institutions or traders at other firms to manipulate the setting of the rate to improve their trading results.  During the global financial crisis, panel banks also reportedly submitted lower borrowing rates than they could actually obtain in the marketplace.  They did so to disguise their financial fragility at a time when uncertainty over bank liquidity and solvency was high.3  \n\nThe resulting scandal was particularly disturbing because of its scale and flagrancy, including collusion by employees across firms.  It led to billions of dollars in fines, jail terms for some individuals, and severe reputational damage to the financial industry as a whole.  The global financial crisis exposed excessive risk-taking and a long series of lapses in judgment, and the LIBOR scandal further undermined trust in the ethical standards of the banking industry. \n\nThe scandal provides many cautionary lessons, including the ways in which poor technical design can be exploited, the limitations of self-regulation, the problems that arise when loyalty is to one\u2019s trading co-conspirators rather than to one\u2019s institution, and the need for robust controls.  It also underscores the power of incentives to drive individuals and firms to do things that are imprudent and/or unethical.4 And, the governance and control framework that the banks and the LIBOR administrator had in place proved woefully insufficient to prevent misconduct that stemmed from poor incentives.  In this context, one could say it was a situation ripe for exploitation. \n\nThe openness and brazenness of misconduct as captured in the recorded transcripts also point to serious deficiencies in bank culture.  My New York Fed colleagues and I have commented frequently on the need for sound culture and incentives as a complement to effective regulation and supervision.  While there has been some progress on this issue in recent years, the LIBOR and other rate-rigging scandals\u2014not to mention more recent breakdowns at individual banks\u2014point to the need for further strengthening of bank culture.5   I look forward to the discussion with Minouche and Andrew on improving culture in the fixed income, currency, and commodity markets in the following panel. \n\nOne of the key lessons from the financial crisis was that critical pieces of financial system infrastructure must be both strong and resilient, and the LIBOR scandal underscored this need.6   The essential problem with LIBOR is the inherent fragility of its \u201cinverted pyramid,\u201d where the pricing of hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial instruments rests on the expert judgment of relatively few individuals, informed by a very small base of unsecured interbank transactions.  Moreover, that base has contracted further in recent years, due to many factors, including regulatory reform and the quantitative easing programs initiated by central banks in many of the major advanced economies.  Relative to the vast sums of U.S.-dollar LIBOR contracts I mentioned earlier, the median daily volume of unsecured three-month U.S.-dollar wholesale borrowing is minuscule, at around $1 billion, and many days see less than $500 million in volume.7   This lack of market liquidity means that these rates cannot be sufficiently transaction-based to be truly representative, and rates that are not transaction-based are more at risk to be manipulated. \n\nSo, despite efforts to improve LIBOR in recent years\u2014and there undoubtedly have been important changes that have strengthened its administration and governance\u2014the lack of underlying market liquidity for nearly all currencies and maturities remains a problem, and there is no obvious solution.8   The setting of LIBOR still depends heavily on expert judgment.  Even for U.S.-dollar LIBOR, actual transactions are the basis for only about one-third of the rate submissions for tenors of one and three months.  This is noteworthy because these are the maturities that are referenced by the bulk of financial contracts.9\n\nIn light of the history of LIBOR\u2014and in the context of more than $320 billion in overall misconduct fines since the crisis\u2014banks are naturally reluctant to assume the legal risks associated with submitting quotes based on very shallow markets.10   Indeed, that is why some banks have left individual LIBOR panels in recent years.11   Andrew Bailey drove home this point in his July 2017 speech.  He explained that the Financial Conduct Authority had to press hard to persuade banks to remain on the panels and voluntarily submit LIBOR quotes through the end of 2021.12   LIBOR\u2019s potential cessation after 2021 poses a clear risk to financial stability, and prudent risk management means that all of us must prepare for a world without LIBOR. \n\nThe Official Sector Response\n\nIn recent years, international and domestic authorities alike have actively worked with the private sector to address LIBOR\u2019s shortcomings and to find alternative rates.  One notable development has been the publication of an international set of principles for financial benchmarks, developed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in 2013.13   These principles\u2014which include 19 specific standards across governance, benchmark quality, methodology, and accountability\u2014have emerged as the international standard.  IOSCO has rightly focused on tying benchmarks more closely to observable, arms-length transactions. This represents an important step toward eliminating excessive reliance on expert judgment.\n\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) has been a galvanizing force at the international level.  The FSB and its members have published proposals, plans, and timelines for reference rate reform and have promoted the strengthening of the major interest rate benchmarks.  The FSB has been carrying out work on the development and introduction of alternative benchmarks, developing a plan to accomplish a transition to new benchmarks, encouraging work by the private sector on contract robustness, and reporting regularly on the progress made.14  \n\nThe Federal Reserve has played a lead role in the development of these recommendations as applied to U.S.-dollar LIBOR, working closely with the other major financial regulatory agencies in the United States.  This effort has also involved coordinating with the official sector sponsors of similar efforts around the world.15   In late 2014, in response to FSB and Financial Stability Oversight Council recommendations, the Federal Reserve convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC)\u2014a group of market participants established to identify more robust alternative U.S.-dollar reference rates that are risk-free or nearly risk-free, fit the needs of the derivatives market, and are compliant with IOSCO principles.16   This effort paralleled similar ones in other jurisdictions to find reference rates that are well-suited to local conditions and market needs\u2014including the UK\u2019s Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates.  The ARRC was also tasked with developing a transition plan to facilitate the adoption of these rates in a voluntary and orderly manner, and with considering best practices in contract design to prepare for the possibility that LIBOR ceases to be published. \n\nPublication of Alternative Reference Rates by the Federal Reserve\n\nThe ARRC has made important progress in achieving its mandate.  Notably, in June 2017, it selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative to U.S.-dollar LIBOR.  SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight using U.S. Treasury securities as collateral, and is thus relevant to a wide range of market participants.  The rate is entirely transaction-based, and the underlying market is robust, with current daily volume of more than $700 billion.  (By comparison, unsecured three-month U.S.-dollar wholesale borrowing totals roughly $1 billion per day, as I mentioned earlier.)  SOFR moves closely with LIBOR and other money market rates over time, and because it covers multiple segments of the repo market, it provides scope for future market evolution.17   Besides being more resistant to manipulation, this nearly risk-free rate should also prove much more resilient during periods of financial stress, because the U.S. Treasury repo market is likely to remain deep and active during such episodes. \n\nThe New York Fed administers and produces SOFR in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research.  We began publishing this rate on April 3 of this year, along with two other repo rates: the Tri-Party General Collateral Rate and the Broad General Collateral Rate.18   This work complements steps by the Federal Reserve to promote greater transparency in rates in unsecured markets through enhancements to the calculation of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and the launching of an entirely new rate, the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR).19  \n\nI have long been a proponent of the idea that central banks are well suited to take on this responsibility.  Reference rates have strong public good properties, and the private sector faces notable coordination challenges in this area.  Central banks have a long history in producing such measures\u2014recognizing that traditionally this has been for purposes related to monetary policy\u2014and are trusted independent parties.  In my view, central banks also ultimately \u201cown\u201d the financial stability risks that are present when key reference rates are flawed.  Better to recognize this responsibility and move proactively to mitigate such risks than to step aside and hope that someone else will take up the mantle of reform. \n\nThe Federal Reserve has designed these benchmarks to be compliant with IOSCO principles, with regular review by oversight bodies and comprehensive ethics and conflict-of-interest policies for staff.20   Best practice also dictates that administrators periodically review the rates they produce to assess whether changes in the underlying markets require changes in how those rates are administered.  We have dedicated significant resources to these efforts, and are committed to the continued production of rates so that market participants can have confidence about their long-term viability. \n\nFor these reasons, the Federal Reserve concurs with the ARRC that SOFR represents a compelling alternative to U.S.-dollar LIBOR\u2014particularly for most derivatives transactions, where a near risk-free rate is more appropriate than a rate that incorporates a bank credit risk premium. \n\nNevertheless, market adoption of SOFR faces its own challenges, such as the development of sufficient liquidity in derivatives that reference SOFR, and the establishment of a term reference rate, which I will discuss in a moment.  These elements will have to be built over time.  The ARRC\u2019s Paced Transition Plan lays out a timeline for the milestones that must reached over the coming quarters and years for a successful transition.21   I am confident that the ARRC will succeed, but it will take considerable attention and effort.\n\nProgress is already evident.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange began offering SOFR futures contracts earlier this month, and trading activity has gotten off to a good start.  Development of SOFR derivatives, in turn, will support the creation of a term reference rate.  Although the ARRC\u2019s transition plan anticipates that this will be completed by the end of 2021, it would be better for this to occur more expeditiously.  The good news is that is broadly appreciated.  In this vein, the Committee\u2019s second report discussed some of the term rate alternatives, and development of proposals for a term reference rate was recently added to its mandate.  In this regard, I would also encourage market participants, academics, and other interested parties to contribute to the effort to develop a term reference rate.\n\nAnother key area of focus\u2014further motivated by Andrew\u2019s warning\u2014is the development of fallback contract language in the event that LIBOR ceases to be published.  The absence of such language creates the potential for large-scale disorder in global financial markets should LIBOR go away.  Put simply, this is an unacceptable risk.  The International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) has been working on this issue for the derivatives market and is expected to issue a consultative document soon that should prove instrumental in making further progress.  The ARRC has also been coordinating a similar effort across cash products of all types.  The goal is to achieve consensus on a consistent approach across markets whenever feasible. \n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs I have noted previously, LIBOR continues to have significant shortcomings despite strengthened governance in recent years, and uncertainty about its future will only grow over time.  This uncertainty reflects the limited liquidity underlying LIBOR and the corresponding legal risks I discussed earlier.  But, I am also skeptical about whether LIBOR can ever be adequately transaction-based.  As Andrew highlighted, there is no guarantee that LIBOR will continue to exist beyond December 2021.  In my view, LIBOR is likely to go away\u2014and it should, because it is not supported by a sufficiently robust regime.  The LIBOR countdown clock should provide an impetus for action, but it should also make market participants and regulators increasingly nervous as we approach the deadline\u2014especially if longer-term solutions are not in train or in place.  Time is of the essence, and we must manage it well.  The ARRC and others have laid out valuable transition plans, and we need to ensure that they are executed expeditiously and well. \n\nOf course, I do not mean to minimize the costs involved.  This is a monumental and complicated effort\u2014one that the industry has never undertaken\u2014and it will entail overcoming many obstacles.  It requires collective action by a wide variety of market participants, some of whom may not be fully convinced of the need for change.  And, there may be others with a direct interest in the preservation of LIBOR\u2014such as its administrator\u2014who may not support moving away from the status quo.  There also undoubtedly will be those who seek a free ride on the efforts of others.  And, of course, the effort will encounter inertia and wishful thinking.  All of this is to be expected in such a large undertaking with significant upfront costs.  Nevertheless, delay is not a viable option. \n\nThis task is borne out of necessity.  Financial crises typically result when we fail to identify vulnerabilities, and then unexpected triggers turn those vulnerabilities into points of weakness that can lead to catastrophic failure.  The discontinuation of LIBOR, however, is different.  We can see it coming, and we know the impact of a disorderly transition would be huge.  Therefore, a half-hearted effort or a failure to act would be inexcusable, especially after all we have learned from the experience of the financial crisis.  Moving this core piece of the global financial system to a firm and durable foundation is essential and worth the cost. \n\nThis task is admittedly hard, but I am optimistic given our past successes.  We have demonstrated that effective collective action can provide solutions to longstanding structural vulnerabilities in the financial system.  A key lesson from the crisis is that structural vulnerabilities must be addressed continually.  If they are ignored, larger problems eventually will result.  For example, through collective action over the past decade, we have successfully addressed structural weaknesses in the tri-party repo market, the over-the-counter derivatives market, and money market mutual funds. \n\nEach of these challenges required a tailored solution that relied on different tools\u2014including a diverse mix of market, regulatory and supervisory measures\u2014to get the job done.  Everything isn\u2019t a nail, and the best tool is not always a hammer.  You have to identify the problem that needs fixing and select the right tool for the job.  This is likely to require both official sector engagement and private sector initiative. \n\nIn the case of LIBOR, the official sector has taken a multi-pronged approach: strengthening the LIBOR regime, developing reference rate principles, using its convening authority to marshal private sector participation, supplying robust alternative reference rates, and using the bully pulpit to educate and spur action.  International coordination has featured strongly in these efforts, and should continue to do so.  This approach has achieved a great deal to date, but, in light of the risks and potential implications, will it be sufficient? \n\nThe transition away from LIBOR represents a significant risk event for firms of all sizes, and they should actively manage this transition through their existing frameworks for identification, management, and mitigation of risk.  Supervisors should continue to support this objective by ensuring that all firms are aware of the transition and that LIBOR-related issues are being addressed in a way that is commensurate with a firm\u2019s exposures and risks.  More broadly, the official sector will continue to push market participants to take all necessary steps to mitigate the risks to financial stability from a disorderly transition. \n\nIn closing, the LIBOR scandal certainly was one low point among many during the financial crisis and its aftermath.  It highlighted the need for reform of a critical area of the global financial system.  We have made considerable progress since then, but reform still has a long way to go.  The remaining work, by necessity, will involve purposeful collective action and engagement across the financial industry to address market-wide issues.  It also will require firm-specific action to manage individual risks.  The challenge is that the window for action is narrowing.  Therefore, we must redouble our efforts to ensure a successful transition from LIBOR to a more sound and durable regime. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

    "speaker": "Beverly Hirtle",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/hir180517",
    "content": "Good morning.  Today, we meet to discuss household balance sheets, with a particular focus on housing. \n\nOver the past decade, the New York Fed has invested heavily in improving its understanding of developments in the household sector.  We have built datasets and created reports and in-depth analyses, many of which we make widely available with the aim of helping the public\u2019s understanding.  This work recognizes the crucial role that households play in the economy and the financial system.  It also serves to underscore the connection between the mission of the New York Fed and the concerns of families in the Second District.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s actions have important effects on everyday \u201ckitchen table\u201d issues like mortgages and auto loans, and we remain focused on those effects, as today\u2019s presentation will demonstrate.  Before going further, I should note that my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAt the close of last year, American households in aggregate were the wealthiest they have ever been by many measures.  This piece of good economic news reflects the economic expansion that has continued for 106 months, among the longest on record.  The principal driving force behind increases in aggregate wealth has been the stock market.  Financial wealth, including stocks and other financial assets, now stands at over $80 trillion, more than 75% above the mid-2009 trough.  Of course, this is a positive development overall, but not everyone has shared in the good news.  Financial wealth is actually even more concentrated among households than income, with the top 10% of households holding 84% of stock market wealth.  In contrast, housing wealth\u2014which is much smaller in aggregate\u2014is a more important form of wealth across most of the income distribution.\n\nFor most families, their home tends to be their most valuable asset.  The exceptions are people at the very top of the wealth distribution, for whom financial assets are more important, and renters, who tend to have low or negative net worth.  The fact that housing wealth is so widely held makes its dynamics very important, yet growth in housing wealth has been quite uneven across households, for reasons that we will discuss today.\n\nHousing wealth nearly tripled between 1995 and 2006, exceeding $13 trillion by 2006.  As we well know, all forms of wealth in the United States were significantly impaired during the financial crisis.  Financial assets fell sharply in 2008, by almost 15%, but had recovered by 2010.  Housing wealth, however, started falling earlier\u2014in 2006\u2014and decreased about 35%.\n\nHouse prices began growing again in 2012, surpassed their previous peak in 2017, and are now almost 50% above their trough levels.  Unlike during the boom, however, when debt was rising nearly as fast as prices, debt growth this time has been much more quiescent.  Housing debt has risen just 6% over that same six-year period of 2012-2017. The combination of fast-growing house prices and slow growth in housing debt supported the complete recovery of housing wealth by early 2017.\n\nBut the fact that aggregate housing wealth has surpassed its previous peak does not mean that everything is the same.  In fact, there have been important shifts in the distribution of housing wealth that are critical for understanding the long-run effects of the housing cycle, as well as the outlook for the household sector.  In particular, the factors that determine housing wealth are not evenly spread across the population, and those relationships have changed since the pre-financial-crisis housing boom.  For example, household formation and transitions from renting into homeownership are much lower than their pre-crisis levels, especially among the young\u2014meaning fewer young people have benefitted from the increase in house prices.  At the same time, current homeowners have drawn on their equity at much lower rates relative to the pre-crisis years, which has supported rapid growth in wealth for those households.\n\nUnderstanding these changes is more difficult than observing them.  While it is possible that millennials are less interested in owning housing than previous demographic groups, survey results, including from our own Survey of Consumer Expectations, do not seem to support that notion.  In our survey, households (including current renters) continue to view housing as a good investment, and do not seem to see increased risk to owning.  So the change in behavior does not seem to be driven by changes in expectations caused by \u201cscarring\u201d from the financial crisis.  Nonetheless, that factor may be part of the explanation for why current homeowners have not used their home equity to finance consumption.\n\nA second important part of the story, I believe, is that mortgage credit has been quite tight in the wake of the financial crisis.  Tight credit can limit the scope for renters to become owners and for current homeowners to access their equity.  Several factors might be contributing to comparatively tight credit for housing finance, including regulation and financial institutions\u2019 wariness about housing as collateral in the wake of the last cycle.  Another important factor seems to be the increase in other forms of debt\u2014notably student loans\u2014among younger borrowers with lower credit scores.\n\nWhatever the causes, the implications are important: homeownership is down overall, and especially among the young.  Those who have gained the most housing wealth over the last decade\u2014older borrowers with high credit scores\u2014are probably less likely to need the credit that increased housing wealth could collateralize.  Those who do have a strong demand for credit and own some home equity may have trouble tapping it if they have less-than-stellar credit histories.  These phenomena have implications for the ability of households to finance consumption growth over the medium term.\n\nFrom the perspective of macroeconomic policy and stability, the overall result is a very strong household balance sheet, with high wealth and low debt in aggregate enabling the sector to absorb many of the shocks that might come its way.  Nonetheless, this sanguine picture is not fully representative, as the gains are distributed unevenly among current homeowners and between homeowners and renters.  The distribution is important, as it reflects who will likely bear the burden when the next economic downturn occurs.  Research by the New York Fed and others has illustrated the distress that delinquencies on consumer debt and housing expenses can have on families and communities.  What is perhaps most clear from the work we discuss today is that the shockwaves from the financial crisis continue to resound through the housing sector\u2014its aggregate recovery notwithstanding.  \n\nThank you for your kind attention. I\u2019ll now ask Andy Haughwout to provide details on these developments."

    "title": "Why Do Risk Events Occur? Insights from Accident Models",
    "date": "May 17, 2018",
    "speaker": "Joshua Rosenberg",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/ros180517",
    "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to present one of today\u2019s keynote addresses. Before I continue, I should note that the views presented here are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTwo of the most powerful questions in risk management are \u201cWhat if?\u201d and \u201cWhy?\u201d My remarks will focus on the second question, \u201cWhy?\u201d and more specifically on the question \u201cWhy do risk events occur?\u201d\n\nRisk events\u2014failures that impair an organization\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives\u2014provide a unique window into an organization\u2019s risk and control environment.1 Because risk events represent a translation of the possibility of risk to actuality of risk, we have much to learn from their causes. By understanding causes, we can improve our ability to design and implement controls to prevent, detect, and correct problems before they mature into risk events. In addition, after a risk event occurs, understanding causes helps us extract the right lessons, not just to fix the immediate issue, but also to address any underlying vulnerabilities.\n\nMy intention in this presentation is to explore the causes of risk events through the lens of models of organizational accidents. Based on the work of Rosness et. al.,2 Dekker et. al,3 and Yang and Haugan,4 I select four accident models: the barrier model, the information processing model, the conflicting objectives model, and the normal accident model. In my commentary, I draw heavily on their interpretation and analysis, but of course, any errors or misinterpretations are my own. While the accident literature also has important lessons for us on risk detection and risk response, I\u2019ll focus my remarks on risk prevention. Along the way, I\u2019ll highlight what we can take from these models to improve our ability to understand and manage enterprise risks.\n\nI start with the barrier model, which we can consider as a baseline model for understanding accidents.5 In the barrier model, an accident occurs when a hazard penetrates protective barriers and causes harm. Barriers can be \u201chard,\u201d like a guardrail placed between people and dangerous equipment, or \u201csoft,\u201d like safety rules, training, or management oversight. In James Reason\u2019s elaboration of the barrier model, the ideal condition of a barrier is solid, but the reality is that barriers have weaknesses or holes like a slice of Swiss cheese.6 These weaknesses can arise from human, technical, and organizational factors. They can be the result of design flaws or problems with implementation.\n\nWhat does the barrier model imply for risk event prevention? The barrier model tells us that risk events occur when threats penetrate barriers, so to prevent risk events we should either reduce threats or strengthen the barriers.7 This is familiar territory for risk managers, although we usually use the term \u201ccontrol\u201d rather than \u201cbarrier.\u201d Strengthening barriers in this context means designing and implementing effective controls, and then maintaining and monitoring those controls to make sure they continue to operate as intended. We are also quite familiar with the approach of establishing multiple barriers (or layered defenses) to provide more protection than a single barrier.\n\nThe second model is the information processing model developed by Barry Turner.8 It provides a different perspective on the causes of organizational accidents and, I would argue, important insights for enterprise risk management. While the barrier model evokes a physical connection between hazards and accidents, the information processing model is set in the context of an organization\u2019s own understanding\u2014or misunderstanding\u2014of its operations and risks. A key insight of the model is that what is usually considered a strength of large organizations\u2014their ability to create a shared outlook and direct common effort\u2014becomes a weakness when the shared outlook results in collective blindness to problems.\n\nIn this model, an accident occurs when an organization is unable to perceive, and therefore does not respond to, a long string of early warning signals that point to increasing danger. Here, accidents are \u201cman-made disasters\u201d that are the result of a failure of organizational intelligence. A frequently-cited application of this model is Diane Vaughan\u2019s analysis of the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster.9 In that work, she coins the term \u201cnormalization of deviance\u201d to describe how organizations can grow accustomed and unresponsive to signs of problems. One of my colleagues refers to this as noseblindness: that is, you will eventually become accustomed to any smell, no matter how bad it is.\n\nWhat does this imply for preventing risk events? In the information processing model, accidents are caused by failures of knowledge, perception, and communication, so that is also where the solutions lie. To avoid these risks, we should maintain a deep, broad, and current risk picture that is sensitive to changes in the internal and external environment. We should encourage a culture of vigilance and challenge of accepted beliefs, including seeking alternative, independent, and outside perspectives. And, our organizations should ensure that there are effective channels for timely risk communication and escalation.\n\nThe third model, Jens Rasmussen\u2019s conflicting objectives model, also identifies the organization itself as a source of risk, although in this case the focus is on incentive conflicts rather than information gaps.10 Accidents here are the end result of the incremental tradeoffs that managers and staff make every day as they balance competing demands on their time and attention. Because organizations face pressure to increase efficiency, many individuals make choices in their own work to favor production over safety.\n\nWhile each of these choices in isolation is innocuous, the incremental effect of each choice pushes the organization, step by step, beyond the boundary of safe operations and into an uncontrolled state that leads to an accident. Rasmussen suggests that several large-scale organizational accidents, including the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, were caused by \u201csystematic migration of organizational behavior toward accident under the influence of cost-effectiveness in an aggressive, competitive environment.\u201d11 It is not only cost that drives conflicting interests; career management and behavioral biases can also lead individuals to make decisions that favor short-term outcomes over the long-term interests of the organization.\n\nWhat are the lessons here for the prevention of risk events? In the language of this model, an organization should ensure that safety and performance priorities are balanced, that it is aware of where the boundary of safe operations is, and that it responds when it is too close to the boundary. This advice is in line with guidance and practice on the use of risk appetite as a core component of effective enterprise risk management.12 By articulating risk appetite and monitoring risk against appetite, organizations are better equipped to see their risks and manage them within appropriate boundaries.\n\nThere is an interesting connection between the last two models, both of which emphasize cultural and behavioral risks, and the concept of risk culture. In my view, a sound risk culture, as defined for example in the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB) risk culture framework, can address many of the risk drivers identified by these accident models.13\n\nThe FSB framework states that a \u201csound risk culture promotes an environment of open communication and effective challenge in which decision-making processes encourage a range of views; allow for testing of current practices; [and] stimulate a positive, critical attitude among employees.\u201d14 This should help organizations avoid failures of information processing. Furthermore, the FSB explains that in a sound risk culture, \u201c[p]erformance and talent management encourage and reinforce maintenance of the financial institution\u2019s desired risk management behaviour.\u201d15 So, by establishing incentives to emphasize effective risk management, an organization can lean against the pressures highlighted in the conflicting objectives model.\n\nThe normal accident model, developed by Charles Perrow, is the fourth model that I would like to share with you.16 This model focuses on complexity, interdependence, and opacity in the interplay between people, processes, and systems in large organizations. Here, large-scale accidents are a rare but normal outcome of multiple failures that interact in unpredicted ways. Perrow analyzes the nuclear meltdown at the Three Mile Island power plant as a case study of a normal accident.\n\nIn the normal accident model, barriers help prevent failures of individual components, but when barriers add to overall system complexity and opacity, they can contribute to major system failures. Ironically, the defenses that we establish to protect ourselves against small problems become the threats that can cause even larger problems. An important insight from the normal accident model is that systems with two characteristics\u2014high interactive complexity (likely to exhibit unexpected sequences of events) and tight coupling (where a change in one component leads to a rapid and strong change in other components)\u2014are at greatest risk of systemic failure. Systems with both of these characteristics, in Perrow\u2019s view, are destined to experience catastrophic accidents, in spite of our best efforts to control them.\n\nWhat do we learn when we look at risk in our organizations from the perspective of this model? One message is that we should simplify and streamline processes, especially those that are interactively complex and tightly coupled. We can look for and address instances where layered controls add, rather than reduce, risk due to an increase in overall complexity. More generally, organic accumulations of controls should be replaced with intentionally designed control systems. For example, frameworks, like Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Resilience Management Model, can be used to harmonize risk management activities across the enterprise.17\n\nAfter reviewing these four models, a sensible question to ask is, \u201cWhich one is right?\u201d As a response, I will give you an economist\u2019s answer: \u201cit depends.\u201d In my view, each of these models has lessons to teach, and which model is the most useful will depend on the context in which it is applied.18 In my view, the barrier model provides a practical approach to identify and analyze risks and controls. By broadly interpreting barriers to include aspects of organizational structure, culture, incentives, and information flow, I think the differences shrink between the barrier model, the information processing model, and the conflicting objectives model.19\n\nAs I said at the start, one of the reasons we want to understand why risk events occur is to improve our ability to prevent them. To go a bit further with this, let\u2019s modify the question \u201cWhy do risk events occur?\u201d and instead ask, \u201cWhy did this specific risk event occur?\u201d That leads us to the topic of learning from risk events. Here, we are looking not only to learn how to prevent the same failure from happening again, but also to find and remediate related vulnerabilities across the organization that would lead to future failures.\n\nWhen we investigate a risk event, we often look to root cause analysis as a tool to understand why. Root cause analysis fits well into the barrier model perspective; we have found the root cause of a risk event when we have identified the barriers that failed. And, importantly, the accident models give us a rich set of potential causes of a risk event to consider. The information processing and conflicting objectives models pull us away from the incident itself to look at broad organizational factors. The normal accident model leads us to question whether it is even possible to identify a clear cause amidst the tangled interactions of a complex system.\n\nOne thing that I have learned from the accident models is not to quickly or easily accept the answer that human error is the root cause of a risk event. James Reason makes a strong case that, while a human is likely to be the last and most visible link in the chain of an accident, human error is rarely the underlying cause. Reason draws our attention to work process and organizational causes such as \u201cunworkable procedures, clumsy automation, shortfalls in training, less than adequate tools and equipment\u201d and culture.20\n\nIn further defense of people, Hollnagel et al. introduce the concept of Safety I and Safety II.21 Under Safety I, the traditional view of safety, people are treated as hazards whose unreliability leads to accidents. Instead, Hollnagel et al. advocate a perspective, called Safety II, in which people are seen as mitigants in that they contribute flexibility and resilience to processes.\n\nHow an organization learns from its mistakes\u2014Is an independent investigation performed? Do lessons learned lead to change?\u2014is itself a reflection of its risk culture. I suggest that, when we are investigating risk events, we widen our field of vision using the perspectives of the accident models. As a starting point, here are some questions that might be worth adding to your repertoire.\n\nTo close, I\u2019ll draw your attention back to two effective tools we already have in our toolkit to address risks highlighted by organizational accident models: managing risks within risk appetite and reinforcing a sound risk culture. We should take full advantage of their potential."

    "title": "Opening Remarks at the ISO 20022 In-Person Federal Reserve Bank of New York Workshop",
    "date": "May 7, 2018",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/dzi180507",
    "content": "Good morning.  I am pleased to kick off the first in a series of ISO 20022 in-person workshops at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  I used to joke, \u201cISO 20022 in 20022, only 18,000 more years to go!\u201d  This has been a long trek, and surely we still have a long road ahead, but I am confident we are going to beat my original forecast.\n\nI understand that today\u2019s session follows a series of webinars to educate the community on the adoption of the ISO 20022 message formats for the Fedwire Funds Service.  These outreach activities underscore a key point: no effort in standardization can be pursued in isolation.  This enterprise is one whose success depends upon multilateral engagement across every front: infrastructure operators, depository institution customers, and vendors.  In this domain, we rise and fall as one.  We\u2019re glad you\u2019re here. \n\nAs conveyed in the public announcement of the Federal Reserve Banks at Sibos Toronto last Fall, and consistent with broader Federal Reserve strategies to enhance the efficiency of the payment system, we have planned a controlled migration to the new message format. Implementation of the ISO 20022 standard for the Fedwire Funds Service will be completed in three phases, beginning in November 2020 and ending in late 2023.  I will defer to my colleagues for a detailed review of our calendar and migration methodology. \n\nAllow me to share three brief but critical observations regarding the business problem, the collective opportunity, and the strategic context before I turn things over to the workshop speakers.  As always, my remarks reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFirst, an elaboration of the problem.  In the legacy environment we impose a tremendous tax upon users who must straddle multiple payments platforms that rely upon proprietary message formats that do not speak with each other.  Maintaining the operational integrity of this network requires a complex web of mapping and translation at each point of handoff in the payment flow.  In the extreme, a payment from a domestic originator to a foreign beneficiary may have to proceed through as many as six iterations of mapping and translation as it migrates through the payment system, adding complexity, introducing risk, and increasing cost at every juncture.   In an increasingly integrated and seamless world, this is no way to run a railroad. \n\nSecond, an elaboration of the collective opportunity.  Standardization around a common message format not only promotes efficiency in straight through processing and greater domestic/cross-border inter-operability, it also enhances value: providing richer data content, with extended remittance information for corporate users representing a prominent example; supporting compliance with regulatory requirements as depository institutions lever structured data fields; and encouraging innovation by all parties around a common message suite.   In pursuing ISO 20022, we must not merely content ourselves with efficiency gains, compelling as they may be, in a like-for-like conversion; we must equally focus on the value proposition for depository institutions and end-user customers.\n\nA final observation on the strategic context and the dollar\u2019s status as a global settlement currency.  A temptation sometimes exists in the United States to rely upon our enormous mass, to which, too frequently, we expect the world to adapt. That passive posture may have been tolerable in an era of static dominance, but in an era of global economic convergence, accompanied by frenetic payments innovation, it represents a luxury we can ill afford.  \n\nThe ISO 20022 payment message format is rapidly emerging as the global standard for high value payment system operators, with many jurisdictions having already adopted ISO 20022 message formats or announced their conversion plans.  We either move in concert with this emerging trend or risk the United States becoming idiosyncratic in its wake, aggravating the competiveness of U.S. financial institutions and corporates, and eroding the many advantages of denominating global economic activity in the dollar and settling dollar payments in the United States.\n\nThe positive and negative business cases for ISO adoption both point in the same direction, favoring action. \n\nIn support of this interest, we expect to continue extensive public outreach regarding our ISO 20022 adoption plans, which may include a request for public comment from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors later this year.  A formal comment period would provide another forum for industry participants to convey their feedback on the business case, implementation approach, and timeline for adopting the ISO 20022 message format for the Fedwire Funds Service.  If the Board decides to request public comment, we would appreciate your valuable feedback in that venue, and through today\u2019s session, to refine and ultimately validate our direction in implementation methodology and timeline.  \n\nThe adoption of ISO 20022 messages for the Fedwire Funds Service represents a strategic investment supporting the long term competitiveness of our financial institutions and end users, and strengthening the role of the dollar as a global settlement currency.  It is imperative that the anchor element of our nation's payment system remains well integrated in an increasingly global marketplace.\n\nThank you for your attention and enjoy your workshop."

    "title": "Operational Perspectives on Monetary Policy Implementation: Panel Remarks on \"The Future of the Central Bank Balance Sheet\"",
    "date": "May 4, 2018",
    "speaker": "Lorie K. Logan",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/log180504",
    "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to join this panel. \n\nThe panel\u2019s topic\u2014what we are normalizing to\u2014is a key issue facing central banks as they normalize monetary policy after the crisis, and I hope to bring to this discussion an operational perspective from my position on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Open Market Trading Desk.  I will highlight three points:  First, the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, once normalized, is likely to be smaller than it is today but considerably larger than it was before the crisis, regardless of the type of operating regime the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) adopts in the long run.  Second, while the FOMC could maintain interest rate control through a corridor system for its longer run monetary policy implementation framework, it would require a lot of learning by doing and would be unlikely to look like our pre-crisis corridor system.  And third, based on what we\u2019ve learned from operating a floor system thus far, it appears that this type of system can provide effective control of rates with operational simplicity.  Before I continue, I should note that the views presented here are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nLast October, the Federal Reserve began the process of reducing the size of its balance sheet\u2014a significant milestone in the ongoing monetary policy normalization process.  Using a program of progressively increasing caps, we are gradually reducing the Fed\u2019s securities holdings, which will reduce the supply of reserve balances in the banking system.2   This process will continue until reserves fall to a level that reflects the banking system\u2019s demand for reserve balances and the FOMC\u2019s decisions about how to implement monetary policy \u201cmost efficiently and effectively,\u201d as noted in the FOMC\u2019s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.\n\nHowever, there remains much uncertainty over what the \u201cnormal\u201d size of the Fed\u2019s longer-run balance sheet will be and how long it will take to get there.  This uncertainty arises from numerous sources:  We don\u2019t know how fast our MBS holdings will pay down, how quickly currency outstanding will grow, how many bank reserves will be required for the efficient and effective execution of monetary policy, or how other liability items on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet will evolve.  The economic outlook also poses an ever-present source of uncertainty.\n\nAlthough the Committee has not yet specified what a normalized balance sheet will look like, market participants\u2019 expectations may provide some helpful context.  The New York Fed\u2019s most recent annual report on open market operations (released just a few weeks ago) presents a set of projections for possible paths of the Fed\u2019s securities portfolio.3   As seen in Figure 1, the report shows three scenarios constructed from distributions of market participants\u2019 surveyed expectations for the future size of the balance sheet.4   Survey-based expectations for the path of interest rates and some staff modeling fill in additional details.  While these scenarios by no means embody the full range of possible outcomes, they suggest the domestic securities portfolio\u2019s size could normalize at $2.5 trillion to $3.3 trillion, with the larger end of that range projected to be reached within two years.  After its normalized size is reached, the portfolio is assumed to incrementally grow again as Treasury securities are purchased to keep pace with trend growth in liabilities, mainly currency.5\n\nThe projection exercise illustrates a key point:  The Fed\u2019s future balance sheet will likely be considerably larger than its pre-crisis level.  This outcome is likely regardless of the design of the operating regime that the Committee ultimately uses to manage short-term interest rates.  The normalized size will be determined by the liability side of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, which will reflect two driving factors:  Growth in non-reserve liabilities, and a potential shift in the structural demand for reserves.\n\nFirst, there has been substantial growth in the Federal Reserve\u2019s non-reserve liabilities in recent years, and some factors are expected to grow further, as seen in Figure 2.  U.S. dollar currency in circulation tends to grow over time and has more than doubled since the start of the global financial crisis, to a current level of $1.6 trillion.6   The median survey response implies an expectation for currency to grow to around $1.8 trillion at the time the size of the portfolio normalizes\u2014in other words, the portfolio will need to be $1 trillion larger than before the crisis just to back currency in circulation.  Meanwhile, various account holders\u2014including the Treasury Department, foreign and international official institutions, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and designated financial market utilities (DFMUs)\u2014have increased their balances held in Federal Reserve accounts or investment services, which currently represent over $700 billion in additional liabilities.\n\nSecond, it is likely there has been a shift in the structural demand for reserves, driven largely by banks\u2019 response to changes in regulations and risk appetite that favor safe assets, particularly reserves.  If the demand curve for reserves has indeed shifted out, the amount of reserves the Federal Reserve will need to supply to achieve a given interest rate target will be comparably larger than it once was.\n\nThe FOMC acknowledged in last June\u2019s addendum to its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that it anticipates a future level of reserve balances that is \u201cappreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.\u201d7   In the three projection scenarios I\u2019ve shown, reserve balances (as derived from market participants\u2019 expectations) are assumed to be around $400 billion, $600 billion, and $750 billion once a normalized balance sheet size is reached, well below the current level of $2 trillion and consistent with the Committee\u2019s statement.  However, we have insufficient information to identify what factors inform these views.\n\nTaking reserves and non-reserve liabilities together, I see virtually no chance of going back to the pre-crisis balance sheet size of $800 billion.  Thus, discussion of whether to have a large or small balance sheet in the long run partly misses the point.  The conversation is really about the relative amount of reserves, which will be governed both by the banking system\u2019s demand for reserve balances\u2014something we will learn more about during the process of balance sheet normalization\u2014and by the Committee\u2019s future decisions around how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively.\n\nDebates about monetary policy implementation regimes generally center on two frameworks, illustrated in stylized form in Figure 3.  The traditional framework\u2014a version of which the Fed used before the crisis\u2014is a corridor system, which is generally associated with a scarce supply of reserves.  Policy is implemented through frequent adjustments to the supply of reserves, such that the supply intersects the steep portion of the reserve demand curve at the desired overnight interest rate.  Fluctuations in reserves stemming from autonomous factors are borne by the private sector through the central bank\u2019s open market operations.  In contrast, the framework used to implement policy today is a floor system, which is associated with an abundant supply of reserves and policy implementation that is achieved through periodic changes to administered rates.  A floor system is generally associated with a relatively larger balance sheet than a corridor system because the central bank needs to supply enough reserves to satisfy demand on the flat part of the reserve demand curve, perhaps with an additional buffer to accommodate reserve supply shocks.  Such shocks typically stem from fluctuations in other liabilities.8   However, we do not really know how large or small a difference in the amount of reserves would be needed to run an effective and efficient floor versus a corridor in the longer run.  The answer will depend critically on the shape of the demand curve, which we will learn more about over time, as well as the specific design parameters of either framework.\n\nI would emphasize that central banks have successfully implemented both types of frameworks, or variations of them, and that the Fed can achieve interest rate control with either one.  Leaving aside some of the broader policy considerations, I\u2019d like to make a few points about the technical operation of each framework in the longer-run.\n\nFirst, some observers see a return to the Fed\u2019s pre-crisis, reserve-scarce corridor system as the natural conclusion to the normalization process, highlighting that system\u2019s familiarity.  But it is important to note that fundamental changes in the money market landscape over the past decade would likely make monetary policy implementation in a future corridor system look substantially different than before the crisis.\n\nIn the Fed\u2019s pre-crisis regime, hitting the target federal funds rate each day was a technically challenging exercise.  Demand for reserves was driven largely by reserve requirements, in addition to intraday payment clearing needs.  We started with a banking system that on most days was short of reserves.  Then, using staff forecasts of various factors affecting the supply of and demand for reserves over multiple days ahead, we calibrated open market operations with the dealers in the repo market to bring the aggregate supply of reserves into balance at the target rate.  With this aggregate balance achieved, individual banks distributed them. Banks facing a deficiency of reserves needed to find and trade with banks holding reserve surpluses, each balancing the costs associated with holding too many or too few reserves.9, 10   We were reliably proficient in hitting the FOMC\u2019s target rate in normal times, but interest rate control was more challenging at times when factors affecting reserves were harder to predict.  This was particularly true in the early stages of the crisis, when large changes in reserve demand caused significant intraday and interday swings in federal funds rates (Figure 4).11, 12\n\nToday, with greater uncertainty and variability in factors affecting the day-to-day demand for and supply of reserves, it would be more difficult to anticipate fluctuations and achieve the necessary balance in reserve conditions even in normal times.  In aggregate, reserve demand is likely to be guided by a more complex set of drivers, including post-crisis liquidity regulation, supervision, resolution planning, and intraday payments risk management.  These needs have the potential to contribute to higher and more variable demand for reserves than banks had before the crisis.13   Estimating reserve demand would need to take into account these factors, as well as banks\u2019 propensities to substitute between reserves and other relevant assets\u2014something that may vary according to an individual institution\u2019s business strategy.  Knowledge about the shape, position, and stability of banks\u2019 reserve demand curve will likely emerge only with experience. \n\nAdditionally, we would need to consider shocks that affect the supply of reserves, such as those stemming from changes in the Fed\u2019s non-reserve liabilities. As seen in Figure 5, net changes in non-reserve liabilities have become more variable in recent years.14\n\nEven if fluctuations could be accurately forecast, in a corridor system, they would need to be offset through open market operations to maintain interest rate control.  Larger fluctuations would likely require larger operations.15   In the years before the crisis, the average size of daily overnight repo operations was around $5 billion\u2014a relatively small amount given the size of the repo market and dealers\u2019 net securities financing needs.  Roughly 95 percent of these operations were for less than $10 billion, and the maximum operation size in normal times was $20 billion.  Looking just at recent variability in non-reserve liabilities and assuming overnight operations were used to offset their fluctuations, daily temporary operations in a corridor system might routinely need to be around $25 billion, but could go as high as $100 billion.16   We would need to consider whether the Fed\u2019s repo and reverse repo operations could be dependably scaled to that degree, and whether their effects would be transmitted to other rates. \n\nOne consideration in this regard is that there appear to be greater frictions across funding markets today.  Dealer balance sheets have shrunk and become less elastic in the face of changes in regulation and risk management.17   While dealer caution contributes to the overall safety and soundness of the banking sector, it could mean we would need more or different types of counterparties for traditional repo operations, or perhaps different types of operations altogether\u2014particularly if federal funds trading became idiosyncratic or disconnected from other rates.  In sum, a reinstated corridor might look less familiar than some expect.\n\nFor comparison, let me make a few observations about our experience with the floor system that the Fed is currently using.  The FOMC has successfully raised its target range for the overnight federal funds rate six times since December 2015, and, as seen in Figure 6, the effective federal funds rate has reliably printed in the prevailing target range over that time.  The policy stance has transmitted to a broad constellation of money market rates.  The system is simple and efficient to operate.  The interest rate the Fed pays on excess reserves serves as the primary policy implementation tool, with support from a standing facility that offers overnight reverse repos (ON RRPs) at an administered rate.18   There is no need to forecast specific factors affecting reserves or to conduct discretionary open market operations each day; overnight reverse repos are offered every day based on price, not quantity.  Day-to-day fluctuations in factors affecting reserves are accommodated by the elastic reserve demand given that reserve needs are widely met.  Market forces keep the federal funds rate in the FOMC\u2019s target range by allowing a wide range of counterparties to price trades against the alternative option of investing with the Federal Reserve.  And in the aggregate, use of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet is efficient by allowing private and official sector market participants to determine their preferred distribution across the range of Fed liabilities.19\n\nThis system could continue to work well with considerably lower levels of reserves, so long as the supply continued to intersect the flat part of the demand curve.  If reserves fell too low, we could see high volumes of fed funds borrowing at interest rates well above the interest rate on excess reserves, which would indicate that we were no longer operating at the flat part of the demand curve.20   As I noted earlier, maintaining a buffer of excess reserves to absorb reserve-draining shocks could prevent this outcome.  An important trade-off arises between the size of that additional buffer and the frequency and size of open market operations.21\n\nTo sum up, the FOMC could choose to retain the floor system to implement policy in the longer-run or it could choose to shift back to a corridor system.  However, a reinstated corridor system may be less familiar than some expect.  Such a framework would involve uncertainties about reserve demand and greater variability in factors affecting reserve supply, and would likely require operations that are larger, more variable, or even very different from those used before the crisis.  Meanwhile, those who favor a floor system may be encouraged by the performance of our current framework to date.  We\u2019ve learned that the floor system has proven to be highly effective at controlling the effective federal funds rate and other money market rates, is resilient to significant shifts in market structure, and is efficient to operate.  Under either framework, the balance sheet will likely normalize at a level substantially larger than it was before the crisis to accommodate higher demand for reserves and non-reserve liabilities in the post-crisis landscape.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today at Lehman College.  In my remarks, I will focus on the economic outlook\u2014both over the near and longer term\u2014and I will discuss some of the important monetary policy issues that will be considered in the years ahead, after my tenure at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is (sadly) over.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nOver the near term, the economic outlook remains quite favorable.  I anticipate that the economy will continue to grow at an above-trend pace in 2018 and 2019, which will put sufficient pressure on the nation\u2019s resources to push up inflation to the FOMC\u2019s longer-run 2 percent objective. \n\nThere are several reasons to be confident in this growth outlook: Monetary policy remains accommodative, financial conditions are still easy, and the global economy is in the midst of a synchronized expansion.  Moreover, significant fiscal policy stimulus from tax cuts and increased federal spending will boost real household disposable income and corporate profits, which should support further gains in consumption and capital spending. \n\nIn this context, I would not take much signal from the slowdown in consumer spending in the first two months of this year.  As I see it, this slowdown was mostly due to two transitory factors: a retrenchment following the spurt in activity from recovery efforts following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the delay in this year\u2019s tax refund payments to those receiving certain tax credits.2   \n\nStrong payroll employment gains also suggest that the slowdown in household spending will be temporary.  Over the last three months, payroll gains have climbed to a monthly pace of 202,000 jobs, somewhat above 2017\u2019s monthly average of 182,000.  Robust job gains coupled with moderate growth in labor compensation should ensure that household incomes will continue to rise at a solid rate, even before factoring in the impact of this year\u2019s reduction in personal income taxes. \n\nWith respect to inflation, most of the evidence is consistent with a slow movement toward the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective.  On a year-over-year basis through February, the overall Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index and the core PCE price index\u2014which excludes the more volatile food and energy components\u2014have risen by 1.8 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, from troughs of 1.4 percent and 1.3 percent last summer.  Further gains appear likely at the end of this month, when the sharp decline in cellular telephone services prices that occurred a year ago drops out of the year-over-year calculations.    \n\nIn the current environment, I see three important issues regarding the appropriate monetary policy stance:\n\nI will take each of these in turn.\n\nAs I see it, a gradual path of interest rate increases remains appropriate.  Even though the unemployment rate is low, inflation remains below our 2 percent objective.  As long as that is true, the case for tightening policy more aggressively does not seem compelling.  My conclusion is reinforced by the fact that we do not know with much precision how low the unemployment rate can go without prompting a significant rise in inflation.  We do not directly observe the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU.  Rather, we only infer it from the response of wage compensation and price inflation as the labor market tightens.  \n\nAlso, the U.S. labor market may have more slack than the 4.1 percent unemployment rate suggests.  Over the past six months, the unemployment rate has remained steady despite robust payroll gains.  As the labor market has improved, more people have been actively seeking employment.  As a result, the labor force participation rate has flattened out despite the ongoing aging of the workforce population.  Furthermore, because the U.S. labor force participation rate for prime age workers is low compared to many advanced economies, the labor market could conceivably improve even further before encountering significant resource constraints. \n\nThat said, the Federal Reserve should not overstay its welcome.  It is important to get monetary policy back to a neutral setting before the labor market becomes so tight that wages and prices begin to rise at a pace inconsistent with the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent inflation objective.  Our mandate from Congress is maximum sustainable employment and price stability\u2014not simply a high level of employment at one point of the business cycle. \n\nWith respect to how far the FOMC should go in removing monetary policy accommodation, two major issues stand out.  First, what represents a neutral monetary policy setting?  Second, under what circumstances would it be appropriate to move beyond neutral to a restrictive setting?\n\nUnfortunately, we do not also observe the neutral real (i.e., adjusted for inflation) short-term interest rate, or r*.  There is a wide range of estimates at any time, and they evolve as the economic environment changes.  For example, all else equal, continued buoyant financial conditions amid recent and anticipated future rate hikes imply that r* may be higher than previously estimated.  A shift to a more stimulative fiscal policy could also imply a somewhat higher r*, at least temporarily. \n\nOne\u2019s view of the neutral rate may also be influenced by one\u2019s assessment of the longer-term economic environment.  For example, if we are in a period of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d\u2014characterized by chronic excess global savings and aging populations\u2014then one would expect r* to remain persistently low.3 But, if we are in a world of abating headwinds as we recover from the financial crisis, then one would expect r* to rise over time.  This lack of clarity about the environment increases the degree of uncertainty about the level of r*.\n\nDespite all these uncertainties, one still has to have a viewpoint.  In the current circumstances, I would judge that r* over the medium term is likely to be somewhere around 1 percent.  Although that is higher than the estimates from some models, I have nudged up my estimate because financial conditions are still easy and fiscal policy will likely be quite stimulative in 2018 and 2019.4 \n\nIf the neutral real interest rate is around 1 percent, there is still some distance to go before monetary policy actually gets tight.  At the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent inflation objective, my estimate of r* implies that the federal funds rate would need to rise to around 3 percent for monetary policy to be considered neutral.  Of course, as the factors that influence r* change, my estimate of r* will also move around over time. \n\nWhether monetary policy will need to move to a restrictive setting depends crucially on how low the unemployment rate can go without inflation climbing meaningfully above 2 percent.  Although the jury is still out on this question, last month\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, is instructive.5  Most FOMC participants\u2014including me\u2014have the unemployment rate moving considerably below their estimate of NAIRU by 2020, with inflation climbing slightly above 2 percent and the federal funds rate moving above their estimates of its likely long-run value.  Thus, the March SEP implies that most FOMC participants expect that monetary policy will need to become slightly restrictive in the years ahead. \n\nRecent fiscal and trade policy developments are likely to increase the uncertainty around the distance to a neutral monetary policy stance and the possibility that the FOMC will have to move to a restrictive stance.  The shift in fiscal policy toward stimulus is somewhat challenging because of its timing\u2014it is unusual to move fiscal policy sharply in a stimulative direction at a mature stage of a business cycle\u2014and because the shift puts the nation\u2019s fiscal path on an unsustainable trajectory.  According to the projections released earlier this month from the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, the federal budget deficit is anticipated to exceed 4\u00bd percent of GDP in 2019, well above the level that would be needed to keep the federal debt-to-GDP ratio from rising.6  Moreover, the CBO expects that the pressures on the budget will be substantial over the next decade, with deficit projections ranging between 4\u00bd and 5\u00bd percent of GDP throughout the period.  Debt service costs will move sharply upward in coming years as federal debt continues to grow and interest rates likely increase further.  Additionally, entitlement spending is likely to increase sharply as members of the baby boom generation continue to retire\u2014myself included.7 \n\nThe shift toward a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade also likely increases uncertainty.  On the one hand, such a posture could lead to revised trade agreements that provide the United States with greater access to foreign markets and better protection of intellectual property.  This would tend to raise U.S. productivity and real GDP growth.  On the other hand, tougher bargaining could lead to retaliation and higher trade barriers, here and abroad.  In contrast to the first scenario, this outcome would be quite negative\u2014leading to higher inflation, lower productivity, and slower potential GDP growth.8  Over time, how U.S. trade policy evolves will have important implications for the performance of the U.S. economy\u2014and, by extension, for U.S. monetary policy.  By increasing uncertainty around the economic outlook, these shifts in fiscal and trade policy could make it more difficult for the FOMC to achieve its dual mandate objectives in the years ahead. \n\nLonger-term Monetary Policy Issues\n\nOver the longer term, the FOMC will also need to address a number of other important issues.  These include: 1) Determining the appropriate long-term implementation framework for U.S. monetary policy, and 2) deciding whether the strategic framework underlying monetary policy decisions needs to be adjusted to mitigate the risks associated with getting pinned at the effective lower bound for short-term interest rates.9 \n\nFor the first issue, I see two options: return to the \u201ccorridor\u201d-type system that was in place prior to the financial crisis, or remain with the framework that has been in place since the crisis\u2014namely, a \u201cfloor\u201d system.  In a corridor system, reserves in the banking system are scarce, and the federal funds rate is set by adjusting the supply of reserves through open market operations to balance demand and supply at the FOMC\u2019s target range.  In contrast, in a floor system, reserves are abundant, so that the interest rate the Federal Reserve pays on excess reserves, or IOER, is the primary tool used to control the federal funds rate. \n\nIn my view, the case for retaining the current floor system is very compelling for a number of reasons.  First, it is operationally much less complex than a corridor system.  In the current regime, the setting of IOER is largely sufficient to maintain the federal funds rate within the FOMC\u2019s target range, as we have seen over the past few years.10  In contrast, a corridor system requires forecasting the many exogenous factors that affect the amount of bank reserves outstanding, and then engaging in open market operations on a near daily basis to keep reserves at a level consistent with the FOMC\u2019s target range.11  This task would likely be more difficult now because of greater fluctuation in these exogenous factors relative to when the corridor regime was last in place. \n\nSecond, a corridor system constrains the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to provide the types of lender-of-last-resort backstops that can help support financial stability.  Prior to gaining the authority to pay interest on reserves in the fall of 2008, Federal Reserve officials\u2014myself included\u2014were faced with a question: if the take-down on a proposed liquidity facility were large, how would we be able to drain the added reserves on a timely basis to maintain control of the federal funds rate?  This was not just a theoretical issue during the financial crisis.  The initial auctions of the Term Auction Facility, or TAF, were kept relatively small, in part, because of concerns that larger programs would make it more difficult for the manager of the System Open Market Account (me, in that particular case) to drain sufficient reserves to offset the TAF reserve additions.  Similarly, the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)\u2014which involved the swap of Treasury collateral from the Federal Reserve against lower-quality collateral held by primary dealers\u2014was introduced in large part because collateral swaps, unlike cash loans, did not affect the amount of reserves in the banking system.  My overall point is that broad-based, open-ended lender-of-last-resort facilities are more difficult to accommodate in a corridor system because of the need to drain any reserve additions to keep the federal funds rate close to the FOMC\u2019s target. \n\nI see this as an important shortcoming of the pre-crisis corridor regime that does not get sufficient attention.  Having the ability to introduce broad and credible lender-of-last-resort backstops\u2014well secured by pledged collateral\u2014can be critical when confidence falters and financial stability is at risk.  Private sector participants are more likely to continue to engage with their counterparties\u2014and to borrow and lend\u2014when they know a central bank backstop will be available if economic and financial conditions deteriorate.  A corridor regime could cause the Federal Reserve to delay or avoid providing such backstops, which could increase financial stability risks by causing lenders and borrowers to disengage with one another earlier.12\n\nAlthough the FOMC has not made a final decision about a future framework for implementing monetary policy, meeting minutes confirm that participants recognize the advantages of a floor system.  As the November 2016 FOMC minutes note: \u201cMeeting participants commented on the advantages of using an approach to policy implementation in which active management of the supply of reserves would not be required\u2026.[S]uch an approach was seen as likely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.\u201d13\n\nThe second major issue facing the FOMC is whether to change its strategic framework to mitigate the risk of a return to the effective lower bound for interest rates.  Once the federal funds rate is close to zero, the FOMC is constrained in its ability to lower short-term interest rates further, and the other available policy options to provide monetary policy stimulus may be less effective.  If the FOMC were unable to provide sufficient stimulus, the economy could have difficulty recovering.  In turn, inflation and inflation expectations could fall\u2014and thus raise real interest rates\u2014effectively tightening monetary policy and making the task of generating a sustainable recovery even more difficult. \n\nSome have argued that a desirable way to reduce this risk would be to raise the FOMC\u2019s inflation objective from 2 percent to perhaps 3 or 4 percent.  Their reasoning is that if the inflation objective were somewhat higher, nominal interest rates at the later stages of the business cycle would also tend to be higher, which would provide greater scope for the FOMC to cut short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy, if necessary. \n\nWhile recognizing that there is a legitimate effective lower bound risk, I do not support the option of raising the inflation objective, for three reasons.  First, I doubt that a higher inflation target would be viewed as consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s Congressional mandate to pursue price stability.  Our employment and inflation mandates have been established by Congress, not by the Federal Reserve. \n\nSecond, the risks of being pinned at the effective lower bound for interest rates may be overstated.  Only once in the postwar period have we reached the zero lower bound.  Upending several decades of effort to anchor inflation expectations around 2 percent might be too high a price to pay to reduce the effective lower bound risk by what might prove to be a small amount.  In this vein, it is important to recognize that the FOMC now has a more credible set of tools available to use at the effective lower bound than it did in 2008, when those tools were largely unproven.  Forward guidance about the path of short-term interest rates and quantitative easing have been effective in providing monetary policy stimulus in the post-crisis period.  Because this is now more broadly appreciated, households and businesses should be more confident that the Federal Reserve has sufficient tools available at the effective lower bound to generate a sustainable economic recovery.  This greater confidence, in turn, should help keep inflation expectations from declining\u2014which should also mitigate the risks associated with hitting the lower bound. \n\nThird, there are arguably better ways of reducing risks associated with the effective lower bound than a higher inflation objective.  In particular, Congress could increase the size and scope of the automatic fiscal stabilizers that support economic activity and income during economic downturns.  For example, Congress could enact legislation in which employment payroll taxes would be automatically reduced when the unemployment rate rose above a particular threshold.  With such stabilizers in place, households and businesses would anticipate additional income support in the face of a cyclical downturn.  This approach would be more powerful than discretionary fiscal actions that carry a greater degree of uncertainty.\n\nAnother option to help better anchor inflation expectations around the current objective would be to move to a price-level targeting, or PLT, regime.  Under the current inflation targeting regime, the FOMC follows a \u201cbygones are bygones\u201d policy: Misses of the inflation objective on one side are not deliberately offset by subsequent misses on the other.  Therefore, when inflation runs persistently below the objective, policymakers do not strive to push inflation above the objective in the future.  Under these conditions, the risk is that inflation expectations will become unanchored to the downside.  In contrast, under a price-level targeting regime, the FOMC would commit to make up any shortfalls below its 2 percent objective by allowing inflation to climb above the objective for the time necessary to eliminate the shortfall.  This commitment to offsetting the period of below-target inflation with a period of above-target inflation would, presumably, help keep inflation expectations from becoming unanchored to the downside. \n\nHowever, a symmetric PLT regime\u2014in which misses have to be made up on both sides of the inflation objective\u2014has an important shortcoming.  Compensating for inflation overshoots by deliberately keeping inflation below the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective would increase the risk of getting pinned at the effective lower bound for interest rates. \n\nAs a consequence, some\u2014including former Chairman Ben Bernanke\u2014have proposed adopting an asymmetric PLT regime.  In such a system, misses below the objective would be offset by misses above only when the effective lower bound was binding.  Under normal circumstances, misses above the objective would not be offset.  Rather, they would be treated as \u201cbygones,\u201d as is currently the case.14\n\nHowever, I suspect that establishing a modified PLT regime would present some challenges.  First, for such a modified PLT to be effective in anchoring inflation expectations, households and businesses would have to understand how the regime would work, and view the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment as credible.  One can imagine that such credibility might be hard to sustain during a long spell of inflation misses to the downside.  Second, while such a regime might be attractive in broad brush form, the devil lies in the details.  If inflation undershot for a few years, what would the desired overshoot path look like?  How high would the FOMC permit inflation to go above its objective, and for how long?  What would happen if the Fed failed to fully offset past downside misses and cumulative undershoots became sizable? \n\nMy view is that we should further study how PLT frameworks might work in practice.15  But, it is possible that a simpler approach of committing to keeping the average inflation rate around 2 percent over the medium term might be just as appealing.  It might be sufficient to better anchor inflation expectations while avoiding the communication challenges and complexity of an asymmetric PLT regime. \n\nIn this vein, I also would evaluate whether the inflation goal should be recast as a range of, perhaps, 1\u00bd to 2\u00bd percent, from the current 2 percent objective.  A range might have several advantages over a point target.  First, it might be viewed as more realistic given that measured inflation will always randomly fluctuate relative to its underlying trend. That is to say, even if the FOMC performs its job exceedingly well, very rarely will the inflation rate, as measured by the PCE price index, be precisely at 2 percent.  Second, having a relatively narrow range would send a message that the FOMC is discriminating between two regimes\u2014one in which inflation is within the range and concerns about inflation are low, versus another in which inflation is outside the range and concerns about inflation are more elevated.  \n\nEven so, I would not recommend shifting to such a range currently.  I would only consider doing so once the FOMC has successfully and sustainably pushed inflation back to its 2 percent objective.  Making such a change now might be viewed as \u201cmoving the goal posts,\u201d given the persistent shortfall of inflation in recent years relative to the objective.  And, doing so now might imply a greater tolerance for missing inflation to the low side in an asymmetric way.  That would not be desirable at a time when inflation expectations are, if anything, too low, rather than too high relative to the FOMC\u2019s objective. \n\nTo sum up, the economy is broadly in a good place and the short-term economic outlook remains favorable.  On a personal level, I am pleased that I will be leaving my current position at a time when the FOMC is likely to be very close to its employment and inflation objectives\u2014recognizing, of course, the terrible damage of the financial crisis and the long time it has taken to get here. \n\nUncertainty about trade policy and the fact that we are now on an unsustainable fiscal path, however, have raised the longer-term risks.  With respect to monetary policy, there are a number of important choices the FOMC will need to make in the years ahead.  I have outlined some of my preferences today: continuing with the current floor system for the implementation of monetary policy, and some of the steps that we could take to reduce the risk should interest rates return to the effective lower bound in the future. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

    "content": "Good afternoon.  I am conscious that I am the concluding speaker for today\u2019s conference, a line usually followed by \u201cand the only thing that separates you from the bar.\u201d  In this case, I\u2019m the only thing that separates you from the gold vault, which may be even more compelling, so I\u2019ll keep things brief, but hopefully meaningful.\n\nAllow me to share two preliminary comments as prelude to formal remarks:\n\nFirst, convening this conference underscores for me and my colleagues that fulfillment of Federal Reserve mandates in monetary policy, supervision, and financial services does not constitute an end to itself, but a means to an end.   The end is to foster conditions and to provide services that support robust and sustainable economic activity on which our nation depends and in which community banks play an integral, indeed indispensable, role. \n\nMay those of us who have the privilege of serving this great institution, and working within these walls, never forget the ultimate object of our mandate, at which you sit at the center.\n\nSecond, my perspective in addressing you today is not as overseer, or as policy maker, but as head of Financial Services at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  In other words, perhaps uniquely in the constellation of the Federal Reserve System, my colleagues and I work for you.  My standing before you represents a visceral reminder of our accountability to depository institutions, independent of size, which rely upon our services to send and receive time critical payments; to maintain and permit the transfer of Fedwire eligible securities; and to provide cash services to support the needs of consumers and commercial establishments.   \n\nIt is with this orientation that I offer these remarks today, which reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nThe theme of today\u2019s conference, appropriately, has been \u201cNavigating Future Risks for Community Banks\u201d.  Allow me to elaborate upon the single risk that dominates from my vantage, regrettably not a \u201cfuture risk\u201d but an all too present one, and to highlight some of the measures that we are taking in response.  The risk to which I refer is not a function of regulatory pressure, or capital demands, or an evolving economy, or compliance challenges, or the proliferation of new technologies, or an unprecedented season of payments innovation, or the challenging competitive landscape.  All of these may represent very real risks, and no doubt occupy your consciousness, to borrow the lyrics of a prior generation, \u201ceight days a week\u201d. \n\nRather, building upon the theme of your prior panel discussion, the risk that dominates from my parochial view is the escalating and evolving cyber threat to our financial and payment systems, representing the challenge of our generation.  The orientation that I want to pursue, reflecting this audience, is not what we are doing within the Federal Reserve to harden our critical infrastructure.  While that is a manic and consuming preoccupation it is not my focus today.  Instead, I want to concentrate on endpoint security vulnerabilities to the payments system, in which partnership with the institutions in this room represents an indispensable element of success.  \n\nHistorically, market infrastructures have operated on the presumption that endpoint security is principally the responsibility of the endpoint, and infrastructure security is principally the responsibility of the operator.  In the United States, the legal framework for wholesale funds transfers codifies that presumption, with each actor assigned responsibility for that part of security most within its control.  Yet, in the present environment endpoint security breaches can have serious implications for public confidence in the integrity of the network as a whole, even in circumstances when the operator\u2019s infrastructure, applications, and security perimeter have not been compromised.  A series of recent high profile events have underscored dramatically this endpoint security risk, a theme that has also captured the attention of global policy makers. \n\nAs operator of a payment system in which a Fedwire Funds transfer is immediate, final, and irrevocable, and for which a single transfer can be affected for a penny shy of $10 billion, the Federal Reserve Banks recognize that the stakes for public confidence are incomprehensibly large; as users of said payment system, you realize the stakes for endpoints in terms of reputational risk and financial viability are equally profound.  Our fates in this domain are inextricably linked. \n\nWork to mitigate endpoint security risks in support of our collective interest proceeds across multiple fronts, including efforts to enhance end-to-end understanding of the security relationships within a network; initiatives to enhance assurance that external endpoints are operating in adherence with an operator\u2019s security requirements; and the development of application tools to enhance a participant\u2019s management of fraud risk.  I want to elaborate upon three recent actions we have taken to enhance endpoint security, and to provide a preview of additional measures in train.  Each of these actions, I will suggest, has particular relevance for community banks:\n\nCollectively, these measures represent material enhancements in endpoint security controls supporting the payment system.  At the same time, given an escalating threat environment that is not static, we cannot stand still.  Therefore, looking forward, we are presently considering another wave of application level enhancements to give depository institutions greater control of their payment activity, such as an exploration of tools that will identify anomalous payments relative to historical patterns; contemplating a further expansion of real-time monitoring to include all depository institutions; and considering adoption of an assurance program to enhance confidence that external endpoints are operating in adherence with security requirements.  We recognize, especially in the resiliency and security domains, that either intentionally we are progressing or inevitably we are regressing; given the technological sophistication and guile of our adversaries, there is no idleness.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet\u2019s pivot in conclusion from the age of electronic payments to the payment form of antiquity.  Many of you will shortly tour the gold vault, the largest such repository in the world, representing approximately one third of the world\u2019s known supply.  You will immediately discern upon descending to the bedrock of Manhattan, marveling at the massive vault door, appreciating the multi-faceted control environment, that payments security is a timeless preoccupation.\n\nHardly any of the gold in the vaults of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the property of the United States, whose reserves you know from 007 lore reside in Ft. Knox.  Instead, it is gold held on behalf of foreign and international monetary authorities.  Indulge me, if you will, in a fascinating historical anecdote in the annals of official reserve custody, which I will endeavor, perhaps feebly, to tie to today\u2019s theme.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War was a brutal conflict that pitted Nationalist rebel forces, allied with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, against the Republican government supported by the Soviet Union.  In 1938, with their government on the cusp of implosion and before fleeing into exile, the Republicans hastily sent their gold stock to their trusted ally, the Soviet Union, for safekeeping.  This episode is recounted in a history of the Spanish Civil War by Hugh Thomas, who writes the following:\n\nSometimes there is illustrative power in a negative example, even from one whose transgressions went exceedingly beyond being an untrustworthy custodian.  The antithesis of what this Bank stands for could not be expressed with more force or greater clarity.\n\nThe ultimate foundation of this institution, you see, far beyond its technical capacities in monetary policy execution, or its supervision of financial institutions, or its provision of financial services, is trust.    \n\nThis trust must be earned, every day, across every mandate, especially in an era in which confidence in public institutions has waned.  The nature of this trust is fickle: it accrues slowly, and can evaporate instantly.  It is a charge we take very seriously, especially when it comes to the resiliency and security of the foundational elements of our nation\u2019s payment system.  \n\nThank you for your generous attention today.  I\u2019d be pleased to respond to a few questions."

    "date": "Apr 18, 2018",
    "speaker": "Kevin J. Stiroh",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/sti180418",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, it\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to the 2018 Community Bankers Conference.  This is the third Community Bankers Conference that I\u2019ve attended since becoming the head of Supervision at the New York Fed and it is great to see the turnout continue to grow.  This year we are fortunate to have nearly one hundred fifty representatives from community banks throughout the Federal Reserve\u2019s Second District and more than forty regulatory colleagues from multiple federal and state agencies.\n\nEach year I look forward to this conference as it offers us, as regulators and supervisors, an unparalleled opportunity to exchange views and perspectives, to identify challenges and opportunities, and to promote a robust dialogue with senior managers and directors of smaller financial institutions in the Second District.  This type of constructive engagement is critical for us as we work to promote a safe and sound financial system that supports a strong economy.\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s conference\u2014\u201cNavigating Future Risks for Community Banks\u201d\u2014is centered on change, which is appropriate when one considers the broad set of forces transforming the U.S. financial system.  As you all know, the banking industry is confronting a series of emerging challenges and environmental changes such as a rising interest rate environment, new businesses and technologies that may disrupt the traditional financial services industry, and novel cyber-threats that seek to exploit our highly interconnected society.  In addition, over the past year or so, we\u2019ve witnessed significant turnover in the leadership at federal regulatory bodies including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC, which has the potential to change the regulatory environment.  And, finally on the legislative front, Congress is currently considering the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which if passed in current form would entail the most significant statutory change to the U.S. banking regulatory framework since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010.  All of this change presents both opportunities and threats.\n\nFor my remarks today, I\u2019d like to explore three specific changes that are relevant for community banks:  first, a shift in community banks\u2019 business models in response to market changes and regulatory pressures; second, the growing competition and potential disruption introduced by \u201cfintech\u201d firms; and third, the critical threat that cybersecurity risks pose to all community banks.  Following my remarks and throughout the day, I look forward to hearing from you about these forces as well as on other changes, trends, and challenges that you and your firms are facing.\n\nBefore I begin, I\u2019d like to thank the organizers of this conference for putting together today\u2019s informative and timely program, as well as our many speakers and panelists for their participation.  In addition, please note that my comments today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCommunity Bank Business Models: Recent Trends\n\nI\u2019ll begin with some observations on recent trends in community bank lending.  This perspective is critical because, as New York Fed President Bill Dudley stated in his welcoming remarks, community banks are a vital component of the U.S. banking system.  They provide an array of financial services to a wide range of customers and business sectors.  This is particularly important as many of these sectors are considered \u201cunderserved\u201d due to the limited presence of physical banking locations in their locales.\n\nAs background, the New York Fed is the primary supervisor for 17 community banks and over 100 bank holding companies that operate throughout Upstate New York, in parts of Connecticut and New Jersey, and in the greater New York City area.  Our staff in supervision monitors trends and emerging risks in the financial services industry across the Second District, including those associated with community banks. These analyses along with insights we gain directly from interaction with community bankers inform our supervisory programs and allow us to tailor our examination strategy and risk-focus for community banks.  \n\nI\u2019ll highlight a few interesting trends that our examiners and analysts have observed through this monitoring.  For the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, aggregate Second District community bank loans grew by 46 percent.1  These loans were often funded by non-core funding sources, which grew by 49 percent in the aggregate over the same period.  This raised concerns among supervisors who consider non-core funding sources as higher risk from a safety and soundness perspective.\n\nMoreover, the primary source of loan growth for this period was commercial real estate.  In response to this growing CRE concentration, the Fed intensified its monitoring of this sector and directed our supervisory focus toward how firms are risk-managing their CRE portfolios.\n\nMore recently, during 2017, we saw more moderate asset growth for community banking organizations in the District\u2014approximately 7.5 percent\u2014which is in line with national peer group averages.  Aggregate loan growth in 2017 was 10.5 percent for the year, which is also comparable to the national peer group averages.  Over this period, we observed a small shift from commercial loan growth toward retail loan growth, specifically in the areas of one-to-four family homes and indirect automobile loans.  With respect to funding in 2017, we observed strong growth in core deposits and less reliance on non-core funding sources\u2014a positive trend from a safety and soundness perspective.\n\nIn the competitive environment of the Second District, we\u2019ve observed community banks seeking revenue from more niche businesses such as wealth management and indirect automobile lending.  We\u2019ve also observed community banks participating with other banks on real estate lending, in part to better manage real estate concentrations.  Community banks are also seeking to differentiate themselves from their larger competitors by marketing their more individualized customer service.\n\nIn regard to liquidity, a number of community bankers have noted the influx in public deposits and the challenges associated with putting these deposits to productive use.\n\nFinally, although there has been a material improvement in asset quality over the last several years, it will be important for senior management to continue to be prudent in their underwriting practices and in monitoring any emerging risks in their portfolios.  The economy continues to show a strong trajectory, but of course we need to remain alert to any potential slowdown.\n\nAs Second District community banks grow in line with their national peers, we are encouraged by the increased reliance on core funding and strong asset quality.  We will, however, continue to monitor developments that may pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the financial and banking system.\n\nFintech\n\nA second major change for community banks\u2014like all banking institutions\u2014is the potential competition from new \u201cfintech\u201d firms. Since 2012 there has been over $40 billion in US-based fintech investments including online lending-based platforms, capital markets, and payment and settlement services.2   By offering traditional financial services to customers through new, innovative platforms and channels, these fintech firms pose a challenge to traditional banking business models.\n\nMany community bankers are taking a proactive, forward-leaning approach to these new technologies with a focus on how they can be leveraged to improve their business and benefit their customers. Among the opportunities community bankers have highlighted during our discussions are: technological solutions that reduce back office costs; more efficient loan processing; and an improved customer experience through smartphone applications and other mobile technology.  This proactive perspective leverages innovation as a strategic differentiator and competitive advantage, rather than just a means to enhance efficiency.\n\nThe speed and magnitude of these changes also have implications for us as supervisors.  We must keep pace and understand the risks associated with innovation so that we can appropriately focus our supervisory efforts on new operational, compliance, and reputational risks.  For example, Supervisory and Regulatory Letter 13-19, \u201cGuidance on Managing Outsourcing Risk,\u201d provides supervisory expectations on partnering with outside vendors.  While supervisors can provide some focus on emerging risks, it is ultimately the responsibility of each firm and its board to identify the relevant risks associated with new technologies and make appropriate and prudent business decisions for their institutions and customers. \n\nCybersecurity\n\nThe potential benefits associated with these new technologies are accompanied by the risks posed by cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity risks, the third topic on my list, continue to raise challenges for all types of firms in the financial system, ranging from supervised banks to financial utilities to non-bank financial firms to government agencies.  While these entities differ in size, purpose, and mission, the common threats associated with cybersecurity represent a universal concern.  Indeed, in my regular meetings with supervisory colleagues and supervised institutions, cybersecurity is almost always at the top of the risk list.  Frequently cited challenges by local institutions include: attracting and retaining information technology talent, as these skilled individuals are in high demand and implementing a sufficiently robust vendor management program for technology services outsourced to third-party providers.  \n\nWhile we expect firms to adequately manage a number of financial and operational risks such as credit risk, market risk, and operational risk, the nature of the cybersecurity risk differs in one key aspect \u2013 motivation.  A cybersecurity attacker might be a nation-state or hacker with the intention to disrupt or damage a critical infrastructure sustaining the U.S. and global economy.  Or, the attack may be financial in nature, where the perpetrator is engaging in fraud and seeking to profit. These motivations suggest that the cyber threat is more intentional than other risks.  This intentionality coupled with the resources of some perpetrators raises the stakes significantly and makes cyber defense much more difficult. \n\nWe recognize that addressing the cyber threat is a complicated and expensive undertaking, but it is an essential one.  All banks, from the largest globally systemically important to the small community banks, are vulnerable to this threat and need to take the appropriate steps to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.  \n\nA critical aspect of cybersecurity is the need for banks to adequately invest in safeguarding their systems and platforms by training their employees on how to identify potential cyber-attacks, mitigate vulnerabilities, and escalate issues appropriately.  Moreover, to address potential insider threats, banks must establish and maintain robust protocols and controls in managing employees\u2019 access to the firm\u2019s systems and databases. Ensuring that sensitive firm data, personal information, and critical infrastructure are accessible only to those trusted employees who need access is vital to guard against accidental or intentional data loss, theft, or damage.\n\nSupervisors expect that institutions create a strong risk culture around access control and vendor management. Employees are banks\u2019 first lines of defense against cyber vulnerabilities, so investment in employee training is critical.  By raising awareness about potential threats and vulnerabilities, a bank can equip employees with the knowledge and judgment to recognize attacks such as social engineering and mitigate the impact. In addition, training can reduce the probability that an employee will unintentionally cause a breach.  For example, we have seen deficiencies due to weak internal controls and policies and procedures, which have led to increased exposure to cybersecurity risk.  Institutions are expected to ensure service providers comply with applicable regulations that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.\n\nClosing\n\nI\u2019ve outlined three major, transformative changes and trends that all of us in this room\u2014community bankers, regulators, and supervisors\u2014are currently facing.  During the panels, formal Q&As, and sidelines of the conference, I encourage you to share your views on these topics and other changes that you are confronting, with a focus on the opportunities, risks, and mitigants.\n\nBy sharing our perspectives, community banks can continue to play a central role in the sustainable provision of financial services to customers in the Second District. Moreover, by working together to address these changes, the New York Fed and the broader regulatory community will be better positioned to achieve its goal of creating safe, sound, and stable banking and financial systems that support the U.S. economy.\n\nThank you for your attention."

    "content": "Thank you for joining us today for our 16th Annual Community Bankers Conference.  This is my last opportunity to address this fine group of community bank leaders in my role as president of the New York Fed.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nSince becoming head of the New York Fed in 2009, I have had the opportunity to watch the evolution of community banking up close.  I observed the resilience of community banks at the height of the financial crisis and how your organizations managed during those turbulent times.  I also have had the privilege of meeting with many of you during my regional visits, and I remain impressed with how small banks remain important pillars of economic support for their communities.\n\nThe past decade has seen significant change for your industry.  There has been significant consolidation among institutions and the remaining community banks are much healthier.  Back in 2009, there were 191 community banks in the Second District with an aggregate of $223 billion in total assets.  In contrast, there are 135 community banks today.  Despite this contraction in number, the remaining firms have continued to grow and thrive, and now have assets totaling $291 billion, which is an increase of about 30 percent.  Community banks are much stronger financially today.  In 2009, troubled assets were 26 percent of capital, primarily reflecting a large volume of construction lending.  That ratio has declined significantly, to 8.5 percent today\u2014demonstrating that community bank leaders have the capacity to take action, effectively work out troubled assets, and generate capital.  These data tell a welcome story regarding your ability to successfully conduct business through the economic recovery.  \n\nSo, where does the industry go from here and what challenges lie ahead?  That is the theme of today\u2019s conference, and I expect a robust and enlightening series of discussions from both panelists and presenters.  From my perspective, there are two challenges that I would highlight: ongoing advances in technology, and interest rate risk.\n\nFirst, major technological changes are compelling banks to embrace technology to better meet the needs of their customers.  Today\u2019s customer expects increased digital access, and a bank\u2019s failure to advance technologically would be very damaging for its franchise value. But, the use of new technology comes with its own risks that require significant investment and attention\u2014especially around cybersecurity.\n\nSecond, in today\u2019s low interest rate environment, we have observed that some community banks have taken on more interest rate risk by increasing the maturity of their assets and the average duration of their loan portfolios.  In the last rate tightening cycle, we observed that banks with larger concentrations of long-term earning assets experienced lower margins.  It will be important for community banks that are very sensitive to interest rate risk to evaluate the risk management of their loan portfolios.\n\nFinally, when I meet with community bankers, I am often asked the following question: \u201cWhen will we see regulatory relief?\u201d My simple answer is soon, I hope.\n\nThere is wide ranging consensus\u2014across party lines and among regulators, the Federal Reserve included\u2014that we need to reform the regulatory requirements for small banks.  As I have said, I favor regulatory relief for smaller banking organizations.2  Their size and complexity do not pose a significant risk to the system, and they lack the scale to absorb large compliance and other regulatory costs.  Given broad agreement on this issue, I am hopeful that relief will be forthcoming. \n\nLet me conclude by saying that we continue to recognize the important role community banks play in our economy.  According to a study by our colleagues at the Kansas City Fed, the U.S. banking system is unique because of its balance between a small number of large banks and thousands of community banks.3  That balance helps serve the needs of a large and diverse U.S. economy that includes businesses of all sizes and consumers with different needs and preferences.  As the U.S. economy continues to grow and expand\u2014as I expect it will\u2014your personalized customer service, commitment to relationship banking, and adaptability to technological advances will serve you and your communities well.\n\nI will miss many aspects of my role at the New York Fed, particularly the opportunities I\u2019ve had to interact with the community bankers in our district.  Please enjoy today\u2019s conference, and thank you for coming."

    "speaker": "Michael Held",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/hel180417",
    "content": "Good morning.  It\u2019s an honor to join you at the 1LoD Summit.  The views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI\u2019ve heard it said that being in the risk control business can be, and often is, a thankless task.  We get all the blame when something goes wrong, and none of the glory when things go right.  So, I want to start my remarks with a word of gratitude to you, my fellow travelers in the world of risk controls.  Thank you\u2014not just for the invitation to speak today, but also for the work you perform each day at your firms. \n\nThe growing sophistication and stature of the first line of defense is, in my view, an unqualified improvement in corporate governance\u2014especially at financial firms.  Let\u2019s begin with what you are defending. \n\nThe credibility and reputation of your colleagues, your employer, and your industry. \n\nThe trust of your customers and clients.  \n\nAnd, perhaps most important, the public interest.  \n\nFrom my perspective, you are not just a first line of defense for your organization.  You are the first line of defense against significant risks to the financial system.  This may sound inflated to some.  And it is not unusual to begin a speech with a bit of flattery.  But I mean this sincerely.  The first line of defense helps keep problems small.  It enhances a firm\u2019s commitment to both its private and public purposes.  It contributes materially to the trustworthiness of firms and the financial system, and therefore promotes financial stability. \n\nToday\u2019s agenda promises to inform and to challenge, and to help the first line develop professionally as a distinct area of corporate controls.  For my part, allow me to share some observations based on my work at the New York Fed. \n\nFirst, I want to discuss the risk of developing harmful silos in a three lines of defense model.2 \n\nSecond, I want to encourage you to be creative and inclusive in your approach to the first line of defense.  You are probably already consulting with technology specialists.  But I am also thinking of fields such as behavioral science.  The observations of neuroscientists and psychologists have disrupted the field of economics, and may help firms better manage risk.\n\nThird, I will offer some thoughts on the development of professional attributes in the first line of defense, especially community and courage.\n\nThree Lines of Defense, Not Three Silos of Defense\n\nSince the financial crisis, we have seen a proliferation of the three lines of defense model across the financial industry.  The official sector has helped promote this framework.3 \n\nThe three lines of defense model is a useful framework, but it is a means to an end.  It is not an end in itself.  The goal is a well-controlled firm with respect to its risks.  There is a potential danger associated with applying the three lines of defense framework so rigidly that it detracts from that goal.  Independence and expertise are desirable.  Silos are not.  Excessive formalism can limit the overall control framework of an organization. \n\nI offer these observations with humility gained through experience.  I have witnessed many discussions about where lawyers fit into the three lines of defense.  First line?  Second line?  Not in any line?  In hindsight, such debates are a distraction.  It is much more important to think instead about the tasks the lawyer is performing.  How do those tasks fit in to the overall goal of helping the organization control its risks? \n\nUltimately, substance matters much more than form.  Of course, clarity of roles and responsibilities is important.  It is also important that a front line business feel accountable for managing the broad set of risks confronting it.  Indeed, one of the benefits of the three lines of defense model is that the business lines think more expansively about the risks they face, beyond just traditional notions of credit and counterparty risk.  But an effective risk manager worries less about whether her firm\u2019s risk management framework exactly matches the theory of the three lines of defense, and more about whether the risks facing the firm are well controlled. \n\nGet Creative\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say, in essence, \u201cDon\u2019t miss the forest for the trees.\u201d  Let\u2019s acknowledge that the challenges you encounter in the first line of defense are a veritable thicket.  To manage effectively the risks that your firms face requires intellectual agility and creativity.  For now, I want to touch on a few considerations: diversity, choice architecture (especially incentives), and moral reasoning.  These inputs can help you apply the three lines of defense model more effectively, especially in the face of rapid technological innovation.\n\nDiversity\n\nIf you want to think nimbly, embrace diversity: the way we think, our backgrounds and areas of expertise, our experiences\u2014including, but certainly not limited to, the ways that people treat us because of where we were born, our race, gender, pedigree, sexual orientation\u2014and even our values.  Diversity can help address the problem of silos that I described earlier.  The problem with silos is not specialization, but blind spots.  At the New York Fed, I don\u2019t want economists making legal judgments, or lawyers performing economic analyses.  But I very much want lawyers and economists to provide insights to each other based on their specialties. \n\nMore generally, inviting outside views helps avoid common, human biases.4  \u201cGroupthink\u201d is one well-documented bias.  Another is the \u201cendowment effect\u201d\u2014placing greater value on what one already has versus what one does not.  What links these phenomena is an excessive preference for the status quo.  It is remarkable how often problems in financial firms can be overlooked because of a sense that are they part of a normal, business-as-usual state of affairs.  A diversity of inputs can help us see the flaws in what we accept as normal. \n\nDiversity is a frequent topic of conversation, but it is not easy.  My view is that, like other ethics, diversity is a habit that takes practice.  As first line of defense professionals, try to develop the habit of seeking out other points of view.  Diverse points of view may come from junior employees in your line of business.  They may also come from HR professionals, sociologists and psychologists, communications experts, even lawyers.  For financial firms, prudential supervisors can also contribute to a diversity of viewpoints.  Their horizontal view of practices across firms not only helps promote a more stable financial system, but also helps firms identify problem areas. \n\nA diverse set of views, professional training, and life experience may help you see shortcomings in your risk management framework\u2014even in the three lines of defense model.  Just because three lines of defense is a sensible way to manage risk does not mean it is perfect\u2014no model is.  A diverse set of inputs will help you figure out how to apply more effectively the three lines of defense in your organization.\n\nChoice Architecture\n\nI recommend as well that you pay attention to choice architecture in deciding how best to construct a first line of defense.  By \u201cchoice architecture,\u201d I mean the broad array of options that promote decisions aligned with the values and goals of your respective firms.5  How choices are presented can have a dramatic impact on outcomes.  Taking account of ordinary, human biases\u2014including the ones I just mentioned\u2014and organizational culture can help you present options in a manner that yields better results.\n\nIn the world of risk controls, individuals face choices every day\u2014choices whether to walk right up to the line of appropriate behavior and risk crossing it; choices to get more or less compensation in exchange for riskier behavior; and choices to raise their hands (or not) when they suspect that something has gone awry.  In my view, effective controls require an appropriate balance of narrowly focused, prescriptive rules, and broader principles and standards.  The precise balance will vary, depending on the task and the firm.  But regardless of the setting, a thoughtful set of risk controls can improve the choices that employees make. \n\nOne other word of advice on choices.  People need time\u2014time to stop, breathe, and ask for help if they need it.  Making decisions sooner than necessary can lead to mistakes.  As human beings, we do not always see consequences in the first instance.  We need time to process.  Of course, time can sometimes seem like a luxury.  Time is, after all, money\u2014or so we have been told.  But the consequences of making the wrong choice because you are in a hurry can be far more expensive.  I was speaking recently with a colleague with years of experience as a criminal prosecutor.  She observed that the first step on the path to criminal ruin often begins with one seemingly small, often rushed choice.  My own experience from years of seeing mistakes in the financial services industry leads me to agree.  People\u2014especially junior employees\u2014too often decide sooner than they must, without taking the time to raise their hand and ask for help.  So do not confuse thinking quickly and creatively with choosing rapidly in every instance.  When considering what structures in your organization can help people make good decisions, consider ways to build in adequate time to decide.\n\nIncentives\n\nIn any discussion of choices, it is critical to consider incentives.  Compensation is a powerful form of incentive.  We need to think creatively about how to structure compensation in ways that promote conduct aligned with the values and long-term financial interests of the firm.  Bill Dudley, the President of the New York Fed, has proposed one possible improvement.  Pay material risk takers and senior managers in the form of deferred debt, which vests in line with the medium- and long-term risks for which they are accountable.6  The idea is to create a performance bond for bankers akin to the security deposit that a tenant provides to a landlord. \n\nBut, believe it or not, money is not the only way to motivate people.  One lesson of the LIBOR scandal is that employees are motivated by more than pecuniary gain.  In that case, loyalty to a network of professional contacts was a powerful incentive to commit fraud.  I am lucky to have had a very different experience at the New York Fed.  I oversee a staff of legal, compliance, and law enforcement professionals who appreciate their paychecks but, in all candor, are not in it for the money\u2014or, at least, not entirely in it for the money.  What matters to them is the Federal Reserve\u2019s public mission.  A good way to encourage their best conduct is to acknowledge their contributions to that mission. \n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it.  A growing number of organizational experts and management consultants have concluded that job satisfaction and other intrinsic benefits matter as much if not more than extrinsic rewards, including pay.7  This is not to say that incentive compensation is weak tea.  It is certainly a powerful motivator.  My point is that, in your efforts to construct the most effective controls for your organization\u2019s risks, consider both monetary and non-monetary incentives. \n\nMoral Reasoning\n\nIt is also important to promote moral reasoning.  I know there\u2019s a joke in there somewhere.  After all, what is a lawyer doing talking about morality?  And there is some tension in advocating moral judgment in a discussion about controls.  Controls seek consistency and objectivity.  Morality, by contrast, can be very personal or subjective.  Controls often remove discretion.  Moral reasoning is all about choice.\n\nBut let\u2019s be realistic.  We cannot rely exclusively on controls or process to achieve desired outcomes.  Not every situation can be anticipated.  Not every decision can be automated.  Controls can be out-maneuvered\u2014sometimes unwittingly, but other times on purpose.  For all these reasons, good processes are necessary but not sufficient.  There will be situations in which your employees have to make choices.  Ignoring the moral dimension of choices carries significant risk.8  If you want your organization to be well controlled with regard to its risk, you have to consider the quality of choices, not just the reliability of processes.9  An organization should therefore develop the capacity of its employees to make good choices, not just permissible choices. \n\nSo, how do you practice moral reasoning?  Bill Dudley has offered what I thought was a good starting point.  Get rid of the notion that a separate morality applies at work than at home.10  Bankers\u2014and, for that matter, lawyers\u2014cannot check their morals at the door when they step onto a trading floor or into a courtroom. \n\nHere are some other ideas, courtesy of a 2016 report by the Financial Conduct Authority entitled \u201cBehaviour and Compliance in Organizations.\u201d11  The report argues, among other things, that ethical considerations need to remain salient in order to promote good choices.  Salience can be achieved by prompting about moral codes\u2014through language that emphasizes words like \u201cmoral,\u201d \u201cethical,\u201d and \u201cgood.\u201d  Discussions by leaders and key culture carriers\u2014that is, esteemed colleagues regardless of rank in a hierarchy\u2014can also help if they address ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of business decisions.  Finally, salience occurs through proximity of decision-makers to those affected by decisions.12 So, look for ways to make the human consequences of choices more apparent.\n\nIn my view, a habit or culture of considering what is right, and not merely what is permissible, will help any organization attract, retain, and develop high-quality employees.  It will promote individual wellbeing and will contribute, over time, to an industry that makes fewer errors of judgment.\n\nDo Not Rest\n\nAbove all, remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint.  So your organization now has three lines of defense\u2014great!  But your work is not over.  You still have to question whether your organization can be better controlled vis-\u00e0-vis its risks.  The challenges and opportunities facing your firm do not stop changing.  You need to adjust accordingly. \n\nI encourage you to ask questions about the three lines of defense model and how it is applied in your organizations.  Here is one of the questions on my mind:  How do the three lines of defense take account of advances in technology?  Technological solutions in financial services are becoming cheaper, faster, more easily available\u2014almost off-the-shelf\u2014and help make your business more efficient and profitable.  But do you know how these solutions work?  Chances are, not really.  I certainly do not, but then I\u2019m just a lawyer.  There may be a tendency to believe that brilliant people built and tested the product.  Surely they know better than you or I about how it works.  We should therefore just trust the experts. \n\nI have seen this movie before.  Similar assumptions existed a decade ago about CDOs and other complex securitizations and hedges.  It has been said that the financial crisis occurred because of a failure of imagination\u2014of not anticipating risk.13  There was also a more basic failure.  Not enough people understood how complex financial products actually worked. \n\nIt is critical that all three lines of defense\u2014and, especially, the first line of defense\u2014understand technology.  I urge you to question your current technology, and to think ahead to further changes.  For example, how will artificial intelligence challenge traditional methods of testing and assurance, which address static coding rather than dynamic learning?  How will machine choices about access to financial services, or the cost of those services, avoid perpetuating or exacerbating historical disparities of race, gender, age, or zip code?  These questions do not have easy answers, and they will likely lead to more questions.  So don\u2019t rest.  Keep learning so that you can better anticipate risks.\n\nProfessionalism and the First Line of Defense\n\nFinally, I encourage you to continue to develop a sense of your field as a profession.  Now, I do not mean to imply that anyone in this room is unprofessional.  But, like many others, I see a role for professionalism in finance.  The Banking Standards Board in the United Kingdom is a thought leader in this field.  According to its most recent annual review, which I recommend to you all, \u201c[P]rofessionalism comprises the attitudes, judgement and high standards of behaviour, knowledge and skill expected of individuals working in banking. . . . [G]reater professionalism in banking would help create a sector that, now and in the future, better met the needs and expectations of its customers, clients, members, employees, the economy and wider society.\u201d14\n\nIn my view, various aspects of professions have a lot to offer.  The eligibility requirements for many professions improve the likelihood that a practitioner will meet standards of competence and behavior in her professional conduct.  These requirements cover character, prior record, and reputation\u2014not only skill or education.\n\nMembers of professions also benefit from codes of conduct that transcend specialized practices.  These principles offer an ethical framework within which to tackle problems that are not easily resolved by narrow rules or processes.  They make it easier to make and stick with good decisions. \n\nGatherings in which members of a profession can come together and exchange ideas and opinions are crucial.  They help members of a professional community keep up to date on important industry-wide developments and raise issues that present the need for collaboration.  They also help to instill a shared sense of purpose and responsibility for carrying out the goals of the profession.\n\nA profession can also provide personal accountability.  Lawyers, for instance, can be disbarred, and complaints against them can become matters of public record.  That is added incentive to maintain the skills, character, and other qualifications required to become (and remain) a member of the bar.\n\nAnd, critically, professions do not stop improving.  Lawyers continue\u2014I hope\u2014to seek a more just society.  Doctors, a healthier one. \n\nI do not mean to call for the equivalent of the legal bar for bankers\u2014although it might not be a bad idea.  But there are elements of professions that could be useful.  For example, forums like this one facilitate information sharing and promote a sense of community.  A code of professional conduct is another example.  Again, I refer you to the work of the Banking Standards Board, which has developed a \u201cStatement of Principles for Strengthening Professionalism.\u201d  Like Bill Dudley, I have argued that banking would benefit from a misconduct database.15  Records of employee misconduct would be available to future employers to combat the so-called \u201crolling bad apple\u201d phenomenon.  Hopefully this would encourage more careful choices by bankers in the same way that the risk of disbarment prompts lawyers to think about the long-term consequences of their decisions. \n\nNone of these ideas is a magic bullet.  But they may be helpful as you consider how the first line of defense and the financial services industry develop as a profession.\n\nConclusion: Professional Courage\n\nLet me end with one final thought on professionalism.  Looking back at the financial crisis and more recent scandals, there must have been people who recognized early that what was happening was wrong, but remained silent.16  As the first line of defense develops and convenes in gatherings like this, it is important to remember one other professional value: courage. \n\nProfessional courage is key to the appropriate functioning of lawyers inside corporations.17  In what has been called the \u201cpartner/guardian\u201d dilemma\u2014a bit of a misnomer since the \u201cdilemma\u201d is really a good thing\u2014lawyers are supposed to assist the firm in its mission and protect its long-term reputation, its good name as a store of value.18  That takes courage, especially when an action is technically legal but otherwise wrong or just plain stupid.\n\nYour roles in the first line of defense also require professional courage.  You are partners in your business.  You are also guardians of your firm, the investment of its shareholder owners, the trust of its customers, and the expectations of public authorities.  That is not an easy task.  You have my sympathy.  And you have my thanks\u2014not just for being an attentive audience, but also for all of your good work."

    "content": "It is a pleasure to have this opportunity to speak to you.  In my remarks today, I will discuss financial regulation and the ways in which proper incentives help ensure resiliency in the financial system. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nWe have come a long way since the global financial crisis in building a more resilient financial system\u2014one that can better support the provision of financial services to American households and businesses such as those represented here, both in good times and in bad.  But, there is still unfinished business. \n\nOn the regulatory side, for example, there is more work to be done to ensure that a systemically important bank can be resolved effectively on a cross-border basis in the event of failure.  Additionally, the efficiency, transparency, and simplicity of the regulatory system could be improved without weakening the core reforms to capital, liquidity, and resolution that have made the financial system much stronger. \n\nMost importantly, we need to recognize that an effective regulatory regime and comprehensive supervision are not sufficient.  We also need to focus on the incentives facing banks and their employees.  After all, misaligned incentives contributed greatly to the financial crisis and continue to affect bank conduct and behavior.2  \n\nToday, I will address this issue of incentives, with emphasis on the complementary roles of regulation, supervision, and bank culture.  Each of these is necessary to ensure that we have a robust and resilient financial system not just today, but also in the future. \n\nProgress Since the Financial Crisis\n\nThe financial crisis was a watershed event that exposed severe deficiencies in the financial system\u2014including the inadequacy of bank capital and liquidity buffers, poor risk management and internal controls, and bad bank cultures.  Many financial firms took on an excessive amount of risk and did not always act in ways consistent with the interests of their customers or the broader public.  The crisis revealed woeful shortcomings in many of these elements, with terrible consequences for the economy and millions of people. \n\nOver the past decade, the official sector and the financial industry have made considerable progress in addressing these problems.  The banking system is much sounder and more resilient as a result, in a number of ways. \n\nFirst, systemically important banks are much safer.3  They have much bigger liquidity and capital buffers, and the quality of capital is much improved.  Moreover, the capital regime now has a forward-looking element in which annual stress tests examine banks\u2019 ability to withstand losses under severely adverse economic conditions and constrain the amount of capital that can be returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.  Strengthened liquidity standards have given the market greater confidence that banks possess adequate resources to weather temporary storms that arise.  At the global level, Basel III has helped to level the competitive playing field in a number of ways\u2014including, most recently, by imposing constraints on banks\u2019 use of internal models to meet their capital requirements, and by introducing a leverage buffer for systemically important firms, similar to what we already have in place in the United States.\n\nNew regulatory standards have been complemented by a supervisory framework for the largest banks that explicitly acknowledges the impact that distress at such firms could have on financial markets and the economy.4  These efforts have led to considerable improvement in risk management at banks, which should help better sustain the flow of credit to the real economy throughout the business cycle. \n\nSecond, considerable progress has been made in terms of resolution.  Systemically important banks now have living wills that provide a roadmap for how these firms would be resolved in the event of imminent failure.  Moreover, there is now a well-defined mechanism under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act for recapitalization of a failed systemically important firm.  The FDIC now has the authority to initiate a \u201csingle point of entry\u201d resolution, which places the parent holding company into FDIC receivership and transfers its subsidiaries to a new parent company.  Total loss-absorbing capacity, or TLAC, of the old parent company would be available to absorb losses and could be used to recapitalize the new parent company.  But, the task of operationalizing resolution for large, global banks\u2014including achieving full clarity on the roles of the home and host supervisors\u2014is still not complete.  It is key that work continues on this front to ensure that a systemically important firm can fail without threatening to topple the rest of the financial system\u2014an important step toward ending \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d \n\nThird, some of the obvious systemic vulnerabilities exposed by the financial crisis have been remedied.  Important changes include mandatory clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives through central counterparties, or CCPs; more intensive supervision of systemically important CCPs; and reforms of the tri-party repo system and the money market mutual fund industry.  But, even as we reduce or eliminate old vulnerabilities, we must not rest on our laurels, for new vulnerabilities will inevitably take their place. \n\nThese accomplishments notwithstanding, I have no doubt that the current regulatory framework could be improved.  Indeed, the official sector should assess the efficiency and effectiveness of regulations on an ongoing basis.  I agree with Vice Chairman Quarles\u2019 observation that there is more we can do to make the regulatory regime more efficient, transparent, and simple\u2014including relief for small banks, greater tailoring based on a firm\u2019s level of systemic importance, and simplifying the Volcker Rule.5  Some of these changes have already been adopted or are in process. \n\nGreater Focus on Incentives Is Needed\n\nBut, I also think we must take a broader view of what characterizes a resilient and robust financial system.  To that end, we need to carefully monitor the incentives that influence the behavior of financial firms and their employees. \n\nIndeed, the record from the crisis and more recent years shows just how powerful incentives can be in driving firms and individuals to do things that are imprudent and/or unethical.  Bad incentives can lead to conduct that not only generates large risk exposures and market excess, but also erodes trust and confidence in the financial system.  For example, the pre-crisis housing boom would not have gone so far, for so long, without the widespread breakdown in mortgage underwriting practices that was driven by poor incentives.6\n\nSome examples of bad incentives that contributed to the financial boom and bust included:\n\nSince then, we have seen a number of other costly breakdowns that were driven, in part, by poor incentives. \n\nThese recent cases were particularly disturbing in terms of their scale and flagrancy, and\u2014in the case of the rate-rigging scandals\u2014the collusion by employees across firms.  I am particularly struck by the fact that manipulation of the foreign exchange market occurred even after the LIBOR scandal was well known.  These episodes underscore the tremendous power that incentives have to influence and distort behavior, potentially leading to massive damage to bank cultures, reputations, and finances. \n\nSome lessons on incentives that stand out for me include:\n\nMany of these issues and risks likely also apply to your companies.  But, I think they are particularly important for financial institutions\u2014especially those that are systemically important.  The scale of such firms magnifies the impact of bad incentives on the financial system and economy.  At the same time, that scale also makes it more difficult for senior management to properly control a firm\u2019s activities and monitor the conduct and behavior of its employees.  For these reasons, we need strong internal and external checks on banks\u2014an area to which I will now turn. \n\nThe Complementary Roles of Regulation, Supervision, and Culture\n\nAs I said earlier, a sound financial system is one that is safe and resilient, can support the provision of financial services at a reasonable price to the real economy in good times and in bad, and promotes confidence and trust among its customers and counterparties.  Financial institutions should be prudently managed and subject to strong internal checks\u2014including risk management policies and procedures, internal controls, compliance, and audit.  Meanwhile, an effective financial regulatory and supervisory regime should be as efficient, transparent, and simple as possible. \n\nI think these goals are broadly shared by supervisors and banks alike, which suggests to me that the relationship between supervisors and banks does not always need to be adversarial.  Indeed, a healthy dialogue helps this supervisory process to work well.  For example, it is important that firms are proactive in revealing problems to their supervisors.  And, individual institutions can certainly benefit from the horizontal perspective that supervisors bring to examinations.  This perspective can highlight where the firm stands vis-\u00e0-vis best practices, or where there may be important vulnerabilities in its operations. \n\nOf course, there is an irreducible amount of tension built into this relationship, given that each party\u2019s roles, interests, and responsibilities will not always coincide.  Banks are naturally more sensitive to constraints on their profit opportunities or dividend policies and to the costs of regulation.  They may also question how much protection is necessary\u2014for example, how stringent the capital requirements or how severe stress testing assumptions should be.  These are areas where I would expect perspectives to differ. \n\nSupervisors are principally focused on compliance with laws and regulations as well as issues of safety and soundness.  They also bring to their work a perspective on financial stability that may not match the more narrow interests of the firm.  For example, supervisors seek to address the externalities created by the failure of a systemically important firm by imposing higher capital and other requirements than the firm would likely select if left to its own devices. \n\nThe financial crisis is a vivid reminder that there can be many risks to financial stability, and of the need for strong internal and external constraints on banks.  Here, the \u201cthree pillars\u201d of regulation, supervision, and bank culture must all play effective roles.  Regulation establishes what is legally permissible for banks to do; supervision helps to reinforce those rules and evaluate whether the bank\u2019s controls and other processes are conducive to safety and soundness; and bank culture sets the norms for what is appropriate behavior.9  But, at the same time, these pillars are mutually reinforcing. Regulation and supervision, for example, attempt to address various market failures in banking that can contribute to excessive risk taking.10  Bank culture, in turn, helps establish norms in areas where regulation may be silent. \n\nIn this way, regulation, supervision, and bank culture are complements, and deficiencies in any of these pillars can be problematic.  For example, as we have seen in cases of unsafe or unethical behavior in recent years, strong regulation and supervision cannot substitute for deficiencies in bank culture\u2014especially not on a timely basis. \n\nIt is the public sector\u2019s job to establish and enforce rules, but rules are inherently limited in their ability to constrain conduct and behavior.  Much of our regulatory regime has been developed in response to financial problems that have arisen over time.  Because regulation is typically reactive in this way, it may not always keep pace with the evolution of the financial system or the broader economic environment.  Also, we must recognize that, at times, actions will be taken that are clearly inconsistent with the spirit of the rules that are place, or the rules will simply be violated.\n\nConsider the use by Lehman Brothers of so-called Repo 105 transactions to window-dress its balance sheet.  Beginning in late 2007, Lehman used Repo 105 transactions to temporarily remove securities from its balance sheet for a few days in order to mislead investors and counterparties about its financial condition.  These transactions had the benefit of being recognized as \u201csales\u201d even though they were nearly identical to standard repo transactions that stayed on the balance sheet. \n\nIn another example, following the introduction of Basel III, some banks tried to reduce their capital requirements by transferring risk to other counterparties.  In certain cases, this occurred even when those counterparties did not provide any additional resources to absorb potential losses\u2014either because they were very thinly capitalized, or were affiliated with the banks in question. \n\nI would also note that the establishment of too many bright-line rules may prove counterproductive to the goal of encouraging good bank cultures.  For one thing, detailed rules can be construed as implying that the responsibility for good conduct rests with the public authorities.  For another, rules may create opportunities or incentives for legal or regulatory arbitrage.  When banks work to find creative ways around rules, it can have an insidious effect on culture.  \n\nAs I see it, an organization\u2019s culture gets into trouble when it equates \u201cwhat is right\u201d with what is legally permissible, and when \u201cwhat is wrong\u201d becomes viewed as what is legally impermissible.  A proliferation of rules\u2014followed by the gaming of these rules\u2014can be ultimately self-defeating. The end result may not only be a loss of trust, but also over time a more burdensome regulatory regime than would otherwise be the case. \n\nSo, while regulation and supervision are necessary to ensure a resilient and robust financial system, I very much doubt that they are sufficient.  They need to be supplemented by bank management that pays close attention to incentives, conduct, and culture.  As I have previously said, incentives drive conduct, which establishes the social norms that help define a firm\u2019s culture.11  The first step is for firms to evaluate the incentives that they have in place with respect to personnel evaluation, compensation, and promotion and to make sure they are consistent with the type of behaviors they want to encourage.  For example, how are compliance violations treated in compensation and promotion decisions?  Are incentives in place to encourage people to speak up early, when problems are smaller and more manageable?  When employees do speak up, how are they subsequently treated? \n\nMy colleagues and I at the New York Fed have commented previously on the essential role of good culture in a bank\u2019s reputation, financial condition and performance, and in customer confidence and trust.12  As we have argued, \u201ccultural capital\u201d\u2014through its ability to limit misconduct risk\u2014can be an important bulwark to a firm\u2019s financial capital.13 \n\nCulture is often viewed as a \u201csoft\u201d topic, but I would disagree.  The financial penalties associated with misconduct are anything but soft\u2014with bank fines since the crisis estimated at more than $320 billion as of year-end 2016.14  The hit to a bank\u2019s reputation from misconduct can also be quantified through, for example, the associated impact on its share price or funding costs.  Culture should be about concrete incentives and behaviors that help achieve specific goals, implying that it should not be viewed as a \u201csoft\u201d issue. \n\nI have argued on several occasions that bank leaders could get a better view into their firms\u2019 progress on conduct and culture by doing more collectively.15  For example, major banks in the United States could participate in an industry-wide survey of their employees conducted by an independent third party, with the results anonymized to encourage respondents to be candid in their assessments.  I suspect that these results would create a more accurate picture of how banks are doing, and would likely underscore how much work continues to be needed to improve bank cultures. \n\nAnother idea that I have discussed is the creation of a database of banker misconduct to combat the problem of \u201crolling bad apples.\u201d  In these cases, employees who are dismissed due to suspicion or proof of misconduct are unwittingly hired by other firms in the industry, where they have the opportunity to repeat their actions.  Understandably, firms are concerned about legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct, but there may be ways to address these concerns through legislation.  Once again, I invite the industry to take the initiative on these issues, and to look to the public sector for support.\n\nFor their part, I believe that supervisors have a special role to play in assessing incentives at the firm level and their possible implications for bank behavior and misconduct.  Supervisors can mitigate misconduct risks by supporting the development of effective corporate governance regimes, prudent risk management policies, and strong compliance and control structures\u2014all within a framework of effective oversight from the firm's board of directors. \n\nUltimately, establishing and maintaining an effective culture with appropriate risk governance and controls is the responsibility of individual firms and the industry, but the official sector can help by highlighting best practices and addressing collective action problems and other market failures.\n\nAreas Where Further Work on Incentives Is Warranted\n\nI would like to briefly touch on some areas where further work on incentives may be warranted, including regulatory changes that might address certain incentive and first-mover problems.  At the outset, let me say that I do not have all the answers and do not mean to suggest that these are the only areas that need improvement. But, these issues are ones where more investigation into possible solutions may be warranted. \n\nAs I discussed earlier, we have made substantial progress in raising banks\u2019 capital buffers.  But, I believe it would also be worthwhile to evaluate other changes to our capital regime to encourage earlier action by banks when the economic environment deteriorates.  Banks are naturally reluctant to raise capital due to concerns about stigma and potential equity dilution.  This hesitancy was demonstrated clearly during the financial crisis.  Bank management may also delay such a move because they may be prone to over-optimism about the outlook for their firm or the economy.  There is also an externality problem, as a bank does not internalize the benefit that accrues to the financial system when it takes steps to strengthen its own financial condition. \n\nAlthough supervisors have tools available in such circumstances, these require a safety-and-soundness basis that may not always be available in a timely manner.  Changes in the 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review program enable banks to avoid a Federal Reserve Board objection based on the quantitative assessment by raising new capital.  While this is a step in the right direction, the current regime may not be sufficient to ensure that banks will raise capital more proactively. \n\nCompensation is also a powerful incentive.  As I mentioned earlier, the emphasis in compensation practices on short-term performance over longer-term sustainable returns was a key vulnerability revealed during the crisis that helped motivate imprudent behavior.  Currently, senior bankers are paid mainly in cash and deferred stock grants.  This structure creates incentives to take actions to maximize a bank\u2019s share price, rather than to minimize the risk of the bank\u2019s failure.  While compensation practices today feature a larger deferred component, greater emphasis on deferral in the form of long-term debt\u2014which can also be recognized as TLAC\u2014could better align senior managers\u2019 interests with the long-term safety and soundness of the firm.16 \n\nAs I see it, this approach could have two benefits.  For one, it would reduce the incentives for risk-taking. For another, if TLAC debt holdings were at risk of conversion to equity in the event of failure, I believe senior bankers would be incentivized to cut dividends or raise equity capital earlier to reduce the risk of failure.  Having a regime in place that creates strong incentives for management to steer aggressively away from bad outcomes would be better than one in which management has incentives to temporize in the face of rising risks. \n\nSome banks have experimented with such compensation schemes, and I would encourage more to do so.  But, this type of reform may also need a push from the regulatory side.  Banks may be reluctant to adopt such pay structures on their own for competitive reasons.  They may perceive that there is a first-mover disadvantage in attracting and retaining talent. \n\nAnother possible reform could involve putting a greater onus on senior management for the costs incurred from regulatory fines or other legal liabilities, rather than on shareholders alone.  Shareholders should not be shielded from such costs and fines\u2014as they may have also profited from associated gains\u2014but it doesn\u2019t seem fair or prudent to shield the decision-makers from responsibility for costly breakdowns as much as they are now.  Greater personal liability may also be a powerful incentive to promote better behavior.  I suspect changes in these areas would lead senior managers to encourage their staff to speak up earlier about emerging risks, be more attentive when red flags were raised, and respond sooner and more forcefully. \n\nI would also note that the many regulatory reforms introduced over the past decade may create incentives of their own, with important implications for bank behavior. Such incentives may alter the nature and locus of risk-taking, and therefore need to be closely monitored.  Risks could be shifted outside the banking system, or the incentives could lead to different bank strategies, business models, and product offerings that introduce new risks. \n\nThere is a long history of such behavior.  For example, off-balance-sheet instruments rose sharply in the 1980s in response to the introduction of minimum primary and total capital requirements based on balance sheet size.  More recently, in some jurisdictions the use of leverage ratios based on period-end reporting of assets\u2014as compared to period averages in the United States\u2014has encouraged window-dressing behavior by some banks at quarter-end.  So, while the reforms have mostly had the intended effect of encouraging safer institutions, authorities and financial institutions should also be mindful of potential unintended consequences. \n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, we have made considerable progress toward a more resilient and robust financial system.  While we should do more to make the regulatory regime more efficient, transparent, and simple, there are outstanding issues that still require additional work\u2014such as the cross-border resolution of large global banks.  We should also focus more on incentives, which can help ensure that regulations are dynamic and work well, and that banks are incentivized to take action early to steer away from trouble.  Finally, regulation and supervision are necessary but not sufficient\u2014they must be supplemented by bank cultures that encourage ethical behavior, the early identification of problems, and a willingness to address those problems proactively. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

    "content": "Thank you, Ilan, and thanks to the Central Bank of Brazil for organizing this event.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity today to talk about the issue of globalization.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAlthough the debate about the benefits and challenges of globalization is not new, it has recently come into sharper focus.  This debate is important to all of us, and I think it is particularly relevant to Brazil given its importance in the global economy. \n\nGlobalization means different things to different people.  In my remarks today, I will focus on the role of globalization as a force for international economic integration and economic development.  I will highlight three themes:\n\nFirst, the important role that trade plays in promoting higher standards of living globally. \n\nSecond, how changes in trade can create challenges for industries and their workers when they lose competitiveness.  Insufficient attention has been given to this issue.  We must do better in addressing the very large costs that can be imposed on particular communities and households. \n\nThird, the answer to those challenges is not greater protectionism.  Instead, we need to provide greater support to displaced workers so they can obtain the skills needed to find new well-paying jobs.  We also need to ensure that there are strong global institutions and international cooperation to help manage the effects of globalization.  This includes responding to the challenges stemming from financial globalization\u2014the flow of capital across national borders.  \n\nThese issues are important to me as a central banker, as they affect the long-term health and productivity of the U.S. economy, the economic opportunities available to our people, and the efficiency and stability of the global financial system. \n\nThe debate around globalization, particularly in advanced economies, reflects many factors.  Undoubtedly, the global financial crisis and subsequent slow recovery have been significant.  But, just as important have been longer-term trends, such as growing income inequality, the loss of middle-income jobs, and the rise of large emerging market economies such as China and India. \n\nAlthough the debate about globalization is not new, I believe we are at a particularly important juncture.  If support for liberalized trade and an integrated global economy were to suffer a significant setback, the consequence could be slower economic growth and lower living standards around the world. \n\nWhile considerable effort has gone into liberalizing trade and developing the existing set of trade agreements, that does not mean they cannot be improved upon.  I have no doubt some trade agreements could be enhanced or updated.  Some may not adequately address recent changes in the global economy\u2014such as the rise of digital trade\u2014and may need to be refreshed.  And, important trade barriers still remain that should be addressed.  In particular, from a U.S. perspective, the access of U.S. firms to some foreign markets and the protection of intellectual property rights are issues that deserve close attention.  But, in addressing these issues, we should take care to preserve the vital benefits of trade to higher standards of living in both advanced and emerging market economies.  Our focus should be on further strengthening an open trade regime, and, as appropriate, amending and improving these agreements.\n\nThe Pace of Globalization\n\nTo begin, let me briefly describe the pace of globalization as a reminder of what is at stake.  Global economic integration has increased dramatically in recent decades.  Trade in goods and services, for example, has grown from nearly 40 percent of global GDP in 1990 to 54 percent in 2016.  Over the same period, the stock of foreign direct investment has increased from roughly 10 percent of global GDP to 36 percent.  Put simply, national economies and financial systems have become more integrated and interdependent.2  \n\nThis rapid growth in trade reflects falling trade barriers, declining transport costs, and improved information and communication technology.  These trends have enabled the development of complex global supply chains that allow companies to manage their production more efficiently.\n\nEmerging market economies now make up a much larger share of global trade, the global economy, and global growth.  As an illustration, emerging market economies have accounted for 70 percent of global economic growth since the crisis\u2014double their share from two decades ago.3   This growth has provided much-needed support to world economic activity, as advanced economies have recovered slowly from the crisis. \n\nRising economic integration is also evident when we examine the trade relationship between Brazil and the United States.  Bilateral trade flows in goods have risen from $17 billion in 1994 to nearly $57 billion in 2016.  The United States is Brazil\u2019s second-largest export market, and an important destination for manufactured goods.  In 2016, the stock of U.S. direct investment in Brazil was $64 billion, up from $18 billion in 1994.4   Recent initiatives announced by the Brazilian authorities\u2014including a large and transparent infrastructure concession program and greater foreign participation in the oil and gas and aviation industries\u2014underscore the potential for further increases in foreign direct investment. \n\nThe Benefits of Open Trade\n\nIncreased trade, through its longer-term impact on productivity, has been a key contributor to global growth and prosperity since the Second World War.  Openness to trade brings many benefits to the supply side of the economy, including:\n\nCollectively, these forces lead to a more efficient allocation of a country\u2019s scarce resources\u2014one that is more closely aligned to its international comparative advantage. \n\nAs a consequence, consumers can benefit from lower prices, higher real incomes, and greater variety and quality of goods and services.  Increased openness may also reduce wasteful rent-seeking behavior on the part of protected industries and the related costs of corruption.\n\nOpenness to trade has certainly played a large role in the economic ascent of Asia.  Following the rise of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and others, fast growth in China and India has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty\u2014an unprecedented feat in human history.  Reflecting these gains, a number of emerging market countries have become strong supporters of open trade, a sign of how much the world has changed in recent years. \n\nBenefits from open trade are evident in Brazil.5   Following its dramatic trade reforms in the 1990s, productivity growth in Brazil increased.  Brazil also has leveraged its ample and diverse natural resource endowments to become a leading exporter of iron ore and a number of agricultural products.  And, the country has benefitted from the rise of China\u2014total export volumes more than doubled between 2000 and 2010, and have now nearly tripled.  Brazilian multinational companies are also important global players in industries such as mining and metals, food, paper products, and transportation equipment. \n\nBut, increased openness to trade is not a panacea in and of itself.  Actual benefits depend on a range of other critical factors. These include macroeconomic policy, the business and regulatory environment, the legal and tax regime, labor and product market flexibility, and the quality of infrastructure and public services, such as education.  While the gains from a liberalized trade regime are not guaranteed, the alternative of trying to achieve a high standard of living by following a policy of economic isolationism will fail.  Trade has played a key role in nearly all of the high-growth success stories since the middle of the last century.\n\nThe Challenges of Open Trade\n\nIt is important to recognize that while trade and international integration tend to increase the overall economic pie, the distribution of the larger pie may be very uneven.  In fact, slices for some particular groups may even shrink.  Some workers\u2014particularly those in industries that are less competitive and whose skills may have become less relevant\u2014can be hurt and can find adjustment difficult.  Successful adjustment often requires individuals to change industries and to relocate to different regions.  So, while trade is almost always a win for a country\u2019s economy, not everyone within that economy will be a winner.  This is especially the case where the policies to cushion the negative consequences of trade and to facilitate adjustment are lacking or inadequate. \n\nEffects are country- and industry-specific, and depend on initial endowments and conditions.  Low-income workers in emerging markets, for example, may find it more difficult to adapt, given weaker safety nets and fewer financial resources available to deal with adverse economic shocks.  The bigger the adjustment process, the more the gains from trade will tend to be eroded. \n\nWhile the rise in the skill premium from trade liberalization has been well established for both developed and developing countries, determining the aggregate impact of trade on jobs has been more challenging.  To date, the evidence has been mixed.  We need further research in this area to determine with more confidence a reasonable range of estimates for these employment effects. \n\nAlthough evidence of the extent to which jobs have been lost due to global trade is inconclusive, job losses that are attributed to trade tend to be viewed differently.  That is, they are seen as having been \u201clost to foreigners\u201d and are often viewed as a consequence of the policy decision to liberalize trade in the first place.\n\nThe challenge of adjusting to open trade is a serious issue that has not received the degree of attention it fully deserves.  This may partly reflect the fact that the burden has been borne unequally and spread out over a long time period.  It also may reflect the fact that the winners from trade have often tended to have a stronger voice than those who have been the losers. \n\nResearch has documented that the effects on individuals of job dislocation\u2014including those resulting from trade\u2014can be significant and long lasting.  Older workers tend to suffer larger earnings losses, and often face more difficult transitions.  Displaced workers may not have the appropriate skills to find good jobs in other areas of the economy, including in growing export sectors. \n\nWhen the affected industry represents a large share of the local economy, the damage is often magnified.  In this case, the burden can become more widespread as the level of wages across the community is negatively affected.  And, this doesn\u2019t begin to capture the full human toll\u2014including the impact on workers who have lost confidence in the future and the poorer health outcomes that occur because of increased stress. \n\nResearch on Brazil has found that workers employed in regions facing larger tariff cuts experienced declines in formal sector employment.6   They also generally did not migrate to more favorable regions.  Instead, they either became unemployed, moved into the informal sector of the economy, or\u2014when more fortunate\u2014moved into another sector within the same region.\n\nWe should find better ways to help communities that are struggling because of the effects of free trade.  In the United States, we have historically experienced a high degree of geographic labor mobility\u2014much higher than in other advanced economies.  The ability to move in search of better opportunities, when possible, has helped to mitigate some of the adverse effects of trade.  But, mobility has declined in the United States in recent years, implying that the adjustment costs to trade may have increased.\n\nProtectionism Is Not the Answer\n\nGiven these costs of global integration and more liberalized trade, what is the best path forward?  Although protectionism can have a siren-like appeal because of its potential to provide short-term benefits to particular segments of the economy, in the longer term it would almost certainly be destructive. \n\nCountries need to compete better, not compete less.  Trade barriers are a very expensive way to preserve jobs in less competitive or declining industries.  They blunt opportunities in export industries and they reduce the affordability of goods and services to households.  Indeed, such measures often backfire, resulting in harm to workers and diminished growth. \n\nA better course is to learn from our experience.  From a U.S. standpoint, we should work to reduce remaining foreign trade restrictions that impair our ability to capitalize on our comparative advantages.  For example, market access restrictions can mean that certain U.S. industries cannot realize their full potential.  Similarly, weaknesses in the protection of intellectual property rights limit the ability of U.S. producers to realize the full returns from their investments.  This lowers profits and diminishes incentives to grow the business and employ more workers. \n\nIf we are going to enhance the benefits of free trade and better manage its costs, it is critical that we continue to strengthen the global rules-based system.  On the positive side, I would point to the World Trade Organization\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement, which addresses customs procedures and could reduce global trade costs significantly.  But, at a broader level, the momentum behind global trade reform has clearly waned in recent years.  This has occurred even though there are a number of areas that would benefit from further reform, such as agriculture and services.  That momentum needs to be rekindled and reaffirmed.  Although advanced economies historically have tended to lead the way, it is important that large emerging market countries now play a greater role.  This is appropriate given their growing prominence in the global economy. \n\nThere are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end.  Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions.  While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs.  Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.  As an illustration, import substitution models that were pursued by many emerging market economies following the Second World War eventually led to poorer economic outcomes.  Such was the experience in Brazil, which helped trigger the reforms of the early 1990s. \n\nIn assessing the benefits and costs of trade, it is important to understand that a nation\u2019s trade balance reflects much more than its trade policy.  Just as important are the country\u2019s saving and investment spending proclivities, which are affected by many factors, including tax and fiscal policies.  For example, in the United States, we have a chronic trade deficit because domestic investment spending exceeds our domestic saving.  Foreign capital inflows make up the gap.  In this process, the foreign exchange value of the dollar plays an important equilibrating mechanism.  If the domestic saving/investment imbalance is unchanged, then any reduction in the trade balance from higher trade barriers will need to be offset by lower exports.  The domestic currency will appreciate to cause the trade deficit to widen to accommodate the desired capital inflows.  Thus, trade restrictions affect the composition of trade but not the gap between exports and imports, which is determined by the difference between domestic savings and investment.  At the end of the day, the protectionist country would produce more goods in sectors protected by higher trade barriers but also fewer goods for export.\n\nThe expectation that higher trade barriers would save jobs ignores these critical second-round effects.  Moreover, the story may not end there.  What happens if another country that now faces higher trade barriers responds by raising its own barriers?  That would push production even further out of high-value-added exports that are now deterred by the higher foreign trade barriers and into those exports that face lower trade barriers, or into the goods protected by the higher domestic trade barriers.  Raising trade barriers would risk setting off a trade war, which could damage economic growth prospects around the world. \n\nMeasures that raise trade barriers typically would protect lower-wage, import-competing jobs, but would also weigh on the prospects for jobs in the more efficient export sector, which tend to be higher-paying.  The outcome would be countries producing more where they have a competitive disadvantage, and less where they have a competitive advantage\u2014the exact opposite of what we should be aiming for.  For example, in the United States, one of our largest manufacturing exports is aerospace parts (which requires skilled labor) and one of our largest imports is apparel (which requires less skilled labor). \n\nThese second-round effects would also likely hurt productivity growth.  Scarce resources would be used less efficiently and trade protection would likely lessen the level of competitive pressure that helps drive innovation.  Moreover, lower productivity growth would likely lead to a slower improvement in a nation\u2019s living standards over time.7  \n\nBetter Approaches to Deal with Globalization\n\nRather than protectionism, a better policy would be to help domestic workers and companies compete more effectively, rather than compete less.  We need additional mechanisms that allow us to more fully capture the benefits from liberalized trade and to more proactively mitigate its costs.  Ideally, policy should also better address job losses and income inequality from automation and other technological advances.\n\nHow we respond should depend on regional and industry circumstances.  These include the nature of trade impacts, the skill sets and location of the workers that have been affected, and the amount of resources that can be mobilized to facilitate adjustment. \n\nIncreasing specialization brings real economic benefits, but can also leave workers more exposed to shifts in demand for their services, potentially on short notice.  These issues are not going away, especially as emerging market economies take on a larger role in the global economy and automation continues apace.  If we are to maintain a more open trade regime, globalization must be socially and politically sustainable.  For that to be the case, we have to provide greater support to those who are hurt by trade.  Policies should include more assistance with job retraining, help with job search and mobility, and broader unemployment support.8\n\nWe also need to do more research into what measures have been effective in economies around the world, and we should encourage greater experimentation with new approaches.  Getting the balance right between providing assistance and making sure that individuals hurt by trade can get back on their feet and achieve their earning potential will be a challenge, and we need a better understanding of what actually works. \n\nMore generally, we need to do a better job positioning our workforce to cope with globalization and technological change.  Improvements across a range of areas\u2014including not only education and training, but also the business regulatory environment and infrastructure investment\u2014could support greater worker mobility.  These measures would also promote higher productivity growth.  While the scope and scale of issues differ substantially by country, many of these issues may also be relevant in Brazil. \n\nThere are various measures available in current trade agreements, such as antidumping measures and countervailing duties for dealing with \u201cunfair\u201d trade, as well as escape clauses that provide safeguards for industries that face a sudden surge of imports.  Again, the challenge is to ensure that such measures are effective, that they help facilitate rather than retard adjustment, and that they are not abused so as to avoid foreign competition.  But, both sanctions and temporary relief have been provided for in global trade rules.  We should be willing to use them when their use would lead to more equitable outcomes and would help sustain political support for a more open trade regime. \n\nFinancial Globalization Is Also Important\n\nFinancial globalization\u2014the flow of capital across national borders\u2014is also an important issue that must be considered.  These flows help to support global economic integration in the trade of goods and services.  This is a large, complex subject\u2014and one the Central Bank of Brazil is well acquainted with, having successfully managed the pressures of heavy capital inflows as well as outflows during periods of stress.  The tremendous damage of the global financial crisis underscores the importance of this issue.  As with issues related to trade, achieving effective financial globalization requires robust and mutually supportive measures at both the domestic and international levels.   \n\nFirst, the high level of cross-border capital flows\u2014and their potentially volatile nature\u2014further underlines the importance of solid domestic fundamentals, including exchange rate flexibility, a credible monetary policy framework, sustainable fiscal policy, sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and a strong financial system.\n\nThe United States has a special responsibility to keep its own house in order, given the large size of its financial markets and the U.S. dollar\u2019s status as a reserve currency.  Indeed, the U.S. financial system was the epicenter of the global financial crisis.  I believe that promoting economic growth and financial stability at home is the most important contribution the United States can make to promoting growth and stability worldwide. \n\nWith that in mind, U.S. monetary policy can have a significant impact on global financial conditions, including exchange rates, and shifts in U.S. monetary policy can lead to consequential shifts in global capital flows.  Therefore, good communication and transparency from the Federal Reserve is needed.  In this respect, I believe we have made a number of improvements in recent years that have facilitated smoother market adjustments to policy changes.  One example is the process by which the Federal Reserve began the normalization of its balance sheet last year.  We foreshadowed our intentions and initiated a program that was transparent in its design and ramped up only slowly.  While the Federal Reserve has a domestic mandate set for it by the U.S. Congress, it needs to be mindful of the international effects of its actions, which can have important potential consequences for the global economy and financial markets.9\n\nA high level of global interdependence also requires robust cooperation and effective international institutions.  To provide one example, I have traveled several times a year for the last decade to Basel, Switzerland, to discuss economic, monetary, and regulatory policy with foreign central bankers at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  This dialogue\u2014supported by ongoing bilateral discussions between central banks\u2014helps build trust, understanding, and the valuable relationships that are crucial during periods of stress.    \n\nThe global financial crisis put the need for a more robust and resilient financial system in stark relief.  Such a regime is necessary if we are to maintain the flow of credit to the real economy\u2014both domestically and internationally\u2014during times of stress.  Over the last decade, policymakers have implemented a range of reforms that have materially strengthened the banking system, including higher capital and liquidity buffers for the major international banks.10\n\nInternational coordination has been essential to the successful implementation of these reforms.  Banking is a global business that requires a high degree of regulatory consistency and as level a playing field as possible to avoid distortions and regulatory arbitrage.  Under the auspices of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of the BIS, a wide-ranging set of reforms has been introduced progressively, including the recent finalization of the Basel III reforms.11  \n\nTighter regulation of international banks must be complemented by effective supervision, and much progress has been made in improving home/host supervisory cooperation.  In a local context, cross-border supervisory coordination has taken on increased importance as Brazilian banks have expanded internationally in recent years.  Still, greater clarity around how large global banks will be resolved is required if we are to successfully end \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d\n\nFinally, it is increasingly clear to me that we also need to develop a better shared understanding of the proper role of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation in a healthy and fair global trading system.  To be sure, in a world of volatile capital flows, experience has shown that having adequate reserve cushions has helped many emerging market economies ward off costly instability.  Indeed, Brazil\u2019s large stock of foreign exchange reserves has been a key pillar of stability through turbulent periods.  But, reserves are a relatively expensive form of insurance, and excessive reserve accumulation can undermine global adjustment, shift burdens onto trading partners, and erode political support for continued trade openness.  As I have said on other occasions, I think that part of the solution lies in further improving the international safety net, so that countries have more efficient and less costly ways of ensuring resilience.12\n\nTo conclude, although the benefits from an open trade regime remain compelling, we must also recognize that such a regime imposes costs, and these need to be forcefully addressed.  Focusing on these costs is necessary if globalization\u2014including its financial dimensions\u2014is to work for all of us.\n\nThank you for your time. I would be happy to take some questions."

    "title": "Remarks at the Economic Press Briefing on Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands After Hurricanes Irma and Maria",
    "date": "Feb 22, 2018",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/dud180222",
    "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the New York Fed\u2019s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  Today, we will provide an update on the economies of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with particular focus on the impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nInitial Fallout from the Storms\n\nHurricanes Irma and Maria did immense damage to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, severely exacerbating what were already very difficult economic conditions.  My heart goes out to our fellow citizens who have suffered so much and who face a long and difficult recovery ahead.\n\nMaria was the most devastating hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century.  Many lives were lost, homes and businesses suffered immense damage, and large parts of the Island\u2019s infrastructure and agriculture were destroyed.  Moreover, Puerto Rico\u2019s power outage was, by far, the most severe in U.S. history, in terms of total customer-hours lost, and it will still likely take many more months to fully restore electricity and other critical infrastructure to all of the Island\u2019s residents.  As a result, a sizable number of residents went to the U.S. mainland in the weeks following Maria, and it still is unclear how many will return once circumstances improve.\n\nEven before the storms hit, Puerto Rico was struggling with severe fiscal difficulties and a long period of poor economic performance.  For over a decade, the Island has been experiencing a shrinking economy, contracting employment, low and declining labor force participation, and persistent out-migration of residents to the mainland.  Furthermore, public debt reached a problematic level, and the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities\u2014including the power and water authorities\u2014lost their ability to borrow in the public markets.  Defaults and ongoing debt restructuring efforts followed.\n\nIn the U.S. Virgin Islands, the situation is similar in many ways.  St. Thomas and St. John were ravaged by Irma, and St. Croix was devastated by Maria just two weeks later.  Their economy, which is much more dependent on tourism than that of Puerto Rico, has also been contracting for the better part of a decade.  However, the population of the U.S. Virgin Islands has not fallen nearly as sharply as Puerto Rico\u2019s, and its economy had stabilized in the past two years following the closure of a major refinery in 2012.  Still, while by some measures the U.S. Virgin Islands are not as fiscally stressed as Puerto Rico, they, too, do not have access to the debt markets.\n\nRecovery and Rebuilding\n\nThe combined impact of complex preexisting economic problems and the hurricanes has made recovery much more challenging.  The loss of market access has severely hampered the ability of the governments to mobilize resources to respond to the damage and rebuild and upgrade infrastructures.\n\nOne example is Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical grid, which is a major obstacle to recovery.  Even before Maria, Puerto Rico suffered frequent blackouts, and the high cost and unreliability of electricity had reduced business competitiveness.  Puerto Rico\u2019s power plants are largely outdated and inefficient, and the electrical distribution system is poorly maintained and extremely fragile.  In my mind, given this poor starting point, now is a perfect opportunity for Puerto Rico to essentially start from scratch and build a resilient power generation and distribution network.  I would assume that an emphasis on renewable energy would be part of this effort, especially given the dramatic fall in costs for this form of electricity generation.  The challenge, of course, will be how to finance this investment, when the Commonwealth is already mired in debt.\n\nDespite these woes, there are signs of resilience in Puerto Rico.  As we will show, job losses following the storm were very substantial, totaling around 4 percent in Puerto Rico and 8 percent in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These losses are considerably steeper than after most major hurricanes that have hit the United States. However, they are not as devastating as Katrina\u2019s impact on the New Orleans economy more than a decade ago, which was and remains unprecedented.  Nonetheless, the labor market, at least in Puerto Rico, appears to be stabilizing as jobs in sectors that were most affected\u2014such as leisure and hospitality\u2014have started to come back.  And, as repair and rebuilding efforts get underway in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, jobs are being created in sectors such as construction.  These job gains are expected to continue for some time to come.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nPuerto Rico now must not only complete the recovery from the hurricane, but also do what is necessary to get on a sustainable economic and fiscal path.  Given the Island\u2019s high debt, unfunded pension obligations, declining population, and now the hurricane, the outlook may seem grim.\n\nBut there are good reasons not to despair.  As I have noted previously, New York City went through a similar crisis during the 1970s: its population was declining, the economy was in a five-year recession, and the city had literally run out of money to pay its employees and could not borrow in the debt markets.  However, leaders had the courage to confront these problems head on, and they adopted a series of reforms, including the establishment of a fiscal oversight board and a more transparent budgeting process.  All of this helped transform the city from an increasingly blighted urban landscape to the vibrant economy of today.  And, New York City is not the only example of a major turnaround.  Now-dynamic cities such as Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, and Seattle also went through wrenching economic and fiscal contractions.  While Puerto Rico\u2019s path to prosperity will not look exactly like that of New York or other cities, history can provide valuable lessons, as well as hope for a better future.  The same can be said for the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nIn addition, Puerto Rico has a number of unique attributes and endowments that it can leverage as it seeks a path toward prosperity, including its educated and bilingual workforce, its proximity and access to markets on the U.S. mainland, and its extensive experience as a host to various major U.S. multinational corporations.\n\nBut, a recovery is not going to happen on its own.  We at the New York Fed have made a number of suggestions over the years that we think can help improve Puerto Rico\u2019s competitiveness and economic prospects.2   Some of these issues are now being addressed, and still more are at least being discussed.  Among others, lowering the costs and disincentives to doing business, helping Island residents develop and use their human capital, and improving labor market opportunities are all important steps that must be taken.\n\nOn the fiscal side, the Financial Oversight and Management Board and the Commonwealth together will be making a series of difficult choices over the coming months.  It will be critically important that these decisions put the Commonwealth on a sustainable fiscal path going forward.  As in other examples, such as New York City in the 1970s, the fiscal adjustment will be painful, and many important decisions will undoubtedly be unpopular.  While the pain has been\u2014and will continue to be\u2014widely shared, it is also critical to seek ways to ensure that the benefits from the restoration of growth are shared broadly.  How exactly to make this work is an open question that I am certain the oversight board and its stakeholders will consider carefully over the coming months.\n\nThe New York Fed will continue to help in the best ways we can\u2014by providing independent research and analysis, and by leveraging our convening authority to bring together stakeholders to share expertise, explore opportunities, and provide information to those who need it most.  We recently held two events on the Island\u2014one for small business owners impacted by the storm and another for credit unions.  We plan to do more in the months and years ahead, and I look forward to gaining a better understanding of conditions on the ground and how we can help when I travel to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands next month.\n\nNow, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jason Bram, who will talk more about what we are starting to see in terms of the economic impact of the storms."

    "content": "James Rosener:\n\nDistinguished guests, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen: good morning. My name is James Rosener. I'm President of the European American Chamber of Commerce, and managing partner of the New York Office of Pepper Hamilton. First, let me thank Thomson Reuters for hosting this event and our own partnership with them together.\n\nOn behalf of the European American Chamber of Commerce, it's a great pleasure to welcome you today to a program on \"Banking Culture: Room for Improvement?\", which brings together three of the foremost thinkers on the subject. Here with us today are William Dudley, President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank; William Rhodes, President and CEO of WR Rhodes Global Advisors, and author of Banker to the World; and Ellen Alemany, Chairwoman and CEO of CIT Group, who also brings us a European perspective from her tenure in London.\n\nAmong our esteemed guests, we also have Stuart Mackintosh, Executive Director of the Group of Thirty. And moderating today's panel is Rob Cox, editor of Breakingiews, of Reuters News.\n\nThis panel discussion is particularly important as many consumers are still with the process of rebuilding wealth and financial services firms continue to struggle with consumer mistrust as well as regulatory compliance issues.\n\nWe all remember the crisis of 2007 and 2008, and how it shook the foundations of the exciting economic system. People all over the world became increasingly angry, cynical, and distrustful. Stock markets plummeted, companies collapsed, individuals watched their savings evaporate, and unemployment rose to levels unseen in decades.\n\nIn the aftermath of the global crisis, regulators introduced a wide range of measures and began implementing stricter micro- and macroprudential policies intending to strengthen the resilience and stability of the economic system.\n\nAlthough in the years since the financial crisis, authorities have increased investigative and enforcement capabilities, punished business for misconduct, and addressed violations, we've learned from a number of scandals and corporate abuses regularly making the headlines that malfeasance, reckless business practices and behavior are a common and widespread phenomenon across business sectors worldwide.\n\nAlmost every active observer acknowledges that the state of affairs represents a bigger problem and calls for drastic change in culture\u2014how employees and management interact and handle business affairs.\n\nJust last Friday, the Fed made it clear to the entire banking system that it will hold boards of directors responsible for conduct and impose limitations on growth where financial institutions have not shown sufficient progress in implementing the kind of risk management that is expected.\n\nAt the same time, we're hearing from the administration about increased deregulation. Thankfully, there's growing and spirited debate on culture and conduct. A majority of banks and institutions are active participants in the debate. They employ consultants, host workshops and conferences, and adopt culture-oriented mission statements. Everyone agrees there's plenty of room for improvement. Creating a virtuous business culture is not an easy task and presents some serious challenges.\n\nWe hope this discussion will shed some light on how banks and financial institutions can benefit from corporate governance best practices\u2014specifically culture change\u2014and overcome the widespread negative perceptions that continue to rattle the sector.\n\nI encourage all participants to engage in the discussions. Do not hesitate to ask questions, not only of our panelists but to one another, and make this a truly interactive event. Thank you for your attention, and I hope you enjoy this important discussion.\n\nWith that, I'll handle it over to Rob Cox.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nThanks Jim. Good morning everybody. Thank you for braving the incipient snow and getting yourselves away from your screens, showing us reds and greens in the stock market. It's hard to believe it's only Wednesday. But I can only surmise from your participation here that you also see a link between culture, banking culture, and the global economy, as I think these panelists that we have up here do, and have done quite a bit to champion our thinking in that regard.\n\nThey don't need any introduction. You've got their bios. Their reputations precede them. I thought I'd just start with you, Bill D. I'm going to go with Bill D, it could be your hip-hop name when you retire next year. But we have two Bills here.\n\nSo, four years ago, you kicked off this conversation with a conference on banking culture, and forming banking culture. It's gone global. Are you happy with the progress that's been made up to now? What's the state of affairs in our understanding of good bank culture?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I guess I would say I'm pleased that there's been substantial progress, but I'm not satisfied with the progress. In other words, there could be even more progress. I think in the United States, for example, we could do more in terms of having an industry-wide survey that actually allows firms to benchmark their results versus one another\u2014we have that in the U.K.\n\nWe could probably do more to address the so-called \"rolling bad apple problem.\" This is where someone leaves a firm after bad behavior, and then gets hired by another firm that's completely unaware of why that person was let go.\n\nSo we proposed\u2014the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has proposed a banking registry, where you could actually keep track of why people actually were dismissed.\n\nThere is something similar to that in the U.K., so I think they've actually made a bit more progress than we have. The good news, though, is I think bankers are taking this a lot more seriously. A number of bank leaders have endorsed working on culture. A number of boards of directors have set up committees on culture. So, I think\u2014have we gotten as far as we need to go? No. Have we made a lot of progress? Yes.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou're speaking as the New York Fed President, but what is your sense of other folks around the world, whether it's the Bank of England who are starting the Financial Conduct Authority, or whoever it might be in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think there's a pretty broad acceptance of the notion that regulation and compliance only takes you so far, and that bad conduct really does undermine the effectiveness of the financial system, because it basically reduces trust.\n\nWe saw in the middle of the financial crisis that it was the breakdown of confidence in the system that really led to the severity of the Great Recession. And I'm not sure how much conduct played into that, but I think it probably played a role.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBill R, a question for you. Maybe stepping back, what are we talking about when we talk about culture? It's not yogurt, right? As someone who has been a banker for many years, and now has spent a lot of time looking at this issue from the vantage point of the G30, how do you characterize culture?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nI think culture is really made up of the history, tradition, and values of a given institution. Each institution is different, and it must look to those three elements, and it can't be imposed by the supervisors and regulators, which they understand. I mean, this isn't something like capital, where you can say\u2014or liquidity\u2014\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhich is a number?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nExactly. At the end of the day, though, it's the most important element of all, because if you don't have a good culture and you don't enact it in the sense of conduct, you're going to ruin your reputation. And once an institution, particularly a financial institution, loses its reputation, then it is a very, very difficult road to slog back.\n\nAnd this is why the Group of Thirty decided to get into this area in the first place. We've been working on it for five years. We are now finalizing with our third report, and as we go around the world in all areas of the world, we are finding that financial institutions, mainly banks, understand the importance of this thing. And if we needed to have a reminder, it was the Great Recession, and what occurred there.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nOne of the things that's come out of this discussion, I think it was Baroness O'Neill in the U.K., her argument was that you have to ask yourself as an institution, what are you for?\n\nAnd I think that's a pretty interesting\u2014I think any company, it doesn't have to be a bank, but certainly a bank\u2014there are certain other social imperatives to make sure that you know what you are for. How would you, Ellen, describe what CIT is for?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nSure, actually CIT has a very long history, but it's a 110-year-old company that started out as a commercial finance company in St. Louis, as Commercial Credit and Investment Trust, which then became Commercial and Investment Trust, CIT.\n\nIt had a lot of different owners. It was unregulated, and what happened was it took TARP money during the crisis, filed bankruptcy, and then reemerged, and then acquired OneWest Bank.\n\nSo when I took over the company, it definitely had \"who are we?\" And I think one of the first things we had to do with employees was really come up with a specific \"this is our strategy,\" which is to give loans and leasing to small and middle-market companies on a national basis, funded by deposits. And a very clear statement.\n\nWe also\u2014because of all the different ownerships, and unregulated/regulated et cetera\u2014really didn't have a value set at the company. And so another exercise I did with the team was we did a cultural survey, and it was really telling what came out of the cultural survey, but as a result of that, we said \"what are the top behaviors that we want for the company going forward?\"\n\nAnd we came up with six behaviors. The first was straight talk. In the institution, we found that people were just really afraid to be open and to talk about bad news. And so straight talk was the first.\n\nThe second was collaboration. Everybody just wanted to be left alone. That was one thing that came out loud and clear in the survey, it was just \"leave me alone.\" They felt if they were doing their piece of the project, that was enough. No one was looking at the enterprise-wide or the full picture.\n\nAccountability was another one. When 15 people sign a credit memo, who's really accountable?\n\nAnd then we also came up with customer-focused, risk-disciplined, and high-performing. And so these are our six values. And we have to constantly reinforce these values in the company.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou had to do a fair amount of pruning and pairing back of some of the businesses. You had an international business, aircraft leasing. Does that tell us anything about the difficulty of actually imparting culture across borders, or was it just too difficult to pull all those things together?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nNo, I mean we put a strategy in place that we wanted to be a leading small and middle-market domestic lender, and we did a strategic review of the company, and we saw that we were in many countries. These businesses were underperforming. There was no connectivity with any of the other businesses.\n\nWe also felt that an aircraft leasing company shouldn't be in a bank because of the capital requirements on the forward order book. So, this was all part of a clear, crisp strategy for the employees, for our shareholders, and then executing against it.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBill Rhodes, you were at Citigroup for many, many years. It in many ways it defines sort of the international banking culture. Just thinking about that culture\u2014not necessarily Citigroup\u2014but when do you think it lost its way a bit? That American banking culture, the global culture of banking?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell, when I started out in banking, which was obviously a long time ago, we had embedded in us three things. First of all, the reputation of the bank. That was number one. But also along with that was the need to look after your customer, and also work with the community.\n\nThese were the three basic values that were embedded in us. Along the way, unfortunately, I think it shifted to short-term profitability, and those early, let's say \"commandments\" tended to be forgotten. And what was the result of this? The financial institutions\u2014again, we're talking banks here\u2014lost the trust of the public, the shareholders, and even of their own staff. And we can see this in some of the more recent cases like Wells Fargo. All three of them are there.\n\nThe other point which people tend to forget, and this is just basic business logic for success, is that if you have a good culture and you act in the proper way, conduct-wise, you are going to do better in your business. It's something that Mario Draghi always says, and he's correct. It's that good business practices, in the sense of culture and conduct, makes your customer feel better, loyal, and people want to bank with an institution that has that.\n\nSo at the end of the day, this is something that pays off to the so-called bottom line. The whole idea of having a proper culture and conduct, embedding it, monitoring it, and very, very importantly, what do you do if someone crosses the line?\n\nI think first of all, you have to look at compensation for the individual. Take a hit compensation-wise, and if that doesn't do it, then you look at termination. I think these are all basic points that we've seen, and pretty much agreed to in our surveys of the Group of Thirty.\n\nAs I said, we are finalizing that now. There are a lot of other things we came forth with. But this is basically what I think happened along the way. And if institutions, banks are smart, they will never allow themselves to go back to that.\n\nForget about what the regulators and supervisors say. The institution itself is the first line of defense. And it's always easy when the problems come up, to say, well, the rating agencies gave us triple-A on this particular instrument, and the supervisors, regulators didn't pick it up. And oh, by the way, the politicians were pushing us to make those mortgage loans. No matter what it took.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhen I think about what you just said, it sounds to me like the cult of shareholder value may have been more influential in forcing companies to think, or banks\u2014companies generally, but let's keep it to banks\u2014in thinking about short-term reward, or short-term incentives.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell, that was all part of the short-term profitability. And that was, as you know, for a period of time the most important metric, and the press built it up. You know, what's the shareholder value and\u2014\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBut I'm wondering how do you balance this need to serve shareholders who can turf out a CEO or the boards of directors? At any time, you always have that barometer of the stock price. Bill, you want to answer this? I also want to ask Ellen: how do you manage this? You've got on the one hand your investors, and on the other, you've got this need to build a long-term, stable, culturally good institution.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nYes, but if your customer does not trust you and the public does not trust you, it's going to fall to the bottom line. So, good business practices like the ones I've mentioned actually help the bottom line. And when you don't have that, you can see the consequences.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYes, yes. Bill Dudley?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou asked the question, why does this happen? I think there are a lot of reasons, but there are two things that I guess I would talk about. Number one is business became more transactional rather than client-focused, and that's partly the growth of the capital markets.\n\nThe second thing is scale. The scale of the institutions got a lot larger. And so I think it became much harder for people at the top to actually\u2014for their views to penetrate deep into the organization.\n\nI really do have a question about whether it's actually possible to manage organizations of several hundred thousand people effectively. Time will tell. One reason to work on culture, though, is to actually get the views of the CEO, and the executive suite, to penetrate down into the organization. It's really difficult the bigger you get and the more complex you get.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nSo how do you manage this balance? Milton Friedman on the one hand and Bill Rhodes on the other, in making sure you're delivering for shareholders but at the same time delivering for the long term and not creating problems down the road?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nSure, before I answer that question, though, I think if there's any one takeaway from today, it is the point that Bill made, is that having a good culture is good business. And it's the tone from the top and believing that if your colleagues are engaged, if your customers are satisfied, if the communities you do business with prosper, then business is going to prosper, which in turn turns into shareholder value.\n\nAnd it's always that balance between the short and the long term. And we manage that through lots of different ways. Compensation is only one piece. But in compensation we make sure that we have a balanced business scorecard for the senior managers.\n\nSo, a percentage is based on the financial results, and it's not just one financial measure, it's several financial measures. And then the other piece is qualitative. We break it up into three buckets\u2014strategic/operational, risk, and then people/culture. Does this employee demonstrate the CIT values?\n\nWe also have clawback, and by having this qualitative, too, if something does go bad or someone doesn't do something that we think is appropriate, you have enough flexibility there to manage the compensation.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI want to delve further into incentives because I think it's really critical to this conversation. But just sort of stepping back a little bit to my first question to you, Bill Dudley, which was about the progress we've made. A corollary to that is the President has talked quite a bit about his deregulatory efforts. We've certainly seen some measures from the House Financial Services Committee that probably will never see the light of day in the Senate. But we also have seen the Senate with its bill to soften, shall we say, parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Is there a danger that this whole cultural discussion gets thrown out with this deregulatory swing back of the pendulum?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, first of all, I guess I don't think that the deregulatory swing is going to be that great, thankfully. I've been talking about this for many months about how it's really important, while we can make regulations simpler and more efficient, that makes a lot of sense, we don't want to go back to where we were in 2007, 2008. So higher capital requirements, higher liquidity requirements, better resolution regime, the ability to centrally clear over-the-counter derivatives, regulate the entities that we clear these through, all of those things need to be kept. Orderly liquidation authority. And so far I'm actually pretty optimistic that the regulatory reforms are going to be around the edges as opposed to wholesale.\n\nThe second thing I would just say, though, is that regulation and culture\u2014these are complements, not substitutes. If you think that regulation can somehow substitute for culture, I think you're really mistaken. In fact, in some ways, the more intense the regulatory regime, it can actually undermine culture, because people can actually say, well, the regulators are saying what I can and cannot do, and so as long as I stick within the confines of those regulations, it's all fine.\n\nBut that's actually not true. Just because a regulation sets this frame or field of scope, there may be things within that that you actually don't want to do. There are number of examples, as we saw, during the financial crisis. One of the most famous ones was Repo 105, which Lehman Brothers did to dress up their balance sheet to misrepresent their balance sheet to the public. That was legal under the accounting rules, but very deceptive. So that was an example where if you just go by what's regulatory-appropriate, you can actually have very bad outcomes.\n\nSo I think that it's not one or the other. You need a good regulatory regime supplemented by various good conduct and culture in the organizations.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBut I was recently in London speaking to the CEO of a big U.K. bank, and he was saying, \"I'm really worried that they're going to relax the Volcker Rule,\" for instance, and \"If those guys are trading using their balance sheet, how are we going to compete?\" And so there's definitely a fear about this.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nOh, you're right, there's always a little bit of pressure that regulation gets rolled back in one regime and everyone says, oh, now these people are more competitive than our people. And so the \"race to the bottom\" problem is obviously all something we have to be aware of.\n\nThat's one reason why I think that the U.S. involvement in Basel with the Bank for International Settlements is important because that helps establish minimum standards that are implemented across the world, to essentially lean against that pressure to race to the bottom in terms of regulation.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBut some things\u2014for instance, relaxing the threshold at which you're a G-SIFI, things like that\u2014that would help CIT, I would imagine. In other words, you can hold less capital as a result of some of these rule changes.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nWe're in an interesting situation because we're actually the first bank in the U.S. that actually raised our hand and said we want to become SIFI. And then we decided to sell the aircraft\u2014we would have been about $80 billion in assets, and we decided to sell our aircraft leasing business, and now we are right at the cusp. We're around $50 billion in assets.\n\nAnd I had gotten so many questions from investors, our board, et cetera. \"Do you de-SIFI?\" \"Will you save a lot of money if you de-SIFI because you don't have to spend money doing these things?\"\n\nAnd we sat there as a management team and we said, you know what? We needed to improve our capital planning process at the company, and that a lot of what is required for a SIFI bank, and if we want to build a strong foundation to grow the company going forward, we needed to invest in.\n\nSo, if the threshold changes, it's really not going to impact what we do day-to-day, because the Federal Reserve Bank still requires us to have a capital planning process that meets the new standards. The standards have been raised for the industry. And we want to build a strong foundation for the company.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nSo, does that mean if you don't have to, even if you don't have to hold an extra one basis point of capital, you would?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nNo, it's more of\u2014the whole capital plan\u2014what's involved with the capital planning process. And we also want to maintain capital that's appropriate for the risk profile of the company. And just because the regulators demand a certain level, it's our assessment of what capital is appropriate for the risks that we're taking as a company. It's a guideline.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhat is your sense of the regulatory environment? How has it changed with the examiners or whoever it is that are sort of crawling around the bank? Are they now smiling, offering lollipops? [CROSSTALK] Pretend Bill is not here. Is there a mood music change of some sort?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nI think that the tone at the top is different in terms of what people are saying\u2014how it actually flows down and impacts us on a day-to-day basis. It really hasn't changed yet in the regulations. For us, there's been more of a tone change at the OCC rather than the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nPeople act like this is sort of this big giant fight between firms and the supervisors. In a lot of ways, the interests are actually very well aligned. We want to have good risk management. We want to have good governance. We want to have adequate capital, adequate liquidity. The firms presumably want all of the same things. So this idea that we're all going head-to-head, I just don't think that is really actually how good supervision and good private sector engagement with that supervision actually works.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nSo you don't have grumpy examiners on your staff?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI'm sure we have some grumpy examiners on our staff.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI mean this actually goes back to the question\u2014you mentioned it before, Ellen\u2014which is good culture being good business. Bill, you wrote a column for us over the summer in which you pointed out that misdeeds and bad behavior and settlements have cost the industry something like $330 billion since the crisis. I mean, that's coming right out of shareholder value.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nNow it's somewhere north of, I think, $350 billion. Those are Boston Consulting figures.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYes, but of course, you know, everything is doing well, everybody is making tons of money now. Is there a risk that these settlements and fines that we've seen meted out are basically just seen by bankers as a cost of doing business over the cycle?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nI certainly don't think so, because in addition to what fines you're paying, you're getting very bad publicity. And it doesn't make the shareholders, your staff, or your customers very happy when they see something like this. Forget about the impact on the bottom line.\n\nAnd I think Ellen commented on the tone at the top, which is key. But it must go right down to middle management, or right down to the teller level. Everyone has to be a believer in this, and they have to practice it. It has to be embedded and monitored throughout.\n\nAnd as I said, and then when you have bad players\u2014bad apples, as Bill said\u2014compensation is a first hit. But eventually you're going to have to go to termination. And I think this has to be understood all the way from the top down to the bottom.\n\nThe other point is that if, in fact, we see let's say less regulation and supervision across the system, that gives even more importance to the culture and conduct area. Because the last thing an institution wants to do is to repeat some of the failures that we've seen over the last decade or more.\n\nAnd I think these things built up over the last 20 years or so\u2014it didn't happen overnight. And the price to pay, with loss of trust\u2014forget about the financial settlements\u2014I think has been significant. Because what do you find today? The area of trust has still not I think fully been given by any of the constituents, as I mentioned, to the institutions. Plus the politicians around the world\u2014particularly in the United States, Canada, Western Europe\u2014are still very I'd say antsy about the banking system, as you can see. So I think we still have a lot of work to go in this area. We've made progress but it's like a stop on a train. You've got more distance to go.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nHow do you feel?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nTwo things that I think are important. Number one, the fines have gotten a lot bigger. At times there's been actually a risk to firms that's existential. The risk of actually losing your charter. So, I think that's causing the senior management to take this a lot more seriously. So I think that's an important change from what we had before.\n\nI think the second thing is the industry is held in not such high regard now. And that has actually consequences for their ability to attract talent. So we've been having a number of business school deans come in and talk to us at New York Fed over the last few years, and what they say is that there are people who will actually not go into the financial services industry because of this bad conduct. That's not a good cycle. If the most ethical people coming out of the business schools decide that they are not going to go into this industry, that means there's quite a bit more work to do.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nThey're all going into journalism.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nBill D. actually makes a really good point. By the year 2020, 50% of our workforce is going to be millennials, and the millennials prioritize different things than we did coming up in our careers. They want corporate social responsibility. They want culture, they want values. And so if you have a good culture, it's really a competitive advantage in terms of attracting the millennials to your workforce.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nSo, Bill, you said in one of your speeches on this topic that incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture. If you want a culture that will support your long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors that will sustain your business over the long haul.\n\nThis is for all of you, but I'll start with you, Bill D. What specifically has been done around the issue of compensation? What are you seeing when you look at comp plans, and not just for the CEOs and CFOs, but throughout the organizations?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nThe reason why I stress that, because people always say, culture is sort of a soft subject, so what can we actually do about it as leaders in banking organizations. Well, you can look at how you compensate people, how you promote people. Those are things that you can actually set. And by having an appropriate set of incentives, you're probably going to get the behaviors that are more consistent with what you desire. And if you get that, over time, that will actually establish the culture of the organization. That will sort of set the social norms that define the organization.\n\nSo, the reason why I stress incentives is this is something that senior management actually has control over. There are things that they can actually do in terms of how people are compensated, how they are evaluated, how they are promoted. And that's why I really\u2014\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWell, what are those things? If you were to trace back to 2006\u2014\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I think we've made some progress on the compensation front, in the sense that there's more deferral of compensation, and there's more scope for clawbacks. But I personally think that there's scope for doing even more on this front.\n\nIf you go back to the old partnership model where people actually had their capital tied up in the firm, and couldn't get their capital back until years after they retired, they had strong incentives to make sure that the firm didn't\u2014\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou were at Goldman when it was a partnership, right?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I wasn't a partner when it was a partnership. But, yeah, I think that culture was helpful in terms of risk management. The willingness to take risk. So, one thing you could look at for example is do we really want to have all these deferrals in the form of stock grants? Maybe we should have these deferrals in the form of total loss-absorbing debt.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nLike a hybrid coco or whatever those things are?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, or just something that basically if the firm does badly in the future, and fails, the compensation that has been deferred in the form of debt gets converted to equity, and the management actually has to suffer some of the consequences.\n\nAnother thing that I think would be really worth looking at a little bit would be who pays the fines when firms have bad conduct and behavior. Why does it always come out of the shareholder's pocket? The shareholders may not have even been shareholders at the time of the bad behavior. Maybe there should be a device that could actually reach down and grab some money out of the pockets of the managers who actually were responsible for the bad behavior and the bad conduct.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhat have you done Ellen? Do you have specific formulas? Is there something you can tell us about the contours of your incentive schemes that are designed to do exactly what Bill is talking about?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nSure, I just touched on some of it before, but at least for the senior team, we put a balanced business scorecard in place that's\u2014a percentage of it is financial performance, with financial targets. And then there's a qualitative piece. We also have deferral through performance stock units and restricted and stock units. And then we also have clawback.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nHave you had to ever claw anything back?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nNot at my current firm, but in a prior firm that I worked at, yes, we have used the clawback for employees. And I actually think that the European banks use it a little more aggressively than the American institutions, and they were really\u2014the European banks were the first to implement clawback.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nIs that right? When you were at Citi in the '80s and '90s, you probably didn't have all of these kinds of highfalutin bells and whistles on compensation then.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell, the compensation was a lot lower to start off with.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nOh, that's true.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nI want to just pick up some of the things that Ellen and Bill have said. I think it's very important that your staff\u2014we talk about those at the top, the middle management down to the teller\u2014have pride in the institution that they are working for. And this then spills over to the client and the customer. And I think that's when we're going to get the trust level back. And then when you talk about pros and cons of rating people, for compensation, one of the things that has become somewhat controversial is the role of the whistleblower.\n\nA lot of institutions don't even call it whistleblowing, they call it\u2014I think in CIT, Ellen told me it's a hotline. And the responsibility that if you're sitting next to somebody, or you see something that is not correct, that you will speak up in some form or fashion. And I can run through some institutions where this did not happen, or where the employee tried to speak up and was suppressed or even fired.\n\nAnd so I think it's key to maintain the pride of the employees and the trust of your customers, that you have some sort of mechanism where if an employee sees something that's being done incorrectly, he or she will speak up. And it makes a lot of sense that this be done really right up to the board level, because what do you want to do? Read about it in the newspaper? Or have your friendly supervisor call you and say, \"We just got a call from someone in your organization saying they've seen this or that.\"\n\nAnd I think that has been another problem. This was suppressed during this period of time. The whole idea of people in the institutions speaking up, and that also has to go back to pride in the institution, that they will do so because they think it's wrong and they don't want to be with an institution that does bad things.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nAnd then senior management has to be receptive to that employee.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nExactly, exactly. Right up to the board level. Because too often\u2014in our first report, as Stuart knows, we worked on, and Bill\u2014was the role of the Board. Because too often boards either didn't want to know, or frankly didn't push senior management to let them know what was going on.\n\nAnd in the most recent cases that I've seen\u2014it's out there. A number of board members of Wells Fargo said we were never told, we didn't know. And it's not just Wells. All of the institutions involved in this in the United States and Europe went through the same bit. So I think this is key.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nLet's talk about Wells. Wells is a living and breathing case study, really, in some of this stuff. I mean Bill Dudley\u2014the Fed last week issued an order forbidding Wells from growing its balance sheet further until they say \"sufficient improvements\" in governance and risk management are made.\n\nAs Bill Rhodes points out, four directors, concomitant with this announcement, were leaving the board. I mean if culture is improved broadly across the industry, how are we to interpret what's happened with Wells, which, prior to this last two years, was considered the sort of paragon of good banking culture?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, that goes back to the discussion we were having before on incentives. They had really bad incentives in terms of how they evaluated and compensated their employees. So you were compensated on the basis of how many accounts you opened. And that was sort of problem number one. So the incentives were wrong. And then two, when people complained about it\u2014employees complained about it\u2014and went up the chain of command, that was essentially not heard or ignored.\n\nTo Bill's point, you want to have a culture where people are willing and comfortable raising their hands. But that willingness and comfort at raising your hand depends on how that's received in the organization. So at Wells Fargo, apparently, people did raise their hands, or tried to raise their hands, and the message just wasn't received by senior management, and I think it never really got to the board of directors.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nHas enough been done on Wells Fargo? I will just say, we've called for a full change of management, CEO level, pretty much since this thing came. We didn't think it was\u2014given the level of cultural rot, that you could have someone who had come from that culture running the place. You think they should fire Tim Sloan?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don't have a view on that. That's way beyond my pay station. I think Wells Fargo understands that they have to change their culture. I mean, I think they completely understand that. Betsy Duke is the lead director at Wells Fargo, and I've worked with her when she was at the Board of Governors.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nShe's chair now.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes, she's chair now. And I think they get that they have to do some pretty substantive things to change the culture there. So, the proof of the pudding will be in meeting those, so they actually have to do it. And, you know, it's hard to change culture in very large, complex organizations. It's not something that one can do overnight. The problem that people always talk about is that the people at the top of the house may have the greatest intentions. But how can they actually reach down into the middle layers of management and sort of change how people perceive the organization?\n\nYou can have a lot of cynicism at the mid-level and lower levels. Like, \"Yeah, the senior management is doing this, but they're just doing this because they are under regulatory pressure. They don't really mean it.\" So it is hard to actually change in these large, complex organizations.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nThere are successful precedents. One could say JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon, there is a sort of inculcated culture at all levels. Of course, we'll see what happens. Headlines may pop at any time and ruin our view of that. But Ellen, you wanted to say something?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nI just want to pick up on that point that cultural change just doesn't happen overnight. And a lot of the studies say it's at least a three-year process, and it's also just not about the regulatory and the compensation. There's what do you do on a day-to-day basis to make sure that the values and behaviors really flow through the entire organization, and that it's living and breathing within the organization.\n\nAnd some of the things that we do\u2014in every town hall and through all our communication and messaging to our employees, we talk about culture and we talk about our values.\n\nI do town halls where I give out a chairwoman's award for employees who demonstrate that they're living our core values and behaviors. And it doesn't sound like a lot, but it really is very meaningful inside the organization. Through some of our corporate programs, like even wellness, to show that we care about our employees. Or we look at our customer complaints. We have a new product approval process where we sit and we talk about, well, gee, what does this product do for the customer?\n\nWe look at business practices, or do you have any financial results that are outsized? I remember taking over a leasing business, and I couldn't figure out\u2014it was a business that when I was at Citi, that Citi had acquired, and I couldn't figure out why they made so much more money in their business versus our business. And so we tried to look at the whole process, front end to back end, and realized that this company we bought had really egregious end-of-lease practices, and we immediately terminated those. Because those things aren't sustainable in the long term.\n\nWe have a hotline. I can't tell you how important the hotline is, and it's important that employees feel like they have a safe environment. And we have my head of human resources, my general counsel, and my head of audit chair the ethics committee, and they look at all of the hotline reports that come through and say is there anything here we think we need to investigate further?\n\nSo, as I said, there's just so many things you need to do in the company. Having a diverse board, so that there are board members that are more sensitive to some of these types of issues and ask the questions at the board meeting. There's just a long list of things that need to be done.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI want to pick up on the Board question, I mean\u2014\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nI would say that that is key\u2014tone at the top, but all the way down, as I said, to middle management and the teller, because often this gets shipwrecked at the middle-management level. But one of the things that we recommended in our last report, which came out in July 2015, was an incident\u2014\n\nRob Cox:\n\nThis is the G30?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nThe G30 report, yes. One of the things we recommended is that boards take a look at forming separate committees to look at culture and conduct, because the norm usually was to put audit and risk together. First of all, audit and risk never should have been put together, because the tendency was to spend all the time on the audit side and nothing on the risk side.\n\nBut in addition to having an audit committee and a separate risk committee, a number of institutions have picked up\u2014or some institutions\u2014have picked up on our recommendation to form a separate committee on culture and conduct.\n\nAnd the reason why this is so important is so you don't get this point that you were making where the board says \"we didn't know what was going on\" type thing. Because they are then responsible for seeing that the culture\u2014whatever it is in the institution\u2014is embedded, is monitored, and then action be taken when an employee does the wrong thing.\n\nSo, I think there have been improvements along the way of getting the board more involved. And Ellen was talking about the hotline, which was very important, in the sense of getting the staff involved right down to the teller level. That everyone feels it's his job, because the whole idea here is when you enter an institution, no matter what level, you want to have some pride in your job. I mean that's the whole idea, to have pride in what you're doing.\n\nAnd the reasons that we're getting a lot of college graduate, MBAs, whatever, not wanting to go into the industry is they don't feel this is an area where they could have pride. And that's the whole area of trust that we've got to bring back on the table. And it's not an easy job. As I said, we're like on a train and we made a couple of the right stops, but the journey isn't over.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before, it will be even more important if the politicians decide that they want to reduce regulation, supervision, the authority of supervisors and regulators\u2014then it's even more important to make sure you have a strong culture and conduct in a positive fashion.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI've got a couple more questions before I open it up to the audience. One is this question about are you guys anxious at all about some of the financial innovations we've seen. One of the stories yesterday was about the sort of anti-VIX product that Credit Suisse was selling, and actually, it is redounding negatively on the reputation of Credit Suisse, arguably. Or you see the way banks or some of the exchanges have gotten into bitcoin futures. Bill Dudley, are these appropriate products for banks to be selling? Are they culturally appropriate?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think it's really a question of the suitability of the clients that the products are being sold to, and their understanding of the risks associated with the products. I don't have a problem with a product being sold to someone as long as that person is a suitable investor for that product and understands the risks of the product. Because you have to be careful here\u2014you don't want to discourage innovation, and you don't want to discourage offering products that allow a lot of people to hedge risk in various ways, adjust their portfolio for risk.\n\nBut you have to make sure that they are appropriate and well designed. I think the thing that we worry about when we look at the financial system and we worry about financial stability risks\u2014where are there cases where there are feedback loops?\n\nSo right now with the stock market having a little bumpy ride over the last few days, there's a question: As volatility goes up, is that going to cause people to sell stocks because they have a strategy of investing that's tied to the level of volatility in the stock market? If that were the case, then that could cause the stock market to be bumpy in the future.\n\nSo, it's those feedback loops that we focus on very intensely, when we analyze financial markets for financial stability risk. And I think that firms when they design products, they need to be cognizant of that.\n\nI mean the classic example is the stock market crash in 1987, when people had this product called portfolio insurance, which meant that when the stock market went down, you had to sell stocks. So as the stock market went down, portfolio insurance kicked in, you had to sell, and that caused the stock market to go down even further.\n\nThat probably was not a very well designed product, and people I don't think had thought through what the implications were, how that product would actually work in practice.\n\nSome of these VIX products, I think people are going to now look at this with the benefit of hindsight and say, \"Were these really well designed?\"\n\nThis wasn't that big a bump in the equity market, and these products actually blew up. So you have to sort of ask yourself the question, \"Were these products well-designed?\"\n\nRob Cox:\n\nAre there are other elements out there, things that worry you, whether it's risk parity trades or some ETFs? I mean when you look at what's happened in the last couple of days with the stock market, what keeps you up at night?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I think the stock market had a remarkable rise over a very long time, with extremely low volatility. I, and many others, had observed that the valuation of the equity market is elevated. And so having a bump like this has virtually no consequence, in my view, of the economic outlook.\n\nMy outlook hasn't changed just because the stock market is a little bit lower than it was a few days ago. I mean it's still up sharply from where it was a year ago. That said, if the stock market were to go down precipitously, and stay down, then that would actually feed into the economic outlook, and then that would affect my view in terms of the implications for monetary policy.\n\nBut so far, this is a big story in the press. It's a big story for financial market participants. But I don't think it's a big story at all at this point for central bankers.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nGo ahead Ellen.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nWhat concerns me is really what's being done in the unregulated bank space. So for example, the fintech space. We bought a fintech company, Direct Capital, a couple of years ago. And it took a lot of work to have it work within a bank environment, including significantly reducing the amount of pricing that we earn on the product, the transparency of the terms we give to customers, but they can get a 30-minute credit approval from us.\n\nBut there are other companies out there that, if customers don't understand the fine print, they're being charged 35, 40% on some of these products. It's the business of BDOs out there that are lending to middle-market companies at terms that we haven't seen since before the financial crisis. And my concern is that this is the whole shadow banking system that hurt us during the last crisis, and if interest rates rise substantially, these companies are going to get into trouble, and guess who finances them? Banks. Banks are giving lines of credit to these companies. So I am worried about this whole shadow banking system, and I think that our regulators should look more at some of these, into these.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nCan I ask just sort of one corollary, something you raised a minute ago, which was diversity of boards. But let me ask, where does the whole \"Me Too\" movement fit into this discussion about banking culture? I'll start with you, Ellen. Or, how should it?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nNo, it does, and I've gotten a lot of questions of, well, gee, why hasn't\u2014we haven't seen financial services companies, fortunately, in the press a lot. And as an industry, we faced this 20 to 30 years ago. The old boom-boom room at Salomon Brothers. I think that the industry, to give it credit, was terrific in terms of sensitivity training, making sure you have a proper code of conduct, actually having public firings, if somebody demonstrated inappropriate behavior, et cetera.\n\nAnd I think that it's really positive that people are feeling they can come out and talk about things right now, but I think as an industry, in financial services, we took a lot of steps to avoid that.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nDo you agree with that, Bill Dudley? That's sort of been the premise that we've written\u2014the sort of \"they went through this.\" The financial industry went through this and created a lot of safeguards.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou know, I hope so. I hope that's right.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYes.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou never know what's unknowable, but I hope that's right. It should be right.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nAll right, I'm going to open this up to questions from the audience. Please, no filibustering. Ask your question, state your case. We'll start here with the gentleman. I think we have mics.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nJust to follow up on the shadow banking question. If you could elaborate more with respect to the potential risks as far as shadow banking globally. Of course we have it here, but China has a rather large shadow banking situation, and although we can contain it here in the United States, what happens with the risks overseas that might impact the U.S. economy?\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou want to take that Bill?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell, I would just say I think it's a very good question, and I'm very concerned, and Ellen brought it up right now, shadow banking. And you mentioned China, where it's a particular problem.\n\nIt's not clear to me that they've gotten their hands around it either, because every time they close something up, they come up with something else. Trust companies\u2014I could run through all of the instruments, because the Chinese business community is very adept at innovation. And we have to remember that China is the world's second largest economy. In fact, if it hadn't been for China in 2008, when they put a stimulus package in, anywhere from $850 billion to $1 trillion, we would have had a Great Depression, not a Great Recession.\n\nAnd so I'm very concerned about that. And China is probably where it's most serious. But as Ellen brought up there are problems here, there are problems in Europe also. When you talk to bankers in Europe, and there was an article in the Financial Times and Reuters the other day about this whole question of regulation of shadow banking in Europe.\n\nI think it's a major challenge, this whole question of shadow banking, because here we spend the time on supervising, the regulatory side, and what the banking community is doing. And the tendency is you don't see that same effort in the shadow banking area. So I think it's most important.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI have a question really for Bill, just because on a really good day my currency and fixed-income portfolio managers complain about the lack of liquidity in the market, let alone on Friday and Monday. So I'm just wondering how much you view liquidity as an issue and how concerned you are about a liquidity crunch.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, people have been looking at the issue of what have the changes in regulation done to liquidity in various fixed-income markets. I think there's probably been some consequence, for example, in the repo market, and a few other markets.\n\nBut I think generally, I would say market functioning actually seems to be pretty good. I mean there was a period on Friday where there was a very sharp movement downward around three o'clock in the equity market. So there's something that we have to look at and evaluate what really caused that.\n\nBut I think generally, liquidity actually is pretty good. If you look at things like bid-offer, bid-ask spreads, more people can execute. I think it's not as good as it was back in 2006, 2007. But there's a lot of reasons not to want to return to 2006, 2007.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhen you say \"not as good,\" you mean bid-ask spreads\u2014\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think there's probably not as much depth in the market. In other words, if you want to do a large transaction, you're probably going to have a little bit more of a price concession now than back then.\n\nPeople talk about the corporate bond market as one area where dealers have reduced the amount of corporate bonds that they hold on their balance sheets because of capital charges against those corporate bonds have gone up.\n\nSo, I think there has been some consequence, but in general, I think markets are functioning quite well. I think the ability of savers to meet borrowers efficiently in the financial system is very much intact. And actually what we care about is, is the financial system able to supply credit to small businesses, to households, in an efficient manner to support economic growth? And I think if you look around the world, the answer is yes. I mean we have a global synchronized recovery now, which I think is quite positive.\n\nSo, it's something that we're going to continue to look at. There is no question we want to continue to focus on what's the appropriate level of regulation, what are some of the consequences of regulation for things like liquidity? But so far, I would say, we have a much safer financial system, and that's able to perform its function throughout the business cycle.\n\nNow the other thing is, if you have looser requirements for things like capital and liquidity, it might lead you to have a little bit more free flow of credit at the top of a boom. But what happens if the system then breaks in the economic downturn? So you really want a system that's actually sustainable throughout the business cycle. And I think we have a much better system now to ensure that.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nTo what extent might banking culture improvement include a reduction in the pay gap between the C-suite and the average worker?\n\nRob Cox:\n\nEllen?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nI don't think they have to worry about my pay ratio. No, just kidding. But, you know I think I'm going to pass that to one of the Bills. I'd have to think about that.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I think the issue of income inequality and the issue of income mobility in this country is really important. I think that some of the things that you see happening in the political space is a consequence of U.S. poor performance in both those regards.\n\nI've been surprised at how high the pay is at the very top of the house. It seems like people would be willing to do the jobs for probably considerably less money. But how we got this result, that's something that people very much debate. People talk about the winner-take-all society.\n\nI think that as a country we need to do a lot better on working on both the income distribution issue, but even more importantly, in my mind, is income mobility. You know there's a lot of work that Raj Chetty and a number of his associates have done about income mobility, and what they find is where you're born has a huge consequence in your ability to have income mobility through your lifetime.\n\nSo it's not about you, it's actually literally where you were born physically. That says that in the United States we have a lot of work to do, to create a much more even set of opportunities for people so that it doesn't matter where you're born. It depends on your work ethic. So I think there's a lot more we can do in the United States in this realm.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI was just wondering if changing the culture seems like a very noble attempt at changing the industry. But how will you avoid poaching your talent if there are firms that are not on the same objective as you are? You know it happens all the time. It happens with traders, it happens with\u2014they're just going to want to go to a Goldman rather than a Citi if Citi is not paying them.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nEllen, you brought this up a little bit, the issue of shadow banking is part of that I suppose.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nYes, I mean so maybe I'm being a little idealistic here, but I don't think it's all about the money. I mean there are some individuals that it's about the money, but I think for the most part, our employees, it's about working for a firm that they can be proud of, that has a good culture, that is interested in long-term shareholder value, et cetera. And I think if you have a good employee proposition, it will prevent some of your employees from being poached. And in institutions where they are having troubles right now, it's actually an opportunity for us because they want to come work for a company where they feel that the employee proposition is very positive.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nAnd if it is all about the culture for those individuals, maybe they don't actually fit in with your culture.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou know we're talking about banking culture. But there are a lot of other industries that have\u2014we've given them a social license with our data, for instance. Big tech is a great example. I don't see conversations like this being promulgated by whatever it is\u2014the regulators, should there be any\u2014of the Googles and the Facebooks. It's great that we're all focused on this, but as a society, are we focusing on the wrong industry right now?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, let's take care of the financial industry first, before we start moving out.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI'm trying to figure out what you're going to do next, Bill.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell, you know, the answer to that, I think this goes back to the shadow banking and comments that were made here. I think some of these real large, enormous high-tech firms are eyeing, as you read in the newspaper all the time, are eyeing the entrance into the financial sector. And we brought up China before, and this is a big issue now on China, with Alibaba, and the others. How much are the supervisors, regulators going to be allowing them to get into what amounts to virtual banking?\n\nSo it all really goes back to that. And I think it's going to be one of the major issues in the financial system going forward. And the question is, has this really been thought out by the politicians, the supervisors, regulators? Not clear. And very importantly, by the banking industry itself so that it can remain competitive? And so I think it is a major issue going forward, without a doubt.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI think that is all we've got time for. I want to thank you all for coming out in this\u2014and hopefully you can get out of here, it looks like it's coming down like cats and dogs now. Please thank my panelists, and thank you for coming."

    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/dud180111",
    "content": "Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with you at this event.  Today, I will focus on the economic outlook for 2018 and beyond.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nBroadly speaking, the prospects for continued economic expansion in 2018 look reasonably bright.  The economy is likely to continue to grow at an above-trend pace, which should lead to a tighter labor market and faster wage growth.  Under such conditions, I would expect the inflation rate to drift higher toward the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent long-run objective.\n\nOver the longer term, however, I am considerably more cautious about the economic outlook.  Keeping the economy on a sustainable path may become more challenging.  While the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 likely will provide additional support to growth over the near term, it will come at a cost.  After all, there is no such thing as a free lunch.  The legislation will increase the nation\u2019s longer-term fiscal burden, which is already facing other pressures, such as higher debt service costs and entitlement spending as the baby-boom generation retires.  While this does not seem to be a great concern to market participants today, the current fiscal path is unsustainable.  In the long run, ignoring the budget math risks driving up longer-term interest rates, crowding out private sector investment and diminishing the country\u2019s creditworthiness.  These dynamics could counteract any favorable direct effects the tax package might have on capital spending and potential output.\n\nFavorable Near-term Outlook\n\nTurning to the near-term outlook, the prospects appear favorable for another year of above-trend growth.  Consumer spending should continue to grow at a moderate pace, supported by solid fundamentals.  Household income is being bolstered by faster compensation growth and continued healthy employment gains.  Moreover, the aggregate household balance sheet remains in good shape, due in part to rising home prices, a strong stock market, and only moderate growth in household debt.  Over the past year, home prices have risen by about 7 percent on a national basis, and the S&P 500 equity index has risen by nearly 20 percent.  In contrast, household debt has risen about 4 percent over the past year, only slightly higher than the growth in personal income.  Further, the household debt service burden is low, reflecting the extended period of low interest rates.\n\nOf course, the aggregate figures mask some underlying problems.  Two issues worth highlighting are the persistent growth in income and wealth inequality and the burden of rising student loan debt.2  Many people of more modest means don\u2019t directly benefit from rising home and stock prices.  And, increasing student debt burdens have made it more difficult for many young adults to become homeowners.3  This is significant because homeownership is a major avenue for wealth accumulation for many households.  Nevertheless, the tightening labor market should provide greater opportunities for workers to obtain employment, build human capital, and gain greater opportunities to improve their financial circumstances.\n\nOn the business side of the ledger, investment spending should remain solid.  Business cash flows are strong, and the corporate sector is set to receive a meaningful lift from the recently enacted tax legislation.  The large reduction in the statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the 100 percent expensing provision for investment should drive down the effective cost of capital for business. \n\nIn addition, the U.S. economy should be well supported by the recent improvement in the global economic outlook.  More synchronized cyclical recoveries in Europe and Japan\u2014and a revival of growth in many emerging market economies\u2014should ensure that demand for U.S. goods and services remains strong. \n\nPutting it all together, I have raised my real GDP forecast for 2018 by about half a percentage point to three quarters of a percentage point to a 2\u00bd percent to 2\u00be percent range.  About one-third of this upward revision reflects the firmer momentum of the economy going into 2018 and about two-thirds the stimulative impact of the tax legislation. \n\nWhile this legislation will reduce federal revenues by about 1 percent of GDP in both 2018 and 2019, I anticipate the boost to economic growth will be less than that. Most importantly, most of the tax cuts accrue to the corporate sector and to higher-income households that have a relatively low marginal propensity to consume.  This suggests that a significant portion of the tax cuts will be saved, not spent. \n\nOn the business side, the boost to investment from the lower corporate tax rate and full expensing is likely to be relatively modest.  In the past, aggregate investment spending has not been very sensitive to the cost of capital, which is only one of many factors that influence investment spending.4  Moreover, the reduction in the effective tax rate for corporations\u2014or what they typically pay in practice\u2014is only about 3 to 4 percentage points, far smaller than the reduction in the statutory rate.  On the household side, the impact is likely to be attenuated by the temporary nature of many important provisions.  Households may not spend much of the additional after-tax income if they perceive the gains as likely to be transitory. \n\nFinally, the legislation is likely to generate some frictional costs that will mitigate its effects on growth.  In particular, it likely will have disparate impacts regionally and across economic sectors.  For example, the $10,000 cap on the amount of state and local income and property taxes that can be deducted will raise the effective cost of owning higher-end residential property in high-tax states.  This could adversely affect prices and construction activity of high-end housing in such states. \n\nIf the economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace in 2018, the labor market should tighten further.  In fact, I anticipate that the civilian unemployment rate will fall below 4 percent this year and reach the lowest level since at least 2000.  If this scenario proves accurate, this should lead to further firming of wage growth. \n\nOn this point, some wonder whether the relationship between tight labor markets and higher inflation has broken down.  I have not lost faith in this relationship.  As the labor market has tightened over the past few years, we have seen a discernible firming in the wage inflation trend from 2 percent to around 2\u00bd percent.5  Also, data at the state level indicate that states with lower unemployment rates tend to have firmer wage trends.  This supports the case that tighter labor markets tend to be associated with higher wage growth. \n\nAs the labor market tightens and wage growth firms further, I would expect these conditions to push up price inflation, particularly for services.  Research by the New York Fed has found that prices of manufactured goods do not appear to be sensitive to labor market tightness.6  In contrast, tighter labor markets tend to be associated with higher price inflation for services.  This difference presumably reflects several factors.  First, prices of manufactured goods are determined in global markets, whereas prices for most services are determined locally.  Second, there remains significant excess capacity in manufacturing across much of the world.  In the United States, for example, the manufacturing capacity utilization rate was only 76.4 percent in November, about 2 percentage points below its average since 1972.  Third, for manufactured goods, there may be more scope for substituting capital for labor, and/or lowering labor costs by importing labor-intensive intermediate goods.  To the extent that this margin of adjustment is available, it would tend to dampen the impact of higher wage costs on prices of manufactured goods.  Finally, the so-called \u201cAmazon\u201d effect, which results in greater price transparency for buyers, may weigh disproportionately on goods prices. \n\nAlthough inflation remains somewhat below the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective on a year-over-year basis, I still anticipate that it will stabilize around that level over the medium term.  As I noted earlier, above-trend growth should tighten the labor market further, pushing up wage inflation and eventually services prices.  In fact, we have already seen some increase in inflation in recent months.  Over the three months ending with November, core personal consumption expenditure prices rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate, up from a corresponding rate of just 0.4 percent last May.  The pronounced slowing of core inflation during the first half of 2017 was due, in part, to transitory factors, such as a sharp fall in prices for cellular phone services.  Those influences have been temporarily depressing the year-over-year figures. \n\nWhen these transitory influences drop out of the year-over-year numbers this spring, the inflation rate is likely to move higher.  Importantly, even as inflation undershot the FOMC\u2019s objective over the past year, inflation expectations have been broadly stable.  I would be much more concerned if low inflation outcomes were contributing to a decline in inflation expectations.  That would make it more difficult to push inflation back toward our 2 percent objective and would increase the risk of getting stuck at the effective lower bound for interest rates following the next economic downturn, which inevitably will come. \n\nEven if inflation were to remain somewhat below 2 percent over the near future, that might not be a serious problem, if the economy were to continue to perform well in other respects.  To me, it would imply that the unemployment rate associated with \u201cmaximum employment\u201d is lower than current estimates and that we could let the labor market tighten a bit further.  This would be a positive outcome because the productive capacity of the U.S. economy would be enhanced and more people would be able to find jobs, develop their job skills, and build their human capital. \n\nIn short, 2018 looks like it will be a good year for the economy.  I anticipate that the Federal Reserve will make further progress in achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  If circumstances evolve close to what I have outlined today, I will continue to advocate for gradually removing monetary policy accommodation.  As I see it, the case for doing so remains strong.  While the fact that inflation is below the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective argues for patience, I think that is more than offset by an outlook of above-trend growth, driven by accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions as well as an increasingly expansionary fiscal policy. \n\nMoreover, if the labor market were to tighten much further, there would be a greater risk that inflation could rise substantially above our objective.  But, let me be clear: A small and transitory overshoot of 2 percent inflation would not be a problem.  Were it to occur, it would demonstrate that our inflation target is symmetric, and it would help keep inflation expectations well-anchored around our longer-run objective.  In contrast, if inflation were to shoot appreciably above 2 percent for a considerable time, the FOMC would have to adopt a markedly tighter policy stance that would put the economic expansion at risk.  In such circumstances, it is unlikely that we would be able to sustain a low level of unemployment and also achieve our inflation objective.\n\nPotential Concerns for the Longer-term Outlook\n\nSo, if 2018 looks good, what about the longer term?  Let me start by discussing what I\u2019m not worried about, before turning to those areas where I have greater concerns.  For one, I do not think the economic expansion\u2014now in its ninth year\u2014is vulnerable just because it is \u201cold.\u201d  As we like to say, expansions don\u2019t die of old age\u2014they die either because monetary policy needs to be tightened appreciably to combat rising inflation, or because the economy gets hit with a large shock that overwhelms the ability of the Federal Reserve and other policymakers to stabilize it successfully.  In general, with inflation below the FOMC\u2019s long-run objective we can be cautious in how we adjust monetary policy. \n\nSimilarly, I am not concerned about the recent flattening of the Treasury yield curve even though some commentators believe that such a flattening foreshadows a recession.  At the end of 2017, the spread between the 10-year Treasury bond and 2-year Treasury note had narrowed to 52 basis points, from 125 basis points at the start of the year.  As I see it, some flattening in the yield curve should be expected as we gradually remove monetary policy accommodation.  If the yield curve were not flattening, it would suggest that we were behind the curve in removing accommodation.  Moreover, this recent flattening is not particularly pronounced.  For example, the 10-year/2-year spread of 52 basis points is only 46 basis points narrower than the average since 1978. \n\nIn addition, all else equal, we should expect the yield curve to be flatter than normal in the current environment.  Not only are bond term premia depressed due to quantitative easing both here and abroad, but the low inflation environment is also likely a contributing factor.  If investors perceive that the risk of significantly higher inflation has fallen over time as inflation has persistently undershot 2 percent, they should demand lower bond term premia as compensation for inflation risk.  Finally, while inverted yield curves have typically preceded recessions, I am unaware of any causal element in that relationship.  For example, I don\u2019t believe that banks become unwilling to lend when the yield curve inverts and that this tightening of credit availability \u201ccauses\u201d a recession.  I think it is noteworthy that in the current environment, higher short-term interest rates tend to raise\u2014not lower\u2014the banking industry\u2019s profitability.  This is demonstrated, in part, by the strong performance of bank stocks in 2017 as the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates.\n\nAs I see it, the Treasury yield curve becomes inverted when investors believe that short-term real interest rates are high and monetary policy is tight.  Investors anticipate that such a regime will slow the economy and be followed by a reduction in short-term rates.  Because these expectations turn out to be validated eventually, we observe that inverted yield curves precede and signal recessions.  But, we are not in this situation currently. Investors expect short-term interest rates to rise, not drop, and to remain higher in the future than they are now.  Despite the flatter yield curve, the consensus view continues to be that monetary policy is not yet tight. \n\nOne area I might be slightly\u2014but not particularly\u2014worried about is financial market asset valuations, which I would characterize as elevated.  While valuations are noteworthy, I am less concerned than I might be otherwise because the economy\u2019s performance and outlook seem consistent with what we see in financial markets.  Volatility in the real economy has been low, and this has been matched by low volatility in financial markets, which has helped support high valuations.  I am also less worried because the financial system today is much more resilient and robust than it was a decade ago.  Thus, even if financial asset prices were to decline significantly\u2014which presumably would occur if the economic outlook were to deteriorate\u2014I don\u2019t think such declines would have the destructive impact we saw a decade ago.  Higher capital and liquidity requirements for major banks have made the banking system more resilient and better able to absorb market shocks without this impairing its ability to intermediate credit flows between borrowers and savers.  It was the collapse of confidence in the financial system in 2008 that caused credit availability to dry up, contributing greatly to the severity of the Great Recession.7 \n\nSo, what am I worried about?  Two macroeconomic concerns warrant mention.  The first is the risk of economic overheating.  Now, this seems like an odd issue to focus on when inflation is low, but it strikes me that this is a real risk over the next few years.  Not only do we have an economy that is growing at an above-trend pace\u2014at a time when the labor market is already quite tight\u2014but the economy will be getting an extra boost in 2018 and 2019 from the recently enacted tax legislation.  Moreover, even though the FOMC has raised its target range for the federal funds rate by 125 basis points over the past two years, financial conditions today are easier than when we started to remove monetary policy accommodation. \n\nThis suggests that the Federal Reserve may have to press harder on the brakes at some point over the next few years.  If that happens, the risk of a hard landing will increase.  Historically, the Federal Reserve has found it difficult to achieve a soft landing\u2014especially when the unemployment rate has fallen below the rate consistent with stable inflation.  In those circumstances, the Federal Reserve has been unable to both push up the unemployment rate slightly to a level that is consistent with stable inflation and avoid recession.8  Now, I don\u2019t want to imply that a recession is inevitable once the FOMC finds it necessary to nudge up the unemployment rate to a sustainable level.  The starting point in terms of the inflation rate is also important because it will influence how far the FOMC is likely to go in terms of making monetary policy tight.  Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say that the track record on this score is not encouraging.\n\nThe second risk is the long-term fiscal position of the United States.  Recognizing that fiscal policy is the domain of the executive and legislative branches rather than the Federal Reserve, I would emphasize several points.  For one, the current U.S. fiscal position is far worse than it was at the end of the last business cycle.  For example, in fiscal year 2007, the budget deficit was 1.1 percent of GDP; in fiscal 2017, it was 3.5 percent of GDP.  Similarly, federal debt held by the public was 35 percent of GDP in fiscal 2007, and 77 percent in fiscal 2017.  Additionally, three factors will undoubtedly cause these budgetary pressures to intensify over time: the tax legislation will push up the federal deficit and federal debt burden; debt service costs will rise as interest rates normalize; and entitlement outlays will increase as the baby boom generation retires.  Let me discuss each of these in turn. \n\nWith respect to the tax legislation, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost at around $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years.9  This estimate takes into consideration the likelihood that the legislation will boost the productive capacity of the U.S. economy somewhat\u2014raising the economy\u2019s potential growth rate\u2014and that this incremental growth will generate additional tax revenues.  To me, this seems like a reasonable estimate, recognizing that with any complex tax legislation, there is a high level of uncertainty about its impact on longer-term growth and revenues.  It is possible that the boost to the nation\u2019s productive capacity from higher capital spending and greater labor supply will be higher than anticipated, leading to faster growth and greater revenue.  But, on the other side, the revenue projections might also turn out to be overly optimistic as households and businesses react to changes in the tax code by adjusting how they conduct their activities in a way to minimize their tax liabilities.  This might especially be true as people look to take advantage of the lower top marginal pass-through rate that is available on sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs and S corporations compared to wage income. \n\nDebt service costs will undoubtedly be boosted by higher levels of federal debt and higher interest rates.  In fiscal year 2007, federal debt service costs totaled $237 billion on $5 trillion of federal debt held by the public.  By fiscal year 2017, although federal debt held by the public had nearly tripled to almost $15 trillion, debt service costs were $263 billion, only modestly above where they were 10 years earlier.  Over the past decade, the sharp decline in short- and long-term interest rates has kept a lid on debt service costs\u2014that lid is now being lifted. \n\nAlthough the future path of interest rates is highly uncertain, the most recent 10-year projections of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) illustrate where debt service costs are heading.  For example, the CBO projects that debt service costs in 2027 will be more than $800 billion\u2014nearly 3 percent of GDP, more than double their current share.10\n\nFinally, the retirement of the baby boom generation over the next decade will put considerable pressure on outlays.  The CBO projects that, by 2027, outlays on Social Security and Medicare will rise to 6 percent and 5 percent of GDP, respectively\u2014each more than a percentage point higher than in 2017. \n\nAs the economist Herbert Stein once remarked, trends that are unsustainable must end.  How, precisely, the United States chooses to address its fiscal challenges will have important consequences for the economy, monetary policy, and financial markets in the years ahead. \n\nTo sum up, I am optimistic about the near-term economic outlook and the likelihood that the FOMC will be able to make progress this year in pushing inflation up toward its 2 percent objective.  The economy has considerable forward momentum, monetary policy is still accommodative, financial conditions are easy, and fiscal policy is set to provide a boost.  But, there are some significant storm clouds over the longer term.  If the labor market tightens much further, it will be harder to slow the economy to a sustainable pace, avoiding overheating and an eventual economic downturn.  Another important issue is the need to get the country\u2019s fiscal house in order for the long run.  The longer that task is deferred, the greater the risk for financial markets and the economy, and the harder it will be for the Federal Reserve to keep the economy on an even keel.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nWelcome to this year\u2019s primary dealer meeting. Primary dealers play several important roles as trading counterparties in the implementation of monetary policy, as participants in Treasury auctions, and as providers of information on financial markets. These annual meetings provide us an opportunity to strengthen this relationship and communicate our expectations. We also have a shared interest in ensuring that markets function efficiently, effectively, and fairly. To help achieve these goals, the official sector employs a variety of channels, including legal, regulatory, and supervisory. Additionally, officials work with market participants to help guide private-sector solutions. Today, I will speak about our shared efforts in the reform of reference interest rates, focusing the discussion on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s (New York Fed) part as an administrator and producer of reference rates. The views presented here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nResponding to LIBOR\u2019s Uncertain Future\n\nReference rates serve a number of purposes in financial markets. They facilitate trading in standardized contracts, which can lower transaction costs and improve market liquidity. They can reduce information asymmetries by providing a transparent, independent pricing source. A robust and reliable reference rate can also reduce moral hazard by limiting incentives to misreport pricing for settling a contract. However, a reference rate that is not well designed may increase moral hazard by creating incentives to manipulate the rate.2\n\nNo reference rate is more ubiquitous than the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). U.S. dollar LIBOR is estimated to be referenced in $150 to $200 trillion of financial contracts, including loans, interest rate swaps, and mortgage-backed securities.3 Many market participants, including the primary dealer community gathered here today, have exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, as Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Chief Executive Andrew Bailey noted in a speech last July, the lack of activity in the wholesale unsecured funding markets that underlie LIBOR means the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed.4 In fact, existing LIBOR panel banks have only agreed with the FCA to support LIBOR through the end of 2021.5 While U.S. dollar LIBOR may exist past 2021, prudent risk management implies preparing for a world without it.\n\nFor several years, the Federal Reserve\u2014in conjunction with others in the official sector\u2014has supported private-sector efforts to identify viable alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR, reduce reliance on LIBOR, and strengthen financial contracts to better address the risk of a cessation of LIBOR. Until relatively recently, this work has focused on the interest rate derivatives market, which represents a very large proportion of total gross notional exposure to LIBOR. But, as Governor Powell noted in a speech in November, the risks to LIBOR highlighted by Andrew Bailey emphasize the need for all participants in the markets where LIBOR currently is referenced to seriously consider how best to transition away from its use.6\n\nFurther, as you are aware from previous meetings, in 2016 the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG) incorporated recommendations in its Best Practices that market participants should understand their vulnerabilities in using financial benchmarks. The TMPG recommends that where current benchmarks are inconsistent with the Principles for Financial Benchmarks (Principles) published by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), market participants should develop plans to use alternative benchmarks that are consistent with the Principles.7,8 It is important that market participants fully assess their exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR given both its weaknesses as a benchmark and the risk that it may not always be published, and that they take steps to mitigate their exposure by adopting more robust contract language and transitioning to alternative rates.\n\nThis past June, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) selected an overnight Treasury repo reference rate that the New York Fed plans to produce\u2014the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR)\u2014as \u201cbest practice for use in certain new U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts\u201d.9,10 The ARRC\u2019s selection of this rate is part of the motivation behind my comments on the New York Fed\u2019s role as an administrator and producer of reference rates.\n\nOver the last two years, the New York Fed has enhanced the calculation of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and launched an entirely new rate, the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR). We also announced plans to begin producing three Treasury repo reference rates, including the SOFR that was selected by the ARRC. At the core of these developments are investments the Federal Reserve has made in all aspects of the administration and production of reference rates to ensure that our rates are reliable measures of market activity. These rates are anchored in active underlying markets, are based on a comprehensive set of transactions that incorporate controls to mitigate risk of errors and manipulation, and are capable of being published every day, even in adverse circumstances.\n\nThe New York Fed produces reference rates primarily to inform monetary policy implementation by developing a better understanding of money market dynamics and to aid market functioning by providing transparency. For example, collecting the transaction-level data necessary for producing robust reference rates enhances the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to analyze market developments. While we have not historically produced rates with the explicit goal of having them referenced in financial contracts, we understand that they often are used that way.11 And, we are committed to the continued production of durable rates that market participants can have confidence in over the long run.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I will first describe the improvements the New York Fed has made to our production process and how those improvements ensure that the rates we produce today are reliable. I will then discuss how our three new rates will help deepen our understanding of money market dynamics and provide transparency for secured money markets. Finally, I will address how we plan to maintain the relevance and reliability of our reference rates as markets evolve.\n\nEvolution of the Effective Federal Funds Rate\n\nAdministering and producing reference rates is not a new activity for the New York Fed. Daily calculation of the EFFR dates back at least to the 1950s. Today, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) primary means of communicating adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, and the EFFR serves as a measure to assess whether conditions in money markets are consistent with the policy stance. However, when the New York Fed first produced the EFFR, the federal funds rate was not the FOMC\u2019s policy target.12 Like the OBFR today and our forthcoming repo rates, the EFFR served as a useful indicator of conditions in an important money market.\n\nFrom the 1950s until early 2016, the EFFR was calculated as a volume-weighted mean based on data collected voluntarily from federal funds brokers. While we continue to be confident in the integrity of the EFFR production process employed during those years, the international focus on best practices in the production of reference rates following revelations about the manipulation of LIBOR hastened our efforts to review all aspects of the EFFR production process. This review included an assessment of whether the EFFR could be strengthened by switching to a more robust data source that better reflected activity in the federal funds market, and whether a volume-weighted mean remained the most appropriate measure of central tendency.\n\nAs a result, in March 2016, we began calculating the EFFR using the Report of Selected Money Market Rates (the FR 2420 report), which collects transaction-level data directly from a large set of domestic banks and agencies of foreign banks operating in the United States.13,14 The FR 2420 report offers a wider breadth of market coverage, higher transaction volumes, and more granular information for better data monitoring than the brokered data used previously. At the same time, the measure of central tendency employed was switched to a volume-weighted median, after analysis indicated a median is less likely to be materially impacted by erroneous data and outliers than a volume-weighted mean.15,16\n\nAdditional changes were implemented to further strengthen the EFFR. We invested in a sophisticated production platform to ensure a well-controlled end-to-end production process, from collection of the data to rate calculation and publication. We refined our framework for regular review by oversight bodies, and enhanced our ethics and conflict-of-interest policies for staff involved in reference rate production. We also put in place a resilient backup production process\u2014including geographic dispersion of staff and platforms involved in data collection, administration, and publication\u2014and developed a data contingency plan that features a backup source of transaction data.\n\nReflecting our commitment to producing rates aligned with international best practices, we will publish a statement for all reference rates the New York Fed administers and produces documenting their compliance with IOSCO\u2019s Principles. We anticipate publishing such a statement for the EFFR and OBFR in the next few weeks, and we will release similar documentation of compliance with IOSCO\u2019s Principles for the three planned Treasury repo rates likely around the time of their initial publication.\n\nDevelopment of a New Overnight Bank Funding Rate\n\nAs we worked to enhance production of the EFFR, we also developed the OBFR\u2014the New York Fed\u2019s first reference rate designed from the outset to be compliant with IOSCO\u2019s Principles. The OBFR was created to increase the amount and quality of publicly-available information about overnight unsecured funding costs of U.S.-based banks. The OBFR is calculated using both federal funds and Eurodollar transactions, as reported in the FR 2420 report.17,18 Many U.S.-based banks are active in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets, so having a measure of borrowing costs across both markets provides a more complete picture of overnight unsecured borrowing costs than looking at the federal funds market alone.\n\nWhen we launched the OBFR in the first quarter of 2016, daily Eurodollar volume was in excess of $200 billion. Today, however, volume is nearly 50 percent lower. The decline largely reflects two factors: less investment by prime money market funds, and a substitution from offshore to onshore wholesale deposits by some banks. The former is a function of the more than $1 trillion decline in prime money market fund assets under management in 2016 associated with the implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) money market fund reforms.19 The latter reflects some U.S.-based banks shifting from taking deposits in their Caribbean branches to taking similar deposits onshore.20 Eurodollar deposits currently are captured in the FR 2420 report, and included in the OBFR. However, onshore wholesale deposits are not captured. The Federal Reserve is considering enhancing the FR 2420 report to capture such \u201conshore Eurodollar\u201d deposits, where the motivation, counterparty, and pricing are similar to the Eurodollar deposits included in the FR 2420 report. If these transactions are collected in the FR 2420 report, we will consider including them in the OBFR as well.\n\nConsistent with our ongoing analysis of the scope of transactions underlying the OBFR, creating a durable reference rate that is reliable over the long run involves some need for flexibility. Financial markets are not static; they evolve. And, for a reference rate to remain relevant over the long run, it must have the flexibility to evolve with the market that underlies it. Of course, changing the calculation of a rate too frequently may create excessive volatility and uncertainty as to exactly what the rate measures, potentially contributing to a loss of confidence in the integrity of the rate. For this reason, we believe it is important to be clear in describing what each reference rate we produce is meant to measure. We do not wish to make frequent changes to the rates we produce, but we are committed to making necessary ones.\n\nExpanding Production to Treasury Repo Rates\n\nSecured markets\u2014the Treasury repo market in particular\u2014also play a critical role in the efficient functioning of financial markets and the implementation of monetary policy.21 However, historically there have been limited data available to the public on the Treasury repo market.22 In November 2016, the New York Fed announced that, in cooperation with the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Financial Research (OFR), we were considering publishing three reference rates based on overnight Treasury repo transactions to improve repo market transparency. Publication of these rates should improve market functioning and our insight into monetary policy implementation. Additionally, the ARRC had expressed interest in a repo rate produced by the public sector as a possible alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR.23\n\nWhy Produce Three Treasury Repo Rates?\n\nHaving identified an opportunity to provide greater transparency into conditions in the Treasury repo market and support reference rate reform, we decided to produce not just one new repo rate, but three. Why three?\n\nFirst and foremost, we wanted to produce a rate reflective of a broad swath of activity in the Treasury repo market. At the same time, we recognized that one broad rate might not consistently reflect differing conditions in various segments of the market. Dynamics in the overnight Treasury tri-party repo market\u2014the segment of the market characterized by cash-rich investors such as money market funds lending to government securities dealers\u2014may not always be the same as dynamics in the blind-brokered, largely interdealer GCF Repo service offered by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). For example, greater opportunity for balance sheet netting resulting from a single central counterparty in the GCF Repo market, and the blind-brokered nature of trading in that market are two differences between the tri-party and GCF Repo markets that impact the set of counterparties active in each market and incentives for trading. Both of these factors could manifest in a divergence in rates.24\n\nTrades in the tri-party and GCF Repo markets are made against pools of \u201cgeneral\u201d collateral. In a general collateral (GC) repo trade, the cash provider stipulates a population of acceptable collateral\u2014for example, all Treasury securities\u2014but does not stipulate the specific securities that must be pledged to settle the transaction. However, in the bilateral repo market, where the services of a tri-party agent are not used, the counterparties themselves identify specific securities to settle each trade. As a result, the bilateral repo market can be used to temporarily acquire specific securities, which can create different trading incentives than simply investing cash against a pool of securities. In particular, demand for specific securities\u2014the supply of which may be relatively scarce\u2014can have a significant impact on rates in the bilateral repo market.\n\nThe money market funds eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve\u2019s overnight reverse repurchase facility (ON RRP) predominantly lend cash in the tri-party market.25 As such, a rate focused only on the tri-party repo market may be useful when evaluating money market fund participation in the ON RRP. On the other hand, a broad measure of the cost of financing Treasury securities in the repo market\u2014one not just limited to GC trades\u2014may be a better fit for other purposes. For example, a broad measure may be a better reflection of the average secured funding cost for a bank holding company that participates across the tri-party, centrally-cleared interdealer, and bilateral repo markets.26\n\nOur choice to produce three overnight Treasury repo rates recognizes this \u201cfit for purpose\u201d issue. Given existing market segmentation and the potential for activity to shift across segments as the repo market evolves, one rate likely is not a perfect fit for all needs. However, producing a vast number of very similar rates is not practical either. From the public feedback received, we believe that producing these three rates will strike the right balance.\n\nWhat are the Three Rates the New York Fed Will Produce?\n\nI will provide an overview of each rate\u2019s \u201cInterest,\u201d the term in IOSCO\u2019s Principles for what a rate conceptually is intended to measure. Transactions in which the Federal Reserve is a counterparty will be excluded from all three rates, as the rates are meant to reflect private-market transactions, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s motivation for transacting in the repo market tends to be different than for other participants.27\n\nThe first rate\u2014the tri-party general collateral rate, or TGCR\u2014is intended as a measure of rates on overnight, tri-party Treasury GC repo transactions where the counterparties involved know each other\u2019s identity at the time of the trade. The terms of all tri-party trades are bilaterally negotiated between the security and cash providers before using the services of a tri-party agent to clear and settle trades. Based on recent data, the TGCR would include around $280 billion of daily tri-party repo transactions.\n\nThe second rate\u2014the broad general collateral rate, or BGCR\u2014is intended to capture all trades where the specific securities provided as collateral are not identified until after other terms of the trade are agreed. The BGCR will include all trades in the TGCR plus other GC trades, such as those that are blind brokered. Given the addition of approximately $15 billion in overnight Treasury GCF repo transaction volume, if calculated today the BGCR would capture nearly $300 billion in daily transaction volume.\n\nThe third rate\u2014SOFR\u2014is the broadest measure of the cost of borrowing overnight in the repo market using Treasury securities as collateral. The first two rates\u2014the TGCR and BGCR\u2014both focus exclusively on the GC repo market, but, as I noted earlier, not all repo trades are for \u201cgeneral\u201d collateral. Many trades in the bilateral repo market are at rates similar to those on GC repo trades in the tri-party repo market, with the cash providers\u2019 motivation for lending in the bilateral market very similar to the motivation of a cash provider in the tri-party repo market. However, in some bilateral repo market trades the cash provider is seeking to acquire specific Treasury securities, and the specific securities to be delivered are determined at the outset of the trade, before a rate is agreed. When such trades occur at rates below prevailing rates on GC trades, the securities collateralizing the repo are said to be trading \u201cspecial.\u201d The more demand for a specific security exceeds the supply available to be lent, the greater the \u201cspecialness\u201d premium for that security, and the lower the rate on repo trades for that security. A cash provider\u2019s motivation for entering GC and \u201cspecials\u201d repo trades is different\u2014investing cash in the case of a GC trade and acquiring specific securities in a \u201cspecials\u201d trade. However, irrespective of the motivation of the cash provider, both types of trades provide the cash borrower a means to borrow funds with Treasury securities as collateral.\n\nSOFR is intended to reflect the general cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, regardless of the motivation of the cash providers participating in the trades. However, a limited number of Treasury securities often trade with a significant \u201cspecialness\u201d premium\u2014i.e., at rates considerably lower than those prevailing for GC trades and most \u201cspecials\u201d trades. A significant \u201cspecialness\u201d premium implies that the supply-demand dynamics for a particular Treasury security are very different than for the vast majority of Treasury securities. To mitigate the potential influence of Treasury securities trading very \u201cspecial,\u201d we will remove a portion of the lowest-rate transactions in the bilateral repo market from the calculation of the SOFR.\n\nGiven the significant activity in the bilateral repo market cleared by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), transaction volume underlying the SOFR would be in the neighborhood of $800 billion if calculated today, more than double the volume underlying the BGCR.\n\nStarting in the second quarter of this year, the New York Fed expects to begin producing and publishing the three repo rates on a daily basis, alongside the EFFR and OBFR. We have explored how best to calculate each of the three rates\u2014also incorporating public comment received through the Federal Register Notice process\u2014and arrived at a calculation methodology for each rate. I will not discuss every aspect of each rate, as that detailed information is already available, but there are four key points that are important to highlight.28\n\nFirst, all three repo rates will be calculated as volume-weighted medians.29 We selected the volume-weighted median as the most appropriate measure of central tendency for these rates for the same reasons we selected it for the EFFR and OBFR. A median is more robust to submissions of erroneous data and is more likely to reflect a transacted rate, as compared with a volume-weighted mean.30\n\nSecond, we have put in place various measures that should mitigate the risks associated with data collection for all three rates. While some have expressed concern that a portion of the data underlying the rates is collected under a commercial agreement, the production of a transaction-based rate necessitates the collection of transaction data, and there are inherent risks in any data collection. I would also note that in November, OFR announced plans to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking this year to collect the cleared repo data underlying the BGCR and SOFR.31 Simply put, if the markets underlying the three repo rates are active, I do not anticipate that acquisition of necessary data will be an impediment to the ongoing production of the rates.\n\nThird, I want to provide further clarity around our method for identifying the set of bilateral trades to be excluded or \u201ctrimmed\u201d from the SOFR, and discuss why we settled on this particular approach.\n\nOur use of a volume-weighted median helps to ensure that \u201cspecials\u201d will not have an undue influence on the rate; however, we have taken additional precautions to ensure that this is the case. All transactions in the FICC-cleared bilateral data set with rates below the 25th volume-weighted percentile will be removed, and the remaining bilateral transactions will then be combined with the tri-party and GCF Repo transactions to calculate the SOFR. In selecting this trimming methodology, we sought a method that would remove transactions for securities trading with an extreme \u201cspecialness\u201d premium, consistent with the concept of the SOFR I outlined earlier, while also being relatively easy to communicate. We explored a variety of potential trimming methods and settled on the one we feel is the simplest that still gets the job done.\n\nFinally, we are working to determine what additional historical data we can provide for all three repo rates, which is reflective of the requests for such data received through the public comment process. There has been particular focus on data for the SOFR, as some have suggested that providing a time series of the SOFR extending back prior to 2007 and the onset of the financial crisis would ease adoption of the rate as an alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. We have previously released indicative rates for the TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR from August 2014 forward based on transaction-level data provided by the tri-party clearing banks and DTCC, and we are looking into producing similar indicative rates for dates earlier than 2014.32, 33 However, the calculation of these rates utilizes some information that first became available after the financial crisis as part of reforms to the tri-party repo market infrastructure. While we may be able to provide additional historical data beyond what we have already published, it is unlikely such data will reach prior to the onset of the financial crisis for any of the three rates.\n\nHowever, for nearly two decades, the New York Fed has collected daily summary data from the primary dealers on their borrowing across all segments of the overnight Treasury general collateral repo market. A rate based on these summary data may serve as a useful indicator of the behavior of rates in the overnight Treasury repo market, and the New York Fed is considering a one-time release of a time series of this primary dealer survey rate. While a rate based on the primary dealer data would cover similar segments of the repo market as the SOFR, the rate would not be a perfect substitute for the SOFR. For example, the primary dealer survey rate would be a volume-weighted mean, would only cover the GC segment of the repo market, and would not cover activity by non-primary dealers. Additionally, the rate could not be produced in a process aligned with international best practices.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nTo conclude, I hope that I have provided you with a brief history of the New York Fed\u2019s role as an administrator and producer of reference rates while highlighting various aspects of the Treasury repo rates we plan to begin producing later this year, including the role these rates play in mitigating risks from overreliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR. In the end, I hope you walk away with two key messages.\n\nFirst, the New York Fed is committed to producing durable reference rates. That is, we are committed to producing rates that are robust and resilient, both now and in the future. These rates are compliant with IOSCO\u2019s Principles, and best practice dictates that administrators periodically review the rates they produce to assess whether changes in the underlying markets require changes to those rates. The New York Fed plans to perform such reviews periodically for the repo rates, as well as for the EFFR and OBFR. We do not anticipate frequent changes to how we calculate the rates we produce, but if we believe changes are necessary, we are committed to making them, and to doing so in a transparent fashion that provides an opportunity for public input. The integrity of the rates we produce is of the utmost importance, whether they are used for analytical purposes or as reference rates in financial contracts.\n\nSecond, recognizing that the long-term availability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed, it is critical that market participants with exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR assess their associated risk and take steps to mitigate their exposure. While individual firms must decide on the most appropriate way to manage LIBOR-related risk, we encourage all to take two steps at a minimum: (1) adopt contract language capable of addressing the cessation of a reference rate, and (2) reduce reliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR by transitioning to robust alternative rates, such as the SOFR. In addition to being in the best interest of individual financial institutions, greater reliance on robust alternative reference rates aids the transmission of monetary policy and reduces financial stability risks.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Today, I will discuss some of the differences between safe and money-like assets, with a focus on the central bank\u2019s unique ability to produce money-like assets. I will highlight the risks that can accompany the private provision of money-like assets and describe how regulation and supervision can mitigate many of these risks. I will then examine how the central bank could complement regulation and supervision in mitigating these risks by providing overnight money-like assets, with a focus on changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s liabilities in recent years. As always, the views presented here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nMoney-Like Assets versus Safe Assets\n\nMoney-likeness and safety, although closely related, are not completely overlapping concepts.2 Safety refers to an asset\u2019s lack of actual and perceived exposure to risk, including credit risk, counterparty risk, interest-rate risk, and market risk.3 Money-likeness refers to an asset\u2019s lack of information sensitivity, such that, when it is used in transactions, economic agents need not worry about its future value, at least in the short term and in most states of the world.4 Because of this, money-like assets are usually short-term, liquid assets with no credit or counterparty risk, promising a fixed payment in nominal terms.5\n\nIn normal states of the world, investors tend not to distinguish too carefully between and among money-like and safe assets. However, in non-normal states of the world, where investors have heightened perceptions of risk\u2014partly because of underlying credit or counterparty issues, but also critically because of uncertainty about the actions of other investors\u2014investors tend to view directly-held liabilities of the official sector as substantially safer than those of the private sector.\n\nIn these non-normal states of the world, central banks have the unique ability to quickly produce large quantities of assets that are both safe and money-like. Central banks can provide liquidity to the private sector and reduce systemic risk in the economy by providing credit that is secured by less-liquid assets.6 This \u201clender of last resort\u201d capacity is particularly important when the precautionary demand for liquidity increases substantially, because it is precisely at these times that private provision of liquidity declines. The financial crisis of 2008 provides a striking example of this ability. As shown in Figure 1, the Federal Reserve doubled the size of its balance sheet in a matter of weeks in September 2008 to meet the extraordinary demand for liquidity as private sources of liquidity dried up.\n\nOn the liability side of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, the increase in liquidity was matched by increases in bank reserves and Treasury deposits through this extraordinary period.7 The Treasury deposits were funded by an increase in bill issuance, hence the amount of officially-produced, safe and money-like assets in the financial system increased by around $1 trillion in a few weeks.8\n\nOf course, since investors are aware of the central bank\u2019s unique ability to quickly supply safe and money-like assets in non-normal times, their incentives to monitor risks in normal times may be reduced. The moral hazard raised by this awareness may be addressed through regulation and supervision. Further, the central bank needs to take care that its provision of money-like assets in normal times does not crowd out the private financial system or exacerbate run behavior in stressful times.9\n\nPrivate Provision of Money-like Assets\n\nThe private sector plays an important role in the provision of money-like assets. For instance, banks create money-like assets in the form of bank deposits.Similarly, nonbank institutions, such as money market funds (MMFs), can also provide money-like assets.\n\nHowever, private provision of money-like assets can increase the risk of financial instability. In order to provide money-like assets, financial institutions generally engage in maturity and liquidity transformation, transforming longer term assets into callable liabilities that are runnable.10 Thus, although in normal times investors may perceive these privately produced assets as safe and liquid, a sudden shift in investor perceptions can amplify instability in periods of market stress. To the extent that the private sector does not incorporate the social cost of runs on private callable liabilities, too much private money can be created in normal times, generating a role for public sector intervention.\n\nThe main way the public sector can mitigate the risks associated with the excessive private supply of money-like assets is through regulation and supervision. By reducing the fragility of financial institutions, regulation reduces the run externalities associated with private money creation. Effective capital regulation and supervision are the main tools for reducing investor concerns about the banking system\u2019s solvency in stressful times. In addition, FDIC deposit insurance complements strong capital by reducing depositors\u2019 incentives to run on banks.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, the regulatory and supervisory framework has been extended to more directly reduce risks from swings in the supply of liquidity within the financial system. In particular, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) reduces the likelihood of runs by forcing banks to hold highly liquid assets against expected future cash outflows.11,12\n\nExample of Money Fund Reform\n\nRuns can also occur on nonbanks. One particularly spectacular run during the financial crisis followed Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy and the Reserve Fund\u2019s \u201cbreaking the buck\u201d as investors fled prime money market funds. This run was stopped dramatically by a government guarantee. Recent work by some New York Fed colleagues provides a real-world example of how, in normal times, new regulation can induce investors to distinguish between safe and money-like assets.13 They used the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) recent implementation of measures to reform the MMF industry as a quasi-natural experiment to characterize investors\u2019 preferences for money-like assets.14\n\nIn 2014, the SEC approved a new set of rules aimed at mitigating the fragility of prime MMFs. As of October 2016, prime funds have been required under certain conditions to impose liquidity fees on redemptions or gates halting the redemption of shares.15 Additionally, prime funds offering shares to institutional investors may no longer price such shares with fixed NAVs; instead, they must price their shares at the market value of the underlying securities, much like standard mutual funds. By requiring prime MMFs to adopt a system of gates and fees, the reform made them less money-like; floating NAVs reduced the money-likeness of the institutional sub-segment even further.16,17\n\nThe differential impact of the SEC\u2019s MMF reforms\u2014which made prime MMFs less money-like yet not riskier\u2014can be used to distinguish between investors' preferences for money-likeness and safety in normal states of the world. Figure 2 shows the industry\u2019s aggregate assets around the implementation of the new rules. In anticipation of implementation, more than $1 trillion flowed from the prime MMF sector into the government MMF sector.18\n\nMoreover, the absence of other changes in investors\u2019 behavior suggests that MMF investors were driven by a narrow desire to preserve the money-likeness of their investments. When moving from prime to government MMFs, investors largely remained in the same fund family. Figure 3 illustrates this observation using a scatter plot of outflows from prime funds versus inflows into government funds at the family level. Additionally, investors shifted into funds that invest primarily in agency debt, the sub-segment of the government MMF industry with a risk-return profile most similar to that of prime MMFs.\n\nThis response to MMF reform differs significantly from what happened in 2008. Although during the 2008 MMF run, investors also fled from prime to government MMFs, the characteristics of the run differed substantially: outflows were large but quickly reverted following the guarantee; they largely occurred across\u2014and not within\u2014fund families as investors became wary of particular counterparties; and investors moved to the safest sub-segment of the government MMF industry, that is, funds investing only in Treasuries and Treasury-backed repos.19 These contrasts further illustrate a difference between investors\u2019 demand for money-like assets in normal times, when regulation changes, and their demand for safety in non-normal times.\n\nPublic Sector Provision of Money-Like Assets\n\nThere is a view that regulation and supervision alone are not sufficient to fully mitigate the financial stability risks associated with private maturity and liquidity transformation, and thus, the official sector should consider providing more money-like assets.20 The argument is that when the official sector increases its supply of money-like assets, it reduces the convenience yield on very short-term securities, thereby weakening the private sector\u2019s incentives to create short-term runnable securities.21 Some recent market pricing helps to illustrate this characteristic. As shown in Figure 4, an increased supply of bills issued by the U.S. Treasury in late 2017 was accompanied by a tightening of the spread between rates on 3-month T-bills and overnight indexed swaps (OIS)\u2014a spread between two risk-free instruments that can be thought as reflecting the premium associated with bills\u2019 money-like characteristics in normal times.22\n\nWhile this is an area worthy of further research, I personally am not compelled by the notion that the public sector can calibrate its supply of money-like assets at the short-end of the curve to exactly remove any remaining externalities from the private creation of money-like assets. In particular, for the last few years in the U.S., because of the various large-scale asset purchase programs, the provision of overnight money-like assets from the Federal Reserve has likely been in excess of investor demand; however, spreads between rates on money-like assets have remained, and in some cases become more variable and larger. This suggests that other forces are in play. One such force is the adjustment of the financial industry to the new regulatory landscape. It is important that the private sector make this adjustment to better align incentives. The role of the central bank\u2019s provision of money-like assets is to ease and support this adjustment, not substitute for it. This is especially true given that private-sector balance sheets are now less elastic in the short-run with respect to fluctuations in the demand and supply of money-like assets.\n\nFederal Reserve Provision of Overnight Money-Like Assets\n\nEven without expressly pursuing a financial stability objective, a central bank\u2019s balance sheet can provide safe and money-like assets to a wide range of financial institutions in normal times.23 The October 2008 introduction of the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to pay interest on reserve balances and the 2013 development of an overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility provided critical tools that allow the Federal Reserve to maintain control of overnight interest rates regardless of the size of its balance sheet.24 This ability is important because, before the crisis, the Federal Reserve could not increase the supply of its money-like liabilities in normal times without compromising monetary policy objectives.25\n\nFigure 5 shows the size of selected liabilities of the Federal Reserve before the crisis, in December 2017, and market participants\u2019 estimates for average 2025 levels.26 Before the crisis, the Federal Reserve\u2019s provision of money-like liabilities other than currency was negligible to ensure control of overnight rates in the operating system used at that time. Reserves were kept scarce in the banking system, and other liabilities\u2014such as the Treasury\u2019s account at the Fed and overnight investments by foreign central banks\u2014were kept very limited, with tight control around their daily variation. In the current operating system, Federal Reserve\u2019s non-currency overnight liabilities are substantial and allowed to vary considerably to accommodate supply and demand shocks in the private sector.27\n\nCurrently, reserves in the banking system are abundant, with possible benefits for the efficiency and safety of the wholesale payment system.28 The estimates for 2025 indicate an expectation that reserves will decline substantially, but still remain many orders of magnitude above their pre-crisis level. Market contacts focus on the demand for reserves produced by the LCR as an important driver of this change. Banks that satisfy their LCR requirements with large reserve balances free up other high-quality liquid assets for the rest of the private sector.\n\nOvernight reverse repos with foreign central banks\u2014who seek safe and money-like dollar assets to maintain liquid dollar foreign currency reserves\u2014have grown substantially in the last few years. Part of this increase was likely a reflection of latent demand that was relieved as restrictions on these investments were relaxed,29 but part of it also represents new regulations that make it more expensive for the private sector to hold large deposits that are callable at any time.\n\nA new category of liability is the ON RRP facility, which is available to nonbanks.30 In addition to supporting interest rate control, this facility helps the private sector adjust smoothly to various new regulations. For example, during the money fund reform period, as money flowed from prime to government funds, prime funds used the facility to become more liquid in advance of redemptions and government funds used it to temporarily absorb new investments.31\n\nFinally, the Treasury General Account (TGA) has grown substantially in recent years as the U.S. Treasury has decided to hold a precautionary buffer of cash generally sufficient to cover five business days of outflows, subject to a minimum balance of $150 billion. Given the daily variability of TGA balances, this type of account would be also expensive for the private sector to offer under new regulations. Further, as the buffer has been funded mainly through increased bill issuance, it has increased the supply of money-like assets to the private sector.\n\nConclusion\n\nCentral banks are uniquely able to produce money-like assets that are viewed as safe during non-normal times. In more normal times, regulation and supervision are the best tools to mitigate risks from the private creation of money-like assets, but there is a role for the central bank to use its balance sheet to smooth fluctuations in the supply and demand for money-like assets.\n\nPresentation"
