        "content": "I. Introduction\nChairman McHenry, Ranking Member Quigley, other members of the Subcommittee, it is an honor to testify before you today to discuss the economic and fiscal challenges facing Europe and the potential implications for the United States. My name is Bill Dudley, and I am president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nLet me preface these remarks by stating that the views expressed in my written and oral testimony are solely my own and do not represent official views of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or any other part of the Federal Reserve System. Additionally, because I am precluded by law from discussing confidential supervisory information, I will not be able to speak to the financial condition or regulatory treatment or rating of any individual financial institution.\n\nThe Federal Reserve seeks to promote financial stability in order to enable U.S. businesses and households to maintain their access to credit and to ensure sustained economic growth. Although the U.S. economy is currently expanding at a moderate pace, we face significant downside risks, mostly relating to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Because developments in Europe will have an important bearing on the prospects for growth and jobs here in the U.S., the Federal Reserve is monitoring the situation there closely. This is also why we have taken special steps, in cooperation with other central banks, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. I welcome the opportunity to testify on these matters today.\n\nII. Europe\nWithin the European Union, seventeen countries share a common currency, the euro. The situation in the euro area is very unsettled, with pressure on sovereign debt markets and local banking systems. The euro area has the capacity, including the fiscal capacity, to overcome its challenges. However, the politics are very difficult, both because the problem has many dimensions, and because many different countries and institutions in the euro area have to coordinate their actions in order to achieve a coherent and effective policy response.\n\nEurope's leadership has affirmed its commitment to the European Union and its single currency monetary union on numerous occasions. And the leadership is working to achieve greater policy coordination in areas such as fiscal policy. Putting all the countries using the euro on a clearly sustainable fiscal path would help restore market confidence. Assuming that Europe ultimately succeeds in managing this situation, a stronger union will emerge that will be viewed as more robust and resilient. This would be a welcome development for the U.S.\n\nIf, in contrast, Europe were not to be fully successful in charting an effective course, this could have a number of negative implications for the U.S. In particular, there are three possibilities that I would like to highlight for the Subcommittee today.\n\nFirst, if the European situation were to deteriorate, then the euro area would face even more serious fiscal and economic challenges. As a result, growth within the euro zone would weaken and this would lead to less demand for U.S. goods and services that are exported to Europe from companies and workers here. This would hurt growth here in the United States and would have a negative impact on U.S. jobs. It is important to recognize that the euro area is the world's second largest economy after the U.S. and an important trading partner for us. Also, Europe is a significant investor in the U.S. economy, and vice versa. Thus, what happens in Europe has significant implications for our economy.\n\nSecond, if the European situation were to deteriorate, this could put pressure on the U.S. banking system. The good news is that U.S. banks are much more robust and resilient than they were a few years ago. U.S. banks have bolstered their capital significantly, built up their loan loss reserves and have significantly larger liquidity buffers. Also, the direct exposures of U.S. banks to the countries in Europe that are facing the most intense fiscal challenges are actually quite modest.\n\nThe bad news is that the exposures of the U.S. banks climb quite sharply when one also considers the exposures to the core European countries and to the overall European banking system. This means that if the crisis were to broaden further and intensify, this could put greater pressure on U.S. banks' capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nThird, if the European situation were to deteriorate further, financial markets would likely become more stressed. This could tighten the availability of credit to U.S. households and businesses. It could also cause equity prices to fall and this would have a negative impact on Americans' pension and 401(k) holdings. This tightening of financial conditions would damage the U.S. recovery and result in slower output growth and less job creation. At a time that U.S. unemployment is very high, this is a particularly unacceptable outcome. In the extreme, U.S. financial markets could become so impaired that this would dry up the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nIII. U.S. Dollar Swaps\nIn terms of what actions the official sector in the United States has taken or could take with regard to Europe, I wish to emphasize that any and all such actions pursued by the Federal Reserve are motivated by the mandates Congress has given to the Federal Reserve to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment here in the United States.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve System was created by Congress in 1913, it was given the responsibility of providing liquidity to the financial system in times of stress in order to shield the economy, to the extent possible, from the severe effects of financial instability on economic activity and jobs. While the economy and the markets have evolved substantially in the century since then, this basic principle continues to guide our efforts today. Central banks around the world have an important lender of last resort role. This role is important in order to protect the economy against financial instability.\n\nIn today's globally integrated economy, banks headquartered outside of the U.S. play an important role in providing credit and other financial services in the U.S.—providing a total of about $900 billion in overall financing within the U.S. For these banks to provide U.S. dollar loans, they have to maintain access to U.S. dollar funding. At a time when it is already hard enough for American families and firms to get the credit they need, we have a strong interest in making sure that these banks can continue to be active in the U.S. dollar markets.\n\nBanks headquartered outside the U.S., like banks that are headquartered here, make extensive use of dollars in their financing activities. In part, this is due to the fact that the U.S. dollar is the world's number one currency—a status that brings with it many benefits for our country. It is in the U.S. national interest to make sure that non-U.S. banks that are judged to be sound by their central bank are able to access the U.S. dollar funding they need in order to be able to continue to finance their U.S. dollar assets. If the access to dollar funding were severely impaired, this could necessitate the abrupt, forced sales of dollar assets by these banks, which could seriously disrupt U.S. markets and adversely affect U.S. businesses, consumers and jobs.\n\nOne way we can help to support the availability of dollar funding is by engaging in currency swaps with other central banks. This has been used as a policy tool dating back to 1962. Recently, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to re-launch this tool, cooperating with five other central banks. Our intention is to create a credible backstop to—but not supplant—private markets. Banks with surplus dollars are more likely to lend to banks in need of dollars if they know that the borrowing bank will be able to obtain the dollars it needs to repay the loan, if necessary, from its central bank.\n\nThis action is designed to support financial stability, avoid an unnecessary tightening in financial conditions and support economic activity and jobs in the United States. In particular, by reducing the cost of dollar funding via the swap lines last month, we reduced the pressure on banks in Europe to abruptly liquidate their U.S. dollar assets. Thus, this step will help to insulate U.S. markets from the pressures in Europe and support the availability of credit to U.S. households and businesses. European banks are particularly active in areas such as trade finance, project finance, energy lending and municipal finance—a sharp contraction of the financing they provide would be harmful for the U.S. economy as a whole including for U.S. exporters, firms working on infrastructure projects, the energy industry and hard-pressed state and local governments across the country.\n\nU.S. financial institutions currently do not face difficulty obtaining liquidity in short-term funding markets. However, were conditions to deteriorate, the Federal Reserve has a range of tools available to provide an effective liquidity backstop for such institutions and is prepared to use these tools as needed to support financial stability and to promote the extension of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\n\nIn sum, I am hopeful that Europe can effectively address its current fiscal challenges. The Federal Reserve is actively and carefully assessing this situation and the potential impact on the U.S. economy. At this time, although I do not anticipate further efforts by the Federal Reserve to address the potential spillover effects of Europe on the United States, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nThank you for your invitation to testify today, and I look forward to your questions."

        "content": "Good morning. I am pleased to be at the University at Albany. It is always a pleasure to speak with students and faculty because of the intellectual leadership role you play in your communities. I also welcome the addition of business leaders to this gathering because you shape the economic landscape in the region. So, I thank you all for coming today and helping make this such a rich audience.\n\nOver the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across my Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important as my trips to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to shape international bank regulation. The understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that my policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\n\nEach visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I represent. As you may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New York State; 12 counties in northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In August, I met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials in Newark, Patterson and Jersey City. Earlier this year I went to Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Puerto Rico, while last year I visited several upstate cities.\n\nMy trip started yesterday with a policy speech to the West Point cadets and was followed by a colloquium with their economics faculty. So, this visit to the upper Hudson Valley brings me in contact with some of our country’s future leaders—you and the cadets who will lead our country in very important, if different, ways. \n\nI will also have a chance to see more of what makes Albany so distinct from both downstate and Upstate New York. Of course, I may have a leg up on this because I was born and raised close by, in western Massachusetts!\n\nThe greater Albany area is home to 900,000 people—roughly the size of three average cities in the United States. You and your fellow residents tend to be highly educated and be employed as public servants. These factors are all part of what makes Albany feel special.\n\nToday, I want to talk with you first about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I’ll give you my views on the economy nationally and locally. It’s a serious issue because it affects your family and students’ job prospects at graduation time.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nI am vice chair of the FOMC—a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability. Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice on hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions— particularly at times like this—and we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike.  But we are united in our commitment to our mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential to the public interest, because it allows us to take tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit.  This trip includes meetings with the people at the SUNY Nanotech Center, Global Foundries (an advanced microprocessor plant), the Capital Region Economic Development Council, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, New Jersey and New York State. These indexes are essentially local measures of output—similar to gross domestic product, or GDP at the national level. These measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the employment report, which is the only other available metric at the state level. We have also started a consumer panel to track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of debt owed by an average person and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nIn addition, we have a new poll about credit and financing for small businesses, the latter are an important source of new jobs. The survey asks firms about credit applications and reasons for not seeking credit. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our May 2011 poll, of which nearly 15 percent were from the upstate region. The next poll will be in January. If you, as part of a small business, would like to participate in our January poll, please pass your card to my colleagues in the audience.\n\nNext month, we will host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses—to provide information about how they can participate in the global economy and expand their companies by exporting their products and services. The Export-Import Bank, the Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce will be on hand. They will tell participants how to tap demand in the global marketplace and what government programs are available to enhance credit, reduce payment risk and increase lines of working capital. We are also facilitating a “speed mentoring” forum in which small businesses will receive feedback on their business plans and advice about applying for financing from a range of finance professionals.\n\nIn 2012, we’re planning similar events in the capital region. We hope to partner with many of you to support the small business sector.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. For the past three years we have provided housing advocates, including the Empire Justice Center, with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via roundtables, presentations and newsletters.\n\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nNow, let me update you on national economic conditions.\n\nWe stand here today several years after the worst financial crisis in modern times. The origins of the crisis are complex, but it had its roots in the bursting of a credit bubble that had grown to great size during the middle part of the last decade.\n\nPrior to the onset of the crisis, a combination of rapid financial innovation and imbalanced global economic integration resulted in a mispricing of risk worldwide. This was particularly extreme in certain markets such as U.S. housing and housing finance.\n\nThis mispricing of risk led to a misallocation of resources and an excessive build-up of debt in many parts of the global economy. Many—though not all—U.S. households responded to the easy availability of credit and rising home prices by taking on more debt. When the housing boom lost steam and began to burst, expectations about housing prices and wealth were disappointed. The bursting of the credit bubble also created instability within the global financial system and, this, in turn resulted in a sharp drop in the credit available to households and businesses.\n\nThe result was what is now called the “Great Recession.” Over the period from late 2007 through mid-2009, real GDP declined by more than 5 percent, making this recession the longest and deepest recession of the postwar period. \n\nThe recession was felt in many ways, but one of the most painful was the severe impact it had on the labor market. Employment dropped sharply during the recession, contributing to a sharp rise in the unemployment rate from around 4.5 percent in the middle of 2007 to over 10 percent in October 2009. \n\nExtraordinary actions by authorities around the world, including the Federal Reserve, prevented full-scale financial and economic collapse, and the global economy stabilized around mid-2009. But since then the recovery has been bifurcated. While emerging economies have rebounded rapidly, the developed world has grown only slowly. This has hastened a historic shift in the balance of economic power that was already underway before the crisis.\n\nIn the United States, the recovery has proven to be persistently weaker than expected. Growth has been insufficient to either bring down unemployment significantly or to achieve a self-reinforcing cycle of strengthening confidence, demand, income and employment.\n\nAlthough the latest news on the U.S. economy is somewhat more encouraging than that from earlier in the year, we should not take much solace from that. After a very weak first half, when GDP growth was less than 1 percent, economic activity has strengthened somewhat and inflation pressures are starting to ease. Growth in the third quarter is currently estimated to be 2.5 percent, and recent indicators suggest growth in the fourth quarter could be somewhat higher. This modest rebound reflects in part the passing of transitory factors such as the damping effect on household and business spending power from rises in energy and food prices as well as the supply disruptions related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\n\nHowever, as we look toward 2012, the U.S. economy continues to face several obstacles to a robust recovery. Accordingly I expect growth of about 2.75 percent for 2012.\n\nConsumer price inflation has begun to moderate. This moderation is just starting to become evident on a 12-month time horizon—in which consumer price inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) is rising at about a 3.5 percent annual rate. Given current expectations for the path of energy prices—taken from futures markets—consumer price inflation on a year-over-year basis should continue to fall over the next few months.\n\nWe cannot be satisfied with the current state of the economy or the outlook for the next few years. The economy is operating far below its productive potential –leaving the level of output, income and employment much lower than they would be if the economy’s unused resources were put to work. One summary statistic says it all—the unemployment rate is unacceptably high at 9 percent. Given my outlook, the decline of unemployment over the next year is likely to be modest. Furthermore, we also continue to face significant downside risks, mostly related to the stress in the eurozone.\n\nIn a speech yesterday at West Point, I highlighted the need for our nation to deploy a full set of economic policy tools to secure the recovery and build for the long term. This includes monetary policy, but also requires policies to help repair housing markets, fiscal policy that supports growth in the short and long run, and structural reforms that increase competitiveness and support a shift in the pattern of economic activity toward a more sustainable growth path than that which prevailed during the last business cycle upswing.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nHow is the recovery proceeding in the state and the region? As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor conditions in New York State.1 Based on our index, the downturn in the state’s economy ended in November of 2009. Since then, I would describe the state’s economy as recovering at a moderate pace, although there appears to have been a pause in September.\n\nThe New York Fed also conducts the Empire State Manufacturing Survey to learn about conditions for regional manufacturers. I am pleased to say that November’s report (issued this Tuesday) shows signs of stabilizing after five months of weakening. In November, more manufacturers are adopting an optimistic outlook.\n\nLike many other large states, New York has a bifurcated economy. New York’s downstate area differs dramatically from the upstate area in terms of industrial composition, occupations and job growth. While Albany may be geographically midway between the two areas, its industry mix resembles neither the downstate’s heavy concentration in the service sector, nor the upstate focus on the manufacturing sector. What sets Albany apart is that it is home to the state’s capital. About one quarter of employees in the Albany area work for the government—about a third more than the statewide average.\n\nThe local economy did not fare as poorly as the national economy during this recession, but the impact was still severe and the recovery is not yet well established. During the downturn, the capital region saw a loss of about 20,000 jobs, or roughly 4 percent of total employment, considerably less severe than the 6.5 percent nationwide decline. Over the past year and a half, job losses have slowed. But, in contrast to the rest of the state, we cannot confidently say that a solid recovery is underway. The Albany area is not yet consistently adding jobs. This is not surprising, considering the fiscal difficulties faced by New York State. The state has cut a considerable number of government jobs and reduced other expenditures as part of its effort to close significant budget gaps. These job reductions have disproportionately slowed Albany’s local economy.2\n\nIn contrast, I am pleased to say that Albany’s private sector is showing signs of recovery. Your private employers have been adding jobs at a fast enough pace to offset the public sector job losses. However, this job creation has not been robust enough to bring down the unemployment rate, which remains at 7 percent of the workforce. That is a lower rate of unemployment than the national rate, as is usual for Albany. However, it is almost double the jobless rate in early 2007; and it has barely budged since the recession ended. It will be difficult for growth in the region’s economy to resume and for unemployment to decline until the public sector stabilizes.\n\nAn important plus for the local economy is the capital region’s housing sector, which has weathered the economic storm relatively well. As a result, the drop-off in economic activity that is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not been as severe here as it has been in many other places around the country. Like much of Upstate New York, Albany’s housing market has proven more stable than much of the rest of the country. During the 2000-2006 housing boom, Albany’s house prices rose by 85 percent, much higher than the roughly 50 percent average increase in Upstate New York as a whole and almost as high as the doubling of house prices seen nationally. Unlike the rest of the nation, though, the region’s housing market has been comparatively stable since then. Prices have declined by about 7 percent from their peak here, compared with a decline of 32 percent nationally.\n\nNonetheless, declining house prices coupled with a sluggish jobs recovery has increased financial pressures on families. During the recession, all across the nation, high levels of debt led to a soaring number of delinquencies. Many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to more sustainable levels.\n\nDrawing on the special consumer credit panel I mentioned earlier I can tell you that these trends have certainly affected people in this area.3 But the good news is that the effects have not been quite as severe here as they have in much of the country. Households in the Albany region did not accumulate as much debt as did households in the rest of the state and country during the run-up to the crisis. Recent data indicate that the average adult in Albany has about $40,000 of debt, which is about 20 percent lower than the average across the state and country as a whole. Thus, financial strains on many families in the Albany area were lower than in many other places around the state and nation.\n\nHowever, the number of delinquencies did rise significantly during the recession in the area, so it is clear that some households face strong financial pressures. About 4 percent of debt balances currently are 90+ days past due in Albany, which is twice the 2 percent delinquency rate in 2005. Although this is less than half of the rate in New York State or the nation, this doubling of delinquencies in the Albany area still troubles me as a sign of heightened distress for many families here.\n\nStepping back from the current challenges, the capital region possesses a number of fundamental strengths. These strengths show through in some key ways:\n\nOne of Albany’s key strengths is its higher education industry. The colleges and universities in the capital region help stabilize the local economy during downturns and recoveries. Indeed, the private education sector continually added jobs before, during, and after the Great Recession, both nationally and locally.  For example, the University at Albany has taken a lead role in shaping the next generation of financial professionals and regulators through its pioneering curriculums. From my perspective at the Fed, a particularly important and timely example is the University’s innovative National Science Foundation-supported program for instruction and research in financial market regulation.\n\nResearch conducted by the New York Fed has shown that colleges and universities can help build the skills and education of their region’s workforce, which is critical to an area’s ultimate economic success.4 They do this in two ways. Most directly, colleges and universities support an educated workforce by producing new college graduates, some of whom will stay and work in the area. The University at Albany clearly plays this role in the capital area.\n\nPerhaps equally important in terms of promoting local economic growth, colleges and universities can play a key role in creating jobs for skilled workers in local businesses. Colleges and universities conduct research and development that can have “spillover effects” into the local economy. Businesses in the region can take advantage of being close to these innovative activities and facilities to develop new products and technologies. This can also help draw new companies to the region to access university resources. Thus, successful industry–higher education partnerships can provide a quite a boost for a region’s economy.\n\nThe local nanotech sector provides an excellent example of this type of partnership at work. During my visit to the University’s College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering this afternoon I look forward to seeing the facilities and hearing more about the Center’s plans to lead the way in global nanotech research. More broadly, I understand that our audience today includes several members of the Regional Economic Advisory Council—including the University at Albany’s president, George Philip and Michael Castellana, the co-chair of the Council—who are working to advance such partnerships and the outlook for the region.\n\nGoing forward, the industry–higher education partnerships taking place here will be increasingly important. I expect the strong foundation already in place will help maintain the economic vitality of the capital region.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, growth has picked up modestly in the second half of 2011, but not enough to bring unemployment down. While there are some bright spots in the U.S. economy and the financial system, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation, which has risen in recent months, is poised to moderate soon. The Fed is doing—and will continue to do—everything within its power to promote jobs and price stability.\n\nLooking ahead, the key challenge for the Albany area will be to continue to prepare its residents for the best jobs being created here. Expanding education and skills will go a long way to broaden participation in the economy to all residents.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n_______________________________________\n1 Regional Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators »\n2 See, for additional discussion of this topic, William C.

In this capacity I am also vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve committee that sets interest rates and makes other decisions about monetary policy. This committee sets policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress: to promote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn the support of these objectives I and my colleagues must also guard as best we can against threats to financial stability, because credit is the lifeblood of the economy. Without financial stability we cannot achieve good economic outcomes, as the experience of the past few years so painfully demonstrates.\n\nI will talk today about our nation's economy and the challenges that we face. As you know, the state of our economy is important not just for the well-being of our people, but also for the national security of our country. We need a strong economy so that we have the fiscal capacity and technological, industrial and educational dynamism to sustain a military capable of defending America's global interests.\n\nToday I will focus on why it has proven so difficult to generate a strong economic recovery. I will then lay out some prescriptions as to what we can do to put growth on a firmer footing. This is not just about what the Federal Reserve can do on the monetary policy front, but also about what other steps can be taken elsewhere—in areas such as financial stability, housing policy, fiscal policy, and structural adjustment to facilitate domestic and global economic rebalancing. Before I continue, let me remind you that the views I offer today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Developments and the Outlook for the U.S. Economy\nWe stand here today several years after the onset of the worst financial crisis in modern times. The origins of the crisis are complex, but it had its roots in the bursting of a credit bubble that had grown to great size during the middle part of the last decade.\n\nPrior to the onset of the crisis, a combination of rapid financial innovation and unbalanced global economic integration resulted in a mispricing of risk worldwide.

Growth in the third quarter is currently estimated 2.5 percent, and recent indicators suggest growth in the fourth quarter could be somewhat higher. However as we look toward 2012 the U.S. economy continues to face several obstacles to a robust economy. Accordingly, I expect growth of about 2.75 percent for 2012, not much higher. We also continue to face significant downside risks, mostly related to the stress in the eurozone.\n\nWe cannot be satisfied with the current state of the economy or the outlook for the next few years. The economy is operating far below its productive potential –leaving the levels of output, income and employment much lower than they would be if the economy's unused resources were put back to work. One summary statistic says it all—the unemployment rate is unacceptably high at 9 percent.\n\nImbalances and Deleveraging\nSo why has the U.S. recovery been so underwhelming? I think the answer lies in the nature of the boom in credit and housing, and the collateral damage that the bust caused to household balance sheets and to the financial system. Recoveries that take place in the aftermath of severe financial shocks and big declines in asset prices that were mainly funded by debt require highly indebted borrowers to deleverage, or in other words, pay down their debts.\n\nThese shocks and asset price declines, in turn, generate large losses for the financial sector that tightens credit availability and further restricts demand. With weak demand comes weak income growth. Meanwhile, financial and economic volatility and the uncertainty this creates about prospects for future incomes causes those who retain access to credit to hold back.\n\nWhat we have learned, I think, is that the power of these economic forces is even stronger than we had previously understood. And, in such circumstances, although a stimulative monetary policy is essential for recovery, it may not be sufficient.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, let's begin by examining net debt flows in the private nonfinancial and government sectors over the last 10 years. As can be seen in Chart 1, borrowing by the private nonfinancial sector rose rapidly from 2003 to 2006 and remained high until the crisis hit. Then borrowing turned negative as new loans were more than offset by repayments and write-offs. Only recently has borrowing turned weakly positive.\n\nChart 2 illustrates how the stock of net debt in different sectors of the economy evolved throughout this period. It shows that much of the credit boom was concentrated in the household sector. The business sector only experienced a surge from 2006 onward.\n\nDuring the boom, leverage also increased in the financial sector. As the boom proceeded, credit losses were low and earnings strong. But once the bust began, this dynamic reversed. Credit losses at financial institutions surged and the sector was forced to deleverage rapidly and raise new capital. This resulted in a significant contraction in the availability of credit and was a major direct shock to the global economy. Crucially, this tightening of credit standards exacerbated how much many households and firms had to deleverage. It also crimped demand, inhibiting economic, employment and income growth, which in turn made the deleveraging process more challenging.\n\nThe nature of this process can be usefully illustrated with a simple, but important accounting identity based on the difference between current income and expenditure in each of the nonfinancial sectors of the economy. For each sector, this difference we call the balance. If the economy were isolated from the rest of the world, then government-sector balance and private-sector balance would add up to zero.\n\nIn real life, of course, we have a foreign sector, too. If the United States in total spends more than it earns, that must be offset by foreigners spending less than they earn and vice versa. When domestic expenditures exceed income, this produces a deficit in the current account balance. Putting these pieces together we have:\ngovernment-sector balance + private-sector balance = current account balance\n\nAs can be seen in Chart 3, when the crisis hit, the private-sector balance moved quickly into positive territory as households in general tried to save more, and this was accommodated by a record government deficit and a smaller current account deficit. More recently, the private-sector surplus has declined and the government deficit has decreased, with little change in the external balance.\n\nThis distribution of surplus and deficit across the economy's different sectors illustrates a substantial challenge for U.S. economy. In the early stages of adjustment, it was quite appropriate for the government to offset part of the sharp increase in private-sector net saving with increased borrowing. If this had not occurred, the recession would have been even deeper. But at 10 percent of GDP, the government-sector deficit must be reduced over time to avoid creating an unsustainably large government debt burden. This decrease in the fiscal deficit has to be offset by some combination of a smaller current-account deficit or reduced private-sector surplus.\n\nOver time, the U.S. economy needs to increase net exports. However, a rapid turnaround will be hard to accomplish in a world in which most other nations are also looking to increase net exports to support retrenchment at home.\n\nSo it appears likely that even as we try to lay the foundation for a more export-oriented economy, securing the recovery will require help from the domestic private sector—a smaller private-sector surplus. But if highly indebted households continue to deleverage, while those households and businesses with low debt remain very cautious about spending and investment, there will be little impetus in this direction. In that case, the U.S. economy will have trouble building forward momentum.\n\nThe financial sector also plays an important role in this process. If credit availability remains tight, then households and businesses may not be able to increase their borrowing even if they want to. While major financial institutions in the United States have strengthened their capital positions significantly since the peak of the crisis in 2008, and deleveraging has abated, the financial system as a whole is still undergoing a process of repair.\n\nTo understand our prospects a bit better, we need to look at the likely behaviors of business and household sectors separately.\n\nCircumstances for the business sector are mixed with larger corporations generally in much better shape than smaller businesses. Many large corporations entered the recession with healthy balance sheets. While leverage1 did increase sharply in the recession, it has subsequently come back down to levels similar to the 1990s. Record profit margins have enabled large corporations to build substantial buffers of highly liquid assets.\n\nLarge businesses are cautious because of concerns about the sustainability of growth and demand, political dysfunction, the health of the financial system and their ability to retain their access to credit throughout the business cycle.\n\nFor smaller firms, the situation is generally more difficult. Because this sector has a higher exposure to real estate, falling real estate values pushed up leverage for this group and it remains well above previous historical highs. Although small businesses identify weak demand as their major problem, the availability of credit is also an issue. An improvement in their ability to obtain credit would seem to require some stabilization of real estate prices and a substantial increase in demand for their products and services.\n\nTurning now to the household sector, Chart 4 shows that a combination of the fall in interest rates, paying down of debt and debt write-offs has substantially lowered the share of income required for households to service their debt. However, as shown in Chart 5, the average homeowner still is substantially more leveraged than before the crisis and has lower net worth.\n\nOne significant problem is the trajectory of home prices. Homeowners have lost more than $6,000 billion in home equity since the housing market turned. For homeowners with mortgage debt, about one-quarter of these homeowners have mortgage debt that exceeds the value of their homes. The loss of home equity is a serious problem in itself of course, but it has been exacerbated by the fact that many households have found it very difficult to refinance to take advantage of lower mortgage rates.\n\nWithout a substantial improvement in the ability to refinance, the outlook for real estate prices, and in income prospects, it seems likely that many of the households that ended up with too much debt after house prices fell 30 percent from their peak may need to deleverage further.\n\nThis implies that for the household balance to fall and provide an impetus to growth, those households with low debts will have to spend more of their income. In many ways these households are in a similar situation to large corporations: their balance sheets contain substantial liquid assets. They are undertaking precautionary saving as a response to greater uncertainty about the economic outlook and their long-term prospects.\n\nIn more normal times, lowering short-term interest rates would induce households and businesses to spend more or invest more in less liquid long-term assets as the real return on their liquid short-term assets fell. The increase in expenditures produced by this change then would lead to increased employment and income growth, higher assets values and a virtuous, reinforcing circle. However, with short-term interest rates close to zero already and problems in the housing market, this standard rebalancing channel is not working as well as we would like.\n\nThis discussion, I hope, has underscored two important truths. First, while deleveraging had to take place following the excesses of the boom period, both the extent of deleveraging on the part of those with high debts, and the degree of precautionary savings by those with low debts, depend on many factors, some of which can be influenced by the policy choices we make.\n\nSecond, the amount of deleveraging and precautionary savings depends on the availability of credit and the health of the financial system and upon the degree to which income is sustained during this deleveraging process. Note that if income growth is sufficiently weak, households may struggle to achieve desired increases in savings and reductions in leverage, which appears to have been the situation of late.\n\nPolicy Responses in This Environment\nSo what should be done? What should economic policy do to secure the recovery and provide a sustainable environment for long-term growth? Clearly, monetary policy will continue to have an important role. But other, complementary, policy initiatives will also be important.\n\nMonetary policy is important as a means of sustaining aggregate demand at a time that the deleveraging process is not yet fully complete and credit availability remains impaired. Sustained low interest rates help support financial asset and house prices, induce households and firms that do not have high debt to save less and spend more, and enable households that do have high levels of debt to refinance them at lower rates. This reduces the amount of deleveraging that has to take place.\n\nHowever, the ability of monetary policy to provide additional support is somewhat constrained by the zero bound—the fact that we cannot lower short-term interest rates below zero, and have to rely on other, less efficient means, to put further downward pressure on longer term borrowing costs. As a result, it becomes progressively more difficult to induce households with low-debt to bring forward consumption by buying motor vehicles or other consumer durables, and to provide further support for asset prices and household net worth. Finally, problems in housing mean that this sector is relatively unresponsive to the low level of interest rates.\n\nDespite this, we are not out of ammunition. Although short-term interest rates have been effectively at zero since December 2008, the Federal Reserve has used other tools—such as balance sheet expansion and communication policies to lower longer term rates and make financial conditions more supportive of growth.\n\nWe could do more in both directions. For instance, we could elaborate on our forward commitment to keep short-term rates low. Indeed, I believe it would be desirable if the committee were able to provide additional guidance as to the economic conditions that the committee would expect to see before raising interest rates.\n\nAnd we could purchase more longer term financial assets. If additional asset purchases were deemed appropriate, it might make sense to do much of this in the mortgage-backed securities market. This would have a greater direct impact on the housing market and would be less likely to disrupt market functioning compared with further purchases in the Treasury market.\n\nAt the same time, we do have to recognize the costs as well as the benefits of further action. Forward commitment entails some risks to our credibility since it is difficult to capture all the considerations that go into policy judgments in simple and concise language. And balance sheet expansion has potential costs, as well.\n\nThese potential costs stem not only because some may view balance sheet expansion as sowing the seeds of future inflation—an incorrect view in my opinion—but also because balance sheet expansion increases the amount of interest rate risk in the Federal Reserve's portfolio of assets and could, if carried to an extreme, harm private market functioning.\n\nBecause reasonable people can differ over the costs and benefits of further action, you should not be surprised that there is vigorous debate among FOMC participants about whether more monetary policy stimulus should be applied. Don't take this debate for disagreement about the broader goal: I am convinced that all FOMC members are committed to taking whatever steps they deem would help advance the dual mandate of price stability and full employment.\n\nFor my own part, I am deeply unhappy with the current forecast of prolonged high unemployment, and will continue to review whether there is more that we could do that would bring more benefit than cost.\n\nMonetary policy must do its part. But there is a strong case for complementary policy actions because such actions can help secure better outcomes than can be achieved through monetary policy alone. If we are to achieve the best possible recovery and build for the future, we will also need ongoing efforts across four broad fronts: financial stability, housing policy, fiscal policy and structural adjustment to foster more sustainable U.S. growth and a more balanced global economy.\n\nOngoing attention to financial stability and the reform and repair of the financial system is essential to support recovery. We need to make sure this proceeds in a manner that is not pro-cyclical, and for this reason we are, for instance, phasing in new capital and liquidity standards, and monitoring how institutions adjust to the new requirements. Nonetheless, the financial system must be healthy to support sustained access to credit. If we want those households and businesses with low levels of debt to reduce precautionary saving, we need to restore their confidence in the financial system.\n\nThis means providing credible assurance that the financial sector is in solid shape today and that the restructured financial system will be able to reliably supply credit across the business cycle – ensuring there is no 2008-style sudden sharp constriction in credit availability. For this reason, policies that increase financial stability, both ex ante by eliminating incentives for excessive risk-taking and making the system more robust to failure, and ex post, by ensuring the capacity to respond to a major shock, will help support growth today.\n\nThe process of financial repair also matters greatly in terms of high debt households, since underwriting standards help define how much deleveraging must occur to regain access to credit. While we do not want a return to the easy credit standards of the bubble period, we also don't what to overshoot in the opposite direction.\n\nHousing is another area where policy can support the recovery by helping to stabilize house prices and housing activity. Housing is the most important tangible asset for most American households, and housing debt the biggest liability. Obstacles to mortgage refinancing undermine the impact of monetary policy. Moreover, declines in house prices and the risk of future declines directly affect the degree of deleveraging that needs to take place among homeowners with high levels of debt, and the extent of precautionary saving by homeowners with low levels of debt.\n\nWhile home prices had to correct following the bubble, they no longer appear overvalued relative to historic multiples of cash flow, income and rents. But it would be unwise to simply assume the market will bottom out at these levels for three reasons. First, expectations of house price declines can easily be self-fulfilling. The feared loss in value can overwhelm the benefit of low mortgage rates, leading would-be buyers to sit out the market.\n\nSecond, with home construction at minimal levels, housing supply cannot decline in response to weak demand. Home prices thus are very sensitive to shifts in demand and credit supply. If access to mortgage credit for home purchases is unduly restricted, the market-clearing price for housing will be lower than it would be if access to mortgage credit was less constrained.\n\nThird, in contrast to the efficient mechanisms in place in the commercial property market to work-out troubled debt, the infrastructure of the residential mortgage market is wholly inadequate to deal with a systemic shock to the housing market. Left alone, this flawed structure will destroy much more value in housing than is necessary.\n\nIn a recent speech I called for a comprehensive approach to housing policy. This might include actions to\n\n1) prudently expand access to mortgage credit for homebuyers, including by limiting putback risks that discourage loan origination and addressing problems with appraisals;\n\n2) eliminate frictions and lower costs to refinancing for all borrowers with prime conforming loans;\n\n3) enable borrowers who are \"underwater\" on their loans but continue to make their monthly payments to earn accelerated principal reduction over time;\n\n4) provide bridge financing for borrowers with proven ability to service their debts who lose their jobs and may take longer than normal to find new jobs in today's weak labor market; and\n\n5) manage the disposition of homes repossessed by creditors in a manner supportive of large-scale conversion into rental units.\n\nI am encouraged by the recent decision by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to make it easier for certain borrowers with high loan-to-value ratios to refinance. I hope this initial step will be followed by others that collectively move in the direction of stabilizing house prices. I believe this would not just be good economic policy, but it would also be extremely beneficial for taxpayers, who now effectively own the credit risk of those home loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nOn the fiscal policy front, ongoing support for demand from the public sector at a time when many households are deleveraging sustains jobs and incomes. But this can be partly or wholly offset if households and businesses lack confidence in the long-term fiscal outlook for our nation.\n\nIt would be greatly beneficial if the Administration and Congress could more effectively work together to craft a coherent fiscal policy. As I see it, this would consist of two elements—continued near-term fiscal support to underpin economic activity and long-term fiscal consolidation to ensure debt sustainability. Without action in Washington, fiscal policy will turn sharply restrictive in 2012—exerting a direct drag on real GDP growth of more than one percentage point. At the same time, the long-term path under current policy is unsustainable.\n\nIt should be possible, even in a time of sharp ideological differences, to agree on some common pro-growth principles: support for demand today made possible by credible long-term fiscal consolidation, and a mix of fiscal adjustments that are supportive of future growth. This would involve making an appropriate distinction between outlays that support current consumption versus outlays that lift the economy's long-run potential such as investment in infrastructure, research and human capital—similarly, between taxes that inhibit work and investment versus those that are more neutral in their impact. Broadening the tax base and making tax system simpler might also be helpful. Progress on the fiscal front would have an important ancillary benefit—a demonstration that Washington can put aside partisan interests and step up to the challenges our nation faces would boost household and business confidence.\n\nFinally, we need structural adjustment policies to facilitate the reorientation of the U.S. economy away from the growth path of the previous business cycle—away from a reliance on asset price gains and easy credit to support consumption to a more durable long-term growth path with greater reliance on business investment and exports.\n\nAs I discussed in a previous speech, we can learn from the example of emerging nations that took the tough decisions necessary to emerge from past crises stronger, more competitive, and better positioned to take advantage of their comparative advantages in a fast-transforming world economy. This means not just plugging gaps of deficient demand, but also solving structural problems.\n\nDone right, such structural reforms would provide the foundations for long-term growth. But this would also support the recovery today. By boosting household and business confidence about the future and about their future income prospects, this would reduce the need and desire to further deleverage and increase precautionary savings.\n\nA structural adjustment program for the U.S. would include a number of elements beyond those already mentioned. These include labor market policies to retrain workers, investment in education and infrastructure, more efficient regulation, more efficient provision of healthcare services, and pro-growth trade and immigration reform.\n\nSteps that raise the productivity of U.S. workers lead to rising living standards. Also, they can help put the economy on a more sustainable fiscal path. Higher productivity leads to a bigger economy that can more easily support the ever increasing number of retired workers.\n\nAs we take such steps to put our own house in order, we could reasonably look to other nations to take complementary steps to promote global economic rebalancing. By spurring domestic demand growth, emerging market economies could support global activity while enabling their own citizens to reap the full benefits of the remarkable increases in productivity and output they have achieved in recent years.\n\nIf we were to take all the steps outlined above, then I think we will have a pretty good 2012, with even better prospects after that. If instead, it is all left to monetary policy, then the outlook will be much less satisfactory. My baseline forecast—absent the full suite of complementary policies to support growth—is that 2012 will not differ much from the second half of 2011: moderate growth, slightly stronger employment and some moderation of inflation. But I worry about the downside risks to this forecast especially if the stresses in Europe continue to escalate, or if little progress is made on housing, fiscal policy and global rebalancing. In particular, accommodative monetary policy becomes much less effective if the housing market remains in the doldrums.\n\nConclusion\nI know that I have laid out here today a daunting set of policy objectives in an environment that is quite challenging. But before being discouraged by that, let's reflect for a moment on what we already have achieved to date and some of the reasons why success is fully within our grasp. U.S. households have already undertaken considerable deleveraging. The U.S. financial system has made material progress toward better health. House prices are back at levels consistent with long-term affordability ratios. Banks have much more capital than they had on the eve of the financial crisis, the quality of that capital is much better and liquidity buffers are now much deeper. Credit availability is slowly improving. Though our challenges are large, we have come a good way already.\n\nAnd the policy challenges we face are not insurmountable. Even the long-term fiscal issues are not as intractable as some maintain; Social Security can be put on a sustainable trajectory with relatively moderate changes, and while Medicare and Medicaid are more complex, successful reform must be possible given that other industrialized economies spend a lot less on healthcare, often with better results across the population.\n\nEven with determined effort the road ahead will not be easy, and it will be several years before our economy once again operates at something close to its true potential and all who seek work have a good chance of finding employment.\n\nHowever, provided we secure the recovery, there is every reason to expect our nation will return in time to prosperity and solid growth. The United States has an extraordinarily flexible economy with a strong entrepreneurial bias that generates new opportunities, jobs and income. Our higher education system is second to none and the country remains a magnet for talented people around the world. The United States has better demographics than most developed countries and some very impressive institutions—such as the U.S. Army—that provide a pathway upward for all based on merit regardless of background.\n\nAmerica's place in a fast-adapting world economy and the prosperity and economic strength of our nation will depend upon the choices we make. In this fundamental sense our economic destiny is in our own hands. Let's get at it.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\nI would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n______________________________________\n1 Defined here as credit market debt to net worth."

        "content": "Over the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across my Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important as my trips to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to shape international bank regulation. The understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that my policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\n\nEach visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I represent. As you may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New York State; 12 counties in northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In August, I met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials in Newark, Patterson and Jersey City. Earlier this year I went to Brooklyn, Queens and Puerto Rico, while last year I visited several upstate cities.\n\nAlthough the Bronx is the second smallest borough, it is hardly small. It would take the combined population of three to four average U.S. cities to add up to the 1.4 million residents found here. You host world-class institutions such as the Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, the New York Botanical Garden, the Montefiore Medical Center, the Hunts Point Market and Fordham University. You also are home to the largest Dominican population in the City and sizable groups from Jamaica, Mexico, Ecuador, Ghana and Honduras. In sum, the Bronx is a major metropolitan area and economic force in its own right.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nI am vice chair of the FOMC—a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability. Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice on hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions, particularly at times like this, and we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential in the public interest, because it allows us to take tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. Later today I'll meet with the people at the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, Baldor Foods, Aging in America—a skilled nursing facility—and housing advocates.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, New Jersey and New York State. These indexes are essentially local measures of output—similar to gross domestic product, or GDP at the national level. We have also started a consumer panel to track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of debt owed by an average person and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nIn addition, we have a new survey about credit and financing for small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs. The survey asks firms about credit applications and reasons for not seeking credit. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our May 2011 poll—nearly 10 percent were from the Bronx. The next survey will be in January.\n\nThis December we will also host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses—to provide them with information about credit enhancements and access to loans from the Small Business Administration.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods, including some in the Bronx, that face high foreclosure rates. For the past three years we have provided housing advocates with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via roundtables, presentations and newsletters. Later today, I'll tour some hard-hit areas with Matthew Wambua, commissioner of New York City Housing Preservation and Development.\n\nThis year, we'll hold our second Financial Awareness Video Competition in New York City. We invite college students to produce videos that encourage young adults to make sound financial decisions. Five Bronx colleges will participate this year.\n\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized, current maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nNow, let me update you on national economic conditions.\n\nPut simply, growth in 2011 has been disappointing. We entered the year with some momentum, spurred by fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. GDP—the output of the U.S. economy—grew at a\n3 percent annual rate from mid-2009 through 2010. While hardly a blistering pace, this growth was sufficient to add nearly 1 million jobs and reduce the unemployment rate by a half percentage point during 2010. Then, during the first half of 2011, growth slowed abruptly to a 0.8 percent annual rate. Job growth slowed so much that the unemployment rate rose back up to 9.1 percent.\n\nGrowth slowed partly because of temporary factors. As these factors have subsided, growth has picked up. At the moment, the consensus expectation for growth of real GDP in the third quarter—the first estimate of which we'll see on Thursday morning—is for an annual rate of 2.4 percent. But this is still quite disappointing relative to what we'd like to see or what we normally might expect at this stage in the economic recovery process.\n\nLooking forward, I regard continued modest growth as the most likely outcome. This sluggishness convinces me that other, more persistent factors must also be holding back economic growth. And, given the depressed level of household and business confidence and the fragility evident in financial markets, I would also conclude that there remain significant downside risks.\n\nIt is worth taking a moment to elaborate on these points. First, what are the temporary factors that slowed growth in early 2011? Of the items noted in the published notes from our FOMC meetings, two bear special mention:\n\nThese temporary factors are now waning. Energy prices are no longer rising rapidly. Manufacturing growth has rebounded. Sales of cars and light trucks have begun to recover. In addition, business investment in new equipment and software is expanding, business investment in nonresidential buildings is recovering, and export growth remains healthy.\n\nNonetheless, the economy clearly entered the second half of 2011 with only modest forward momentum. What are the factors that are preventing a more vigorous recovery? I'll call attention to four:\n\nThus, our economy continues to face some serious headwinds.\n\nWithout robust growth, the economy is more vulnerable to negative shocks, which unfortunately seem to keep coming. It is like riding a bicycle—at a slow speed, the bicycle wobbles and the risk of falling rises. Politics here and abroad have not helped. The intense debate around raising the debt ceiling and the subsequent downgrading of the federal debt took a toll on household and business confidence. More recently, the difficulties in Europe, along with lower U.S. growth prospects made investors less inclined to take risks. So, we saw a major stock market sell-off and widening credit spreads. All these events increase the downside risks to the growth outlook.\n\nLet me turn now to the inflation outlook. As you may know, the FOMC has two charges: we are asked to promote stable prices as well as sustainable growth. This has been a tough year for both parts of our mandate. We've already discussed how unemployment is too high and the challenges in reducing it. At the same time, inflation has risen more than expected. Nevertheless, because monetary policy works with a lag, we have to make policy based not on where inflation is today, but where it is headed in the future. I believe that underlying fundamentals will help to subdue inflation over the next few quarters.\n\nAs of August, the 12-month change for a broad measure of consumer prices was 2.9 percent, almost double the 12-month change the year before. However, the bulk of that increase was due directly to the run-up of energy and other commodity prices that are very volatile, which means they bounce around a lot.\n\nMeasures of the underlying rate of inflation have moved up too, but by less and to levels broadly consistent with price stability. It is important to remember that a year ago many experts were worried that deflation—meaning a persistent, widespread decline in prices—might take hold. Deflation tends to inhibit growth because families and companies have a harder time paying down debt and tend to defer investments and purchases when prices and wages are falling. Avoiding outright deflation is a very good thing.\n\nSome non-commodity prices have increased a bit more than expected over the past months, but I expect those to subside, as well. Rising rents for housing are likely be constrained by the large supply of vacant homes. Likewise, the surge in prices of apparel and new vehicles should soon be over.\n\nThus, barring more energy price jumps, which futures markets do not anticipate, I expect the inflation rate to fall late this year and next. All the fundamentals point in that direction. Many people are out of work, so wage pressures are unlikely to rise. Corporate profit margins are quite high, likely prompting greater price competition going forward. Moreover, households' inflation expectations remain well anchored. This last point is of critical importance. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin to expect higher inflation. By the same token, low and stable inflation expectations help us to deliver low and stable inflation.\n\nIn light of the current weak outlook, the FOMC issued a statement after our last meeting saying that we expect to keep short-term interest rates exceptionally low at least through mid-2013. The committee also said it would change the composition of the assets the Fed holds on its balance sheet for monetary policy purposes. We are selling some of the short-term government debt that we hold and buying longer-term debt. This exchange should provide some additional support for growth. In addition, we discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery even as we keep inflation pressures in check.\n\nJust like interest rate cuts in normal times, our monetary policy provides support through lower interest rates that encourage private-sector business investment and household spending. This policy tool should not be confused with fiscal stimulus or government spending.\n\nI believe that the actions we have taken recently will be helpful in supporting growth and jobs. However, I do not think that monetary policy is all-powerful. To get the strongest possible recovery we need reinforcing action in areas such as housing and fiscal policy.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nNow, how has the region fared during the downturn and how is the recovery proceeding? As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes to help monitor the regional economic conditions.1 Based on these measures, the downturn in the economy in New York City ended in November of 2009. Since then, New York City's economy has been on the mend, and our numbers for September show that the recovery continues at a healthy clip.\n\nThe local economy has not fared as poorly as the national economy during this recession and recovery. Citywide employment fell by nearly 4 percent during the downturn, much less than the nationwide job loss of 6.5 percent. During the recovery, New York City has already regained half of the net jobs lost during the recession. This has happened without much help from the securities industry (Wall Street), which has been a driving force behind local economic recoveries in the past. This time, the strongest contributors to job growth have been professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and—importantly for the Bronx—education and health services.\n\nWhile the Bronx is closely linked to the rest of the City, the borough has a rich history and vibrant economy of its own. The Bronx economy has evolved substantially over the past century and a half. Through much of the 1800s, Mott Iron Works produced cast stoves, pipes and many other iron products in the neighborhood we now call Mott Haven. In the early 20th century, the Bronx was a major hub of piano manufacturing. Between 1900 and 1930, as the economy here boomed, the population increased more than six-fold.\n\nOf course, from the 1950s to the late 1970s, the Bronx had its troubles. Construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway took a toll on many neighborhoods. Yet the borough persevered, and rebounded somewhat in the 1980s.\n\nToday, I note that some manufacturing remains, particularly in food, apparel and textiles. In addition, Hunts Point is reported to be the world's largest food distribution center. However, the largest sectors—health and education services—together account for nearly half of all private-sector jobs in the borough. The Bronx is home to many fine institutions of higher education, including Fordham University, Lehman College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. In addition, the Bronx High School of Science and the High School of American Studies are among the city's finest high schools. As for health services, the Bronx has a large number of medical care facilities. Montefiore Medical Center is now the borough's largest employer.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Bronx, unlike the nation and the city as a whole, sustained almost no net job loss during the recession. While national employment remains well below its pre-recession peak, the Bronx has added 10,000 jobs since the start of the recession. Some of this resilience is due to the concentration in health and education—the only sectors that added jobs across the nation during the recession. Another factor is that the Bronx is largely a borough of renters, making it less vulnerable to the fallout from the housing crisis.\n\nThis is not to say that all is well here. Some 12 percent of the Bronx workforce—a painfully high share—is jobless and less than a fifth of its adult population holds a college degree. The seeming disconnect between the pace of job creation here and high unemployment reflects commuting patterns. Many Bronx residents work in Manhattan and other places where job trends have been less favorable. In addition, not all jobs in the Bronx are filled by borough residents.\n\nHigh unemployment and low average levels of education help explain why the per capita income here is more than a third below the national average. A quarter of the population here lives below the poverty line, more than double the nationwide rate. Reducing poverty and raising the graduation rate are clearly major challenges for policymakers here.2 Thus, there is much room for improvement even though the Bronx, like New York City, seems headed in a promising direction.\n\nHow are families here doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, the number of debt delinquencies soared and many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to more sustainable levels.\n\nLet me tell you what we see in the Bronx, using the special consumer credit panel I mentioned earlier.3 Although families here stopped adding on debt at the end of 2007, they have not yet succeeded in reducing what they owe. As of June, the average debt owed by Bronx residents with a credit report was about $27,000—about the same as three years before. This amount of debt is smaller than the New York State and national averages of about $50,000, partly because the Bronx's many renters have no mortgages. However, it worries me that in contrast to falling debt levels elsewhere, Bronx residents have not reduced their indebtedness during the last two years.\n\nAnother troubling sign is how many people here are behind on their loan payments. About 17 percent of household debt in the Bronx is seriously delinquent. That is very high: roughly double the rate in New York State and the nation, and almost three times the rate in 2006. Plus, the number of delinquencies is still climbing here, even though they are falling in the rest of the state and the nation. All of this tells me that Bronx households have a considerable way to go before they reach more comfortable debt levels.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, over the first half of 2011, the slowing of economic growth in the nation and the weak labor market has been a major disappointment. Growth has picked up modestly in the second half of 2011, but not enough to bring unemployment down. While there are some bright spots in the U.S. economy and the financial system, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation, which has risen in recent months, is poised to slow soon. The Fed is doing—and will continue to do—everything within its power to promote jobs and price stability.\n\nHigh poverty, unemployment and delinquency rates suggest that the Bronx faces a number of challenges. However, the continued job growth in the Bronx and rest of the city should create more opportunities for Bronx residents to improve their incomes and personal finances.\n\nGoing forward, the key challenge for the Bronx will be to prepare its residents for the best jobs being created here, in the city and in the accessible areas north of the city. The Bronx must strive to build the human capital—that is, education and skills—of its workforce. A region's human capital determines a large part of its economic success. The Bronx needs to ensure that it can attract and train workers for the broad range of tasks that an advanced economy demands. In addition, expanding education and skills goes a long way to broaden participation in the economy to all residents.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n_______________________________________\n1Regional Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators »\n2See, for additional discussion of this topic, William Dudley. 2011. \"Job Creation in the Region.\" Remarks at the Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing, New York City.

        "content": "Over the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across my Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important as my trips to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to shape international bank regulation. The understanding that I gain today will help ensure that my policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\n\nEach visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I represent. As you may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New York State; 12 counties in northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This year I have met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials around the region.\n\nAlthough the Bronx is the city's second smallest borough, it has 1.4 million residents—equal to the combined population of three to four average U.S. cities. You host world-class institutions such as the Yankees, the New York Botanical Garden, the Montefiore Medical Center and the Hunts Point Market. You also are home to the largest Dominican population in the city and sizable groups from around the globe. In sum, the Bronx is a major metropolitan area and economic force all on its own.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nI serve as Vice-chair of the FOMC—a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington, D.C., to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. At FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current regional and national outlook. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from our boards of directors, regional councils and community leaders, such as you.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District and have created tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity—essentially local measures of output—for the city, New Jersey and New York. We have also started a consumer panel to track local household credit conditions.\n\nIn addition, we have a new survey about credit and financing for small businesses. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our May 2011 poll—nearly 10 percent from the Bronx. If you, as part of a small business, would like to participate in our January poll, please pass your card to my colleagues in the audience.\n\nThis December we will host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses—to provide information about credit enhancements and loans from the Small Business Administration. I will send your president, Mr. Caro, details about how to register. I hope to see you in at the New York Fed in lower Manhattan in December.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods, including some in the Bronx, that face high foreclosure rates. Later today, I'll tour some hard-hit areas with the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our detailed maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with Fed colleagues and other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nNow, let me update you on national economic conditions.\n\nPut simply, growth in 2011 has been disappointing. We entered the year with some momentum, spurred by fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. U.S. economic output grew at a 3 percent annual rate from mid-2009 through 2010. While hardly a blistering pace, it was sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate by a half percentage point during 2010. Then, during the first half of 2011, growth slowed so much that the unemployment rate rose back up to 9.1 percent.\n\nGrowth slowed partly because of temporary factors. As these factors have subsided, growth has picked up. But the consensus expectation for 2.4 percent annualized growth in the third quarter is still disappointing.\n\nLooking forward, I regard continued modest growth as the most likely outcome. This sluggishness convinces me that other, more persistent factors must also be holding back growth. And, given the depressed level of household and business confidence and the fragility evident in financial markets, I also conclude that there remain significant downside risks.\n\nIt is worth elaborating on these points. First, what are the temporary factors that slowed growth in early 2011? Of the items noted by the FOMC, two bear special mention:\n\nThese temporary factors are now waning. Nonetheless, four factors are preventing a more vigorous recovery:\n\nThus, our economy continues to face some serious headwinds. Without robust growth, the economy is more vulnerable to negative shocks, which unfortunately seem to keep coming. It is like riding a bicycle—at a slow speed, the bicycle wobbles and the risk of falling rises. Politics have not helped. The intense debate around raising the debt ceiling took a toll on confidence. More recently, the difficulties in Europe and lower U.S. growth prospects made investors less inclined to take risks, spurring a major stock market sell-off and widening credit spreads. All these events increase the downside risks to growth.\n\nLet me turn now to the inflation outlook. As you may know, the FOMC has two charges: promoting stable prices and sustainable growth. This has been a tough year on both counts. Unemployment remains too high. At the same time, inflation has risen more than expected. Nevertheless, because monetary policy works with a lag, we have to make policy based not on where inflation is today, but where it is headed in the future. I believe that underlying fundamentals will help to subdue inflation over the next few quarters.\n\nAs of August, the 12-month change for a broad measure of consumer prices was 2.9 percent, almost double the change in the year before. However, the bulk of that increase was due directly to the run-up of energy and commodity prices, which tend to bounce around a lot. Measures of the underlying rate of inflation have moved up too, but by less and to levels broadly consistent with price stability. I expect those to subside soon, as well. It is important to remember that a year ago the worry was that deflation—meaning a persistent, widespread decline in prices—might take hold. Deflation tends to inhibit growth because people and companies have a harder time paying down debt and may defer investments and purchases when prices and wages are falling. Avoiding outright deflation is a very good thing.\n\nThus, barring more energy price jumps, I expect inflation to fall late this year and next. Moreover—and this is crucial—households' inflation expectations remain well anchored. Low and stable inflation expectations help us to deliver low and stable inflation.\n\nIn light of the current weak outlook, the FOMC has announced that we expect to keep short-term interest rates exceptionally low at least through mid-2013 and will change the composition of the assets the Fed holds to provide additional support for growth. In addition, we have discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery even as we keep inflation pressures in check.\n\nJust like interest rate cuts in normal times, our monetary policy provides support through lower interest rates that encourage private-sector business investment and household spending. This policy tool should not be confused with fiscal stimulus or government spending.\n\nI believe that the actions we have taken recently will be helpful in supporting growth and jobs. However, I do not think that monetary policy is all-powerful. To get the strongest possible recovery we need reinforcing action in areas such as housing and fiscal policy.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nNow, how has the region fared during the downturn and its aftermath? Based on the New York Fed's indexes,1 the downturn in the economy in New York City ended in November of 2009. Since then, the city's economy has been on the mend and, as of September, the recovery continues at a healthy clip.\n\nThe local economy has fared better than the nation during this deep recession and slow recovery. Employment fell by a smaller percentage in the city than it did nationally. During the recovery, New York City has already regained half of the net jobs lost during the recession. This has happened without much help from the securities industry (Wall Street), a key driving force behind past local economic recoveries. The strongest job growth has been in professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and—importantly for the Bronx—education and health services.\n\nAlthough closely linked to the rest of the city, the borough has its own vibrant economy. Some manufacturing takes place here, particularly in food, apparel and textiles. In addition, Hunts Point may be the world's largest food distribution center. However, the largest sectors—health and education services—account for nearly half of all private jobs in the borough. In education, the Bronx hosts Fordham University and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others. As for health services, numerous facilities include the Montefiore Medical Center, now the borough's largest employer.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Bronx, unlike the nation and the city overall, sustained almost no net job loss during the recession. While national employment remains well below its pre-recession peak, the Bronx has added 10,000 jobs since the recession began. Some of this resilience is due to the borough's concentration in health and education—the only sectors that grew nationally during the recession. Another factor is that Bronx residents largely rent their homes, so they were less vulnerable to the fallout from the housing crisis.\n\nThis is not to say that all is well here. Some 12 percent of the Bronx workforce—a painfully high share—is jobless and less than a fifth of its adult population hold a college degree. The seeming disconnect between the pace of job creation here and high unemployment reflects commuting patterns. Many Bronx residents work in Manhattan and other places where job trends have been less favorable. In addition, not all jobs in the Bronx are filled by borough residents.\n\nHigh unemployment and low average levels of education help explain why the per capita income here is less than two-thirds of the national average. A quarter of the population here lives below the poverty line, more than double the national rate. Reducing poverty and raising the graduation rate are clearly major challenges for policymakers here,2 even though the Bronx, like the city, seems headed in a promising direction.\n\nHow are families here doing in reducing their debt to more sustainable levels? Let me tell you what our special consumer credit panel reveals about the Bronx.3 Families here, as renters, carry relatively little debt. However, it worries me that in contrast to falling debt levels elsewhere, Bronx residents have not reduced their indebtedness during the last two years.\n\nAlso troubling is the 17 percent of household debt in the Bronx that is seriously delinquent: roughly double the rate in the state and nation. Plus, the number of delinquencies is still climbing here, even though they are falling in the state and nation. All of this tells me that Bronx households have a considerable way to go before they reach more comfortable debt levels.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, over the first half of 2011, the slowing of economic growth in the nation and the weak labor market has been a major disappointment. Recently, growth has picked up modestly, but not enough to reduce unemployment. Despite some bright spots in the U.S. economy, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation, which has risen in recent months, is poised to slow soon. The Fed is doing—and will continue to do—everything within its power to promote jobs and price stability.\n\nHigh poverty, unemployment and delinquency rates suggest that the Bronx faces a number of challenges. However, the continued job growth in the Bronx and rest of the city should create more opportunities for Bronx residents to improve their incomes and personal finances.\n\nGoing forward, the key challenge for the Bronx will be to prepare its residents for the best jobs being created in the region. The Bronx must strive to build the human capital—that is, education and skills—of its workforce. A region's human capital determines a large part of its economic success. The Bronx needs to ensure that it can attract and train workers for the broad range of tasks that an advanced economy demands. In addition, expanding education and skills goes a long way to broaden participation in the economy to all residents.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n_______________________________________\n1Regional Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators »\n2See, for additional discussion of this topic, William Dudley. 2011. \"Job Creation in the Region.\" Remarks at the Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing, New York City.

        "title": "Opening Remarks at the Global Association of Risk Professionals Forum",
        "content": "I want to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and to the risk forum we are sponsoring jointly with the Global Association of Risk Professionals. I want to thank Rich Apostolik and Rene Stulz for their work in organizing this forum with us.\n\nBefore I introduce tonight’s speaker, Pat Parkinson, I’d like to make some brief remarks.\n\nThe financial crisis underscores the importance of good risk management practices and systems. Some firms had a better understanding of the risks that they were exposed to and liquidated positions and bought protection as the housing boom turned bust. But others took too much comfort in credit ratings or felt too comfortable operating with very high risk concentrations. The desire to protect revenue streams also caused some firms to stick much too long with businesses that were much more exposed to risk than anticipated.\n\nValue at risk measures proved inadequate—understating risk in numerous ways—first, by putting too much weight on historical volatilities, second, by understating tail risks, and third, overstating diversification benefits in adverse economic circumstances. Also, some firms had difficulty in assessing their exposures on a consolidated basis. Thus, while risks in particular business units might have looked manageable, there was a lack of understanding about how the risks aggregated up at the firm level and how adverse shocks could reverberate more broadly throughout the firm’s activities and business.\n\nThere has been considerable progress made since the crisis hit. Risk management practices have been bolstered, MIS systems improved, and scenario stress analyzes have become more commonplace. But there is still much to do. In particular, transparency into risk management practices remains poor. Investors have little information by which to assess the competencies of firms as risk managers or how well firms will likely do in adverse economic circumstances. Also, the ability to discern various basis risk exposures is poor. The large banks have huge books of business that net down to much more modest net exposures. Investors are uncertain about how to think about this as they cannot easily discern how solid the hedges, collateral, and guarantees will turn out to be under stress. Right now, investors are focused on exposures to European sovereigns and banks. The gross exposures are sometimes quite sizable, but the net positions are typically small. We need to figure out better ways to present these exposures and risks in the firm’s disclosures.\n\nTwo more points, I would like to make about risk management.\n\nFirst, in thinking about risk management, we need to be cognizant that, at times, that risk management objectives for the firm may diverge from those of the regulator. In the spring of 2009, the largest U.S. banks did not want to raise more capital because in good states of the world they would not need it and raising that capital in order to have capital for bad states of the world would be very dilutive for shareholders.\n\nThe regulatory perspective was different. If banks did not prepare for a bad state of the world, this made the bad state of the world more likely. By forcing the banks to hold sufficient capital to withstand bad states of the world, the SCAP exercise made a bad state of the world less likely. This underscored an important externality—if an individual firm strengthens itself, this strengthens the financial system and makes everyone better off. I would argue that this issue is relevant right now with respect to the European bank and sovereign debt crisis.\n\nSecond, there are limits on the ability of good risk management practices to protect the financial system. We have to recognize that the feedback loops and contagion channels within our complex financial system are extraordinarily complex and that risk management modeling will often be inadequate in describing how such a complex system is likely to perform under stress. For example, I think we can take too much comfort by focusing on bilateral, direct exposures. As we have seen in the financial crisis, the lines of contagion can occur in unanticipated ways. Also, I may understand well my exposures to my counterparties, but what about my counterparties’ exposures to others in the financial system? I conclude that good risk management practices are essential, but not sufficient. Appropriate capital and liquidity buffers; fulsome transparency and disclosure, and incentives that are consistent with safety and soundness are all also important. Also, working towards a financial system structure in which shocks are attenuated rather than amplified is important.\n\nI’m pleased tonight to introduce Pat Parkinson as our keynote speaker. Pat has been Director of the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation since October 2009. Prior to that, Pat was Deputy Director of the Board’s Division of Research and Statistics, with responsibility for oversight of the micro-financial policy. In addition, from 1993 until 2009 he was the principal staff advisor to the Board’s Chairman on issues considered by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets. He first joined the Board’s staff in 1980. During the first half of 2009 Mr. Parkinson served as Counselor to Treasury Secretary Geithner and played a leading role in development of the Administration’s proposals for reforming financial institutions and markets, including the OTC derivatives markets.\n\nPat is one of our most experienced risk management experts. His international experience is extensive. From 1999 to 2004 he co-chaired the CPSS-IOSCO Joint Task Force on Securities Settlement Systems, which developed the international standards for securities settlement systems (including central counterparty arrangements for derivatives). This work has been the basis for the current effort to update these standards. Pat’s earlier contributions are an important reason why this work has been moving ahead smoothly.\n\nFinally, let me underscore my own appreciation of Pat’s work. He and I worked very closely together during the worst days of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 developing some of the special liquidity facilities such as the CPPF and the TALF. Those were very difficult and uncertain days. I have a great appreciation for his ability and insight."

        "date": "September 23, 2011",
        "title": "Financial Stability and Economic Growth",
        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to be here today. I want to emphasize in my remarks today three points. First, a stable financial system is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth. Second, the financial system that operated in the years leading up to the crisis failed in this regard, generating terrible outcomes in terms of economic growth and unemployment, returns available to savers and access to credit for borrowers. Third, although we have made progress in reforming how we oversee and regulate the financial system, our work toward achieving a more stable and dynamic system able to deliver its essential services to both savers and borrowers is far from complete. We must keep pushing this agenda forward and not be deterred by those that defend the status quo. As always, the remarks that follow reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me start with a few words about where we are now. It is clear that the build-up of debt during the years prior to the crisis, as well as the crisis itself, has contributed to an unusually anemic recovery. This has occurred despite the best efforts of policymakers to stimulate demand through aggressive monetary and fiscal easing. The extraordinarily poor economic outcomes we see today underscore the importance of building a financial system that is resilient in its ability to provide credit to households and business throughout the business cycle. It also underscores the importance of limiting the types of financial and real imbalances that develop during times of prosperity. When such balances unwind, they can cause significant damage to the financial system and the economy.\n\nA range of reforms are in train as the Dodd-Frank Act and other initiatives are implemented in the United States and abroad. Within the Federal Reserve System, we are building a more robust framework for financial stability. And, through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), interagency coordination in identifying and mitigating risks to financial stability is being strengthened.\n\nAs we move to implement financial reform, we should not be dissuaded by those who argue that the costs of reform are too high or that the job is simply too difficult. I grant that not everyone is, or will be, happy with all the reform measures. Reasonable people can disagree about the best way to achieve certain public policy objectives or the appropriate speed of the transition. But I think that the fundamental point that the financial system needs to be changed in profound ways should be broadly accepted at this point.\n\nNow I accept the notion that some minimum degree of instability is unavoidable. That is the price society pays for maturity transformation and the other services provided by the financial sector—services that produce large public benefits. But I doubt that this should be the end of the story—we also have some control over the amplitude of booms and the severity of the busts.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to attribute the instability of financial markets to any one single driving force, recent experience suggests that in many cases innovation plays an important role. I explore this point further in the printed version of my remarks—but for the purposes of our discussion today let me summarize it by saying that innovations that initially create real value generate feedback mechanisms that often fuel the development of excessive expectations—a boom that eventually reverses when the basic belief system that sustained it is contradicted by events.\n\nSuch innovations can occur in the real economy—consider the Internet—or in the financial sector—think of subprime lending and structured finance products. Although the role of innovation has differed across various booms and busts, some important common elements are evident in many of these episodes.\n\nEarly on in the cycle, an innovation can lead to changes in fundamental valuations or the creation of new markets and financial products. Examples of this might include the technology boom that followed the creation of the Internet or the subprime lending and the associated structured finance innovations that supported the housing boom.\n\nAs market participants respond to the innovation, this may cause a surge in business activity. Consider the investment in fiber optic cable and telecommunications equipment in the late 1990s or the surge in U.S. housing demand in the 2000s. This surge in activity drives up profits and prices, which in turn sustains the boom. As part of this process, feedback mechanisms work to reinforce beliefs in the importance and sustainability of the innovation. In the tech bubble, for example, some new firms do displace traditional providers and network effects support scale and profitability and deter new entrants. In the case of the subprime lending boom, the provision of credit led to increased demand, which pushed up prices, and rising prices, in turn, held down credit losses. These feedback mechanisms reinforce belief in the sustainability of the boom, often extending the boom far beyond activity levels or valuations justified by how the innovation has changed the “fundamentals.”\n\nThe process often comes to an abrupt end, and generally does so when the basic belief system that underpinned the boom is contradicted by events. In the tech boom, prices fell when earnings didn’t materialize because only a few firms could achieve and sustain first-mover advantages. In the subprime mortgage episode, loss experience climbed sharply once the options of selling or refinancing at higher prices was no longer available. With the benefit of hindsight, the inherent contradictions supporting the boom are exposed. For example, the U.S. housing boom was unsustainable because it was not possible to indefinitely keep relaxing credit underwriting standards to qualify new buyers to stoke demand. It was also unsustainable because the rise in prices often led to a supply response that limited the prospect of further price increases.\n\nAnother class of threats to financial stability emerge from sudden reversals of market sentiment regarding economic policy and institutional arrangements. This is a complex issue which I will not explore in detail today, other than to note that here too, early profits all too often feed pro-cyclical behavior, undermining market discipline. This in turn facilitates the accumulation of both private and public imbalances that are painfully difficult to unwind when financing suddenly stops.\n\nWhen sudden reversals occur, large costs are imposed on the real economy and the financial system, costs that are not fully internalized by the market participants that may have benefited from the boom. The often significant negative externalities associated with financial market instability suggest that regulation and prudential standards should be aimed both at limiting the frequency and extent of booms and at building a more resilient financial system, so there is less damage when the busts inevitably occur. The goal here is not to use regulation to prevent or even limit innovation, whether real or financial.\n\nMany innovations have generated significant benefits for the macro-economy. For example, the Internet, which lay at the heart of the tech bubble, generated myriad benefits. Similarly, innovations in the financial realm have enabled businesses to limit risk and specialize in their core competencies, and households to smooth consumption. This in turn has enabled the economy to be more productive.\n\nInstead, a critical objective of prudential oversight and regulation should be to enhance the system so that financial transactions of all forms reflect an assessment of risk and return by both the borrower and the lender that is as accurate as possible, recognizing that we live in an inherently uncertain world. This means that our reform efforts should be aimed at strengthening the quality of information and the system of incentives governing risk-taking by both institutions and individuals. And on those occasions when regulators judge that a systematic understatement and mispricing of risk may be occurring, we need to find better and more effective ways to actively lean against those dynamics. This includes using the bully pulpit to point out why a particular boom is likely to prove unsustainable.\n\nIt also means ensuring that markets are structured so that investors with differing perspectives on the value of an asset are able to actively participate. Booms tend to go further when the ability to “go short” is limited or emerges only late in the game. Second, regulation needs to be oriented to establishing standards that will be appropriate throughout the cycle—for both the boom period and the bust. For example, in terms of subprime mortgage underwriting, this would have included enforcing standards with respect to loan valuation, loan-to-value ratios, household income verification, and the quality of loan documentation. As I have argued before, monetary policy will often, though not always, be too blunt a tool for such tasks. Generally, it will be better to develop and use more surgical instruments designed to fit the particular circumstances.\n\nIn addition, no matter how effectively we reform the financial system, it seems unlikely that we will ever be able to completely eliminate booms and busts. There will be problems in identifying the boom—distinguishing between what is sustainable and what is unsustainable. There also will be broader and even more subtle obstacles—booms, when they are underway, are typically enjoyable. As a result, regulatory interventions that temper booms normally are going to be unpopular. So in practice even activist regulators may struggle to act early enough and with sufficient force to arrest a boom before it becomes a bubble. This suggests that to make the financial system secure, we are going to have to do much more than just act to temper booms and busts.\n\nIn this regard, making financial markets and institutions, in their practices and structure, less prone to amplifying and propagating shocks is a critical step. This means, in particular, that regulation should be designed to create incentives that operate over sufficiently long time horizons so that the entire cycle of boom and bust is included.\n\nFor risk management systems, this includes using stress scenarios to place appropriate limits on concentration and risk exposures. The use of value at risk (VAR) models that emphasize recent experience is clearly inadequate. In the case of compensation practices, firms and regulators need to continue to look for ways to tie compensation to the profitability of the firm over the cycle and rather than over shorter time frames, such as the calendar year, and making sure that compensation is appropriately adjusted for the risks that were taken. There also needs to be a framework for ensuring that collateral haircuts are high enough to provide meaningful protection in bad states of the world even if this means keeping collateral margins higher during the good times.\n\nMaking progress on this front would help limit the propensity for leverage to increase when loss experience is low and to provide greater protection when volatility climbs and market conditions become less buoyant. In general, we need to continue to look to implement changes in systems and practices that will help dampen the pro-cyclicality of the system, and temper the amplitude of both booms and busts.\n\nAttention to the incentives created by infrastructure design is also important. Poor infrastructure design can serve to mask and obscure participants’ understanding of the credit and liquidity risks that they are exposed to. A good example of this is the triparty repo market, which plays a central role in providing funding on a collateralized basis. This market for short-term credit evolved in the United States in a manner in which transactions between lenders and borrowers covered only part of each day—from late afternoon to early morning. During the middle of the day, the two large clearing banks supplied huge amounts of intraday credit to the major securities dealers. Borrowers’ assumed this credit would always be available to them, and did not appreciate the rollover risk to which they could be exposed if a clearing bank decided not to lend to them during the day. Similarly, triparty lenders underestimated their exposure to borrowers, believing that the clearing banks would always return their funds each morning. When triparty borrowers encountered funding pressures, these assumptions were starkly called into question. The private sector Triparty Repo Infrastructure Task Force, created in 2009, has made progress toward the objective of creating a more stable triparty market, but deeper change is needed to achieve real systemic risk reduction in this market. I will return to this subject later.\n\nAs part of our financial stability effort, we also need to build in short-circuit mechanisms that help to dampen shocks and increase resilience. This is reflected in work underway in implementing the Basel III agreements relating to the capital conservation buffer and also on capital planning in our supervisory process. This includes requirements for financial intermediaries to cease paying dividends when economic circumstances deteriorate. It also includes developing a systematic framework so that banks can be required to raise capital to ensure that they have adequate resources to deal with adverse economic scenarios—even if those scenarios have a low probability of being realized.\n\nThese innovations are designed to limit behaviors that we saw during the financial crisis that made the financial system less robust. Banks were reluctant to cut their dividend payments and compensation because of fears that this would signal weakness. These payouts depleted capital and made these institutions more vulnerable to deteriorating economic circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, banks were reluctant to raise capital to protect themselves against particularly adverse states of the world. This was unfortunate because the collective behavior of banks to be less prepared for adverse states of the world, often made such adverse states of the world more likely. In an important sense, a poorly capitalized bank generates negative externalities, making the entire financial system less secure, with costs to other financial market participants, whereas the reverse is true of a well-capitalized bank.\n\nAs noted earlier, another important step is to increase transparency throughout the financial system. There are at least two important elements to this. First, regulators need to have comprehensive access to information about the financial institutions and markets that they oversee—including ones that may not be directly regulated. Without such information, diagnosis of emerging problems is more difficult and less timely, and appropriate remedies are more difficult to develop.\n\nSecond, financial institutions and other market participants need access to high quality information in terms of the financial condition of their counterparties. Balance sheet information including capital and liquidity positions and counterparty exposures would enable financial market participants to more accurately assess the condition of those with which they do business. Increased transparency would reduce the level of uncertainty, which contributes to risk aversion and financial crises. Greater transparency in terms of off balance-sheet activities such as OTC derivatives exposures might also be helpful for the same reasons.\n\nGreater transparency is often unpopular because it may reduce market power and reveal business strategies and, thereby, limit profits. But the private loss of profit opportunities must be balanced against the public good of greater financial stability.\n\nSuch steps reinforce the work underway to make the major financial intermediaries and financial market infrastructures more resistant to shocks when they inevitably occur. This includes appropriate capital and liquidity requirements and appropriate risk management practices for banks and financial market infrastructures.\n\nFinally, when institutions do get into difficulty we need a credible way of enabling these institutions to recover or, if recovery is not possible, to be resolved in an orderly manner so that failure of any one institution doesn’t threaten to bring down the rest of the financial system.\n\nSo how are we doing relative to the agenda that I have laid out? In my opinion, we have made a good start, but there is a long ways to go. In many areas, we have identified the necessary tasks only in general terms. Progress in figuring out the details and the implementation path and how to coordinate the efforts on a cross-border basis is more limited.\n\nI would particularly highlight the cross-border coordination problem—regulatory oversight is national, but many financial firms and infrastructures operate on a global basis. Effective reform requires mutually consistent global standards—and while international cooperation to date has been good on many fronts, progress is uneven, and the devil is in the details of implementation. We need all national authorities to resist the temptation to favor domestic financial interests over the interest of achieving a true level playing field globally. And we should resist the urge to favor locally controlled infrastructures where global solutions would better advance the collective financial stability interest. Instead we should work to ensure fair access to global infrastructures. Also, it is important that national regulators have access to data and a role in the regulatory oversight of such global infrastructures when that is relevant to their own national financial stability agendas.\n\nIn the United States, I think we have made more progress in bolstering the resilience of our banking institutions than we have on the other tracks. There are two elements to this. The first element is the increase in capital that has already occurred. The major U.S. banking institutions are much better capitalized today than they were in the fall of 2008.\n\nThe increase in capital reflects a number of factors—a long period of low capital payouts relative to income, significant equity raises, as well as sizable asset dispositions that have shrunk the balance sheet and bolstered capital. The fact that credit losses have abated and this has enabled banks to release reserves has also been important.\n\nThe second element is the international agreement to implement new Basel III capital standards. Not only will Basel III significantly raise the Tier I capital standard when it is fully implemented in 2019, but also it raises the quality of capital by putting the emphasis on tangible common equity.\n\nIn addition, we and our partners in the international community are in the process of implementing capital surcharges for large, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), with the size of the surcharge dependent on size, complexity, and interconnectiveness. I appreciate that it is impossible to calibrate “SIFIness” precisely, but this is not a valid argument for no surcharge.\n\nThe logic behind the SIFI surcharge is that the failure of a systemically important institution would generate a very large shock to the rest of the financial system. As a consequence, it makes sense to require higher capital for such firms to reduce their probability of failure.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to improve banks’ capital planning processes and evaluate their capital dispositions in the context of stress scenarios—the so-called Comprehensive Capital Assessment and Review (CCAR) process—is an important innovation. Most significantly, this process induces banks to improve their capital planning processes in light of potential stress scenarios. It also creates an enforcement mechanism so that dividends and share repurchases can be suspended more quickly when economic circumstances deteriorate.\n\nOn the liquidity side, there has also been progress. U.S. banks have bolstered their liquidity buffers and the Basel Committee has proposed a liquidity coverage ratio requirement that effectively would require large, systemically important banks to hold sufficient liquid assets so that they could reasonably conduct their operations for 30 days without having to raise any new funds. In addition, the industry is reengineering how the triparty repo system operates in order to significantly reduce the large intraday exposures of the two clearing banks in the system. This is important because, as we saw during the financial crisis, very large intraday exposures can prove destabilizing.\n\nHowever, I would argue that progress on the liquidity front has not progressed as far as desired.1 First, many banks remain dependent on short-term funding to finance longer-term assets from counterparties that tend to flee at the first signs of distress. In particular, money market mutual funds remain vulnerable to runs. Such runs can occur even when the underlying risks remain negligible, making money market mutual funds a source of instability. Just a question from an investor about the fund manager’s exposures can cause the fund manager to withdraw funding from a counterparty. This may be market discipline, but it does not operate in a way that makes the financial system more stable. The SEC is leading an effort to reform the money market mutual fund industry.\n\nSecond, the Basel liquidity coverage ratio is under review to ensure that it accomplishes its goals without creating adverse unintended consequences. It will be implemented but in a somewhat altered form, since the proposal is not locked down to the same degree as the Basel III capital standards.\n\nEnsuring that financial market utilities (FMUs) are robust is another important workstream with a number of important elements. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act has provisions that enable the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate particular FMUs as systemically important and, therefore subject to tougher prudential standards. Internationally, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS), which I chair, and the International Organization of Security Commissions (IOSCO), have proposed a comprehensive set of operational standards for FMUs, which I expect will be finalized early next year. We expect that these principles will be endorsed and adopted by the G20 countries, establishing a minimum standard for important FMUs around the world.\n\nHowever, progress is slow and uneven. For example, it is unlikely that the G20 countries will meet the goal to clear all standardized over-the-counter derivative trades through central clearing counterparties by the end of 2012. Similarly, I have my doubts whether the next set of industry recommendations to reduce risk in the triparty repo market will be sufficient to eliminate all the major potential sources of instability—including inadequate risk management practices and lack of resiliency to a dealer default. Experience suggests that it is not easy for market participants to agree on measures that enhance financial stability when this goal conflicts with the commercial and business interests. If the private sector falls short in this instance, public authorities may need to intervene and impose more forceful regulatory solutions.\n\nI also think that the scorecard is mixed with respect to making financial institutions, in their practices and structure, less prone to amplifying and propagating shocks. On one hand, the capital rules and the CCAR process should cause banks to husband their capital better during times of stress than was the case during the financial crisis. Also, compensation practices are improving in that more pay is deferred and over longer time periods. Similarly, risk management practices have improved. Institutions are better able to aggregate and assess their risk exposures within short time periods and stress testing means that there is a better understanding of how these exposures might perform in adverse environments.\n\nBut our task remains unfinished. While progress on reforming compensation practices is welcome, I recognize that there is still much to be done before we can truly say that incentives are lined up in a way that fully supports financial stability objectives.\n\nWe have work to do on the information front too. Consider the issue of international regulatory access to data. Currently U.S. bank regulators do not have access to the consolidated global balance-sheet information of the foreign banks that operate in the United States (or vice versa for that matter). Our examiners see data associated with the foreign firms’ U.S. operations, but not how that fits in with their operations abroad. Without certain specific types of consolidated global information, it is difficult to place the U.S. operations of a foreign firm in their global context, and make informed judgments about the adequacy of such firms’ capital and liquidity buffers. For example, liquidity is often managed on a global basis, and key business lines are frequently managed globally, even if they reside in multiple legal entities located in different jurisdictions. Making progress in establishing protocols that would enable bank regulators to share more relevant confidential supervisory information on a cross-border basis would be a significant advancement. Such enhanced collaboration offers attractive alternatives to ringfencing or other actions that seek to impose local solutions to risks facing globally active firms.\n\nSimilarly, information about counterparty exposures is not broadly available. Occasionally, information is revealed following specific stress tests, but disclosure is very incomplete and irregular. Nor is good pricing information on many financial market instruments such as OTC derivatives readily available. This may ultimately change as such OTC derivatives instruments become more standardized, are centrally cleared, and the data associated with such trades are reported to trade repositories—but, as noted earlier, this still lies off in the future. Similarly, implementing a global legal entity identifier standard that would enable regulators (and potentially others), to easily aggregate information on a consolidated legal entity basis is still a work in process.\n\nSimilarly, there has been little progress made with respect to reengineering the financial system so that the transmission mechanisms act to dampen rather than amplify shocks. However, I wouldn’t be very critical here. This is particularly difficult work for several reasons. First, it is difficult because it relates to how all the parts of the financial system interact. It requires a holistic approach and an evaluation of how the financial system responds to shocks. Up to this point, regulatory reform efforts have been more focused on individual banks and infrastructures, rather than how the entire system functions. Second, it is difficult because the evaluation must extend to entities and activities that operate outside of the more tightly regulated core—including, of course, the so-called “shadow banking system.” In the U.S., some of this responsibility undoubtedly falls to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act. But this is a relatively new institutional arrangement and how well it will be able to perform its mission in practice remains to be determined. Similarly, on an international basis, the Financial Stability Board has undertaken an initiative to evaluate risks within the shadow banking system, but this effort is also still in a fledging stage.\n\nFinally, turning to the last issue about how to deal with institutions that run into difficulty, there has been progress. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) gave the FDIC the authority to resolve certain large systemically important financial firms, on the recommendation of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and after the Treasury Secretary makes certain determinations in consultation with the President. Among other things, DFA enables the FDIC to establish a bridge institution in which critical activities could be moved so that the failure of a major institution will not unduly disrupt the provision of key financial services. DFA also authorizes the Federal Reserve to require that such institutions develop recovery and resolution plans—plans that must be acceptable to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The need to produce such plans will likely create some incentive for rationalizing complex corporate structures and, presumably, make resolution easier to implement.\n\nBut a major challenge remains in implementing resolution effectively on a cross-border basis. The legal rules and regulatory regimes differ across legal jurisdictions. So, when a multinational banking organization becomes insolvent, each subsidiary and affiliate must be resolved in multiple bankruptcy proceedings, with the prospect of inconsistent treatment and larger than necessary losses in aggregate. Although the Financial Stability Board has taken up this issue, the legal impediments to progress here are significant despite the best efforts and intentions of regulators. The difficulty in implementing an efficient cross-border resolution is one of the reasons why the largest globally active firms are being asked to hold additional capital.\n\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize the importance of the mission—to reform and better regulate the global financial system so it can perform its key financial intermediation function of funneling savings from investors to borrowers even under adverse circumstances. Clearly, the financial system we had in 2008 was woefully inadequate relative to this mission.\n\nBoth the official sector and the private sector have responsibilities with respect to the work that remains ahead. It falls on us as regulators to seek to minimize the costs and adjust as the unforeseen consequences of reform become apparent, and to be mindful of the adjustment costs and challenges facing many firms and markets. In particular, we need to understand as best we can how all the threads of the reform effort interact within one integrated global financial system. We also need to ensure that, where the law gives us latitude, that compliance and other costs are calibrated to be commensurate with the financial stability benefits generated by particular reform measures. In this respect, we must be particularly sensitive to the burden that the regulatory environment places on smaller, less systemically important institutions.\n\nBut the private sector has responsibilities too. Banking leaders and industry trade groups should propose smart solutions to achieve essential financial stability objectives and not simply lobby against change. The industry has an interest in a healthy financial system that can withstand shocks and adverse economic circumstances. More statesman-like engagement is both warranted and welcome.\n\nThank you very much for your attention. I am happy to take a few questions.\n\n_______________________________________\n1In general, I think progress on liquidity is inherently more difficult than on capital because tougher liquidity standards conflict with one of the basic function of banks-maturity transformation. Savers want to hold their funds in highly liquid, short-term assets. But borrowers want to lock up their funding over long time periods. Banks help bridge that gap. Pushing banks hard on the liquidity side runs up against this constraint."

        "content": "Good morning. I am pleased to be in northern New Jersey this morning and to speak to the members of the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, as we wound down our emergency meetings, I asked my staff to develop an ambitious outreach program so I could visit the different parts of my District. Over time, I plan to visit all parts of the region.\n\nEach trip gives me a chance to deepen relationships with the people I represent. As you may know, the New York Fed’s District includes 12 counties here in northern New Jersey; all of New York State; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In June, I met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials in Brooklyn, and in May I travelled to several cities in the mid-Hudson Valley north of New York City to meet with the leadership of those communities. Today I will continue to meet with a wide range of people and organizations here in northern New Jersey to talk about what I do and to learn firsthand about the economic and financial issues important to you. These conversations will help me to represent all of my constituents in my work at the Fed as I consider how best to manage interest rates and make other monetary policy decisions.\n\nNorthern New Jersey is important to me not just because it is a large and important part of the New York Fed’s District, but also because it accounts for a large share of New Jersey’s economy and last, but far from least, it is my home—my wife and I have made our home in Cranford, her home town and where she can be near her mother. \n\nWe are pleased to work with the business community and vigorous active chambers such as the Meadowlands. However even in a wealthy state such as New Jersey there are pockets – sometimes large pockets of poverty. So, even as we work with the business community, we also have a number of initiatives specifically targeted to help low-and moderate-income groups, and have worked particularly hard to help challenged cities, such as Newark.\n\nFor the past three years we have provided the Newark/Essex County Foreclosure Taskforce with data and analyses on the latest mortgage conditions and trends through round tables, presentations and newsletters. The task force was formed in late 2007 in response to the rise in foreclosures in Newark and surrounding towns. We’ve also partnered with Bank on Newark, a private/public partnership developed to bring unbanked populations into the financial mainstream by helping them establish bank accounts and receive financial education. This fall, we will launch our Financial Awareness Video Competition in Newark and Essex County. The competition invites university and college-level students to produce videos that encourage young adults to make sound personal-finance decisions.\n\nI thank the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce for inviting me here to speak to you today. This is the second day of my visit to northern New Jersey where I am meeting with elected officials, community bankers and credit union officials, and visiting several businesses—my staff has booked a packed schedule.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does\n\nBy way of introduction, let me briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nI am vice chair of the Committee and we meet eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. At every meeting of the FOMC, each Committee member presents his or her current outlook for their region and for the overall economy. For these assessments we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our board of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders, such as the feedback I will get from you today.\n\nAt the regional level, we continually track economic conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for this purpose. For example, to fill a void in timely measures of regional economic output, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New Jersey, as well as for New York State and New York City. These measures are similar in concept to measures of gross domestic product, or GDP. We have also initiated a consumer credit panel so we can monitor local household credit conditions, including the amount of debt being carried per person and the composition and payment status of that debt.\n\nFurthermore, we have a new survey to track credit and financing issues for small businesses, which create a lot of jobs. The poll takes a fresh look at borrower demand by asking firms not only about credit applications but also about reasons for not seeking credit. In all, 876 small businesses from the tri-state area responded to our May 2011 poll, and 14 percent of these were from New Jersey\nTo share the information that we gather and produce about our diverse District, we have created a rich website with localized current data and maps on conditions in the region. I invite you to visit us at newyorkfed.org to explore the highly detailed information on small business, credit and housing conditions that we provide.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies in the United States and abroad to help put the nation’s financial system on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy even in normal times.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nThe statement issued by the FOMC last week presents a sober assessment of the state of the U.S. economy. Economic growth so far in 2011 has been quite a bit slower than we expected earlier in the year. While jobs growth picked up early in the year, in the last few months conditions in the labor market have deteriorated again and the unemployment rate has edged up.  Household spending has flattened out, and the housing sector is depressed. Business investment in equipment and software is expanding, but investment in corporate offices and other commercial buildings is weak.\n\nSome of the weakness in economic activity in the first half of the year was due to temporary factors such as the hit to household income from higher food and energy prices, and supply chain disruptions following the tragic earthquake in Japan. These restraining forces have abated and thus, we should see stronger growth in the second half. But it is clear that not all of the weakness was due to these one-time factors—and in light of this, I have revised down my expectations for the pace of recovery going forward.\n\nOn the inflation front, the committee noted that inflation has moderated recently as energy and commodity prices have declined from their peaks - having picked up earlier in the year, mainly reflecting higher prices for commodities and imported goods, as well as the supply disruptions from Japan. Longer-term inflation expectations remain stable, and the Committee now expects inflation to settle over the coming quarters at levels at or below those consistent with our mandate to promote full employment and price stability.\n\nIn light of the current outlook, the FOMC in its statement noted that we now anticipate that we are likely to keep short-term interest rates exceptionally low at least through mid-2013. We also discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Further details on the discussion at the meeting will be available when the minutes are published later this month. I will not comment on monetary policy any further today.\n\nFollowing the release of the FOMC’s statement, market interest rates generally moved lower, which should help provide some additional support for economic activity and jobs. I would note, however, that conditions remain unsettled and the equity market in particular has been quite volatile recently.   \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nSo how is our region doing? Let me start by saying that New Jersey is well-positioned for growth. The state has a population of 8.8 million, the 11th largest state, and despite the fact that this is a fairly mature region, the state’s population expanded by 4.5 percent over the past decade. Over 40 percent of the population 25 years of age and older in the state have a college degree, a full 5 percentage points higher than the national average. Our population is quite ethnically diverse: roughly 20 percent of the state’s residents were born abroad, and that share is even higher in Essex and Bergen counties. Significant numbers of the foreign-born residents in the state come from India, Mexico, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic and Korea.\n\nThe state’s economy is also quite diverse and its industry mix mirrors that of the national economy. A sizeable number of jobs in the state are in the healthcare, professional and business service, wholesale and retail trade, and leisure and hospitality fields. When we look at the northern part of the state, we see a somewhat greater concentration of jobs in finance— particularly in Hudson County—in goods distribution—related to the ports, rail lines and trucking and warehousing activities that are prominent here—in pharmaceuticals manufacturing and research and development, and in the private education sector.\n\nThe area also has important links to New York City. For example, the data centers here in the state serve many of the city’s financial firms, and there are a large number of residents, including myself, who commute each day into the city. A smaller but still sizeable number of New Yorkers commute into this state. \n\nNow, how did the state fare during the downturn and how is the recovery proceeding?  As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes of economic activity to help monitor the performance of the region.1 Based on our index, the downturn in activity in New Jersey began about the same time as the Great Recession was beginning nationwide, that is around December 2007. While activity in the state is no longer declining, and there has been a slight pickup this year in the level of activity, to date there is still no sign that a strong recovery has taken hold. And quite frankly, this modest recovery in New Jersey contrasts with the relatively sturdy recovery in activity in New York City over the past 18 months.\n\nEmployment in our region also declined substantially during the Great Recession. Job losses in New Jersey totaled about 250,000—on par with the roughly 6 percent loss nationwide. The pattern of job losses here in northern New Jersey was very similar. In New York City, job losses were also large but somewhat less severe, with employment in the city down a little over 4 percent.\nThe jobs recovery in New Jersey to date has been sluggish. The private sector has seen moderate gains, with growth in some of the key sectors I mentioned earlier, particularly professional and business services, education and health, and leisure and hospitality. Businesses in these sectors, on balance, expanded jobs at a faster rate than in the nation. But the state continues to shed jobs in manufacturing and residential construction. Notably, overall employment in the state has been weighed down by declines in public sector employment. Like many states, New Jersey faced large projected state budget deficits during the downturn, and, as in many states, the adjustment to those gaps included job cuts through a reduction in state government jobs and cuts in state funding for local government programs.  \n\nBecause the jobs recovery has been weak, there has been little progress in reducing unemployment. The unemployment rate among New Jersey residents currently stands at 9.5 percent, the same rate as a year ago, and slightly above the national rate.\n\nUnderneath the slow overall job growth, however, there is a considerable amount of churning in the labor market. Taking a closer look at the patterns of job gains and losses during the recession and recovery reveals some interesting facts about the labor market in New Jersey. Of particular interest is that job creation in the state and the nation since the recession ended has been closely balanced between hiring into industries that lost jobs during the recession and jobs in expanding industries. Thus, many unemployed workers may be returning to work without needing to retrain or look far afield from the job they lost. However, an equal number many need to search outside the industry they know best and this may require retraining in some cases. Thus, the need for job-search assistance and training opportunities is likely to be high in New Jersey and the nation in the near term.   \n\nAnd now let’s look at the situation of New Jersey households. The median household income among New Jersey families is the second highest in the nation, at about $68,000 in 2009 and 9 percent of state residents are in families with incomes below the poverty line. This rate compares favorably with the national rate of 13.6 percent, but varies by city across the state, and there is room for improvement. Even in such a wealthy state as New Jersey, there are pockets across the state characterized by sizeable numbers of residents lacking a high school diploma, unemployed and living in poverty. Reducing poverty is clearly a major challenge for policy makers.2\n\nMore broadly, how are the state’s families doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, the number of debt delinquencies soared and many families found they had to reduce their debt to more sustainable levels. The New York Fed keeps track of credit conditions in the region—including the average debt carried per person and whether they are current with their payments—using the special consumer credit panel we developed. The report for the second quarter of this year was just released on Monday.3\n\nFamilies in New Jersey are reducing their debt levels. As of the second quarter of this year, for those people with a credit report, average debt per person was about $60,400 down from $63,000 three years ago. But the crisis has taken its toll. Delinquency rates on the debt are high: 7.4 percent of all debt in the state is seriously delinquent, roughly the same rate as the nation. The comparable figure for the state just three years ago was 4.1 percent, so, like the nation, households in the state still appear to have a considerable way to go before they reach more comfortable debt levels.\n\nWhile there have been indications that home prices in the area have been firming in the past few months, the mortgage crisis continues to take a toll on New Jersey homeowners. As of March of this year, 10 percent of all borrowers in the state were either 90-plus days delinquent on their mortgages, or their homes were in foreclosure—above the national rate of 7.7 percent. In Bergen County, the rate is close to 8 percent.   \n\nIn our recent small business survey, which we conducted in May, we asked firms to report on their first quarter sales and their future outlook. The results were encouraging. Over two-thirds of firms told us they had stable or increased sales in the first quarter, up from 50 percent last year. When asked about their future outlook, while the majority of business owners, 56 percent, were neutral—many more said they were optimistic than pessimistic: 37 percent compared with only 7 percent.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese debt and delinquency figures, together with the weak jobs picture, suggest that New Jersey faces a number of challenges. In the near term, the key issue will be to expand jobs and reduce unemployment. At this point it is difficult to say when the pace of recovery in the state will pick up, but several factors appear encouraging.  \n\nA continued expansion of output and employment nationally would clearly help to expand activity and employment in a number of industries in the state, including professional and business services and the goods distribution industries. Also, the pace of contraction in public sector jobs in the state has slowed from the sharp declines that occurred last year, and has thus become less of a drag on job growth. Further, continued job growth in New York City should create opportunities for New Jersey residents, particularly in this part of the state.\n\nLonger term, one of the key challenges will be for the state to build upon and expand the human capital—by which I mean the education and skills—of its workforce. A region’s human capital determines a large part of its economic success. Even though it already has one of the most educated workforces in the country, New Jersey needs to continue to attract and train workers who can do a range of tasks that an advanced economy demands, such as start innovative firms, operate sophisticated capital equipment and design websites. In addition, a broad expansion of education and skills goes a long way to broaden participation in the economy to all residents of the state.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n_______________________________________\n1Regional Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators »\n2See, for additional discussion of this topic, William Dudley. 2011. \"Job Creation in the Region.\" Remarks at the Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing, New York City.

        "content": "Good morning. I am pleased to be in Newark this morning and to speak to the members of the Newark Regional Business Partnership.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, as we wound down our emergency meetings, I asked my staff to develop an ambitious outreach program so I could visit the different parts of my District. Over time, I plan to visit all parts of the region.\n\nEach trip gives me a chance to deepen relationships with the people I represent. As you may know, the New York Fed’s District includes 12 counties here in northern New Jersey; all of New York State; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In June, I met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials in Brooklyn, and in May I travelled to several cities in the mid-Hudson Valley north of New York City to meet with the leadership of those communities. Today and tomorrow I will meet with a wide range of people and organizations here in northern New Jersey to talk about what I do and to learn firsthand about the economic and financial issues important to you. These conversations will help me to represent all of my constituents in my work at the Fed as I consider how best to manage interest rates and make other monetary policy decisions.\n\nNorthern New Jersey is important to me not just because it is a large and important part of the New York Fed’s District but also because it is my home. My wife and I have made our home in Cranford–her home town where she can be near her mother. \n\nWhile my colleagues and I are pleased to work with the business community—and I know that Jason Bram and Rae Rosen of the Fed have addressed this group in the past—we also have a number of initiatives specifically targeted to help low- and moderate-income groups, particularly here in Newark.\n\nFor the past three years we have provided the Newark/Essex County Foreclosure Taskforce with data and analyses on the latest mortgage conditions and trends through a range of outlets including round tables, presentations and newsletters. This Taskforce was formed in response to the rise in foreclosures in Newark and surrounding towns in late 2007. The Taskforce is comprised of representatives of over 40 community development corporations, nonprofit housing counseling and legal service providers, government and community development officials and advocacy organizations working to address this serious issue.\n\nOver the past two years we have partnered with Bank on Newark. Bank on Newark is a private/public partnership developed to bring unbanked populations into the financial mainstream by providing assistance in establishing bank accounts and receiving financial education. The New York Fed serves as an advisor and data monitor for Bank on Newark and its sister program, Bank on Manhattan, as well.\n\nThis fall, we will launch our Financial Awareness Video Competition in Newark and Essex County in partnership with the City of Newark. The goal of this video competition is to promote financial awareness in the Greater Newark community. The video competition invites university- and college-level students to produce original videos that encourage young adults to practice sound personal financial decisionmaking. We have successfully launched similar video competitions in Puerto Rico and New York City. Last year’s videos were judged by a panel of professional film makers and leading advertising agencies. The winning videos ran for two weeks as “shorts” in major movie theaters in Manhattan and Queens.\n\nI thank the Newark Regional Business Partnership, PNC Bank and NJ PAC for inviting me here to speak to you today. I would also like to thank the SGA Group PC for sponsoring this breakfast. Over the next two days I look forward to meeting with your elected officials in Newark, visiting Newark Now, sitting down with the Episcopal Community Development Housing Counselors, as well as meeting with New Jersey community bankers and credit union officials, visiting the manufacturer Accurate Box, touring Jersey City and learning more about the pharmaceutical industry–my staff has booked a packed schedule.\n\nThe Role of the New York Fed\nBy way of introduction, let me briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC. I am vice chair of the committee and we meet eight times a year in Washington, D.C., to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy.\n\nAt every meeting of the FOMC, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for their region and for the overall economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our board of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders, such as the feedback I will get from you today.\n\nAt the regional level, we continually track economic conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for this purpose. For example, to fill a void in timely measures of regional economic output my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New Jersey, as well as for New York State and New York City. These measures are similar in concept to measures of gross domestic product (GDP). We have also initiated a consumer credit panel so we can monitor local household credit conditions, including the amount of debt being carried per person and the composition and payment status of that debt.\n\nFurthermore, we have a new survey to track credit and financing issues for small businesses, which create a lot of jobs. The poll takes a fresh look at borrower demand by asking firms not only about credit applications but also about reasons for not seeking credit. In all, 876 small businesses from the tri-state area responded to our May 2011 poll, and 14 percent of these were from New Jersey.\n\nTo share the information that we gather and produce about our diverse District, we have created a rich website with localized current data and maps on conditions in the region. I invite you to visit us at newyorkfed.org to explore the highly detailed information on small business, credit and housing conditions that we provide.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington and at other agencies in the United States and abroad to help put the nation’s financial system on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy even in normal times.\n\nMacro Conditions\nThe statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee earlier last week presents a sober assessment of the state of the U.S. economy. Economic growth so far in 2011 has been quite a bit slower than we expected earlier in the year. While jobs growth picked up early in the year, in the last few months conditions in the labor market have deteriorated again and the unemployment rate has edged up. Household spending has flattened out, and the housing sector is depressed. Business investment in equipment and software is expanding, but investment in corporate offices and other commercial buildings is weak.\n\nSome of the weakness in economic activity in the first half of the year was due to temporary factors such as the hit to household income from higher food and energy prices, and supply chain disruptions following the tragic earthquake in Japan. These restraining forces have abated and thus, we should see stronger growth in the second half. But it is clear that not all of the weakness was due to these one-time factors – and in light of this, I have revised down my expectations for the pace of recovery going forward.\n\nOn the inflation front, the committee noted that inflation has moderated recently as energy and commodity prices have declined from their peaks–having picked up earlier in the year, mainly reflecting higher prices for commodities and imported goods, as well as the supply disruptions from Japan. Longer term inflation expectations remain stable, and the committee now expects inflation to settle over the coming quarters at levels at or below those consistent with our mandate to promote full employment and price stability.\n\nIn light of the current outlook, the FOMC in its statement noted that we now anticipate that we are likely to keep short-term interest rates exceptionally low at least through mid-2013. We also discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Further details on the discussion at the meeting will be available when the minutes are published later this month. I will not comment on monetary policy any further today.\n\nFollowing the release of the FOMC’s statement, market interest rates generally moved lower, which should help provide some additional support for economic activity and jobs. I would note, however, that conditions remain unsettled and the equity market in particular has been quite volatile recently. \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nSo how is our region doing? Let me start by saying that New Jersey is well-positioned for growth. The state has a population of 8.8 million, the 11th largest state, and despite the fact that this is a fairly mature region, the state’s population expanded by 4.5 percent over the past decade. More than\n40 percent of the population 25 years of age and older in the state have a college degree, a full 5 percentage points higher than the national average. Our population is quite ethnically diverse: roughly 20 percent of the state’s residents were born abroad, and that share is even higher in Essex and Bergen counties. Significant numbers of the foreign born residents in the state come from India, Mexico, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic and Korea.\n\nThe state’s economy is also quite diverse, and its industry mix mirrors that of the national economy. A sizeable number of jobs in the state are in the healthcare, professional and business service, wholesale and retail trade, and leisure and hospitality categories. When we look at the northern part of the state, we see a somewhat greater concentration of jobs in finance, particularly in Hudson County, in goods distribution, related to the ports, rail lines and trucking and warehousing activities that are prominent here, in pharmaceuticals manufacturing and research and development, and in the private education sector.\n\nThe area also has important links to New York City. For example, the data centers here in the state serve many of the city’s financial firms. In addition, a large number of residents, including myself, commute each day into the city. A smaller but still sizeable number of New Yorkers commute into this state.\n\nNow, how did the state fare during the downturn and how is the recovery proceeding? As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes of economic activity to help monitor the performance of the region.1 Based on our index, the downturn in activity in New Jersey began about the same time as the Great Recession was beginning nationwide—that is, around December 2007. While activity in the state is no longer declining, and there has been a slight pickup this year in the level of activity, to date there is still no sign that a strong recovery has taken hold. Quite frankly, this modest recovery in New Jersey contrasts with the relatively sturdy recovery in activity in New York City over the past 18 months.\n\nEmployment in our region also declined substantially during the Great Recession. Job losses in New Jersey totaled about 250,000—on par with the roughly 6 percent loss nationwide. The pattern of job losses here in northern New Jersey was very similar. In New York City, job losses were also large but somewhat less severe, with employment in the city down a little over 4 percent.\n\nThe jobs recovery in New Jersey to date has been sluggish. The private sector has seen moderate gains, with growth in some of the key sectors I mentioned earlier, particularly professional and business services, education and health, and leisure and hospitality. Businesses in these sectors, on balance, expanded jobs at a faster rate than in the nation. But the state continues to shed jobs in manufacturing and residential construction. Notably, overall employment in the state has been weighed down by declines in public sector employment. Like many states, New Jersey faced large projected state budget deficits during the downturn, and, as in many states, the adjustment to those gaps included job cuts through a reduction in state government jobs and cuts in state funding for local government programs.\n\nBecause the jobs recovery has been weak, there has been little progress in reducing unemployment. The unemployment rate among New Jersey residents currently stands at 9.5 percent, the same rate as a year ago, and slightly above the national rate.\n\nUnderneath the slow overall job growth, however, there is a considerable amount of churning in the labor market. Taking a closer look at the patterns of job gains and losses during the recession and recovery reveals some interesting facts about the labor market in New Jersey. Of particular interest is that job creation in the state and the nation since the recession ended has been closely balanced between hiring into industries that lost jobs lost during the recession and jobs in expanding industries. Thus, many unemployed workers may be returning to work without needing to retrain or look far afield from the job they lost. However, an equal number may need to search outside the industry they know best and this may require retraining in some cases. Thus, the need for job search assistance and training opportunities is likely to be high in New Jersey and the nation in the near term.2\n\nNow let’s look at the situation of New Jersey households. Here, too, there is room for improvement. While the median household income among New Jersey families is the second highest in the nation—at about $68,000 in 2009—about 9 percent of residents are in families with incomes below the poverty line. This rate compares favorably with the national rate of 13.6 percent, but varies by city across the state: here in Newark that share is 24 percent. Reducing poverty is a major challenge for policymakers. Local organizations like Newark Now are working hard to create greater economic independence for low- to moderate-income residents.\n\nMore broadly, how are the state’s families doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, the number of debt delinquencies soared and many families had to reduce their debt to more sustainable levels. The New York Fed keeps track of credit conditions in the region—including the average debt carried per person and whether they are current with their payments—using the special consumer credit panel we developed. The report for the second quarter of this year was just released on Monday.3\n\nFamilies in New Jersey are reducing their debt levels. As of the second quarter of this year, for those people with a credit report, average debt per person was about $60,400 down from $63,000 three years ago. But the crisis has taken its toll. Delinquency rates on the debt are high: 7.4 percent of all debt in the state is seriously delinquent, roughly the same rate as the nation. The comparable figure for the state just three years ago was 4.1 percent, so, like the nation, households in the state still appear to have a considerable way to go before they reach more comfortable debt levels.\n\nWhile there have been indications that home prices in the area have been firming in the past few months, the mortgage crisis continues to take a toll on New Jersey homeowners. As of March of this year, 10 percent of all borrowers in the state were either 90-plus days delinquent on their mortgages or their homes were in foreclosure—above the national rate of 7.7 percent. In Essex County, that rate had reached 16 percent, and in Newark it was 30 percent.\n\nIn our recent small business survey, which we conducted in May, we asked firms to report on their first quarter sales and their future outlook. The results were encouraging. Over two-thirds of firms told us they had stable or increased sales in Q1, up from 50 percent last year. When asked about their future outlook, while the majority of business owners, 56 percent, were neutral—many more said they were optimistic than pessimistic—37 percent compared with only 7 percent.\n\nConclusion\nThese debt and delinquency figures, together with the weak jobs picture, suggest that New Jersey faces a number of challenges. In the near term, the key issue will be to expand jobs and reduce unemployment. At this point it is difficult to say when the pace of recovery in the state will pick up, but several factors appear encouraging.\n\nA continued expansion of output and employment nationally would clearly help to expand activity and employment in a number of industries in the state, including professional and business services and the goods distribution industries. Also, the pace of contraction in public sector jobs in the state has slowed from the sharp declines that occurred last year, and has thus become less of a drag on job growth. Further, continued job growth in New York City should create opportunities for New Jersey residents, particularly in this part of the state.\n\nLonger term, one of the key challenges will be for the state to build upon and expand the human capital—by which I mean the education and skills—of its workforce. A region’s human capital determines a large part of its economic success. Even though it already has one of the most educated workforces in the country, New Jersey needs to continue to attract and train workers who can do a range of tasks that an advanced economy demands, such as start innovative firms, operate sophisticated capital equipment and design websites. In addition, a broad expansion of education and skills goes a long way to broaden participation in the economy to all residents of the state.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n_______________________________________\n1Regional Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators »\n2See, for additional discussion of this topic, William Dudley. 2011. \"Job Creation in the Region.\" Remarks at the Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing, New York City.

Further details on the discussion at the meeting will be available when the minutes are published in three weeks time. I will not comment on monetary policy any further today.\n\nFollowing the release of the FOMC's statement, market interest rates generally moved lower, which should help provide some additional support for economic activity and jobs. I would note, however, that conditions remain unsettled and the equity market in particular remains very volatile.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nTurning to our region, the economic recovery continues to be slow, although much of the region is performing reasonably well compared with the nation as a whole.\n\nTo frame our current situation, let me put this recession and recovery in the context of previous cycles. While this recession lasted longest, caused the deepest job losses, and has shown the slowest employment recovery of any post-war recession for the United States, it has not been the worst on record for the region.\n\nNew York State sustained fewer severe job losses than the nation during the recent recession—a reversal of historical patterns. Upstate New York, which has struggled with sluggish economic growth in recent decades, has proven particularly stable. In fact, while job losses were quite severe during previous recessions, that was not the case this time around. Similarly, New York City's job losses were more moderate than in previous recessions. New Jersey, on the other hand, saw steeper jobs losses than New York and a more tepid recovery. Puerto Rico endured a serious downturn lasting for over five years and is now just beginning to show signs of stabilization.\n\nWhy was the downturn in our region less severe than in many other parts of the country? Part of the reason is that the effects of the housing boom and bust on the region's economy were less consequential. Of course, we have seen declines in construction employment, losses of housing equity and people losing their homes. However, as in most mature regions, the housing market tends to be less influential here than it is in parts of the country where population growth has been more rapid. This is particularly true across much of Upstate New York, which experienced little in the way of a construction boom, home price growth or subprime mortgage penetration. While many areas in downstate New York and northern New Jersey did experience a more significant boom and bust, the changes there were not on the same scale as in hard-hit states, such as Nevada, Arizona or Florida.\n\nAlso, while the financial crisis was a key driving force behind the recession, employment in New York City was not affected nearly as much as some had predicted. Instead, it turned out that the finance sector held up better than expected.\n\nThe pace of recovery in our region, though somewhat stronger than at the national level, has nonetheless been disappointing. Growth has been weak and the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. This slow pace of recovery continued into the second quarter of 2011.\n\nAs attendees at previous regional press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes (CEIs) to help monitor the performance of the regional economy.\n\nBased on these measures, activity continued to expand in both New York State and New York City through June, with growth decelerating only modestly in the second quarter. By contrast, the recovery in New Jersey's economy has been more sluggish, though the index for New Jersey did pick up in 2011, which is an encouraging development.\n\nWe monitor Puerto Rico using an index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico. This index shows that the recession there, which started back in 2005—well before the mainland's—continues to be a challenge. The sharp decline in activity that persisted well into 2010 appears to have subsided. However, for some time now the island's economy has experienced a series of fits and starts. As such, the recent improvements will need to be sustained for a period of time before we'll know that they are breaking out of the pattern of mixed signals.\n\nThe performance of regional housing markets continues to influence the pace of recovery for local economies. Many of the places hit hardest by the housing bust have had a particularly weak recovery. Although housing markets remain fragile, an encouraging development here is that home prices appear to be firming across much of our region.\n\nTurning to jobs, data for the second quarter of 2011 indicate that businesses in the region, on balance, expanded employment at a more rapid pace than the nation. Still, the number of jobs being created each month is not enough to sustain a robust recovery.\n\nGiven the slow recovery of employment across much of the region, unemployment rates have edged up in most places. June's unemployment rate of 8.0 percent in New York State and 9.5 percent in New Jersey remain unacceptably high. While Puerto Rico's unemployment rate has fallen sharply in recent months, it is still particularly elevated at 14.9 percent.\n\nOne factor that remains a drag on overall employment growth in much of the region is the weakness of the public sector. As we have discussed at previous press briefings, our state and local governments continue to cut jobs more sharply than governments elsewhere. The recent exception to this trend is Puerto Rico. While the island sustained deep cuts in government jobs in 2009 and 2010, a recent increase in this sector was a key reason for Puerto Rico's relatively strong job growth in June. Overall, the weakness of the public sector continues to pose a risk to employment growth throughout our region going forward.\n\nAnother potentially troubling development for the region is the recent weakness in the financial sector. The finance industry, which had begun to recover late in the cycle, appeared to be showing signs of expansion when we last met. Since then, the industry has lost jobs in New York City and in New Jersey. This recent job loss has been particularly significant in the city's securities industry, which has shed nearly 4,000 jobs since April. More difficulties may lie ahead, as there have been many recent announcements of consolidations and layoffs in the region's banking sector.\n\nDespite weak labor market conditions overall, some sectors are enjoying robust growth in the region. In particular, the professional and business services and education and health sectors have continued to add jobs. These are high-value-added services that the region can export to other parts of the country and overseas, and provide jobs that tend to be performed by highly skilled people. As such, these sectors help support the broader economy and are likely to provide a source of growth for the region going forward.\n\nIt is difficult to say when the pace of job growth will pick up. As such, we will continue to monitor our region's economy and job situation closely.\n\nJob Creation in the Region\nThe fact that the recovery has been so sluggish might lead you to believe that no jobs are being created. However, this is not true. Beneath the high unemployment rate and overall slow job growth lies a considerable amount of job churning. Ongoing losses in some sectors are being offset by gains in other sectors. Today we look inside this churning for clues about how these changes are playing out in our region.\n\nHow do these changes in the labor market occur in the midst of a recession and recovery? First, many jobs are destroyed rapidly and few created as the economy weakens. This pattern is a defining characteristic of recessions. Afterward, during the recovery, employment rises as layoffs subside and firms begin to hire more. As this process plays out, some hiring will be in different industries from the layoffs. For example, some auto manufacturing jobs may never come back, while health care providers continue to add jobs.\n\nThus, employers are adding two sorts of jobs: new and old. Some jobs are in industries that continued to expand jobs throughout the recession and weak recovery, such as health care and education. We think of these as \"new jobs.\" These shifts in jobs are transformational. They are part of how our region adjusts to the evolution of technology, trade patterns and consumer preferences. In addition, now that we are in recovery, a broad set of industries are beginning to add jobs to replace earlier layoffs, such as administrative support and wholesale and retail trade. We think of these as \"old jobs\" because they restore their industries' share of jobs as economic activity picks up.\n\nThe two recessions before the current one saw an unusually high share of \"new job\" creation—in expanding industries, rather than rebounds of \"old jobs\"—compared with recessions in the 1970s and 1980s. Research done here at the New York Fed documents this for the nation and New York.1 The preponderance of transformational \"new job\" creation may have reflected the fact that the recessions of 1990-91 and 2001 were relatively shallow.\n\nIn addition, employers may be more likely to use recessions as an opportunity to make their operations more efficient. For example, employers are less likely to use temporary layoffs when they reduce staff during downturns and more likely to use temporary service agencies or outsource part of their operations when they need to expand.\n\nSo far, the current recession does not follow the pattern of the last two downturns. In New York and New Jersey as well as the nation, job creation during the recovery has been fairly evenly balanced between new jobs and old jobs—instead of heavily weighted toward new jobs as in the past two recessions. If this pattern holds, the recovery process could have a higher share of unemployed workers returning to jobs similar to those they left during the downturn. That could be promising for the adjustment process when the recovery gathers strength. There is some variation within the region, though, and the areas with a higher preponderance of new jobs are undergoing more rapid transformations that could position them well for growth going forward. As a result, these areas could face a particularly strong need to retrain and educate their workers.\n\nIn order to prepare our region to be as competitive as possible, policy makers, firms and workers need to accurately gauge which industries and jobs will grow fastest.\n\nGiven the trend over the past few decades, it is no surprise that the new jobs being created across the region and nation are most likely to be in industries with a high share of workers with a college education. Thus, education and worker training is likely to continue to be very important in maintaining the economic vitality of our region going forward.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, the recovery in our region continued at a slow pace during the second quarter of 2011. While overall job growth has been sluggish through the recovery, we find that there has been a great deal of job churning below the surface throughout our region. So far, this job churning is about evenly balanced between old and new job creation. The evidence to date is pretty clear that these new jobs, on balance, are in industries that employ workers with higher levels of skills and education.\n\nI will now ask Jaison Abel to provide additional details on the regional economy.\n\n_______________________________________\n1Groshen, Erica L. and Simon Potter. 2003. \"Has Structural Change Contributed to a Jobless Recovery?\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Current Issues in Economics and Finance 9, no. 8.\nGroshen, Erica L., Potter, Simon, and Rebecca J.

        "content": "As way of background, the U.S. experience conducting stress tests across an array of large banks came out of earlier work doing horizontal supervisory evaluations of banks. We found these exercises useful in identifying best practices and to determine where particular banks were deficient.\n\nIn talking about stress tests in the United States, there are three distinct sets of stress tests to consider:\n\nSCAP was a supervisory stress test, meaning that regulators specified the adverse scenario and determined the resulting loss and revenue estimates on a standardized basis drawing on information submitted by each firm. The CCAR process centered on bank-run stress tests in which regulators specified the scenario but required each bank to model the stress event itself.\n\nDodd-Frank mandates both supervisory stress tests and bank-run stress tests. We are still working out how we will do each of these types, but I expect that the SCAP and CCAR exercises will serve as models.\n\nToday I will focus on the SCAP and CCAR exercises. The first important point to make is that the purposes of the SCAP and CCAR are very different. Thus, these processes are conducted in very distinct ways. Turning first to the SCAP, its purpose was to restore confidence in large U.S. banks. The SCAP was designed to accomplish this mission by measuring how much capital these banks would need in a stress macroeconomic environment and then forcing these banks to either raise this capital from private sources or take mandatory convertible preferred equity from the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe key attributes of the SCAP include:\n\nIn contrast, while CCAR had an embedded stress test, the key attributes of the CCAR are quite different:\n\nOur evaluation of their capital planning processes and their requests to make capital disbursements was based mainly on three factors: 1) capital adequacy, 2) the quality of the capital planning process, and 3) the credibility of their plans to meet the Basel III capital requirements. Elements of a good planning process include: 1) description of risk appetite and capital targets, 2) robust internal controls, 3) incorporation of stress testing and stress-test results into the decisionmaking process, 4) good governance with respect to the role of senior management and the board of directors, and 5) well-articulated capital distribution policies that describe how decisions are made relative to the expectations of future outcomes.\n\nSome outside observers ask why supervisors would ever want to use bank-run stress tests rather than supervisory stress tests. The answer is that they serve different purposes. A bank-run stress test allows supervisors to evaluate how good each individual bank—and the banking system in general—is at assessing the risks it faces in a stress scenario and translating this into an appropriate amount of capital to set aside against these risks. Crucially, supervisors do not simply accept the results the banks produce in these tests—they evaluate both the adequacy of the numbers the banks produce and the processes they use to get there.\n\nIf all we ever did was run supervisory stress tests in which we instruct banks in detail how to perform the test, we would be in the position of a parent who shows his child how to solve each problem in her homework—and never discovers whether the child can do the work on her own or not.\n\nThe CCAR process differs from the SCAP in several key respects. First, in the CCAR there was no disclosure by the Fed of the stress test results. In CCAR, the focus was on assessing the sensitivity of the firms' own projections of capital under the baseline and stress scenarios to alternate assumptions and estimates. The results do not lend themselves to direct, apples-to-apples comparisons like the results in the SCAP. Second, the emphasis was on the capital planning process, not forcing the banks to raise capital to withstand a stress environment. Third, the CCAR was conducted at a different stage of the economic cycle. The issue was not capital raising as in the SCAP, but instead how fast should they continue to build their capital. What's prudent? This translated into an evaluation about the amount of capital that they could prudently pay out via dividends and/or share buybacks.\n\nFourth, with respect to the distribution requests, we were not calculating the amount of capital that the banks can distribute. Instead, we were making an \"up\" or \"down\" decision per their requests. Either we \"objected\" or we \"did not object.\" We want banks to have good capital planning processes and make intelligent decisions with respect to capital. We don't want to determine their capital actions or what their distributions should be. They need to be able to do this. Fifth, with respect to disclosure, this decision was left to individual firms. In some cases, banks disclosed whether we objected or not to their plans for distributions, while in other cases they simply announced their intention with regard to future capital distributions.\n\nSo what have been the lessons from our stress test exercises?\n\nOne key issue during the financial crisis was the unwillingness of banks to proactively raise capital so they would be better prepared to withstand a \"bad state of the world\" scenario should that transpire. Banks didn't want to do this for two reasons. First, capital raises might signal that they were, in fact, weak. Second, the capital raises would be dilutive. In particular, in many cases the expected share price would be higher without dilution even admitting the possibility of a \"bad state of the world\" scenario. The problem with this approach was that each individual bank's decision not to raise capital to protect against the \"bad state of the world\" scenario increased the likelihood of the \"bad state of the world\" scenario. There was an important externality. If a bank raises additional capital, it doesn't just make its own bank stronger, it also makes the entire banking system more stable. Yet it reaps only a portion of these benefits. This was the collective action problem that the SCAP was designed to remedy.\n\nPerhaps, I can best illustrate the problem via two figures. In Figure 1, banks have sufficient capital. The mean value of capital is well above zero, the distribution is narrow, and none of the distribution falls below zero—everyone believes the bank is solvent. In Figure 2, losses push the distribution of capital to the left and uncertainty about the value of the assets widens the distribution. Thus, unlike the case in Figure 1, a portion of the distribution falls below zero. The bank may be insolvent. Thus, the bank is likely to encounter funding difficulties.\n\nThe point of the SCAP was to push the probability distribution back to the right by adding capital—and to narrow it by creating more certainty about how much capital the banks need. By moving the banking industry collectively back to Figure 1 from Figure 2, the \"bad state of the world\" becomes less likely.\n\nIn the SCAP, we had to make a number of important decisions. These included:\n\nDisclosure allowed private-sector analysts to kick the tires and this was important. The day after the results were published, I remember that Bridgewater Associates—which had said the banks needed considerably more resources—published a paper evaluating the SCAP results. The banner headline was: \"We Agree.\" So this was important. However, I would note that it is important not to draw too strong a conclusion from just one episode. In the SCAP process, I also think it is important that we had some good luck. First, the banks' needs were not that great. What people didn't appreciate going in was that U.S. banks have strong revenue-generation capabilities: the banks had already set aside a large amount of reserves and taken large mark-to-market losses, and the banks had already bolstered their capital resources via capital raises and the sale of ancillary businesses. Second, the economy started to look a bit better in May at the time the SCAP results were released. This made the stress scenario more credible. Third, the capital markets were open to the banks. This was important because, as we saw, private capital was viewed as very much superior to Treasury mandatory convertible preferred shares. Fourth, although we made the correct decision to disclose, this was a difficult and close call. The fact that the loss experiences for the different asset classes varied across the banks helped to bolster the credibility of the results.\n\nGoing into the spring of 2009, there was a prevailing view that several of the largest banks would have to be nationalized. The problem was that on a mark-to-market basis, some of these banks were viewed as potentially insolvent. But the mark-to-market price declines overstated the problem because a significant portion of the decline in prices did not reflect expected losses but instead was due to a huge increase in the illiquidity premium. This was due to the fact that risky assets could no longer be financed easily on a leveraged basis. As long as banks could hold onto the assets, losses would shrink once the illiquidity premium narrowed back to a more typical level.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that the SCAP was an important turning point in the financial crisis. Confidence improved as banks raised capital mainly in the private markets.\n\nSo what were the lessons from the CCAR?\n\nI think here the lessons were mostly for the banks. There were negative consequences for banks that had inadequate capital planning capabilities or asked to make distributions that were too large relative to expected capital resources.\n\nFrom the CCAR, we concluded that all banks could and should be required to improve their capital planning processes, even those that received a decision of \"no objection\" to their proposed distributions. A detailed letter went to each firm outlining areas for improvement and we will be tracking the banks progress.\n\nCCAR is not a one-off event. It will be an ongoing process. It is designed to push banks to continue to upgrade their risk management and capital assessment processes.\n\nSo what are the implications of the U.S. experience? The context and purpose of any stress test should dictate the form it takes. Both the SCAP and CCAR models likely have some lessons for other such exercises, but in circumstances of market stress, the SCAP model is more relevant than the CCAR model. In such episodes, our experience suggests:\n\nOne tricky issue is how to treat sovereign debt exposures. This was not an issue in the U.S. SCAP exercise. This is difficult because there is a complex interaction between fiscal soundness and bank soundness, which is very hard to model. This illustrates a wider point—that all situations are importantly distinct and that while we can all learn from each others' experiences in this field, there is no one-size-fits-all approach."

        "content": "Good morning. I am pleased to be in Brooklyn to speak to you and meet with the leadership of New York City's most populous borough.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, as we wound down our emergency meetings, I asked my staff to develop an energetic outreach program so that I could visit the different parts of my district. Over time, I plan to visit all parts of the region.\n\nEach trip gives me a chance to deepen relationships with the people whom I represent. As you may know, the New York Fed's district includes New York State; twelve counties of northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In May, I travelled through the mid-Hudson Valley to meet with community leaders, businesses, academics, bankers and elected officials in Poughkeepsie, Middletown, Fishkill and Newburgh. Even though these are large towns, Brooklyn—with over 2.5 million residents in 2010—has many more people than all four of them combined.\n\nBrooklyn is important to me not just because it is an important part of the New York Fed's district, but also because I have lots of personal attachments. My grandfather served as the minister of a church on Flatbush Avenue, so my father was raised in Brooklyn. As an adult, I lived in Brooklyn myself for six years. We moved out to the suburbs only so that my wife—who is an only child—and I could be helpful to her parents.\n\nOf course, we're meeting here today not only because of my personal ties.\n\nToday I will meet with a wide range of people to talk about what I do. I will also hear firsthand about the economic and financial issues important to you in Brooklyn. These conversations help me to represent all my constituents in my work at the Fed. I also look forward to visiting the Navy Yard and meeting with Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and several new businesses.\n\nI thank the Chamber for inviting me to speak here in Brooklyn. This morning I will talk about economic conditions in the nation and the region, paying particular attention to how the recession has affected the labor market here. Looking at jobs, Brooklyn's employers have weathered the recession better than those in many parts of the region and country. However, the unemployment rate remains too high, as does the level of stress among some homeowners here.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed\nBy way of introduction, let me start by summarizing what the New York Fed is, what we do, and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, which was created by Congress in 1913 to manage the supply of money in the economy. The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. The New York Fed is one of these Reserve Banks.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary policy—such as whether to adjust interest rates—in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an objective for us: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This goal is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two parts: high employment, and low, stable inflation. In order to promote this objective, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation. What do the terms stable inflation and financial stability mean? By stable inflation we mean keeping the rate of inflation low and fairly steady over the months. By financial stability, we mean ensuring that financial institutions have sufficient capital and are managed responsibly, so that we need not worry that the failure of one large firm will trigger a cascade of other firm failures with more job losses.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks, decides how to best achieve the objective set by Congress. We meet in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to vote on whether to change some key interest rates and, if so, by how much. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman of the FOMC. At these meetings, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for the economy.\n\nFor these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. My visit to Brooklyn today is a part of these regional activities, in which I learn first-hand about the economic and financial conditions important to you.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy. This means that at the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities in order to change short-term interest rates. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire® the conduit for large money transfers between banks. In addition, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nAt the regional level, we continually track economic conditions in our District with the help of a number of tools that we have created for this purpose. For example, to fill a void in current measures of economic output, my staff produces monthly economic indicators that are similar in concept to gross domestic product (or GDP) measures for New York State and New York City. We also have initiated a consumer credit panel so that we can monitor local household credit conditions.\n\nFurthermore, we have a new quarterly survey to track credit and financing issues for small businesses, which create a lot of jobs. Before I go further, I want to thank the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the Myrtle Avenue Revitalization Program, the Fulton Business Improvement District and Kings County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and other members of Brooklyn's vibrant business community, who assisted us with this survey. More than 80 businesses responded from Brooklyn. The survey results will be published early this summer and, of course, we will share the results with you and post them on our website. If you are not already part of the survey, I invite you to give your business card to my staff. We will add you to our survey universe, so that it can reflect your views, too.\n\nTo share the information that we gather and produce about our diverse district, we have created a rich website with localized current data and maps on conditions in the region. I invite you to visit us at newyorkfed.org to explore the highly detailed information on small business, credit and housing conditions that we provide.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington and at other agencies in the United States and abroad to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. As regulators, we have made progress, for instance, in crafting tougher capital rules for the biggest banks.\n\nYet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves. We must learn from the economic catastrophe of the past few years so that the financial system is able to perform its essential role in supporting economic activity without being a source of instability for the economy as a whole.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nNow, what are the outlook and risks for economic activity, employment and inflation in the nation?\n\nSince the recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a modest pace. Real GDP—that's the economic output of the country—increased 2.8 percent between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010. This growth was sufficient to lead to a modest one-half percentage point decline in the unemployment rate over the course of 2010.\n\nHowever, economic growth so far this year has been disappointing. Real GDP in the first quarter of 2011 grew at a tepid 1.8 percent annual rate, and the available data suggest that growth in the current quarter will not be much better.\n\nA major factor behind this slowdown is that real consumption growth (that is, spending on goods and services adjusted for price increases) has been slower than in the last quarter of 2010. This occurred, in part, because higher gasoline and food prices reduced the income that households could spend on other purchases. High energy prices also contributed to lower consumer confidence, which may have had an independent negative effect on consumer spending.\n\nAs noted, a number of economic indicators suggest that economic growth in the second quarter will also be subpar. Manufacturing production fell in April. Most business survey indicators, including the New York Fed's own Empire State Manufacturing Survey, also have declined recently, although most continue to signal some growth. The housing market remains very weak and home prices fell in early 2011. After a notable improvement earlier in the year, the labor market showed more softness recently: more workers filed for unemployment insurance in the past few weeks, firms added fewer jobs on net in May, and unemployment inched up in April and May.\n\nIn part, this softness is related to factors that I expect will prove transitory. These factors include the rapid rise in gas and food prices that I noted earlier, supply disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan, and severe weather and flooding in parts of the United States. All three suggest that the soft patch may not persist. However, we continue to monitor the data for signs of more persistent weakness, whether related to the interaction of housing and consumption or some other factor.\n\nAnother reason to expect the economy to recover from this soft patch is that many fundamentals have improved since last year. In particular:\n\nConsequently, I anticipate that economic growth will pick up enough in the second half of 2011 to sustain a moderate economic recovery. Still, the pace of recovery probably will be painfully slow for the many unemployed and underemployed workers. Even if the economy added 300,000 jobs per month over the next year and a half, we would likely still have considerable labor market slack at the end of 2012.\n\nEven though I expect a moderate economic recovery to be sustained, the recent disappointing data suggest that downside risks to the outlook have increased. Let me list some of them for you:\n\nAlthough these issues bear watching, I still believe that they remain risks rather than the most likely outcomes.\n\nWith respect to inflation, after a period when inflation was lower than the Fed would like to see, headline inflation (on a yearly basis) has risen somewhat above desired levels. The recent rise in commodity prices is likely to push up headline inflation further in coming months. It is noteworthy, however, that the spike in oil and food prices over the past year has not spilled over much to the prices of other goods and services. Furthermore, commodity prices have dipped in the recent weeks.\n\nThus, most measures of underlying inflation trends—including core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices)—remain below levels consistent with our mandate for price stability.\n\nGoing forward, futures markets do not signal that investors expect commodity prices to rise rapidly from current levels. Provided these prices stop rising rapidly (or indeed retreat further), I would expect headline inflation to decline to a level closer to our longer-run objectives. While this process plays out, however, it is critical that we ensure that inflation expectations do not become unmoored. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin to raise their expectations of inflation. At this point, measures of inflation expectations overall remain well within the range of recent years—and some measures have moved down significantly in recent weeks.\n\nEconomists at the New York Fed have examined inflation expectations using a unique survey that we sponsor. As reported in a recent post on our new Liberty Street Economics blog, they find no evidence to suggest that a wage-price inflation spiral is getting underway. However, we continue to monitor expectations for medium-term inflation very closely.\n\nTo sum up, despite the recent soft patch, economic conditions have improved in the past year. I expect a moderate recovery to continue. However, we still have a considerable way to go to meet the Fed's dual mandate of full employment and price stability.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nSo, how is our region doing? As I mentioned a moment ago, the New York Fed produces economic indicators to help monitor the performance of the region. Based on these measures, the downturn in economic activity in New York City ended in November of 2009. Since then, New York City's economy has been on the mend, and our numbers for April show that the recovery continues at a healthy clip.\n\nLet me turn specifically to employment trends in the region. In particular, I want to describe our region's experience during the recession and recovery. To put this in context, it's important to relate our region's downturn to the nation's experience.\n\nNationally, the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, has been the deepest economic downturn since World War II. When employment finally bottomed out in February 2010—seven months after the official end of the recession—the country had lost almost 9 million jobs—a 6 percent drop—and the unemployment rate had more than doubled. In addition to the millions of people who lost their jobs, many more saw their hours or income cut, and the duration of unemployment for jobless workers reached a historical high. For many families, this distress was compounded by losses of wealth from declining home prices. Since that low point of employment, job creation has resumed, albeit at a slower pace than we would like, and unemployment has fallen by about a percentage point.\n\nAs in other parts of the country, employment in our region declined substantially during the recession. However, employment in New York City and across much of New York State declined less severely than the nation. Both the state and city lost less than 4 percent of their jobs. Part of the reason for the more moderate decline in jobs in New York during the recession was a less pronounced boom-bust housing cycle. Indeed, as a percentage, the city lost fewer jobs during this recession than it did during either of the last two downturns.\n\nNow, as in the nation, a labor market recovery has begun across much of the region. Over the past year, New York State has added roughly 100,000 private-sector jobs. Within the state, the recovery has been somewhat uneven. New York City has been gaining jobs for more than a year now—at roughly the same pace as the nation—and it has recovered about half of the jobs lost during the downturn.\n\nConditions in Brooklyn\nContinuing to drill down geographically, let me talk in more detail about conditions here in Brooklyn—recognizing that Brooklyn is a big city and conditions vary neighborhood by neighborhood.\n\nAs you know, if Brooklyn were a city it would rank as the fourth largest in the nation. The borough's population is also amazingly diverse. Over 36 percent of those currently residing in the borough were born abroad—and that doesn't even include second generation immigrants. Significant numbers of residents of the borough were born in the Caribbean Islands, China, Mexico, Ukraine and Russia.\n\nBrooklyn has a vibrant business community: almost a half-million jobs are located in the borough. Almost two out of every five jobs are found in the health care and social assistance sector, and these jobs represent a wide range of providers including hospitals, outpatient centers, visiting nurses and child care employees. The borough is also home to jobs in a diverse set of other industries, including apparel manufacturing, retail trade, and professional services, not to mention a number of public and private colleges.\n\nWhere do Brooklyn residents work? Many Brooklynites work in businesses within the borough, in the sectors that I just mentioned. However, the majority commute to work, primarily in Manhattan (as I did when I lived here), but also in other boroughs. Thus, the improving job markets in the city and the region will also help Brooklyn residents.\n\nNow, how did the borough fare during the recent downturn and how is the recovery proceeding? I will answer this by looking at jobs and at housing and credit conditions.\n\nWith regard to jobs, the news is mixed. On the positive side, Brooklyn employers held their own during the 2008-09 downturn and have bounced back well. From peak to trough, the number of jobs located in Brooklyn shrank by 1 percent, which was not nearly as steep as in New York City as a whole, and much less severe than the national average.\n\nThe recovery in jobs in Brooklyn is proceeding at a healthy pace. By early 2010, employment in Brooklyn had recouped all its losses and was setting new highs.\n\nEncouragingly, job growth was brisk through the third quarter of 2010—the latest date for which we have hard figures. By then, overall employment was up by 5 percent from its low point in early 2009. This jobs recovery is being led by an ongoing expansion in healthcare, which was little affected by the downturn, as well as sizeable gains in the leisure and hospitality, retail, and professional and business services sectors.\n\nOn the negative side, unemployment for those who live in Brooklyn remains very high. The seeming disconnect between the healthy jobs picture that I just described and the high rate of joblessness is largely explained by the majority of Brooklynites who commute to work. The severe layoffs in Manhattan and other boroughs during the downturn cost many Brooklyn residents their jobs. Thus, joblessness among residents of Brooklyn is still running a little over 9 percent—above the citywide average and slightly above the national rate. As in much of the region and the nation, jobless rates have retreated somewhat but still remain stubbornly high.\n\nAlso, there is plenty of room for improvement when one focuses on the situation of Brooklyn households.\n\nIn 2010, almost a fifth of families in Brooklyn had incomes below the poverty level, about twice as high as the national rate. In addition, many self-employed workers in areas such as real estate sustained big hits to their income during the downturn.\n\nLike the nation, Brooklyn experienced a housing price boom and bust. However, Brooklyn is showing signs of quicker recovery than the nation. From 2000 to 2007, average home prices in the borough increased about 2½ times, compared with a doubling in prices at the national level. During the housing bust, prices here fell steeply—by 15 percent—but not as much as the 25 percent national drop. Since then, however, local home prices have begun to recover, even as they have fallen to new lows nationally. Nevertheless, as of March of this year, 12 percent of Brooklyn's homeowners are seriously delinquent on their mortgages. That is high compared with the 8 percent national rate.\n\nOf course, unlike much of the nation, most Brooklynites rent their homes, rather than own them. This tendency to rent may be one reason that Brooklyn's economy—like New York City's more generally—was not hit quite as hard by the housing downturn and ensuing recession. Yet, many renters, like owners, are still experiencing financial stress from job and income losses.\n\nMore broadly, how are Brooklyn's families doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, debt delinquencies soared and many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to a sustainable level. We keep track of the credit conditions in the region—including the average debt that people carry and whether they are current with their payments—using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Consumer Credit Panel.\n\nIn Brooklyn, although delinquencies remain very high, debt levels and delinquencies continue to fall. The amount of debt carried per person with a credit report in the borough is now down by 8 percent from its peak level in late 2008, and is lower than average for New York State. As of the first quarter of this year, debt per person was continuing to fall modestly.\n\nNevertheless, the mortgage crisis has taken a heavy toll on Brooklyn's homeowners. In terms of consumer debt, seriously delinquent debt (including mortgages) quadrupled from 2005 to 2009, reaching nearly double the statewide rate. As of the first quarter of 2011, this delinquency rate has declined modestly. Yet, delinquencies in Brooklyn remain far higher than the rate in the rest of New York State and the nation. These patterns suggest that Brooklyn's households have made some progress on restoring their balance sheets to health, but still are likely to have a considerable ways to go before they complete the process.\n\nThus, Brooklyn was affected by the recession, but less so than the nation and even somewhat less so than other parts of the city. With prospects for the national economy improving, the outlook for Brooklyn's diverse economy and labor force, and New York City's as a whole is brightening as well. Nevertheless, while a jobs recovery appears underway, unemployment and poverty remain high and signs of stress clearly remain in household finance.\n\nIn the near-term, the regional economy, and indeed the economy of the entire state, faces a number of challenges. Among them is the need to address the large state budget gap. New York is not alone in having seen its tax revenue decline as the economy weakened and, thus, faces hard choices. As I mentioned, state and local government employment has already weakened in many areas. Going forward, further contraction in this sector continues to pose some risks to the recovery.\n\nDespite these issues, in our recent survey, nearly 40 percent of Brooklyn small businesses reported an increase in their sales during the first quarter of 2011. In addition, when asked about their business outlook, over two-thirds of Brooklyn respondents responded positively, saying that the outlook for their business was fair to very good. In fact, small businesses in Brooklyn were the most optimistic among the five boroughs of New York City.\n\nLonger term, one of the key challenges for this region is to ensure that it trains and attracts a highly skilled workforce that can meet the needs of innovative and rapidly changing firms. A region's human capital—that is, the skills and education of its work force—determines a large part of its economic success and resiliency. The education and research taking place in local colleges and universities, such as Brooklyn College and the Polytechnic Institute of New York, directly helps to build those skills and to sustain economic growth.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the national economy experienced a soft patch in activity during the first quarter of 2011 that has spilled over into the beginning of the second quarter. Nevertheless, the recovery in much of the region continued at a good pace.\n\nIt is very encouraging that Brooklyn's employers have already added back enough jobs to replace all those lost during the recession, and then some. The continued expansion of employment across the nation should also support economic activity and jobs in Brooklyn.\n\nYet the regional recovery is still far complete. Brooklyn's households continue to have relatively high delinquency rates on their mortgage and other debt, suggesting continued stress for many of its residents. Furthermore, despite recent improvements, both nationally and in Brooklyn, unemployment remains unacceptably high.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now be happy to answer some questions."

        "title": "U.S. Economic Policy in a Global Context",
        "content": "In this discussion I will highlight how the recent financial crisis and its aftermath have accelerated the shift in the relative importance of the so-called developed and emerging market economies.\n\nI will then discuss how the global economic system needs to adapt in light of the growing relative importance of the EMEs in the global economy. I will explore the implications of these changes for U.S. economic policy and I will also touch on some of the challenges the EMEs face as they seek to consolidate their gains and sustain their success.\n\nI will argue that the developed countries and the EMEs need to adjust in mutually supportive ways. In my view, the current relationship between the EMEs and the United States is not sustainable for either side. Not only has an unusually wide divergence in cyclical positions opened up that creates immediate strains, but there are also important structural imbalances that have developed that must be addressed.\n\nI will close by turning my attention to what can be done to address these cyclical and secular challenges. Although I will discuss the role of U.S. monetary policy in this context, I will also discuss what other steps can be taken to strengthen the relationship and make it more sustainable.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOver the past few decades, the most salient feature of the global economy has been the growing importance of the emerging market economies and the ever-deepening integration of these economies into the global economic system. A shift toward more market-based and outwardly oriented development on the part of the EMEs has enabled hundreds of millions of people across the emerging world to become integrated into the global economy for the first time. The outcome has been a rapid rise in living standards and a reduction in poverty on a scale that is without precedent in human history.\n\nThese changes have been most evident in China, with a historic transformation that began with the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping and continues to this day. But the EME story is much broader than China. Over the past decade,1 excluding China, the emerging world has grown at a 4.7 percent annual rate— its fastest rate on record.\n\nThe EME world is, of course, not monolithic. There are the dynamic large economies, EMEs that are broadly complementary to them, and some countries that are both less complementary and less competitive than their peers. Happily, for the most part, EME success is proving mutually reinforcing, as witnessed by growing intra-EME trade.\n\nAs EME output has grown rapidly, their share of the global economy has increased markedly. EMEs now account for 38 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), up from 23 percent in 1990. And it is the EMEs, not the developed economies, that have been the engine of global growth in recent years. For example, during the 2000s, EME growth accounted for 59 percent of global growth, up from 33 percent and 25 percent, respectively, in the two preceding decades.\n\nBy other measures, the EMEs have been even more important. For example, EME growth has been very commodity intensive. Thus, while China is still only two-fifths the size of the United States in GDP terms, it dwarfs the United States in terms of its demand for some key commodities.\n\nThe growth momentum among the EMEs is the result of years of tough choices and sound decisionmaking across the emerging world. Policymakers learned from the mistakes of past crises and capitalized on globalization and technological change. However, while the rise of the EMEs is due mainly to the efforts of the EMEs themselves, the reaction of the developed countries in maintaining an open global trading system and resisting calls for protectionism has also been essential.\n\nEven before the financial crisis, the sustained dynamism of the emerging economies was bringing about a profound shift in the role of the EMEs within the global economy. The traditional distinction between the industrialized \"core\" of the system and the emerging \"periphery\" was becoming harder to justify as an analytical construct—still less an organizing framework for policy—as the periphery took on more weight and became a much more important driver of global economic developments.\n\nHowever, the crisis and its aftermath accelerated this transition. Although many emerging market economies contracted sharply following the peak of the financial crisis in late 2008, economic activity in the EMEs has since rebounded powerfully. In contrast, the recovery for the developed economies has been anemic. Economic output for the BRICs this year will be about 31 percent higher than it was in 2007; for the G7 just 1 percent higher.2\n\nThe rapid rebound of the EMEs occurred mainly because the locus of the financial crisis was elsewhere and that helped limit the damage to their financial system and balance sheets. But many EMEs also recovered quickly because they had the capacity and credibility to pursue countercyclical policies in response to large external shocks to aggregate demand for the first time.\n\nOn many fiscal metrics, some economies in the emerging world now look in better shape than many of those in the advanced world. This challenges the traditional distinction between developed country and emerging market sovereign creditworthiness. Where the developed world still stands apart is in the quality of its institutions, legal and policy frameworks, and the sophistication of its technologies and markets. But even here the gap is narrowing.\n\nThe story of the EMEs has generally been an extraordinarily positive one for the world as hundreds of millions of people have lifted themselves out of poverty.\n\nNevertheless, even before the crisis, it was evident that the relationship between developed and emerging economies was becoming strained and needed to be adjusted; the status quo would clearly be unsustainable. Consider, for example, the economic relationships between the United States and China that prevailed over the past decade or so.\n\nSome experts have summarized the arrangements as follows. The United States bought Chinese exports at low prices, which bolstered U.S. living standards and held down U.S. inflation. The United States did not take extreme steps to try to force China to revalue the renminbi upward against the dollar, and China, in turn, invested its trade surplus and capital inflows into U.S. Treasuries in order to keep the renminbi from appreciating too rapidly. The U.S. terms of trade improved as the cost of imported goods dropped, and U.S. interest rates stayed relatively low as China recycled its trade surpluses back into U.S. financial assets. For China, the benefits included strong economic growth, technology transfer and the creation of many manufacturing jobs. These developments, in turn, helped foster rising living standards and political stability in China.\n\nThese outcomes were by no means all the result of a deliberate grand strategy. But I think this is a reasonable, albeit overly simplistic, description of what happened.\n\nAlthough the pre-crisis arrangements worked reasonably well for a while, the flaws became increasingly evident over time. Looked at from the lens of the developed world, the combination of rapid gains in production capacity and relatively repressed consumption in the EME world helped foster a global deficiency of demand relative to supply. In these circumstances, the United States and many other industrialized economies had to sustain domestic demand at elevated levels in order to achieve \"full employment\" and prevent deflation.\n\nFor the United States, the consequence was elevated consumption facilitated by asset price inflation, easy underwriting standards for credit and structural budget deficits. Of course, this particular outcome was not preordained or caused by the EMEs. There were multiple combinations of domestic demand consistent with full employment in the United States during the pre-crisis period. For example, if the United States had adopted different policies, it might have shifted the composition of growth toward more business investment and less consumption and housing. But in a disinflationary global environment amid chronic EME trade surpluses, the United States could not achieve a high level of employment with a high level of national saving.\n\nLooked at from the lens of the emerging world, sustained consumption demand in developed nations induced the EMEs to continue to emphasize investment and exports. This meant that still poor populations did not reap the full benefit of their labors in the form of increases in real income and consumption commensurate with the gains achieved in productivity and output.\n\nAlso, this system led, in many cases, to poor returns to EME savers. This resulted, in part, from the cost of sterilizing reserves accumulated in the process of managing exchange rates and the use of the banking system as a tool of industrial policy.\n\nWhile it is tempting to draw a line of causation from actions in one part of the global system to the other, this is overly simplistic. Rather, we have to think of the global economy as a single system, with outcomes based simultaneously on all the choices and preferences throughout the system. What is new is that the so-called periphery is now weighty enough to have a large impact on the pattern of economic activity in the core, as well as vice versa.\n\nAlthough the outcomes were not caused by currency arrangements per se, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that regimes with limited exchange rate flexibility linked to the dollar at undervalued exchange rates frustrated one channel through which relative prices might otherwise have adjusted in a way to induce more balanced global growth.\n\nIt is clear that the pre-crisis formula for global growth was not sustainable. This is obvious in the case of industrialized nations where private consumption and fiscal deficits reached unsustainable levels and needed to be cut back.\n\nLess obviously, this is also the case for EMEs, as growth strategies that rely on excessive consumption elsewhere in the system are no longer viable. Put simply, we now have a problem of arithmetic—particularly for China as the largest and most dynamic EME.\n\nAs China becomes increasingly weighty in the global economy, it will not be able to sustain export growth in the high teens annually3 in a world that is growing (ex China) at less than 4 percent a year on average. For China, the business fixed investment side of the ledger also appears unsustainably high as a share of GDP. In this context, China's ongoing rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which carries real economic costs, seems less a sign of strength than an indication of how difficult it is to shift to a different growth path.\n\nThe financial crisis did not cause the old growth patterns to become unsustainable. They already were. But its aftermath forces us to confront the need for adjustment with greater urgency, due to the added imposition of extreme cyclical pressures on what were already unsustainable structural relationships.\n\nThere are now two additional dimensions to the problem: (1) the stress created by exchange rate regimes that link the monetary conditions of economies at very different stages in the business cycle, and (2) the need for far-reaching fiscal adjustment in the crisis-hit economies of the developed world in the coming years.\n\nAgain, to simplify, take the case of the United States and China. The Chinese economy is experiencing the pressures of rapid economic growth that threaten to lead to overheating. Chinese wages—especially in the coastal regions are rising rapidly and consumer prices, on a year-over-year basis, are rising at about a 5 percent annual rate. In contrast, U.S. inflation is considerably lower, growth is subdued, and the United States is still 7 million jobs short of the peak reached in 2007.\n\nAn extreme cyclical imbalance exists between the EME world and the United States. The monetary policy appropriate for the United States is increasingly inappropriate for the vast majority of EMEs and vice versa. This creates for EME authorities a dilemma that cannot be resolved entirely via macro-prudential regulatory policies, regardless of their merit.\n\nAn EME faces the choice: let its currency appreciate more rapidly and risk losing competitiveness in international markets, or restrain the rise in its currency through intervention and risk inflation. The steps required to mitigate the inflation risk through sterilization can involve big fiscal costs.4 Neither option is attractive, though the former strategy of currency appreciation is much less problematic if other EMEs are acting in a similar manner.\n\nMeanwhile, we all have to bear in mind that current circumstances put stress on the support for open global markets in the developed world.\n\nOn the U.S. side, the recovery remains distinctly subpar in spite of aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus. On the monetary policy front, short-term rates remain near zero and the Federal Reserve is just about to complete its $600 billion Treasury purchase program. On the fiscal policy front, the U.S. government has engaged in large stimulus program. This supported demand and employment while the private sector shifted its saving balance into surplus in an effort to repair balance sheets.\n\nHowever, the large size of the fiscal deficit and the rapid increase in the country's federal debt-to-GDP ratio means that this is not sustainable for much longer.\n\nUltimately, the composition of economic activity in the United States needs to be rebalanced. There are two issues here. First, the consumption share of GDP may still be too high. Second, the need for U.S. fiscal consolidation implies that there will have to be offsetting increases in investment and the U.S. trade balance as the recovery proceeds.\n\nTo illustrate this second point consider the following accounting identity:\nThe public sector balance + the private sector balance = the current account balance\n\nRight now the identity holds as roughly:\n-10 percent of GDP public sector balance + 7 percent of GDP private sector balance = -3 percent of GDP current account balance.5 \n\nIf the public sector balance must over time move from around -10 percent to around -3 percent to stabilize the federal debt-to-GDP ratio at tolerable levels, then the private sector balance and the current account balance must move by roughly 7 percentage points of GDP to take up the slack.\n\nAssuming that the consumption share of GDP still needs to fall over the medium term, the adjustment in the U.S. private balance will have to occur primarily in terms of rising residential or business fixed investment.\n\nThere does seem to be room for business investment to expand significantly when firms become more confident in the economic outlook, provided that the United States remains a competitive location for investment. But residential investment is unlikely to climb very much for some time given the chronic overhang of unsold homes.\n\nIf these two sectors cannot take up all the slack created by necessary fiscal retrenchment in the years ahead—as seems likely—then the U.S. trade balance will need to improve as well. This implies that EMEs will no longer be able to rely on expanding U.S. demand as a key driver of their own economic growth.\n\nOf course, this is not just an issue of U.S. and EME adjustment. Adjustments will be required in other industrialized countries, too—and not just the deficit countries. There has to be recognition on all sides that global rebalancing in terms of the composition of activity and growth and in terms of global capital flows is necessary.\n\nFortunately, this is not a zero-sum game: it is in the interests of all sides. However, it is still very difficult to accomplish because it is not in the short-term interests of some interest groups in many nations. This means that there are likely to be considerable political obstacles to adjustment in many parts of the global economy.\n\nIn this process, the United States needs to show leadership in contributing to a smooth adjustment. In this regard, I think there are a number of actions that the United States can take—unilaterally and in its own interest—that will make this rebalancing process easier and less prone to disruption.\n\nAs discussed earlier, no issue is more important than a credible commitment for getting our fiscal house in order, but at a pace that does not forestall a sustained economic recovery. What is needed here is fiscal consolidation that begins slowly, builds over time to substantial magnitude, and is difficult to dismantle—i.e., it requires the commitment of both political parties. The decision of how big the U.S. government should be and what functions it should perform is a political decision that I leave to the voters and our legislators. However, as a nation we need to acknowledge that we must be willing to pay for whatever government services and transfers we want to have. We should not assume that an excess of global savings will always be available to easily finance our public deficits.\n\nThe choice of fiscal sustainability is not a political one, it is an economic one and if we do not act voluntarily and preemptively, the market will inevitably force the outcome later—most likely in a much more difficult and messy fashion.\n\nMoreover, we must recognize that the rest of the world is closely monitoring our ability as a nation to come to grips with our long-term fiscal challenges, and to pay our debts when they come due. This is an important litmus test of our credibility and ability to exercise global economic leadership.\n\nBut the challenges extend far beyond fiscal policy. We, as a nation, have to take steps that facilitate the needed structural adjustment of U.S. economic activity that will position us to thrive in the next chapter of global economic transformation. We need to make sure the next business cycle will be more sustainable than the last, which was built on an unstable foundation of asset price gains, easy credit and outsized financial-sector profits.\n\nThis will require a shift in orientation from consumption to export and investment-led growth. As EMEs have shown us, comparative advantage and global competitiveness are not inevitable consequences of factor endowments—they are the result of the choices we make as nations.\n\nThere are no easy answers or quick-fix solutions. But in this regard, ensuring broad access to educational opportunity and improving opportunities for people to retool their skills mid-career so they can compete in a rapidly evolving global economy are important.\n\nSo too is ensuring that regulation is calibrated such that it achieves public policy goals in the most efficient manner possible, with the least compliance costs and unnecessary delays. A continued commitment to open markets and free trade is essential. Enlightened immigration policies can play a role—making sure that U.S. companies doing business here in the United States can augment the skill sets of workers here with those attracted from abroad.\n\nTax reform, energy policy, and housing policy also have crucial roles to play—as does financial reform, a subject to which I will return later in the speech.\n\nLeveraging the comparative advantage that the United States has in higher education also makes sense. This should include encouraging foreign students to come here to study. Also, closer partnerships between universities and business could leverage the technological discoveries and advances that occur in university research so that the benefits accrue to a greater degree to U.S. firms and workers.\n\nThese are fundamentally structural issues—not cyclical issues. They cannot be tackled primarily through monetary policy. Instead, monetary policy is mainly a tool for stabilizing the macroeconomy and keeping inflation expectations well-anchored.\n\nNevertheless, monetary policy has an important role in supporting the transitions that need to take place, consistent with our dual mandate of full employment and price stability. As we do so, we must take international developments fully into account.\n\nThe integration of the EMEs into the global economy has been associated with some major shifts in relative prices. For a number of years, the United States and other industrialized nations benefited from disinflation in manufactured goods produced in EMEs. This shift in relative prices—a positive terms of trade gain—helped contain inflation.\n\nMore recently, the disinflationary tailwind in traded manufactured goods imported from China may have come to an end, at least for a period, as more of the increase in productivity there is captured in wage gains.\n\nMeanwhile, growing prosperity and urbanization in highly populous countries such as China and India has been the principal driver of a major, multiyear upward shift in the relative price of commodities. This move—a negative terms of trade hit for the United States—has pushed up the overall rate of inflation, at least temporarily.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that commodity prices will not continue to increase at the explosive rate of recent months. Households and businesses will adjust their activities in response to higher prices, and there will be a supply response to higher prices that will gradually build over time.\n\nIn any event, a shift in relative prices, even if spread out over a number of years, should not to be confused with the onset of an ongoing inflation problem. But the uncertain future path of commodity prices does make the task of the central banker harder.\n\nIt is the job of central bankers to ensure that changes in relative prices do not infect the general trend in prices. In the United States —unlike in many EMEs that are appropriately tightening policy—a large amount of slack and low unit labor cost increases provide a disinflationary counterbalance to commodity price gains. Of course, as I noted in a speech earlier this year, we will have to monitor inflation expectations closely to ensure that they do not become unanchored.\n\nWe also need to keep a close eye on the degree to which unit labor cost increases in EMEs and real exchange rate appreciation abroad are passed through into U.S. import prices and consumer inflation. Although the historic evidence is that pass-through has been limited in the United States, we cannot be complacent about this.\n\nMeanwhile, we have to recognize that monetary policy works somewhat differently in a world in which a large share of global GDP is part of a de facto dollar block. In particular, we must take into account the feedback loops this creates—how U.S. monetary policy influences financial conditions elsewhere and, how these changes, in turn, influence activity and prices in the United States.\n\nAt the same time, other nations should recognize that we cannot and do not seek to make monetary policy for the world. Responsibility for ensuring that financial conditions in other nations are appropriate for their own circumstances appropriately lies with their national authorities, and they have a wide range of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate and other policy tools available for this purpose.\n\nI do not see any fundamental conflict between U.S. domestic economic objectives and the interests of the global system as a whole. But the existing system of global currency and monetary arrangements does render effective pursuit of these objectives more difficult.\n\nI believe that we would all be better off if the system evolved toward more flexible exchange rates and greater monetary independence in the EME world.\n\nNotwithstanding this, we can and do pursue our monetary policy objectives in the United States ever mindful of how our policy choices affect other parts of the global economic system, recognizing that these impacts will, in turn, influence U.S. economic outcomes.\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, pursuing the dual mandate of full employment and price stability allows us to make an important contribution to global stability and growth. Ensuring low and stable inflation preserves the purchasing power of the dollar and sustains its attractiveness as a medium of exchange. Supporting maximum sustainable employment means that we have an important growth mandate.\n\nThis remains the case even when we are at the so-called zero bound with respect to short-term rates. In this context, I believe that our large-scale asset purchase programs were fully consistent with our global responsibilities. For example, our recent program to purchase $600 billion of Treasury securities sought to prevent a relapse into recession and to lessen the risk of deflation—outcomes that would have been very damaging to global economy.\n\nI do not mean to dismiss lightly the concerns raised by some EMEs about the program. By removing long-duration Treasury assets from private investors' hands, we encouraged those investors to purchase other assets, including foreign assets. This eased U.S. financial conditions and, thus, boosted U.S. demand for both domestically and foreign-produced goods. The portfolio rebalancing also may have encouraged greater gross capital outflows. It is at least possible that this amplified the fundamentally driven rise in EME asset prices and put some upward pressure on some EME currencies.\n\nBut, in my opinion, it would have been irresponsible for us to allow the risk of a deflationary outcome in the United States to persist without decisive policy action. If the United States had slipped back into recession, the global economy and financial system would have been destabilized in unpredictable ways, and capital flight to the EMEs and upward pressure on EME currencies would have likely increased rather than diminished.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is fully committed to keeping inflation in check and maintaining the purchasing power of the dollar. This is important for U.S. economic stability and growth. It is also critical if the United States is to retain foreign investor confidence, which, as an importer of capital, we should never take for granted.\n\nIn fact, we recognize that the United States, as the issuer of the global reserve currency, has singular responsibilities within the global system. The central role of the dollar and dollar assets rests on several pillars:\n\nThese are strengths that we must constantly maintain.\n\nEnsuring financial stability is essential to advancing the common interests of the global economic system. We have much work still to do in the developed world. But the EMEs also need to be active participants in this conversation, given their rising weight in the world economy, already large contribution to global savings and growing importance in the creation of financial assets. Everyone benefits if the EMEs can liberalize and deepen their financial systems in ways that avoid some of the mistakes that we in the United States and others have made.\n\nTo sum up, the rapid ascendancy of the EMEs in the world economy and the widespread improvement in living conditions associated with globalization are to be applauded. But aspects of this process have occurred in a manner that has led to strains on both a cyclical and secular basis. The current relationships in terms of capital flows and composition of growth are not likely to prove sustainable on a long-term basis.\n\nThe issue of global rebalancing has received plenty of attention elsewhere. My goal today is not to play the blame game. We all share responsibility for addressing our current set of challenges. Rather, it is to lay out the reasons why it is imperative that the United States and the EMEs collectively move toward arrangements that put us on a mutually sustainable path. I hope I have been convincing.\n\nThe United States must provide leadership in this global process. This is in our own national interest. The policy response we need combines fiscal and structural adjustments that would enable the United States to prosper in the next phase of global economic transformation. These issues cannot be addressed primarily thorough monetary policy. However, monetary policy has a role to play in supporting the necessary transitions, and it too needs to be conducted mindful of its global context.\n\nAs we step up to our responsibilities, we should look to the leading nations of the EME world to provide leadership too, commensurate with their growing importance in the global system, in rebalancing demand and increasing currency flexibility. If we lead together, with mutually supportive actions, we can achieve better outcomes than any of us can achieve on our own.\n\nThank you for your kind attention."

Last summer I travelled through central and western New York and met with community leaders, business people, academics, bankers and government officials.\n\nOn this visit I will also meet with a wide range of people to talk about what we do and to hear first-hand the economic and financial issues important to you in the Hudson Valley so that I can best represent all my constituents in my work at the Fed. I also look forward to walking across that magnificent old railroad bridge, the Walkway Over the Hudson, for the spectacular view that I’m told awaits me.\n\nI thank the Dutchess County Regional Chamber of Commerce Center for inviting me to speak here in Fishkill today. This morning I will talk about economic conditions in the nation and the region, paying particular attention to how the recession has affected the labor market here. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (that is, the committee that sets interest rates—also known by its initials as the FOMC).\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed\nBy way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do, and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, which was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the supply of money in the nation's economy.\n\nThe Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary policy—such as whether to adjust interest rates—in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee consists of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks. It meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy, that is—should we change interest rates and, if so, how much. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings. At these meetings, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. My visit to Fishkill today is a part of these regional activities in which I learn first-hand about the economic and financial conditions important to you.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy. This means that at the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities in order to adjust short-term interest rates. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nAt the regional level, we continually track economic conditions in our District with the help of a number of tools that we have created for this purpose. For example, to fill a void in current measures of economic output, my staff produces indexes of economic activity which approximate output for New York State and New York City on a monthly basis. We also have initiated a consumer credit panel so that we can monitor local credit conditions. And, we have begun a quarterly survey of small business finances to track the issues related to credit and financing for this key job-generating sector. If you are not already part of the survey, I invite you to give your business card to my staff and we will add you to our survey universe, so that it can reflect your views, too.\n\nTo share the information that we gather and produce about our diverse district, we have created a rich website with very localized current data and maps on conditions in the region. I invite you to visit us on the web to explore the highly detailed information on small business, credit and housing conditions that we provide.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington and at other agencies in the United States and abroad to help put the nation’s financial system on a firmer footing. As regulators, we have made progress, for instance, in crafting tougher capital rules for the biggest banks, but much remains to be completed and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves. We must learn from the economic catastrophe of the past few years so that the financial system is able to perform its essential role in supporting economic activity without being a source of instability for the economy as a whole.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nNow, what is the outlook for and risks to economic activity, employment and inflation in the nation?\n\nSince the recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a relatively modest pace. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2011 was somewhat softer than anticipated, with the advanced reading of real gross domestic product (GDP)—that’s the economic output of the economy—increasing at only a 1.8 percent annual rate. A number of factors contributed to the slowdown. Construction activity fell—likely reflecting the continued large supply of unsold homes—and government expenditures at the federal, state and local levels declined.\n\nIn addition, real consumption growth (that is, spending on goods and services adjusted for price increases) in the first quarter was slower than in the last quarter of 2010. This occurred, in part, because of the rise in gasoline and food prices that pushed up consumer price inflation last quarter and reduced the amount of income available for other household purchases, a pattern that continued to be evident in retail sales for April. High energy prices have contributed to weaker consumer confidence, which also may have negatively affected consumer spending.\n\nHowever, the weakness of real output growth in the first quarter probably will prove temporary. Although manufacturing production fell in April, largely because of supply disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan, business survey indicators, including the New York Fed’s own Empire State Manufacturing Survey, generally continue to signal growth, suggesting that production should soon return to more robust growth. And financial conditions have continued to improve, albeit gradually. The temporary reduction in payroll taxes and other fiscal measures also are providing support to demand. In addition, demand abroad—particularly in Asia—remains robust, supporting our exports.\n\nMost importantly, the labor market has shown further improvement, as demonstrated by the latest employment report. Although payroll job growth has been subdued during most of this recovery, the latest figures show the economy added 244,000 jobs in April—and an average of 233,000 over the past three months. While the unemployment rate—which is based on a different survey—ticked higher last month to 9 percent it is nonetheless 0.8 percentage points lower than it was in November, a relatively rapid decline by historic standards. Private-sector job growth has been strong enough to more than offset government layoffs, particularly at the state and local levels.\n\nA particularly encouraging sign is the rapid growth of manufacturing jobs over the past year and the recent broadening strength in services employment. While the exact pace of a jobs market recovery is always hard to predict, we were expecting the rate of job growth to pick up over the first half, and I am hopeful that job growth will continue to strengthen in the coming months. We would welcome this. However, even if the economy added 300,000 jobs per month from now on, we would likely still have considerable labor market slack at the end of 2012.\n\nDespite these clearly encouraging signs, there are still some downside risks to the growth outlook that bear watching. Let me list them for you:\n\nAlthough these issues bear watching, they remain risks rather than likely outcomes.\n\nIn regard to inflation, after a period in which inflation was below the levels the Fed judges to be most consistent with its statutory objectives, on a year-over-year basis, headline CPI (consumer price index) has increased more than 3 percent, which is somewhat above this desired level. The rise in commodity prices over the past year probably will push up headline inflation further in the next few months. It is noteworthy, however, that even with the sharp rise in oil and food prices over the past year (and notwithstanding the more recent drops), there has been limited pass-through into the prices of other goods and services. In fact, most measures of underlying inflation trends—such as core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices)—remain below levels consistent with our mandate for price stability.\n\nGoing forward, futures markets do not signal that investors expect rapid ongoing increases in commodity prices from current levels. Provided these prices stabilize (or indeed retreat further), I would expect headline inflation to move back to a more mandate-consistent rate. While this process plays out, however, it is critical that we ensure that inflation expectations do not become unmoored. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin to raise their expectations of inflation. At this point, measures of inflation expectations overall remain stable.\n\nEconomists at the New York Fed have examined inflation expectations using a unique survey that we sponsor. As reported in a recent post on our new Liberty Street Economics blog, they find no evidence to suggest that a wage-price inflation spiral is getting underway. However, we will continue to monitor expectations for medium-term inflation very closely.\n\nTo sum up, economic conditions have improved in the past year. Yet, the recovery remains moderate and we still have a considerable way to go to meet the Fed’s dual mandate of full employment and price stability.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nSo, how is our region doing? As some of you may know, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the region. Based on these measures, the downturn in economic activity in New York ended in November of 2009, and since then activity in New York State and New York City has been recovering steadily at a moderate pace.\n\nRegional Employment Trends\nLet me turn specifically to employment trends in the region. In particular, I want to describe our region’s experience during the recession and recovery.\n\nNationally, the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, has been the deepest economic downturn since World War II. When employment finally bottomed out in February 2010—about seven months after the official end of the recession—the country had lost almost 6.5 percent of its jobs and the unemployment rate had more than doubled. Many people lost their jobs or saw their hours or income cut, and the duration of unemployment for jobless workers reached a historical high. For many families, this distress was compounded by losses of wealth from declining home prices. Since that low point of employment, job creation has resumed, albeit at a slower pace than we would like, and unemployment has retreated by a percentage point. As in other parts of the country, employment in our region declined substantially during the recession. But, the various parts of our region had very different experiences.\n\nEmployment in much of New York State, including the Hudson Valley, declined less severely than the nation. Both the state and city lost about 3.8 percent of their jobs. Part of the reason for the more moderate decline in jobs in New York during the recession was a less pronounced boom-bust housing cycle. Indeed, as a percentage, the city and state lost fewer jobs during this recession than they did during either of the last two downturns.\n\nNow, as in the nation, a labor market recovery has begun across much of the region. Over the past year, New York State has added roughly 100,000 private-sector jobs. Within the state, the recovery has been somewhat uneven. New York City has been gaining jobs for more than a year now—at roughly the same pace as the nation, while to date, the Hudson Valley has seen little overall job growth.\n\nConditions in the Hudson Valley\nContinuing to drill down geographically, let me talk in more detail about conditions here the mid-Hudson Valley. I am referring to Dutchess and Orange counties, which comprise the Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metropolitan area, which includes Fishkill; and Ulster County—which is also the Kingston metropolitan area.\n\nFirst, what does the mid-Hudson Valley region look like from an economic standpoint? There is a lot of economic activity here. All told, about 850,000 people live here and 420,000 jobs are located here. And, over the past decade, all three counties added people more rapidly than the state.\nPeople here are, on average, more highly educated than in the nation as a whole, as measured by the over 30 percent of residents who have college degrees. So, it is not surprising that median household income in all three counties is above the national median.\n\nThe industrial composition varies by county.\n\nNow, how has the area fared during the recent recession and recovery? I will address this from three perspectives: housing, credit conditions and jobs.\n\nUnlike central and western New York, this region experienced a modest boom and bust housing cycle. During the boom period from 2000 to 2006, home prices more than doubled in the Poughkeepsie area and increased by 150 percent around Kingston—exceeding the U.S. rise of roughly 90 percent and the average rise of roughly 50 percent that prevailed in our region. The price declines in the bust period, from 2007 to 2009, were somewhat less severe than the nation, falling by roughly 20 percent in both areas, compared with 30 percent nationally. Recently—and this is a hopeful sign—home prices in both areas have steadied.\n\nNext, how are families in the Hudson Valley doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, debt delinquencies soared and many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to a sustainable level. We keep track of the credit conditions in the Second District—including the average debt that people in area carry and whether they are current with their payments—using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel. In the Hudson Valley, debt per person with a credit report is now down by 5 percent from its peak level in 2008. As of the first quarter of this year, debt was continuing to fall modestly. At the same time, delinquency rates continue to rise. The proportion of debt that is at least 90 days delinquent has risen from 2 percent in 2005—which was low for New York—to 9 percent currently, matching the delinquency rate statewide. These patterns suggest that households in the area are making progress on restoring their balance sheets, but they may not have completed the process.\n\nWith regard to jobs, employment losses in the area during the 2008-09 downturn were steeper than in most of New York State, although less severe than for the Unites States as a whole. As of the first quarter of 2011, the Hudson Valley had yet to see a clear upturn in employment. The private sector has actually seen brisk job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector, and the professional and business service sector added jobs in the Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metro area. And private-sector employment has held steady in the Kingston area over the past year. Both areas, however, have seen continuing job losses in retail trade and, especially, government employment. State and local government employment has declined by about 3.5 percent in the past year and has weighed down overall job growth in both areas.\n\nUnemployment rates in the mid-Hudson valley peaked at 8.4 percent in late 2009—well below the national peak of 10 percent and moderately below the state-wide peak of 8.9 percent. Nevertheless, as in much of the region and the nation, jobless rates have not retreated much thus far and remain stubbornly high.\n\nThus, the area was severely affected by the recession, but somewhat less so than the rest of the country. The recovery has begun, but some signs of distress remain in housing, credit and labor markets.\n\nIn the near-term, the regional economy, and indeed the economy of the entire state, faces a number of challenges. Among them is the need to address the large state budget gap. New York is not alone in having seen its tax revenue decline as the economy weakened and, thus, facing hard choices. As I mentioned, state and local government employment has already weakened in many areas. Going forward, further contraction in this sector continues to pose some risks to the recovery.\n\nLonger term, one of the key challenges for this region is to ensure that it trains and attracts a highly skilled workforce that can meet the needs of innovative and rapidly changing firms. A region's human capital—that is, the skills and education of its work force—determines a large part of its economic success and resiliency.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the national economy experienced a soft patch in activity during the first quarter of 2011, while the recovery in much of the region continued at a good pace.\n\nIn the region, the continued expansion of employment across the nation should help increase economic activity and employment in the Hudson Valley. Yet, as elsewhere, state and local government will likely be a drag for some time.\n\nAnd, both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains unacceptably high.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now be happy to answer some questions."

        "content": "Each visit to this area gives me a chance to deepen the Bank's relationship with the people whom I represent as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Last summer I travelled through central and western New York and met with community leaders, business people, academics, bankers and government officials.\n\nOn this visit I will also meet with a wide range of people to talk about what we do and to hear first-hand the economic and financial issues important to you in the Hudson Valley so that I can best represent all my constituents in my work at the Fed. I also look forward to walking across that magnificent old railroad bridge, the Walkway Over the Hudson, for the spectacular view that I'm told awaits me.\n\nI thank the Center for Research, Regional Education and Outreach for inviting me to speak at SUNY New Paltz today. This morning I will talk about economic conditions in the nation and the region, paying particular attention to how the recession has affected the labor market here. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (that is, the committee that sets interest rates—also known by its initials as the FOMC).\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed\nBy way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, which was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the supply of money in the nation's economy.\n\nThe Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary policy—such as whether to adjust interest rates—in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee consists of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks. It meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy, that is—should we change interest rates and, if so, how much. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings. At these meetings, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. My visit to New Paltz today is a part of these regional activities in which I learn first-hand about the economic and financial conditions important to you.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy. This means that at the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities in order to adjust short-term interest rates. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nAt the regional level, we continually track economic conditions in our District with the help of a number of tools that we have created for this purpose. For example, to fill a void in current measures of economic output, my staff produces indexes of economic activity which approximate output for New York State and New York City on a monthly basis. We also have initiated a consumer credit panel so that we can monitor local credit conditions. And, we have begun a quarterly survey of small business finances to track the issues related to credit and financing for this key job-generating sector. If you are not already part of the survey, I invite you to give your business card to my staff and we will add you to our survey universe, so that it can reflect your views, too.\n\nTo share the information that we gather and produce about our diverse district, we have created a rich website with very localized current data and maps on conditions in the region. I invite you to visit us on the web to explore the highly detailed information on small business, credit and housing conditions that we provide.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington and at other agencies in the United States and abroad to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. As regulators, we have made progress, for instance, in crafting tougher capital rules for the biggest banks, but much remains to be completed and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves. We must learn from the economic catastrophe of the past few years so that the financial system is able to perform its essential role in supporting economic activity without being a source of instability for the economy as a whole.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nNow, what is the outlook for and risks to economic activity, employment and inflation in the nation?\n\nSince the recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a relatively modest pace. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2011 was somewhat softer than anticipated, with the advanced reading of real gross domestic product (GDP)—that's the economic output of the economy—increasing at only a 1.8 percent annual rate. A number of factors contributed to the slowdown. Construction activity fell—likely reflecting the continued large supply of unsold homes—and government expenditures at the federal, state and local levels declined.\n\nIn addition, real consumption growth (that is, spending on goods and services adjusted for price increases) in the first quarter was slower than in the last quarter of 2010. This occurred, in part, because of the rise in gasoline and food prices that pushed up consumer price inflation last quarter and reduced the amount of income available for other household purchases, a pattern that continued to be evident in retail sales for April. High energy prices have contributed to weaker consumer confidence, which also may have negatively affected consumer spending.\n\nHowever, the weakness of real output growth in the first quarter probably will prove temporary. Although manufacturing production fell in April, largely because of supply disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan, business survey indicators, including the New York Fed's own Empire State Manufacturing Survey, generally continue to signal growth, suggesting that production should soon return to more robust growth. And financial conditions have continued to improve, albeit gradually. The temporary reduction in payroll taxes and other fiscal measures also are providing support to demand. In addition, demand abroad—particularly in Asia—remains robust, supporting our exports.\n\nMost importantly, the labor market has shown further improvement, as demonstrated by the latest employment report. Although payroll job growth has been subdued during most of this recovery, the latest figures show the economy added 244,000 jobs in April—and an average of 233,000 over the past three months. While the unemployment rate—which is based on a different survey—ticked higher last month to 9 percent it is nonetheless 0.8 percentage points lower than it was in November, a relatively rapid decline by historic standards. Private-sector job growth has been strong enough to more than offset government layoffs, particularly at the state and local levels.\n\nA particularly encouraging sign is the rapid growth of manufacturing jobs over the past year and the recent broadening strength in services employment. While the exact pace of a jobs market recovery is always hard to predict, we were expecting the rate of job growth to pick up over the first half, and I am hopeful that job growth will continue to strengthen in the coming months. We would welcome this. However, even if the economy added 300,000 jobs per month from now on, we would likely still have considerable labor market slack at the end of 2012.\n\nDespite these clearly encouraging signs, there are still some downside risks to the growth outlook that bear watching. Let me list them for you:\n\nAlthough these issues bear watching, they remain risks rather than likely outcomes.\n\nIn regard to inflation, after a period in which inflation was below the levels the Fed judges to be most consistent with its statutory objectives, on a year-over-year basis, headline CPI (consumer price index) has increased more than 3 percent, which is somewhat above this desired level. The rise in commodity prices over the past year probably will push up headline inflation further in the next few months. It is noteworthy, however, that even with the sharp rise in oil and food prices over the past year (and notwithstanding the more recent drops), there has been limited pass-through into the prices of other goods and services. In fact, most measures of underlying inflation trends—such as core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices)—remain below levels consistent with our mandate for price stability.\n\nGoing forward, futures markets do not signal that investors expect rapid ongoing increases in commodity prices from current levels. Provided these prices stabilize (or indeed retreat further), I would expect headline inflation to move back to a more mandate-consistent rate. While this process plays out, however, it is critical that we ensure that inflation expectations do not become unmoored. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin to raise their expectations of inflation. At this point, measures of inflation expectations overall remain stable.\n\nEconomists at the New York Fed have examined inflation expectations using a unique survey that we sponsor. As reported in a recent post on our new Liberty Street Economics blog, they find no evidence to suggest that a wage-price inflation spiral is getting underway. However, we will continue to monitor expectations for medium-term inflation very closely.\n\nTo sum up, economic conditions have improved in the past year. Yet, the recovery remains moderate and we still have a considerable way to go to meet the Fed's dual mandate of full employment and price stability.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nSo, how is our region doing? As some of you may know, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the region. Based on these measures, the downturn in economic activity in New York ended in November of 2009, and since then activity in New York State and New York City has been recovering steadily at a moderate pace.\n\nRegional Employment Trends\nLet me turn specifically to employment trends in the region. In particular, I want to describe our region's experience during the recession and recovery.\n\nNationally, the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, has been the deepest economic downturn since World War II. When employment finally bottomed out in February 2010—about seven months after the official end of the recession—the country had lost almost 6.5 percent of its jobs and the unemployment rate had more than doubled. Many people lost their jobs or saw their hours or income cut, and the duration of unemployment for jobless workers reached a historical high. For many families, this distress was compounded by losses of wealth from declining home prices. Since that low point of employment, job creation has resumed, albeit at a slower pace than we would like, and unemployment has retreated by a percentage point. As in other parts of the country, employment in our region declined substantially during the recession. But, the various parts of our region had very different experiences.\n\nEmployment in much of New York State, including the Hudson Valley, declined less severely than the nation. Both the state and city lost about 3.8 percent of their jobs. Part of the reason for the more moderate decline in jobs in New York during the recession was a less pronounced boom-bust housing cycle. Indeed, as a percentage, the city and state lost fewer jobs during this recession than they did during either of the last two downturns.\n\nNow, as in the nation, a labor market recovery has begun across much of the region. Over the past year, New York State has added roughly 100,000 private-sector jobs. Within the state, the recovery has been somewhat uneven. New York City has been gaining jobs for more than a year now—at roughly the same pace as the nation, while to date, the Hudson Valley has seen little overall job growth.\n\nConditions in the Hudson Valley\nContinuing to drill down geographically, let me talk in more detail about conditions here the mid-Hudson Valley. I am referring to Dutchess and Orange counties, which comprise the Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metropolitan area, and Ulster County—which is also the Kingston metropolitan area.\n\nFirst, what does the mid-Hudson Valley region look like from an economic standpoint? There is a lot of economic activity here. All told, about 850,000 people live here and 420,000 jobs are located here. And, over the past decade, all three counties added people more rapidly than the state.\n\nPeople here are, on average, more highly educated than in the nation as a whole, as measured by the over 30 percent of residents who have college degrees. So, it is not surprising that median household income in all three counties is above the national median.\n\nThe industrial composition varies by county.\n\nNow, how has the area fared during the recent recession and recovery? I will address this from three perspectives: housing, credit conditions and jobs.\n\nUnlike central and western New York, this region experienced a modest boom and bust housing cycle. During the boom period from 2000 to 2006, home prices more than doubled in the Poughkeepsie area and increased by 150 percent around Kingston—exceeding the U.S. rise of roughly 90 percent and the average rise of roughly 50 percent that prevailed in our region. The price declines in the bust period, from 2007 to 2009, were somewhat less severe than the nation, falling by roughly 20 percent in both areas, compared with 30 percent nationally. Recently—and this is a hopeful sign—home prices in both areas have steadied.\n\nNext, how are families in the Hudson Valley doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, debt delinquencies soared and many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to a sustainable level. We keep track of the credit conditions in the Second District—including the average debt that people in area carry and whether they are current with their payments—using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Consumer Credit Panel. In the Hudson Valley, debt per person with a credit report is now down by 5 percent from its peak level in 2008. As of the first quarter of this year, debt was continuing to fall modestly. At the same time, delinquency rates continue to rise. The proportion of debt that is at least 90 days delinquent has risen from 2 percent in 2005—which was low for New York—to 9 percent currently, matching the delinquency rate statewide. These patterns suggest that households in the area are making progress on restoring their balance sheets, but they may not have completed the process.\n\nWith regard to jobs, employment losses in the area during the 2008-09 downturn were steeper than in most of New York State, although less severe than for the Unites States as a whole.

A region's human capital—that is, the skills and education of its work force—determines a large part of its economic success and resiliency. The education and research taking place in local colleges and universities, such as SUNY New Paltz, directly helps to build those skills and sustain economic growth.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the national economy experienced a soft patch in activity during the first quarter of 2011, while the recovery in much of the region continued at a good pace.\n\nIn the region, the continued expansion of employment across the nation should help increase economic activity and employment in the Hudson Valley. Yet, as elsewhere, state and local government will likely be a drag for some time.\n\nAnd, both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains unacceptably high."

In regard to inflation, on a year-over-year basis, the headline measures have increased to levels near those consistent with our objectives—which most members of the FOMC consider to be 2 percent or a bit less on the personal consumption expenditures measure. Moreover, the rise in commodity prices over the past year probably will push up headline inflation even further in coming months. It is noteworthy, however, that even with the sharp rise in oil and food prices, there has been little pass-through into broader measures of prices.

Yet, the recovery remains moderate and we still have a considerable way to go to meet the Fed’s dual mandate of full employment and price stability. \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nNow, how is our region doing? As attendees at previous press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the region.\n\nI am pleased to report that the latest months of data no longer suggest that the regional recovery has paused, as they indicated in February. Based on these measures:\n\nWe monitor Puerto Rico using an index produced by the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico. The index shows that the decline in activity on the island began in 2005 and continued through late 2010. However, there are some signs that the economy has stabilized in recent months. \n\nRegional Employment Trends\nNow, let me turn specifically to employment trends in the region, the focus of our briefing today.  In particular, we want to describe our region’s experience during the recession and recovery.\n\nNationally, the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, has been the deepest economic downturn since World War II. At the jobs trough in February 2010—about 7 months after the official end of the recession—the country had lost almost 6.5 percent of its jobs and the unemployment rate had more than doubled. Many people lost their jobs or saw their hours or income cut, and the duration of unemployment for jobless workers reached a historical high. For many families, this distress was compounded by losses of wealth from declining home prices and stock market losses. Since the jobs trough, unemployment has retreated by a percentage point and jobs growth has resumed, albeit at a slow pace. Today, we will review questions about jobs in our region such as:  How severe was the downturn? Where are jobs returning? And, what factors affect the employment outlook?\n\nAs in other parts of the country, employment in our region declined substantially during the recession. But, New York and New Jersey and Puerto Rico had very different experiences.\n\nEmployment in much of New York State, including New York City, declined less severely than the nation. Both the state and city lost about 3.8 percent of their jobs.  As we discussed at our briefing last October, part of reason for the more moderate decline in jobs in New York during the recession was a less pronounced boom-bust housing cycle. Indeed, as a percentage, the city and state lost fewer jobs during this recession than they did during either of the last two downturns.\n\nBy contrast, the downturn in employment in New Jersey in the current cycle was more severe.  About 250,000 jobs were lost, or roughly 6.0 percent of total state employment—about the same as in the country as a whole. This decline is comparable to the job losses during the most severe recent recession in the state, that of 1989-1992.\n\nFairfield County in Connecticut, also part of our District, saw declines comparable to the nation, while Puerto Rico experienced much deeper and longer job declines than the nation.  In fact, employment in Puerto Rico began declining nearly two years before the onset of the recession on the mainland.  \n\nNow, as in the nation, a labor market recovery has begun across much of the region. Over the past year, the tri-state region added roughly 100,000 private-sector jobs. Within the region, however, the recovery has been somewhat uneven. New York City, upstate New York and Fairfield County have been gaining jobs for more than a year now—at roughly the same pace as the nation.\n\nHowever, employment in New Jersey has only begun to expand during the past few months. In Puerto Rico, job growth has yet to be firmly established. The recession, which began in 2005, has seen employment leveling off since last summer, but no clear reestablishment of growth.\n\nBusinesses in a variety of services sectors have contributed to the recovery of jobs in the region, including professional and business services, education and health, and leisure and hospitality, as well as finance. The overall expansion of our private sector is being partially offset by ongoing losses in manufacturing and construction, where firms in our region are not matching the modest growth seen in jobs at the national level. In addition, state and local government jobs in our district have declined sharply. After holding steady for much of the recession, state and local governments in New York and New Jersey have reduced job counts by more than 40,000. These losses effectively offset about half of the private-sector jobs created over the period. The government job declines were particularly severe in New Jersey and Puerto Rico, and considerably steeper than in the United States overall.\n\nLooking ahead, the continued expansion of employment at the national level should have positive effects on many industries in our region. As elsewhere, state and local government will likely be a drag for some time. However, some new detailed job listing data point to an expansion of job openings in a number of key occupations in the region.\n\nFinally, despite the overall recovery of employment across much of the region, unemployment rates remain very high. Although down from their year-ago levels, March’s unemployment rate of 8.0 percent in New York State and 9.3 percent in New Jersey remain unacceptably high. And there is disappointingly little evidence of any sustained improvement in Puerto Rico’s 16.1 percent unemployment rate. \n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the national economy experienced a soft patch in activity during the first quarter of 2011, while the recovery in much of the region continued at a good pace. New York continued to expand and New Jersey has shown signs of turning the corner in the last two months. Puerto Rico may have bottomed out.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, most of New York sustained less severe job losses than the nation as whole. By contrast, New Jersey’s losses were comparable to the rest of the country and Puerto Rico’s job losses have been more severe. As the recovery takes shape, private services are the most likely source of job growth throughout the region.\n\nThere are many reasons to believe conditions are in place for stronger growth in the coming months in the nation and the region. Nevertheless, both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains stubbornly high and is likely to remain so for many months to come.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now ask James Orr to provide more details on regional economic conditions."

        "content": "I am pleased to be here today to speak about the issue of regulatory reform and the global financial system.\n\nA stable and resilient financial system that allocates credit in an efficient manner underpins and supports economic growth and rising standards of living around the world. As we saw recently, however, a financial system that is prone to booms and crashes can not only lead to an inefficient allocation of real resources during the booms but can also have devastating consequences for global economic activity and employment during the crashes. In an integrated global economy, severe negative consequences can be felt far away from the center of the financial crisis–as they were in Asia in late 2008 and early 2009. This underscores our common interest in promoting financial stability on a global basis.\n\nTruly effective reform would generate sizable and widespread benefits. However, there are significant challenges to achieving this. One challenge arises from the fact that we have a global economy with many large, globally active financial firms, but our regulatory regimes are implemented at the national level. Another is that any attempt to improve regulatory standards will inevitably meet with resistance from parties that have a vested interest in the status quo.\n\nToday I will comment on the actions underway in the United States and internationally to make the financial system more resilient and robust. I will focus on the logic behind the reform efforts, progress to date, and areas where there still is considerable work to do. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve System, or my international supervisory colleagues with whom I work closely with on a regular basis.\n\nThe financial crisis exposed significant vulnerabilities in the financial system. Without revisiting all the causes and consequences of the credit boom and bust that led to a boom and bust in the U.S. housing market, the bottom line is that our regulatory system failed in two important dimensions. First, a significant number of large, internationally active financial firms reached the brink of failure. Second, the financial system was not very resilient when these firms got into difficulty. Instead, the threat of failure propagated further shocks that reverberated throughout the global financial system.\n\nThese two shortcomings reflect many factors including inadequate capital and liquidity buffers, poor incentives to correctly measure, price and manage risks ex ante, the opacity of firm balance sheet and counterparty exposures, and the manner in which large financial firms were interconnected within the financial system. In the end, there was too much leverage in which large amounts of highly illiquid, long-term assets were financed by short-term liabilities. The fact that a large amount of the wholesale funding used to finance these assets was provided by leveraged financial intermediaries to other financial intermediaries increased the system’s vulnerability to adverse shocks. As it turned out, the amount and quality of capital was grossly inadequate relative to the quality of the assets and off-balance-sheet exposures of many of the major global banking institutions. Moreover, many institutions had inadequate liquidity buffers. The lack of liquidity forced the fire sale of assets, which depressed prices and increased the pressure on capital.\n\nWhen troubled institutions did fail, this exacerbated the pressure on the remaining institutions. Aggravated by the lack of transparency about their counterparty exposures and the contingent liabilities they faced, the problems of a single institution quickly became the problems of many. This was fueled in part by concern that the counterparty claims on failed institutions would be frozen and unable to be realized quickly.\n\nNot only did some core firms have inadequate capital and liquidity, they also faced conflicting incentives as to how to manage their capital resources. For example, many firms that came under stress were slow to cut their dividends or to raise new capital because of fears that such actions would signal their underlying weakness. Obviously, the failure to conserve capital made these institutions weaker rather than stronger.\n\nThe crisis also underscored severe deficiencies in the international dimension of the regulatory environment. Financial institutions, flows and activities are global, but the vast majority of regulation and information sharing is contained within national boundaries. Where resolution regimes existed, they generally existed only for banking entities and were not set up to handle the orderly resolution of a large internationally active bank holding company or non-bank financial firm. This cross-border problem persists to this day.\n\nThe interconnectedness of the financial system also caused shocks to spread quickly. For example, the failure of Lehman Brothers led to losses at the Reserve Fund, which precipitated a widespread money market mutual fund panic. It also led to actions by U.K. bankruptcy authorities that had the effect of freezing the assets owned by hedge fund and other clients of the firm and this encouraged such investors to pull assets from other institutions perceived to be weak. These and other propagation channels in turn, led to virtual stoppage of lending and borrowing activity in the money markets and, ultimately, a credit crunch that reverberated throughout the global financial system. For example, the crisis led to a sharp constraint on the availability of trade credit in the fall of 2008 that had a devastating impact on economic activity in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, as well as Japan. This region felt the full economic consequences of the crisis even though banks in the region were generally healthy and far from the U.S. housing boom and bust and the subprime mortgage debacle that could be viewed as the initial spark that ignited the crisis.\n\nThe crisis also underscored another area for further cross-border work: Our international approach to liquidity provision and lender-of-last-resort services to globally active institutions. Cooperation among liquidity providers, for example, through some central bank dollar swap arrangements, played an important role in stabilizing global money markets. However, the division of lender-of-last-resort responsibilities between home and host countries remained ambiguous through the crisis. This needs further attention.\n\nSo what steps have been taken to address some of these sources of vulnerability? There are literally dozens of initiatives underway nationally and globally, not only in traditional bodies for such cooperation such as the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision, but also among newer international groups such as the Financial Stability Board. Most of these initiatives can be grouped into three major categories:\n\nTurning to the first set of initiatives designed to reduce the probability of failure of large, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), the tougher capital and liquidity regimes that the Basel Committee has devised are probably the most important elements. On the capital side, Basel III significantly increases requirements with respect to both the quantity and quality of capital. On the quantity side, there have been two important changes. First, the capital requirements have been raised so that internationally active banks must have common equity ratios of at least 7 percent of risk-weighted assets when the standards are fully phased in by 2019. This 7 percent standard consists of a 4.5 percent minimum plus a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. Banks whose capital ratios fall into the buffer range will face increasingly stringent restrictions on capital distributions such as dividends and share repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to staff. This should act as a form of “automatic stabilizer” to their capital resources and change the incentives banks face during periods of stress. Second, for many globally active banks, the amount of capital required will also rise because the amount of risk-weighted assets against which the capital ratios are calculated will increase. Explicit capital requirements for operational risk and counterparty credit risk, as well as increased requirements for certain trading activity and transactions between financial institutions should result in a significant rise in risk-weighted assets.\n\nOn the quality side, capital requirements have been toughened by narrowing the definition of what can be counted toward common equity capital for regulatory capital purposes. The emphasis has been put on common equity because of the superior loss-absorbing capacity of this type of capital on a going concern basis. Tighter limits have been put on certain types of assets—such as mortgage servicing rights and tax-deferred assets—in which the values depend on a firm remaining viable, and that might not be easy to realize in the midst of a financial crisis.\n\nOn the liquidity regime side, several major initiatives are underway. The Basel Committee has proposed a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for globally active banks. In essence, this standard would require that large, internationally active banks hold sufficient short-term, liquid assets so that a bank could fund its operations for at least 30 days, without needing to borrow funds from the central bank. By creating a pool of liquid assets that the bank could sell or allow to mature, the liquidity buffer would buy time for the bank to explore options to restore market confidence. Such steps might include selling businesses and other asset dispositions, raising additional capital, or by making changes in senior management. The LCR requirement is being carefully evaluated to ensure that there will be no deleterious, unintended consequences when it becomes effective.\n\nAlso, apart from the Basel initiative, supervisors are placing greater emphasis on liquidity. For example, in the United States, supervisors have emphasized the importance of adequate liquidity buffers and many banks have been pushed to bolster their liquidity resources through the supervisory process.\n\nTogether, this emphasis on a greater quantity and higher quality of capital and larger liquidity buffers should make banks individually, and the banking system as a whole, more resilient to adverse shocks. The goal is to enable banks to retain market access to capital and funding even when large losses occur or the banks are subject to other adverse shocks. The ability to retain access should enable banks to manage through their problems, avoiding the types of liquidity runs that led to the forced unwinding of positions and that pushed what might have been solvent institutions over the edge into insolvency.\n\nIn addition to the Basel III standards for capital and liquidity, an international effort is underway to further reduce the probability of failure for systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs. The basic logic behind this effort is that the failure of a larger, more complex firm can have disproportionately large negative systemic consequences. As a result, such firms should be forced to hold additional capital in order to reduce their probability of failure below that of smaller firms. An additional capital requirement on such SIFIs would also help to level the playing field between larger and smaller firms by offsetting the funding advantage that accrues to the largest firms that stems from the perception that they are “too big to fail.” Although there are potentially other options, I believe that a SIFI surcharge could best be satisfied by requiring SIFIs to hold additional common equity above and beyond the Basel 7 percent Tier I common standard.\n\nThe move toward a tougher capital and liquidity regime undoubtedly receives the greatest attention in terms of the measures being implemented to make large banks safer. However, there also are a number of other important changes being made to supervisory practices in the United States and elsewhere. One noteworthy example is the more widespread use of horizontal stress tests to ensure that banks have adequate capital. This is a very important development, because it makes the evaluation of capital more forward-looking. The issue is not just how much regulatory capital a bank has currently but how that bank’s capital level is likely to evolve over time in adverse economic circumstances.\n\nIn the United States, another important change is that we are refocusing our supervisory practices to identify structural weaknesses and to push firm managements to remedy their shortcomings relative to “best practice” standards. Horizontal reviews across the large banks are being undertaken to identify firm-specific deficiencies. At the Federal Reserve, we are placing greater emphasis on understanding banking organizations’ business models and strategies—in other words, better understanding the specific markets and activities from which the banking organizations make money over time and the nature of the risks they take in this process. Strong risk management practices within organizations are particularly important, as risk managers must be empowered to stand up to those in the front office and prevent activities and practices that create risks or incentives that are incompatible with bank safety and soundness. Compensation practices are being reviewed to ensure that the incentives created by the compensation regime are consistent with a banking organization remaining in sound financial condition.\n\nAnother key supervisory innovation has been the more extensive supervisory engagement on the processes that banking organizations use to assess and plan for their capital needs. Recently, the Federal Reserve completed a Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program for the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies. The purpose of the CCAR process was to assess the way these institutions allocate capital over time against the risks they run, including how robust that allocation is to changes in the economic and financial environment. As part of this exercise, banking organizations had to show how their capital would hold up under a stress environment specified by the Federal Reserve, as well as how they expected their activities and capital positions to be affected by changes such as Basel III. The CCAR built on lessons learned during the crisis about the importance of taking a forward-looking and comprehensive approach to assessing capital adequacy, including an assessment of the level and composition of a bank holding company’s capital resources under stressed economic and financial market conditions.\n\nThis exercise received considerable attention because an assessment of bank holding companies’ plans for increasing dividend payments and implementing stock buyback plans were an important part of the review. However, the CCAR’s focus was much broader than simply assessing proposed capital distributions. Instead, the goal of the CCAR was to help ensure that large bank holding companies have strong, firmwide risk measurement and management processes to support their internal assessments of capital adequacy and that their capital resources are sufficient given their business activities and the resulting risk exposures.\n\nThe second important strand of reform is to ensure that regulatory oversight is sufficiently broad to include the activities of the so-called shadow banking system. This aspect of reform and oversight is still in its early days. But work is underway. For example, the Financial Stability Board is undertaking work to identify potential sources of vulnerability caused by the activities in the shadow banking system and how such vulnerabilities could be addressed. Also, in the United States, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) views its mandate broadly with respect to identifying systemic risks and proposing remedies. For example, on an ongoing basis, the FSOC will monitor and assess which non-bank financial intermediaries in the United States are systemically important and, thus, require greater regulatory oversight.\n\nBut the focus will not just be on large financial firms. Activities and practices that occur outside of the core institutions are also important. For example, the activities of money market mutual funds is one area receiving close scrutiny. As you know, a run on the money market funds developed in the fall of 2008 when the Reserve Fund broke the buck when Lehman Brothers failed. This underscored a critical structural weakness of money market mutual funds created by the convention that the net stable asset value could be fixed at par. When a money market mutual fund incurs losses that cause it to “break the buck,” this encourages investors to rush to withdraw their funds from other funds before they break the buck. The result can be a run on money market mutual fund assets. In the United States, the Securities Exchange Commission has already tightened the rules with respect to liquidity, quality and the average maturity of so-called 2a-7 fund assets, but there is still more to be done to address the remaining vulnerabilities.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the final major strand of regulatory reform is to strengthen the core of the financial system and make the system as a whole robust to the failure of a large bank or non-bank financial institution. In this realm, there are several notable initiatives.\n\nFirst, an effort is underway to create robust resolution regimes that allow large systemically important financial institutions to be wound down smoothly in a way that minimizes contagion and the risk of a broader panic or that causes damage to other parts of the financial system. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act gives enhanced resolution powers to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to use to wind down large, complex non-bank financial institutions. If such a firm becomes troubled, the regulators, with concurrence from the U.S. Treasury, can avert a bankruptcy filing and instead put the non-bank financial company into resolution. As part of such a resolution process, regulators are working to ensure that systemically important firms have viable recovery plans and that such firms have “living wills” that can help guide how such firms can be managed through a resolution situation.\n\nSecond, to reduce the likelihood of disruptive and highly costly failures, regulators around the world are evaluating whether bail-in forms of capital might be used to help recapitalize firms when they would otherwise lose their viability, or, alternatively, to help facilitate the orderly wind-down of a firm. Bail-in capital might consist of a well-identified tranche of debt that would convert to equity only if and when a particular set of trigger conditions were met. Such triggers might include breaching a certain level of regulatory capital and/or a regulatory determination that without conversion the firm would no longer be viable. One considerable challenge is how to define a set of triggers in a way that is sufficiently transparent and objective so that the bail-in process does not act as a catalyst and precipitate a run on other firms that might appear to have similar characteristics. In principle, however, by helping to recapitalize the firm, bail-in capital could help to forestall the need for a forced, rapid liquidation of assets and this might help to facilitate the orderly wind-down of a large, global firm that otherwise could not otherwise be easily resolved.\n\nThird, efforts are underway to reduce counterparty risk exposures by requiring that over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and equity and commodity derivative trades be standardized where feasible—and that all standardized trades be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). Standardized clearing through CCPs reduces the complex web of counterparty exposures that exist in the bilateral world of OTC derivatives. Everyone that centrally clears becomes the counterparty to the CCP. This enables a high level of gross bilateral exposures to be netted down to a much more manageable set of net exposures to the CCP.\n\nFourth, recognizing that mandated central clearing will only reduce risk if the CCPs themselves are robust, efforts are underway to strengthen financial market infrastructures. In the United States, for example, the Dodd-Frank Act instructs the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate certain financial market utilities (FMUs) as systemically important. Such FMUs would be subject to a tougher regulatory oversight regime. On a parallel track, at the international level, the Committee for Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are revising and strengthening a set of regulatory oversight principles and minimum business standards for financial market infrastructures (FMIs). These principles include numerous standards with respect to governance, access, risk management practices, and capital and liquidity standards. As Chair of the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems and someone deeply involved in the CPSS-IOSCO work, I believe that adoption of an agreed-upon global set of minimum standards for FMIs is essential if we are to have a safe global financial system.\n\nRecently, CPSS-IOSCO issued a revised set of such principles for consultation. Responses to the proposed principles are due back by late July. The CPSS-IOSCO plans to publish a final set of standards early next year. I hope and anticipate that countries will adopt these principles as the minimum regulatory standards for the systemically important FMIs that operate in their jurisdictions.\n\nIn summary, considerable effort is underway to enhance financial stability.\nThat said, I think it is important to recognize some of the important challenges in designing and implementing effective reform. Four broad challenges immediately come to mind. First, the resolution of large financial firms that operate in multiple jurisdictions remains largely out of reach—at least in the near- to medium-term. This is due to the fact that legal rules are not harmonized across the different regulatory regimes with respect to bankruptcy and liquidation. For example, although the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a resolution regime for the U.S. operations of a large global financial firm domiciled in the United States, this resolution framework stops at the nation’s borders. Supervisors from different nations are working together in an effort to create more effective cross-border crisis management tools and resolution regimes, but this work is still in its very early stages and there are formidable obstacles to overcome.\n\nA second challenge is the uneven progress that has been made in reforming bank regulation and supervision across the different jurisdictions. For example, in some cases, the supervisory authorities have been quite forceful in making banks domiciled in their countries raise capital. In other cases, the response has been less aggressive. The uneven progress of reform makes comprehensive reform more difficult. It shifts the tenor of the discussion away from what is the proper macroprudential framework and set of capital and liquidity requirements to one that focuses too much on issues of relative competitiveness. Too often the questions asked are: What is most beneficial to the banks of my particular country? Do the regulations bolster or harm my “national champion”? The focus shifts away from the goal of bolstering global financial stability to finding ways of tilting or adjusting the new standards to achieve a national competitive advantage.\n\nThis is in not in anyone’s interest. As discussed earlier, every nation has an interest in promoting financial stability globally, since the effects of systemic financial stress in one place can swiftly spread throughout the global economy. Moreover, although a relatively loose regulatory regime may attract business from other financial centers, there is no free lunch here. A more lax regulatory regime is likely to expose that country’s taxpayers to huge tail risks.\n\nA third challenge is the sequencing of reforms. For example, many jurisdictions are focusing on banking reforms, but have not yet applied the same intensity to shadow banking activities. If regulatory requirements for banks are increased significantly, the risk of stimulating the growth of the non-regulated shadow banking sector also increases. This suggests that the regulatory oversight effort has to be broadly applied so we just don’t trade one problem—for example, undercapitalized large banks—for another—a shrunken regulated banking sector and an enlarged, unregulated non-banking sector.\n\nSo what needs to be done? In short, plenty. Although we have made some progress in making the global financial system safer and more secure, there is much more to do. Several examples illustrate the range of issues that are still outstanding.\n\nFirst, we do need to adopt an additional capital requirement on large global systemically important financial institutions. We need this to reduce the risk of failure of such institutions to very low levels because we do not yet have the tools in place to resolve these institutions on a cross-border basis in a non-disruptive manner. We also need to do this because such institutions—by being perceived to be too big to fail—obtain a funding advantage, which higher capital charges can help offset. Without such a requirement, large banks can gain a competitive advantage just through their size.\n\nSecond, as discussed earlier, we have much more to do to ensure that we have a relatively level playing field. We need that to discourage regulatory arbitrage and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that might benefit narrow national constituencies at the expense of global financial stability.\n\nThird, we need closer cooperation among regulators. While regulators have successfully worked toward a much tougher regulatory regime for capital and liquidity, there are still huge opportunities for further progress. For example, regulators need to adopt more far-reaching protocols that allow for greater sharing of supervisory information on a cross-border basis to facilitate more effective supervision. But, this needs to be done carefully, so that proprietary business information is protected. Currently, regulators generally do not have access to the necessary information to fully assess the condition of foreign banks that operate within their borders. They have supervisory information about the activities and state of condition of the foreign bank branches and subsidiaries within their borders, but do not always have good access to information about the parent company or what the banking entity looks like on a consolidated basis. This has long been a difficult issue, though efforts are underway to find ways to enhance information-sharing.\n\nSimilarly, protocols need to be developed to share regulatory information about systemically important financial market infrastructures that operate on a cross-border basis. Access to the trade records of OTC derivatives activity that will be recorded in trade repositories also needs to be made available to be shared among regulators.\n\nFourth, we need greater clarity concerning the responsibilities of the home versus the host country, especially when a bank encounters problems.\n\nFifth, we need to work out how emergency liquidity should be provided on a cross-border basis. If a major financial market utility in London, for example, needs dollar liquidity to stay in operation, who will provide in it? Who will bear the risk and on what terms and conditions?\n\nThe political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa underscores once again the fact that we operate in a shared world economy in which events in one country and region can have large impacts globally. And to support this globalized economy, global financial firms and a global payments and settlement infrastructure are needed to support this activity. Yet, we currently operate with a financial system that is largely regulated on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThis is not tenable. What’s required is not some global authority dictating what national authorities can do but instead greater cooperation and trust in exchanging information and agreement on harmonized standards such as those laid out in the Basel III capital requirements and the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. There needs to be a good faith commitment to try to achieve a level playing field. The regulations and supervisory practices that are put in place should be determined by what is good for the public good writ large, rather than what benefits some narrow set of private financial institutions or markets.\n\nFinally, we need to be persistent. There is much work that still lies ahead. As the crisis recedes in memory, the natural reflex will be to relax and grow complacent. Already, some bankers are arguing that it is time to get back to “business as usual.” We have seen that “business as usual” results in unacceptable outcomes. So we need to keep working on a continual basis to make the global financial system more resilient and robust. We will not be able to avert all future failures or crises, but I know we can do much better in limiting the frequency, severity and the breadth of their impact when they occur if we keep pushing forward.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions."

As a result, such firms should be forced to hold additional capital in order to reduce their probability of failure below that of smaller firms. An additional capital requirement on such SIFIs would also help to level the playing field between larger and smaller firms by offsetting the funding advantage that accrues to the largest firms that stems from the perception that they are \"too big to fail.\" Although there are potentially other options, I believe that a SIFI surcharge could best be satisfied by requiring SIFIs to hold additional common equity above and beyond the Basel 7 percent Tier I common standard.\n\nThe move toward a tougher capital and liquidity regime undoubtedly receives the greatest attention in terms of the measures being implemented to make large banks safer. However, there also are a number of other important changes being made to supervisory practices in the United States and elsewhere. One noteworthy example is the more widespread use of horizontal stress tests to ensure that banks have adequate capital. This is a very important development, because it makes the evaluation of capital more forward-looking. The issue is not just how much regulatory capital a bank has currently but how that bank’s capital level is likely to evolve over time in adverse economic circumstances.\n\nIn the United States, another important change is that we are refocusing our supervisory practices to identify structural weaknesses and to push firm managements to remedy their shortcomings relative to \"best practice\" standards. Horizontal reviews across the large banks are being undertaken to identify firm-specific deficiencies. At the Federal Reserve, we are placing greater emphasis on understanding banking organizations' business models and strategies—in other words, better understanding the specific markets and activities from which the banking organizations make money over time and the nature of the risks they take in this process. Strong risk management practices within organizations are particularly important, as risk managers must be empowered to stand up to those in the front office and prevent activities and practices that create risks or incentives that are incompatible with bank safety and soundness. Compensation practices are being reviewed to ensure that the incentives created by the compensation regime are consistent with a banking organization remaining in sound financial condition.\n\nAnother key supervisory innovation has been the more extensive supervisory engagement on the processes that banking organizations use to assess and plan for their capital needs. Recently, the Federal Reserve completed a Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program for the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies. The purpose of the CCAR process was to assess the way these institutions allocate capital over time against the risks they run, including how robust that allocation is to changes in the economic and financial environment. As part of this exercise, banking organizations had to show how their capital would hold up under a stress environment specified by the Federal Reserve, as well as how they expected their activities and capital positions to be affected by changes such as Basel III. The CCAR built on lessons learned during the crisis about the importance of taking a forward-looking and comprehensive approach to assessing capital adequacy, including an assessment of the level and composition of a bank holding company's capital resources under stressed economic and financial market conditions.\n\nThis exercise received considerable attention because an assessment of bank holding companies’ plans for increasing dividend payments and implementing stock buyback plans were an important part of the review. However, the CCAR's focus was much broader than simply assessing proposed capital distributions. Instead, the goal of the CCAR was to help ensure that large bank holding companies have strong, firmwide risk measurement and management processes to support their internal assessments of capital adequacy and that their capital resources are sufficient given their business activities and the resulting risk exposures.\n\nThe second important strand of reform is to ensure that regulatory oversight is sufficiently broad to include the activities of the so-called shadow banking system. This aspect of reform and oversight is still in its early days. But work is underway. For example, the Financial Stability Board is undertaking work to identify potential sources of vulnerability caused by the activities in the shadow banking system and how such vulnerabilities could be addressed. Also, in the United States, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) views its mandate broadly with respect to identifying systemic risks and proposing remedies. For example, on an ongoing basis, the FSOC will monitor and assess which non-bank financial intermediaries in the United States are systemically important and, thus, require greater regulatory oversight.\n\nBut the focus will not just be on large financial firms. Activities and practices that occur outside of the core institutions are also important. For example, the activities of money market mutual funds is one area receiving close scrutiny. As you know, a run on the money market funds developed in the fall of 2008 when the Reserve Fund broke the buck when Lehman Brothers failed. This underscored a critical structural weakness of money market mutual funds created by the convention that the net stable asset value could be fixed at par. When a money market mutual fund incurs losses that cause it to \"break the buck,\" this encourages investors to rush to withdraw their funds from other funds before they break the buck. The result can be a run on money market mutual fund assets. In the United States, the Securities Exchange Commission has already tightened the rules with respect to liquidity, quality and the average maturity of so-called 2a-7 fund assets, but there is still more to be done to address the remaining vulnerabilities.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the final major strand of regulatory reform is to strengthen the core of the financial system and make the system as a whole robust to the failure of a large bank or non-bank financial institution. In this realm, there are several notable initiatives.\n\nFirst, an effort is underway to create robust resolution regimes that allow large systemically important financial institutions to be wound down smoothly in a way that minimizes contagion and the risk of a broader panic or that causes damage to other parts of the financial system. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act gives enhanced resolution powers to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to use to wind down large, complex non-bank financial institutions. If such a firm becomes troubled, the regulators, with concurrence from the U.S. Treasury, can avert a bankruptcy filing and instead put the non-bank financial company into resolution. As part of such a resolution process, regulators are working to ensure that systemically important firms have viable recovery plans and that such firms have \"living wills\" that can help guide how such firms can be managed through a resolution situation.\n\nSecond, to reduce the likelihood of disruptive and highly costly failures, regulators around the world are evaluating whether bail-in forms of capital might be used to help recapitalize firms when they would otherwise lose their viability, or, alternatively, to help facilitate the orderly wind-down of a firm. Bail-in capital might consist of a well-identified tranche of debt that would convert to equity only if and when a particular set of trigger conditions were met. Such triggers might include breaching a certain level of regulatory capital and/or a regulatory determination that without conversion the firm would no longer be viable. One considerable challenge is how to define a set of triggers in a way that is sufficiently transparent and objective so that the bail-in process does not act as a catalyst and precipitate a run on other firms that might appear to have similar characteristics. In principle, however, by helping to recapitalize the firm, bail-in capital could help to forestall the need for a forced, rapid liquidation of assets and this might help to facilitate the orderly wind-down of a large, global firm that otherwise could not otherwise be easily resolved.\n\nThird, efforts are underway to reduce counterparty risk exposures by requiring that over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and equity and commodity derivative trades be standardized where feasible—and that all standardized trades be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). Standardized clearing through CCPs reduces the complex web of counterparty exposures that exist in the bilateral world of OTC derivatives. Everyone that centrally clears becomes the counterparty to the CCP. This enables a high level of gross bilateral exposures to be netted down to a much more manageable set of net exposures to the CCP.\n\nFourth, recognizing that mandated central clearing will only reduce risk if the CCPs themselves are robust, efforts are underway to strengthen financial market infrastructures. In the United States, for example, the Dodd-Frank Act instructs the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate certain financial market utilities (FMUs) as systemically important. Such FMUs would be subject to a tougher regulatory oversight regime. On a parallel track, at the international level, the Committee for Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are revising and strengthening a set of regulatory oversight principles and minimum business standards for financial market infrastructures (FMIs). These principles include numerous standards with respect to governance, access, risk management practices, and capital and liquidity standards. As Chair of the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems and someone deeply involved in the CPSS-IOSCO work, I believe that adoption of an agreed-upon global set of minimum standards for FMIs is essential if we are to have a safe global financial system.\n\nRecently, CPSS-IOSCO issued a revised set of such principles for consultation. Responses to the proposed principles are due back by late July. The CPSS-IOSCO plans to publish a final set of standards early next year. I hope and anticipate that countries will adopt these principles as the minimum regulatory standards for the systemically important FMIs that operate in their jurisdictions.\n\nIn summary, considerable effort is underway to enhance financial stability.\n\nThat said, I think it is important to recognize some of the important challenges in designing and implementing effective reform. Four broad challenges immediately come to mind. First, the resolution of large financial firms that operate in multiple jurisdictions remains largely out of reach—at least in the near- to medium-term. This is due to the fact that legal rules are not harmonized across the different regulatory regimes with respect to bankruptcy and liquidation. For example, although the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a resolution regime for the U.S. operations of a large global financial firm domiciled in the United States, this resolution framework stops at the nation's borders. Supervisors from different nations are working together in an effort to create more effective cross-border crisis management tools and resolution regimes, but this work is still in its very early stages and there are formidable obstacles to overcome.\n\nA second challenge is the uneven progress that has been made in reforming bank regulation and supervision across the different jurisdictions. For example, in some cases, the supervisory authorities have been quite forceful in making banks domiciled in their countries raise capital. In other cases, the response has been less aggressive. The uneven progress of reform makes comprehensive reform more difficult. It shifts the tenor of the discussion away from what is the proper macroprudential framework and set of capital and liquidity requirements to one that focuses too much on issues of relative competitiveness. Too often the questions asked are: What is most beneficial to the banks of my particular country? Do the regulations bolster or harm my \"national champion\"? The focus shifts away from the goal of bolstering global financial stability to finding ways of tilting or adjusting the new standards to achieve a national competitive advantage.\n\nThis is in not in anyone's interest. As discussed earlier, every nation has an interest in promoting financial stability globally, since the effects of systemic financial stress in one place can swiftly spread throughout the global economy. Moreover, although a relatively loose regulatory regime may attract business from other financial centers, there is no free lunch here. A more lax regulatory regime is likely to expose that country’s taxpayers to huge tail risks.\n\nA third challenge is the sequencing of reforms. For example, many jurisdictions are focusing on banking reforms, but have not yet applied the same intensity to shadow banking activities. If regulatory requirements for banks are increased significantly, the risk of stimulating the growth of the non-regulated shadow banking sector also increases. This suggests that the regulatory oversight effort has to be broadly applied so we just don’t trade one problem—for example, undercapitalized large banks—for another—a shrunken regulated banking sector and an enlarged, unregulated non-banking sector.\n\nSo what needs to be done? In short, plenty. Although we have made some progress in making the global financial system safer and more secure, there is much more to do. Several examples illustrate the range of issues that are still outstanding.\n\nFirst, we do need to adopt an additional capital requirement on large global systemically important financial institutions. We need this to reduce the risk of failure of such institutions to very low levels because we do not yet have the tools in place to resolve these institutions on a cross-border basis in a non-disruptive manner. We also need to do this because such institutions—by being perceived to be too big to fail—obtain a funding advantage, which higher capital charges can help offset. Without such a requirement, large banks can gain a competitive advantage just through their size.\n\nSecond, as discussed earlier, we have much more to do to ensure that we have a relatively level playing field. We need that to discourage regulatory arbitrage and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that might benefit narrow national constituencies at the expense of global financial stability.\n\nThird, we need closer cooperation among regulators. While regulators have successfully worked toward a much tougher regulatory regime for capital and liquidity, there are still huge opportunities for further progress. For example, regulators need to adopt more far-reaching protocols that allow for greater sharing of supervisory information on a cross-border basis to facilitate more effective supervision. But, this needs to be done carefully, so that proprietary business information is protected. Currently, regulators generally do not have access to the necessary information to fully assess the condition of foreign banks that operate within their borders. They have supervisory information about the activities and state of condition of the foreign bank branches and subsidiaries within their borders, but do not always have good access to information about the parent company or what the banking entity looks like on a consolidated basis. This has long been a difficult issue, though efforts are underway to find ways to enhance information-sharing.\n\nSimilarly, protocols need to be developed to share regulatory information about systemically important financial market infrastructures that operate on a cross-border basis. Access to the trade records of OTC derivatives activity that will be recorded in trade repositories also needs to be made available to be shared among regulators.\n\nFourth, we need greater clarity concerning the responsibilities of the home versus the host country, especially when a bank encounters problems.\n\nFifth, we need to work out how emergency liquidity should be provided on a cross-border basis. If a major financial market utility in London, for example, needs dollar liquidity to stay in operation, who will provide in it? Who will bear the risk and on what terms and conditions?\n\nThe political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa underscores once again the fact that we operate in a shared world economy in which events in one country and region can have large impacts globally. And to support this globalized economy, global financial firms and a global payments and settlement infrastructure are needed to support this activity. Yet, we currently operate with a financial system that is largely regulated on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThis is not tenable. What’s required is not some global authority dictating what national authorities can do but instead greater cooperation and trust in exchanging information and agreement on harmonized standards such as those laid out in the Basel III capital requirements and the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. There needs to be a good faith commitment to try to achieve a level playing field. The regulations and supervisory practices that are put in place should be determined by what is good for the public good writ large, rather than what benefits some narrow set of private financial institutions or markets.\n\nFinally, we need to be persistent. There is much work that still lies ahead. As the crisis recedes in memory, the natural reflex will be to relax and grow complacent. Already, some bankers are arguing that it is time to get back to \"business as usual.\" We have seen that \"business as usual\" results in unacceptable outcomes. So we need to keep working on a continual basis to make the global financial system more resilient and robust. We will not be able to avert all future failures or crises, but I know we can do much better in limiting the frequency, severity and the breadth of their impact when they occur if we keep pushing forward.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "content": "Good morning. I am pleased to be back in Puerto Rico to speak to you and meet with various communities in the Commonwealth. Each visit gives me a chance to deepen the Bank's relationship with the island. Last year I visited La Cantera and met with community leaders, business people, academics, bankers and government officials. This year I visited Goya Foods—the oldest Hispanic-owned plant in our country with subsidiary facilities in my home state, New Jersey, and upstate New York. I will also meet with a similar wide range of people to talk about what we do and to hear first-hand the economic and financial issues important to Puerto Ricans so that I can best represent all my constituents in my work at the Fed. Your beautiful island is unique within the Second Federal Reserve District. For me, personally, being here also recalls special memories of my childhood visit with my parents.\n\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to speak at the Export Trade Basics Forum, to help kick off the week-long summit on Education, Exports and Entrepreneurship that begins next week. This morning I will talk about economic conditions in the mainland and in Puerto Rico, paying particular attention to the developments since my visit last year and to the role of exports. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed\nBy way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do, and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, which was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the supply of money in the nation's economy. Congress designed the central bank to be decentralized, representative of all regions of the country—including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands—and independent of the political process.\n\nThe Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary policy—such as whether to adjust interest rates—in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC consists of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks. It meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings. At these meetings, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. My visit to Puerto Rico today is a part of these regional activities, in which I learn first-hand about the economic and financial conditions important to Puerto Ricans.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy. This means that at the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nFinally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of New York City to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to here in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nNow, what is the outlook for economic activity, employment and inflation on the mainland? In particular, what are the areas of vulnerability that we should be most concerned about?\n\nI am pleased to say that the economic outlook for the mainland has improved in the past six months. Despite this, we are still very far away from achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Faster progress toward these objectives would be very welcome.\n\nOn the activity side, a wide range of indicators show a broadening and strengthening of demand by households and production by firms. For example, on the demand side, after an unusually deep retrenchment during the recession, consumer spending has begun to recover, and that recovery strengthened considerably in the final months of 2010. Not surprisingly, businesses' orders and production are following suit.\n\nThese factors led to a 3.1 percent growth rate in our most comprehensive measure of national output (real, or inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product or GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2010. Growth for the first quarter looks likely to be similar, near 3 percent. In my view, the revival in demand and production—while not as strong as desired—suggests that we may be much closer to establishing a virtuous circle that will support stronger growth. What I have in mind is a cycle in which rising household and business demand generate more rapid income and employment growth, which in turn bolsters confidence and leads to further increases in spending. This is why we upgraded our assessment of the economy at last month's FOMC meeting, noting the economy is now on a \"firmer footing\". The major missing piece of the puzzle has been the absence of strong payroll job growth. We will need to see sustained strong employment growth in order to be certain that this virtuous circle has become firmly established.\n\nWith respect to the labor market, we have seen some conflicting signals. On one hand, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply over the past four months, dropping to 8.8 percent from 9.8 percent in November. On the other hand, payroll employment gains have been relatively modest.\n\nThe good news is that the data on payroll employment for the past two months was better than for the prior months. The economy added a notable 216,000 jobs in March. Particularly encouraging is the growth of manufacturing jobs. Over the past year we have added factory jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s. Other labor market indicators, such as initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits and the employment components of both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business surveys have also shown improvement recently.\n\nAlthough there is still uncertainty over the timing and speed of the labor market recovery, I am hopeful that job growth will increase more rapidly in the coming months. We would welcome this. A substantial pickup is sorely needed. Even if we were to generate growth of 300,000 jobs per month, we would still likely have considerable slack in the labor market at the end of 2012.\n\nSo, why is the economy finally showing more signs of life? In my view, the improvement reflects three developments.\n\nFirst, household and financial institution balance sheets continue to improve. On the household side, the 2008-09 rise in the saving rate appears to have stabilized in the 5 percent to 6 percent range. Meanwhile, the amount of money that households need to service their debt (for mortgages, cars, credit cards) has fallen sharply to levels that prevailed during the mid-1990s. Debt service has been pushed lower by a combination of debt repayment, refinancing at lower interest rates and debt write-offs. Financial institutions have strengthened their balance sheets by retaining earnings and by issuing equity. Bank lending standards, while still tight, have begun to ease somewhat. As a result, some measures of bank credit are beginning to expand again.\n\nSecond, monetary policy and fiscal policy have provided support to the recovery. On the monetary policy side, we at the Fed have maintained unusually low levels of short-term interest rates and engaged in large-scale asset purchases. These measures have fostered a sharp improvement in financial market conditions. On the fiscal side (that is, government spending and taxation), the economy has been supported by the shift in policy to help support growth. In particular, the temporary reduction in payroll taxes could have a strong impact on growth during the first part of this year.\n\nThird—and very much linked to the topic of this meeting—is growth abroad. Much of the rest of the world—especially the emerging market economies—have been growing strongly. This growth has led to an increase in the demand for U.S.-made goods and services. Over the four quarters of 2010, real, or inflation-adjusted, exports rose 9.2 percent. All told, real exports accounted for about 40 percent real GDP growth in 2010. In a few moments, I will talk about how this growth abroad also presents an opportunity for Puerto Rico.\n\nThe firming in economic activity, in short, is due both to natural healing and past and present policy support.\n\nIn this regard, it is important to emphasize that we at the Federal Reserve have been expecting the economy to strengthen. We provided additional monetary policy stimulus via the asset purchase program to help ensure that the recovery regained momentum. A stronger recovery with more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives is what we have been seeking. This is welcome and not a reason to reverse course.\n\nYet, we must not be overly optimistic about the growth outlook. The coast is not completely clear—the healing process in the aftermath of the crisis takes time and there are still several areas of vulnerability and weakness. In particular, housing activity remains unusually weak and home prices have begun to soften again in many parts of the country. State and local government finances remain under stress, and this is likely to lead to further spending cuts, tax increases, or job losses in this sector that will offset at least a part of the federal fiscal stimulus.\n\nMoreover, in recent weeks we have experienced several shocks from abroad that could have some impact on the economy's forward momentum, at least in the short term. For example, higher oil prices cut into household purchasing power, and the tragedy in Japan is leading to supply disruptions that may dampen growth somewhat in the near-term. Also, conditions in Japan, the Middle East and North Africa remain uncertain and could worsen, with negative implications for global economic growth. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the risks stemming from the longer-term fiscal challenges that we face in the United States.\n\nBut in the near-term, the most immediate domestic problems may recede rather than become more prevalent. On the housing side, stronger job growth should lead to more household formation. For example, more young people will be able to move out of their parents' homes when they get jobs. This trend should provide more support to housing demand. On the state and local side, a rising economy would boost sales and income tax revenue, and help narrow near-term fiscal shortfalls.\n\nWe also need to remain watchful to ensure that low interest rates do not foster a buildup of financial excesses or bubbles that might pose a medium-term risk to both full employment and price stability. In this regard we monitor interest rates on risky and safer assets. An unusual narrowing of these differences could signal that risk is not being appropriately assessed. These differentials for risk on U.S. assets in general do not seem obviously compressed today.\n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, the risk of deflation is greatly diminished. At the moment, both total, or headline, inflation and core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, have increased but remain below levels consistent with our dual mandate objectives—which most members of the FOMC consider to be 2 percent or a bit less on the personal consumption expenditures measure. Moreover, the rise in commodity prices is likely to put further upward pressure on headline inflation in the coming months. Provided commodity prices level off around current levels, the effect on inflation should be transitory. But we will need to ensure that commodity price pressures do not cause inflation expectations to become unmoored. If that were to occur, it would be more difficult to keep inflation in check.\n\nTo sum up, economic conditions have improved in the past year. Yet, the recovery is still tenuous. And, we are still far from the mark with regard to the Fed's dual mandate. In particular, the unemployment rate is much too high.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Puerto Rico\nNow let me turn to economic conditions in Puerto Rico. In contrast to the situation during my last visit, I am pleased to see signs that the Commonwealth may finally be emerging from this painful recession. Nevertheless, conditions remain difficult for many families.\n\nThe recession here has been deeper than the downturn on the mainland. By mid-2010, total employment in Puerto Rico had fallen by 13 percent or 138,000 jobs from its peak in 2005. This is almost double the 7 percent job loss on the mainland from the employment peak to its trough. Furthermore, the recession in Puerto Rico has lasted about five years—three times as long as the mainland downturn. The recovery has also lagged that of the mainland. While the mainland's economy began to recover in mid-2009, Puerto Rico's economy continued to decline for another year.\n\nBut, since mid-2010 there have been promising signs: Recently released revisions suggest that job growth on the island, while still very weak, improved modestly since last summer. And most of the weakness since then has not been broad-based, but instead concentrated in construction and manufacturing. The unemployment rate has come down by a full percentage point since its peak. However, at just over 16 percent, it remains unacceptably high.\n\nInflation generally remains subdued on the Commonwealth—although there has been some recent volatility. After a period of falling prices in 2009, inflation picked up in December 2009 with annualized rates of around 4 percent for a few months—with medical care a key driver for these increases. Since June 2010, reported inflation rates have reverted to a range between 1 percent and 2 percent. However, the rise in food and energy prices is likely to push inflation somewhat higher over the next few months.\n\nTo help keep track of conditions in Puerto Rico, we can now look at the Institute of Statistics' new Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PR-PMI), which is conducted in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association and Scotiabank. The survey shows that business conditions on the island were steady in January, following improvement at the end of 2010. The PR-PMI has signaled growth for seven of the past nine months. It will take some time before this new index has a clear track record, but we welcome this source of timely information on economic activity in Puerto Rico.\n\nNow, what about credit conditions in Puerto Rico: how much debt do families have and how have they been doing in terms of meeting their obligations? I needn't tell you how important it has been to monitor these trends over the course of the Great Recession. Using a new source of information—the New York Fed's Consumer Credit Panel—we can now track how families in the mainland and Puerto Rico have managed their credit in recent years.\n\nOverall, compared with the mainland, Puerto Ricans avoided much of the recent boom and bust in the use of household credit. Yet, signs of distress are readily apparent, owing to the long and deep recession here. Unlike the mainland, households on the island did not raise their borrowing much in the run-up to the recession. Thus, it is not surprising that Puerto Rico did not see the sharp spike in loan delinquencies that many areas saw from late 2007 to early 2009. Instead, Puerto Rico's delinquencies on household debt—that is, the proportion of debt where payments are 90 or more days late—have risen gradually as the recession has persisted. In 2005, households were behind on about 5 percent of the total debt. As of 2010, they were delinquent on about 9 percent of the debt, about the same as the national average—reflecting the stress imposed on many families by the deep and long recession.\n\nThe Outlook and Exports\nLooking ahead to the rest of 2011, I see grounds for cautious optimism. In particular, exports, which have been so important to the economic recovery on the mainland, have the potential to contribute to growth here in Puerto Rico as well.\n\nCurrently, Puerto Rico runs a sizeable trade surplus, selling more products to the world than it buys. In 2009, the latest year for which full-year data are reported, the value of exports was roughly $60 billion compared with roughly $40 billion of imports. Based on data through November, exports grew briskly, by about 10 percent, in 2010.\n\nWhat does Puerto Rico export? Pharmaceuticals are by far the island's largest export. In addition, Puerto Rico is a successful exporter of medical equipment, computer and electronic products, and electrical equipment.\n\nThe mainland is Puerto Rico's primary trading partner, accounting for half of the island's imports and three-quarters of its exports. There are many reasons for this. While Puerto Rico interacts with many other economies, for generations the mainland United States and Puerto Rico have had a special multifaceted economic relationship. One of the most obvious of these ties is the free flow of goods between the mainland and the island. Another link is our common use of the dollar. This means that tourists from the mainland can visit without worrying about changing currencies. In addition, businesses can make long-term investments in Puerto Rico without worrying that currency fluctuations against the dollar will undermine their competitiveness.\n\nThe island runs a surplus with the mainland that accounts for much of the island's overall surplus. So the signs of a further pickup in economic growth on the mainland bode well for the island.\n\nPuerto Rico's export markets also extend overseas. Aside from the U.S. mainland, the top export markets for the Island are Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. Exports to these four countries combined exceeded $11 billion in 2009 and have grown by more than 30 percent since 2007.\n\nThe success that Puerto Rico has in selling its goods and services to industrialized countries bodes well for the island's future. As more emerging economies narrow the gap between themselves and the more developed countries, the market for Puerto Rico's goods could well expand accordingly. Going forward, I would not be surprised to see Puerto Rico's exports rise further as your companies take advantage of the opportunities presented by the rapidly emerging economies.\n\nAt your upcoming forum and summit, you'll learn more about how to develop export markets for your products. I applaud your efforts to do so, as an important component of sustaining the vigor of the economic recovery in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Long View and the New York Fed's Role\nAlthough the signs I've mentioned suggest that the recession is over, the road to sustained economic growth is likely to be challenging in the near term.\n\nIn its favor, Puerto Rico has some important intrinsic advantages. These include natural beauty, a hospitable climate and unique status as a major U.S. economic and population center in the Caribbean. Perhaps just as important, the island has a relatively well-educated workforce. Research shows quite convincingly that abundant human capital is an important ingredient for a thriving economy.\n\nWe at the New York Fed aim to do our part to help sustain growth in the Commonwealth. For example, we co-sponsor a financial awareness video competition for college students here and the Community Reinvestment Act Week activities with the Puerto Rico Bankers Association. And, as a member of the Alliance for Economic and Financial Education we promote economic and financial education via teacher training, a high school economic competition, and a speaker series. The New York Fed also has several ongoing programs of technical assistance in Puerto Rico. We partnered with other organizations throughout the year to help provide technical training for community development professionals. We cover the costs of two to three professors who are engaged in macroeconomic and monetary policy research to attend our annual symposium on current economic conditions held at the New York Fed.\n\nWe also recognize that a healthy banking system and accurate economic statistics are both important components of a favorable business climate. To improve our understanding of the Puerto Rican economy, the New York Fed joined a group of local businesses to sponsor and fund a household survey, undertaken by the Center for the New Economy to benchmark Puerto Rican consumer finances. To help businesses and government in Puerto Rico, we have also been providing technical assistance to Puerto Rico's new Institute for Statistics in launching the new monthly manufacturing survey I mentioned earlier. We applaud this and other efforts to improve the measurement of economic conditions in Puerto Rico.\n\nAs a financial regulator, the New York Fed works to help the financial system run smoothly so that it can support economic growth. We are working hard to prevent the type of financial crisis that we recently experienced from recurring in the future, in a way that does not inhibit businesses from growing and prospering.\n\nWe are working closely with all of the banking supervisors and other key parties to facilitate an effective resolution to the problems facing the island's banking sector. Last year, some of Puerto Rico's banks were consolidated and many improved their balance sheets by selling underperforming assets. Both of these steps are likely to produce stronger, healthier institutions more able to make the sound lending decisions that support economic growth.\n\nAll of these activities, ranging from effective monetary policy and prudent financial regulation to fostering economic literacy and measurement, complement and reinforce each other to help support a strong economy in Puerto Rico.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the mainland economy experienced a pick-up in activity during the second half of 2010 that shows signs of continuing in 2011. The recovery in Puerto Rico has taken longer to get off the ground, but now shows signs of firming. On the mainland and in Puerto Rico, unemployment remains stubbornly high, but many indicators suggest that conditions are in place for stronger employment growth in the coming months.\n\nWith government and business leaders like yourselves working together to build a better future for Puerto Rico, I am hopeful that we will soon be able to look back at 2010 and see not only the end of the island's long recession but also the beginning of an era of growth and prosperity for Puerto Rico.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "content": "You may have noticed videos playing as you walked into the room. These videos are the winners of a Federal Reserve Bank of New York contest to promote financial literacy among young adults. This year, students from LaGuardia Community College took both first and second-place in the competition. The top winning video ran as a public service announcement at several movie theaters in New York City. All three videos are available on the New York Fed’s website and on YouTube.1 This is an impressive achievement and I applaud the students and LaGuardia Community College.\n\nAlthough some people may refer to Queens as an “outer borough,” I am quite aware that the center of population of New York City is in Maspeth, Queens. Of course, Queens is special not just for its central location, but also for its extraordinary diversity. Queens continues to serve as a land of opportunity for immigrants from all over the world. Roughly 46 percent of Queens’ population is foreign born—more than four times the national average and higher than any other county in the country with the exception of Miami-Dade. Sizable communities of immigrants from countries ranging from Columbia to Korea, Ecuador to Egypt, Greece to Guyana, and Italy to India have made Queens their home.\n\nThis morning I will talk to you about national and regional economic conditions. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed\nBy way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the supply of money in the nation’s economy.  Congress designed the central bank to be decentralized, representative of all regions of the country and independent of the political process.\n\nThe Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary policy in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC consists of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks, and it meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote. At these meetings, the committee members and I each present our current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders.  My visit to Queens today is a part of these regional activities.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nFinally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of New York City to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nNow, what is the outlook for economic activity, employment and inflation? In particular, what are the areas of vulnerability that we should be most concerned about?\n\nI am pleased to say that the economic outlook has improved considerably in the past six months. Despite this, we are still very far away from achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Faster progress toward these objectives would be very welcome.\n\nOn the activity side, a wide range of indicators show a broadening and strengthening of demand by households and production by firms. For example, on the demand side, families boosted their real consumption at a 4.1 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter. This compares with only a 2.2 percent annual rate during the first three quarters of 2010. Not surprisingly, businesses’ orders and production are following suit. And this revival in activity, in turn, has been accompanied by improving consumer and business confidence.\n\nThese contributed to a 2.8 percent growth rate in our most comprehensive measure of national output (real gross domestic product or GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2010. I actually suspect that this number may understate the economy's forward momentum. That is because real GDP growth in the quarter was held back by a sharp slowing in the pace of inventory accumulation. In my view, the revival in demand, production and confidence strongly suggests that we may be much closer to establishing a virtuous circle that will support stronger growth. What I have in mind is a cycle in which rising household and business demand generate more rapid income and employment growth, which in turn bolsters confidence and leads to further increases in spending. The only major missing piece of the puzzle is the absence of strong payroll job growth. We will need to see sustained strong employment growth in order to be certain that this virtuous circle has become firmly established.\n\nWith respect to the labor market, last Friday’s report helps resolve some conflicting signals. On one hand, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply over the past three months, dropping to 8.9 percent from 9.8 percent two months earlier. On the other hand, payroll employment gains had been very modest and were not consistent with a sustained drop in the unemployment rate.\n\nLast Friday we learned that the economy added 192,000 jobs in February, and estimates of previous job growth were adjusted upward modestly. Particularly encouraging is the growth of manufacturing jobs. Over the past year we have added factory jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s. This makes me more confident that job growth in January was temporarily depressed by unusually bad winter weather. Other labor market indicators, such as initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits and the employment components of both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business surveys have also shown improvement recently.\n\nAlthough there is still uncertainty over the timing and speed of the labor market recovery, I do expect that job growth will increase considerably more rapidly in the coming months. We should welcome this. A substantial pickup is sorely needed. Even if we were to generate growth of 300,000 jobs per month, we would still likely have considerable slack in the labor market at the end of 2012.\n\nSo, why is the economy finally showing more signs of life? In my view, the improvement reflects three developments.\n\nFirst, household and financial institution balance sheets continue to improve. On the household side, the 2008-09 rise in the saving rate appears to have stabilized in the 5 percent to 6 percent range. Meanwhile, the amount of money they need to service their debt (for mortgages, cars, credit cards, etc.) has fallen sharply to levels that prevailed during the mid-1990s. Debt service has been pushed lower by a combination of debt repayment, refinancing at lower interest rates and debt write-offs. Financial institutions have strengthened their balance sheets by retaining earnings and by issuing equity. As a result, some measures of bank credit are beginning to expand again.\n\nSecond, monetary policy and fiscal policy have provided support to the recovery. On the monetary policy side, we at the Fed have maintained unusually low levels of short-term interest rates and engaged in large-scale asset purchases. These measures have fostered a sharp improvement in financial market conditions.  On the fiscal side (that is, government spending and taxes), the economy has been supported by the shift in policy to help support growth. In particular, the temporary reduction in payroll taxes could have a particularly strong impact on growth during the first part of the year.\n\nThird, growth abroad—especially among emerging market economies—has been strong and this has led to an increase in the demand for U.S.-made goods and services. Over the four quarters of 2010. real exports rose 9.2 percent. After a disappointing performance earlier in the year, U.S. net exports surged in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe firming in economic activity, in short, is due both to natural healing and past and present policy support.\n\nIn this regard, it is important to emphasize that we at the Federal Reserve have been expecting the economy to strengthen. We provided additional monetary policy stimulus via the asset purchase program to help ensure that the recovery regained momentum. A stronger recovery with more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives is what we have been seeking. This is welcome and not a reason to reverse course.\n\nYet, we must not be overly optimistic about the growth outlook. The coast is not completely clear—the healing process in the aftermath of the crisis takes time and there are still several areas of vulnerability and weakness. In particular, housing activity remains unusually weak and home prices have begun to soften again in many parts of the country. State and local government finances remain under stress, and this is likely to lead to further spending cuts, tax increases, or job losses in this sector that will offset at least a part of the federal fiscal stimulus. And we cannot rule out the possibility of further shocks from abroad. For example, higher oil prices cut into household purchasing power, and the situation in the Middle East and Africa remains uncertain and dynamic. Also, we cannot ignore the risks stemming from the longer-term fiscal challenges that we face in the United States.\n\nBut in the near-term, the most immediate domestic problems may recede rather than become more prevalent. On the housing side, stronger job growth should lead to more household formation. For example, more young people will be able to move out of their parents’ homes when they get jobs. This trend should provide more support to housing demand. And anxieties about the large overhang of unsold homes represented by the foreclosure pipeline may overstate the magnitude of the excess supply of housing. Families that have lost their homes through foreclosures are likely to seek new homes as their income permits, even though many may re-enter the housing market as renters rather than buyers. On the state and local side, a rising economy should boost sales and income tax revenue, and help narrow near-term fiscal shortfalls.\n\nWe also need to remain watchful for signs that low interest rates could foster a buildup of financial excesses or bubbles that might pose a medium-term risk to both full employment and price stability. Fortunately, current risk spreads on U.S. financial assets are not unduly compressed. This suggests that people are still being relatively cautious about taking on a lot of financial asset risk.\n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, there are some signs that core inflation is now stabilizing after falling for several years. At the Fed, we track core inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy prices) because experience and research tell us that core inflation provides the best measure of whether overall inflationary pressures are building up or subsiding. Core inflation has proven quite reliable in predicting future total, or “headline” inflation rates. At the moment, both headline and core inflation remain below levels consistent with our dual mandate objectives—which most members of the FOMC consider to be 2 percent or a bit less on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure.\n\nRecent evidence shows that the large amount of slack in the economy has contributed to declining inflation over the past couple of years. I expect this slack to continue to dampen price pressures in the near term. Inflation expectations are well-anchored today and we intend to keep it that way. A sustained rise in medium-term inflation expectations would represent a threat to our price stability mandate and would not be tolerated.\n\nNevertheless, we always need to be careful about inflation—even in an environment of ample spare capacity. Let me focus on one issue, commodity prices, for a moment. Surely some of the businesses in the audience have faced the challenge of sharply rising oil, food or metal prices in recent months. For example, the spot GSCI—a broad measure of commodity prices—has risen more than 35 percent over the past year. This was in train before the upheavals in the Middle East and Africa raised market concerns about potential disruption to oil supplies, pushing energy prices—though not other commodity prices—still higher. Commodity price pressures are pushing measures of headline inflation above measures of core inflation, which, as I mentioned, exclude food and energy prices. You may have concerns that the rise in commodity prices will turn out to be persistent and, if so, how this might impact the inflation outlook.\n\nFrom a policymaking standpoint, there are important factors that suggest that it would be unwise for the Federal Reserve to over-react to recent commodity price pressures by raising interest rates soon. Why? First, despite the general uptrend, some of the recent commodity price pressures are likely to be temporary—due to poor weather or geopolitical uncertainties. This is certainly what is anticipated by market participants.\n\nSecond, even if commodity price pressures were to prove persistent, they have a smaller impact in the United States than they do in many other countries. Relative to most other major economies, the U.S. inflation rate is lower, the amount of slack much greater and commodities represent a relatively small share of our consumption basket. This small share helps to explain why the “pass-through” of commodity prices into core measures of inflation has been very low in the United States for several decades.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve's success in anchoring inflation expectations has also been important in limiting pass-through. Since 1984, for example, when the Federal Reserve began to achieve success in driving down and then subsequently anchoring long-term inflation expectations, there has been very little evidence of commodity price pass-through into core inflation. In contrast, prior to 1984, when inflation expectations were much less well-anchored, pass-through did occur and, at times, played an important role in pushing underlying inflation higher.\n\nThus, while rising commodity prices may be giving some of you a bad headache, they are not likely to lead to a sustained rise in inflation to levels inconsistent with our dual mandate. We will have to ensure, however, that these pressures do not cause inflation expectations to become unanchored. If that were to occur, that would be a troublesome development that would complicate the pursuit of our dual mandate of high employment and low and stable inflation Because we have an Federal Open Market Committee meeting next Tuesday, I will not comment today on the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy. \n\nOutlook for the Region and Queens\nNow, let me turn briefly to the situation here in the city and in Queens, in particular. While the national economic outlook improved considerably during the latter part of 2010 and into early this year, growth in New York City's economy appears to have slowed a bit.\n\nThe regional economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have developed a composite economic index for New York City. It incorporates measures such as employment, unemployment and income, and can serve as a barometer of the state of the local economy. Based on this measure, the city's economic activity, which had declined fairly sharply throughout much of 2008 and all of 2009, rebounded at an encouraging pace in the first half of 2010. Growth slowed in the second half of the year, but recently released employment data point to some pickup in the city’s economy in early 2011 and suggest that the local economic recovery remains on track.\n\nOver the past year, employment in the city has expanded fairly strongly in a number of key industries, including finance, professional and business services, education and health, and tourism, including air transportation.  Job losses in construction and government, however, continue to weigh down growth. Meanwhile, New York City's unemployment rate has edged down steadily over the past year, though it remains unacceptably high at 8.9 percent. Unfortunately, as in the rest of the nation, much of the recent drop in the unemployment rate has come from people withdrawing from the labor force so that they are no longer counted as unemployed. Some of the unemployed have been able to find jobs, but not in large numbers thus far.\n\nWhere do Queens’ residents find employment? While many of them commute to work in other boroughs (primarily Manhattan), Queens has a formidable industrial base of its own. As the home to the city's two major airports, the volume of air traffic coming through Queens ranks third highest among U.S. counties. Not surprisingly, then, transportation is Queens' largest industrial specialty; it accounts for 12 percent of total employment—four times the national average. Air transportation alone accounts for 6 percent of Queens’ jobs, or 15 times the nationwide share. But, of course, Queens has a diverse economy, with jobs in industries ranging from medical care to construction, not to mention printing and a number of other manufacturing industries that benefit from being in a large population center.\n\nDuring the recent recession, Queens' dynamic economy was hard hit, yet it proved more resilient than Manhattan’s and much of the nation’s. From peak to trough, employment declined by roughly 3 percent in Queens, far less than the roughly 7 percent plunge nationally and the 4.5 percent loss in New York City as a whole. Although borough-specific economic data are not quite as current as city-wide data, we at the New York Fed see clear indications that employment in Queens stopped declining in the first half of 2010. We hope that upcoming reports will show a sustained upturn. With prospects for the national economy improving in early 2011, the outlook for Queens’ diverse and vibrant economy—and New York City’s as a whole—seems to be brightening as well.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the national economy experienced a pick-up in activity during the last quarter of 2010 that shows signs of continuing in 2011. Although the city’s economy saw some loss of momentum, I would not be overly discouraged. After all, soft patches are not uncommon during economic recoveries. Both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains stubbornly high, but many indicators suggest that conditions are in place for stronger growth in the coming months.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1See top winning videos of the New York Fed's Financial Awareness Video Competition on YouTube:\nThink Twice Before You Swipe \nDebt Comedy Jam  \nCredit Card Arrest"

        "content": "In my talk, I'll argue that the economic outlook has improved considerably. Despite this, we are still very far away from achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Faster progress toward these objectives would be very welcome and need not require an early change in the stance of monetary policy.\n\nHowever, I'll also focus on some issues with respect to inflation that will merit careful monitoring. In particular, we need to keep a close watch on how households and businesses respond to commodity price pressures. The key issue here is whether the rise in commodity prices will unduly push up inflation expectations.\n\nInflation expectations are well-anchored today and we intend to keep it that way. A sustained rise in medium-term inflation expectations would represent a threat to our price stability mandate and would not be tolerated.\n\nTurning first to the economic outlook, the situation looks considerably brighter than six months ago. On the activity side, a wide range of indicators show a broadening and strengthening of demand and production. For example, on the demand side, real personal consumption expenditures rose at a 4.1 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter. This compares with only a 2.2 percent annual rate during the first three quarters of 2010\n(Chart 1). Orders and production are following suit. For example, the Institute of Supply Management index of new orders for manufacturers climbed to 67.8 in January, the highest level since January of 2004 (Chart 2).\n\nThe revival in activity, in turn, has been accompanied by improving consumer and business confidence. For example, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 77.5 in February, up from 68.9 six months earlier (Chart 3).\n\nIndeed, the 2.8 percent annualized growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter may understate the economy's forward momentum. That is because real GDP growth in the quarter was held back by a sharp slowing in the pace of inventory accumulation. The revival in demand, production and confidence strongly suggests that we may be much closer to establishing a virtuous circle in which rising demand generates more rapid income and employment growth, which in turn bolsters confidence and leads to further increases in spending. The only major missing piece of the puzzle is the absence of strong payroll employment growth. We will need to see sustained strong employment growth in order to be certain that this virtuous circle has become firmly established.\n\nWith respect to the labor market, there are conflicting signals. On one hand, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply over the past two months, dropping to 9.0 percent from 9.8 percent two months earlier (Chart 4). This is the biggest two-month drop in the unemployment rate since November of 1958. On the other hand, payroll employment gains have remained very modest—rising by only 83,000 per month over the last three months (Chart 5). Such modest payroll growth is not consistent with a sustained drop in the unemployment rate.\n\nThe true story doubtless lies somewhere in between—but probably more on the side of the household survey that tracks unemployment. That is because measured payroll employment growth in January was probably temporarily depressed by unusually bad winter weather. Although some of the recent decline in unemployment is due to a drop in the number of people actively seeking work, the household survey does show a pick-up in hiring. Other labor market indicators, such as initial claims and the employment components of the ISM surveys for manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, have also shown improvement recently\n(Chart 6 and Chart 7), which suggests that the weakness in payroll growth is the outlier.\n\nAlthough there is uncertainty over the timing and speed of the labor market recovery, I do expect that payroll employment growth will increase considerably more rapidly in the coming months. We should welcome this. A substantial pickup is needed. Even if we were to generate growth of 300,000 jobs per month, we would still likely have considerable slack in the labor market at the end of 2012.\n\nIn monitoring employment trends, we also need to recognize that the data are likely to be quite noisy on a month-to-month basis. This is particularly the case during the winter months, when weather can play an important role. Recall, for example, the aftermath of the blizzard of 1996 in the Northeast when the February payroll employment count was originally reported as rising by 705,000 workers. It will be important not to overreact to monthly data but to focus on the underlying trend.\n\nSo why is the economy finally showing more signs of life? In my view, the improvement reflects three developments. First, household and financial institution balance sheets continue to improve. On the household side, the saving rate, which moved up sharply in 2008 and 2009, appears to have stabilized in the 5 percent to 6 percent range. Meanwhile, debt service burdens have fallen sharply to levels that prevailed during the mid-1990s. Debt service has been pushed lower by a combination of debt repayment, refinancing at lower interest rates and debt write-offs (Chart 8). Financial institutions have strengthened their balance sheets by retaining earnings and by issuing equity. For many larger institutions, a release of loan loss reserves has been important in supporting earnings. Credit availability has improved somewhat as very tight standards start to loosen (Chart 9). As a result, some measures of bank credit are beginning to expand again\n(Chart 10).\n\nSecond, monetary policy and fiscal policy have provided support to the recovery. On the monetary policy side, the unusually low level of short-term interest rates and the Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchase programs (LSAPs) have fostered a sharp improvement in financial market conditions. Since August 2010, for example, when market participants began to anticipate that the Federal Reserve would initiate another LSAP, U.S. equity prices have risen sharply and credit spreads have narrowed (Chart 11 and Chart 12). Long-term interest rates have moved higher after initially declining, but this does not appear troublesome as it primarily reflects the brightening economic outlook.\n\nOn the fiscal side, the economy has been supported by the shift in policy toward near-term accommodation. In particular, the temporary reduction in payroll taxes is providing substantial support to real disposable income and consumption. This could have a particularly strong impact on growth during the first part of the year.\n\nThird, growth abroad—especially among emerging market economies—has been strong and this has led to an increase in the demand for U.S.-made goods and services. Over the four quarters of 2010 real exports rose 9.2 percent (Chart 13). After a disappointing performance earlier in the year, U.S. net exports surged in the fourth quarter (Chart 14).\n\nThe firming in economic activity, in short, is due both to natural healing and past and present policy support.\n\nIn this regard, it important to emphasize that we did expect growth to strengthen. We provided additional monetary policy stimulus via the asset purchase program in order to help ensure the recovery did regain momentum. A stronger recovery with more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives is what we have been seeking. This is welcome and not a reason to reverse course.\n\nWe also have to be careful not to be overly optimistic about the growth outlook. The coast is not completely clear—the healing process in the aftermath of the crisis takes time and there are still several areas of vulnerability and weakness. In particular, housing activity remains unusually weak and home prices have begun to soften again in many parts of the country (Chart 15 and\nChart 16). State and local government finances remain under stress, and this is likely to lead to further fiscal consolidation and job losses in this sector that will offset at least a part of the federal fiscal stimulus (Chart 17). And we cannot rule out the possibility of further shocks from abroad, whether in the form of stress in sovereign debt markets or geopolitical events. Higher oil prices act as a tax on disposable income, and the situation in the Middle East remains uncertain and dynamic. Also, we cannot ignore the risks stemming from the longer-term fiscal challenges that we face in the United States.\n\nBut in the near-term, the most immediate domestic problems may recede rather than become more prevalent. On the housing side, stronger employment growth should lead to increased household formation, which should provide more support to housing demand. And anxieties about the large overhang of unsold homes represented by the foreclosure pipeline may overstate the magnitude of the excess supply of housing. Families that have lost their homes through foreclosures are likely to seek new homes as their income permits, even though many may re-enter the housing market as renters rather than buyers. On the state and local side, a rising economy should boost sales and income tax revenue and help narrow near-term fiscal shortfalls.1\n\nMoreover, although we do need to remain ever-watchful for signs that low interest rates could foster a buildup of financial excesses or bubbles that might pose a medium-term risk to both full employment and price stability, risk premia on U.S. financial assets do not appear unduly compressed at this juncture.\n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, there are some signs that core inflation is now stabilizing. However, both headline and core inflation remain below levels consistent with our dual mandate objectives—which most members of the FOMC consider to be 2 percent or a bit less on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure.\n\nRecent evidence shows that the large amount of slack in the economy has contributed to disinflation over the past couple of years. This can be seen in the steady decline in core inflation between mid-2008 and the end of 2010. As shown in Chart 18, core PCE inflation in December had risen at just 0.7 percent on a year-over-year basis, down from 2.5 percent in mid-2008. Slack in our economy is still very large, and this will continue to be a factor that acts to dampen price pressures.\n\nNevertheless, there are several reasons why we need to be careful about inflation even in an environment of ample spare capacity. First, commodity prices have been rising rapidly (Chart 19). This has already increased headline inflation relative to core inflation, and the commodity price changes that have already taken place will almost certainly continue to push the headline rate on year-over-year basis higher over the next few months. Second, some of this pressure could feed into core inflation. Third, medium-term inflation expectations have recently risen back to levels consistent with our dual mandate objectives (Chart 20). If medium-term inflation expectations were to move significantly higher from here on a sustained basis, that would pose a risk to inflation and, thus, would have important implications for monetary policy.\n\nWith respect to the inflation outlook, I think there are four important questions that deserve attention.\n\nWith respect to the first question, the economy retains a very large amount of slack by virtually all measures. For example, last month the industrial capacity utilization rate was 76.1 percent. This compares with a long-term average of 80.9 percent (Chart 21). Similarly, the current unemployment rate of 9 percent is well above most estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)—the lowest rate of unemployment consistent with sustained price stability.\n\nIn the pre-crisis period, the NAIRU was likely in the region of 4.5 percent to 5 percent. There are several reasons why the NAIRU may now be higher. First, extended unemployment compensation benefits create incentives for prospective workers to keep looking for better jobs rather than accept less attractive positions. Empirical work on this subject suggests that the NAIRU might currently be roughly 1 percentage point higher because of this factor. However, this effect will only persist for as long as the extended benefits are in place.\n\nSecond, the rise in unemployment has been associated with an increase in the degree of mismatch between unemployed workers' job skills and available job vacancies. Some cite the upward shift in the Beveridge curve, which illustrates the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies (Chart 22), as evidence of this effect.\n\nThird, the longer that people are unemployed, the more their skills tend to atrophy, which makes it harder for them to become employed in the future. For unemployed workers, the median duration of unemployment has climbed and a growing proportion of the unemployed has been jobless for long periods (Chart 23).\n\nIn my view, these last two factors have probably pushed up the NAIRU by 0.5 to 1 percentage point on top of the about 1 percentage point effect of extended unemployment benefits, which is likely to be a temporary effect. Taken together, this suggests that the current NAIRU might be between 6 percent and 7 percent.\n\nAlthough undesirable, this rise should not create concern about the medium-term inflation outlook. First, even the higher estimate of NAIRU is still far below the current unemployment rate of 9 percent. Second, as discussed above, much of this rise is likely to be temporary rather than permanent. As the labor market improves, the extension of unemployment claims benefits will almost certainly be allowed to lapse. When this occurs, the NAIRU is likely to drop back to somewhere in the region of 5 percent to 6 percent.\n\nThird, some of the evidence that the NAIRU has increased is not particularly compelling. For example, the loop in the Beveridge curve that is evident now has been seen in past business cycles—cycles in which there was no persistent rise in the NAIRU. This strongly suggests that the rise in job mismatch has a cyclical component. Fourth, the 9 percent unemployment rate may understate the amount of labor market slack. That is because the labor participation rate has fallen sharply.\n\nIn my view, the large gap between the current unemployment rate and the long-run NAIRU suggests there is little payoff from investing much energy to more precisely estimate the NAIRU. As the economy expands and the unemployment rate falls, we will have plenty of time to be able to refine our estimates of NAIRU in light of what happens to labor cost trends such as the employment cost index, and to unit labor costs. Currently, all these measures are quiescent and consistent with a large amount of labor market slack (Chart 24).\n\nThe second question is whether the economy could grow so fast that inflation pressures could rise even with an unemployment rate still well above the NAIRU. The notion is that at very fast growth rates wages and prices might have to rise in order to funnel labor and capital to those areas where demand and output were rising particularly rapidly.\n\nAlthough this possibility shouldn't be ruled out, we should not be too worried about this, particularly if growth is broadly based. In particular, the economy is not growing quickly right now relative to past recoveries. For example, in the rebound from the comparably deep early 1980s recession, the annualized growth rate exceeded 7 percent for five consecutive quarters. Moreover, empirically there is little historical evidence that discontinuous “speed limit” effects play a significant role in influencing inflation in the United States.\n\nThe third issue is whether the rise in commodity prices will turn out to be persistent and, if so, how this might impact the inflation outlook. Recently, commodity prices have risen sharply. For example, the spot GSCI—a broad measure of commodity prices—has risen more than 35 percent over the past year. This was in train before the upheavals in the Middle East raised market concerns about potential disruption to oil supplies, pushing energy prices—though not other commodity prices—still higher. Commodity price pressures are pushing measures of headline inflation above measures of core inflation, which exclude food and energy prices. How worried should policymakers be about this development?\n\nAlthough there have been commodity price cycles in the past, commodity prices have not consistently increased relative to other prices, and indeed have declined in relative terms over the very long term. Historically, if commodity prices rose sharply in a given year, it has been reasonable to expect that these prices would stabilize or fall within a year or two. This property has been important because it has meant that measures of current “core” inflation, rather than current headline inflation, have been more reliable in predicting future headline inflation rates.\n\nIn contrast, over the past decade, commodity prices generally have been on an upward trend. For example, as shown in\nChart 25, fuel prices have generally been in a rising trend since 1999 and non-fuel prices since 2001—both trends interrupted temporarily by the financial crisis.\n\nSetting to one side the near-term effects of geopolitical developments, the rapid urbanization and industrialization of nations such as China and India could be generating an ongoing secular rise in commodity prices that might not be fully captured in today's spot and futures market prices. If so, this would undercut the role of core inflation as a good predictor of future headline inflation.\n\nNevertheless, there are important mitigating factors that suggest that it would be unwise for the Federal Reserve to over-react to recent commodity price pressures. First, despite the general uptrend, some of the recent commodity price pressures are likely to be temporary. In particular, much of the most recent rise in food prices is due to a sharp drop in production caused by poor weather rather than a surge in consumption (Chart 26). More typical weather and higher prices should generate a rise in production that should push prices somewhat lower. This is certainly what is anticipated by market participants, as shown in Chart 27.\n\nSecond, even if commodity price pressures were to prove persistent, the U.S. situation differs markedly from that of many other countries. Relative to most other major economies, the U.S. inflation rate is lower and the amount of slack much greater.\n\nMoreover, for the United States, commodities represent a relatively small share of the consumption basket (Chart 28). This small share helps to explain why the pass-through of commodity prices into core measures of inflation has been very low in the United States for several decades.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve's success in anchoring inflation expectations has also been important in limiting pass-through. Since 1984, for example, when the Federal Reserve began to achieve success in driving down and then subsequently anchoring long-term inflation expectations, there has been very little evidence of commodity price pass-through into core inflation. In contrast, prior to 1984, when inflation expectations were much less well-anchored, pass-through did occur and, at times, played an important role in pushing underlying inflation higher.\n\nThis leads to our final issue—the importance of inflation expectations in shaping the inflation outlook.\n\nRising inflation expectations tends to push up inflation in a number of ways—by reducing the expected cost of borrowing at a given level of interest rates, by pulling forward buying decisions to beat future expected price increases, and by encouraging more aggressive price and wage setting behavior. In a world of unanchored inflation expectations, commodity price pressures would more easily be passed through into core inflation.\n\nFortunately, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. This can be seen in all three major measures of inflation expectations. First, market-based measures of inflation expectations are generally well-behaved. For example, the five-year forward measure of breakeven inflation generated from differences in the nominal Treasury yield curve and the TIPS yield curve has shown a modest rise since mid-2010 back into the range that has generally been in place for the past decade (Chart 29). Second, the long-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters have been very stable. As shown in Chart 30, the median long-term inflation forecast in the Professional Forecasters' survey remains around 2.1 percent for the PCE deflator. In terms of household expectations, there has been an increase in short-term expectations. This typically occurs when commodities such as gasoline go up sharply in price. However, even here longer-term expectations remain well-anchored. As shown in Chart 31, the University of Michigan median five-year inflation expectations measure remains around 2.9 percent—comfortably within its normal range and historically consistent with slightly lower realized inflation.\n\nTo summarize the main points, we have a considerable amount of slack, little evidence of discontinuous speed limit effects, and little inflation pass-through from commodities into core inflation when inflation expectations are well-anchored, which is currently the case. This suggests that the biggest risk in terms of higher underlying inflation over the next year or two is that inflation expectations could become unanchored. This might occur, for example, if there were a loss of confidence in the ability and/or willingness of the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy in a timely way in order to keep inflation in check.\n\nIn this regard, the proof of the pudding will be in our actions—talk is cheap. What is key—that the appropriate policy steps are taken in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, let me make two points. First, I am very confident that the enlarged Federal Reserve balance sheet will not compromise our ability to tighten monetary policy when needed consistent with our dual mandate goals. Second, I am equally confident that no one on the FOMC is willing to countenance a sustained rise in either inflation expectations or inflation.\n\nLet me explain why our enlarged balance sheet does not compromise our ability to tighten monetary policy. Although our enlarged balance sheet has led to a sharp rise in excess reserves in the banking system, this has the potential to spur inflation only if banks lend out these reserves in a manner that generates a rapid expansion of credit and an associated sharp rise in economic activity. The ability of the Federal Reserve to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER) provides a means to prevent such excessive credit growth.\n\nBecause the Federal Reserve is the safest of counterparties, the IOER rate is effectively the risk-free rate. By raising that rate, the Federal Reserve can raise the cost of credit more generally. That is because banks will not lend at rates below the IOER rate when they can instead hold their excess reserves on deposit with the Fed and earn that risk-free rate. In this way, the Federal Reserve can drive up the rate at which banks are willing to lend to more risky borrowers, restraining the demand for credit and preventing credit from growing sufficiently rapidly to fuel an inflationary spiral.\n\nFor this dynamic to work correctly, the Federal Reserve needs to set an IOER rate consistent with the amount of required reserves, money supply and credit outstanding needed to achieve its dual mandate of full employment and price stability. If the demand for credit were to exceed what was appropriate, the Federal Reserve would raise the IOER rate—pushing up the federal funds rate and other short term rates—to tighten broader financial conditions and reduce demand.2 If the demand for credit were insufficient to push the economy to full employment, then the Federal Reserve would reduce the IOER rate—pushing down the fed funds rate and other short term rates—to ease financial conditions and support demand, recognizing that the IOER rate cannot fall below zero. While the mechanism is different, the basic approach is very similar to the way the Federal Reserve has behaved historically.\n\nAlthough our ability to pay interest on excess reserves is sufficient to retain control of monetary policy, it is not bad policy to have both a “belt and suspenders” in place. As a result, we have developed means of draining reserves to provide reassurance that we will not—under any circumstance—lose control of monetary policy. These include reverse repo transactions with dealers and other counterparties, auctions of term deposits for banks, or securities sales from the Fed's portfolio.\n\nA related concern is whether the Federal Reserve will be able to act sufficiently fast once it determines that it is time to raise the IOER. This concern reflects the view that the excess reserves sitting on banks' balance sheets are essentially “dry tinder” that could quickly fuel excessive credit creation and put the Fed behind the curve in tightening monetary policy.\n\nIn terms of imagery, this concern seems compelling—the banks sitting on piles of money that could be used to extend credit on a moment's notice. However, this reasoning ignores a very important point. Banks have always had the ability to expand credit whenever they like. They didn't need a pile of “dry tinder” in the form of excess reserves to do so. That is because the Federal Reserve's standard operating procedure for several decades has been a commitment to supply sufficient reserves to keep the fed funds rate at its target. If banks wanted to expand credit that would drive up the demand for reserves, the Fed would automatically meet that demand by supplying additional reserves as needed to maintain the fed funds rate at its target rate. In terms of the ability to expand credit rapidly, it makes no difference whether the banks have lots of excess reserves on their own balance sheets or can source whatever reserves they need from the fed funds market at the fed funds rate.3\n\nSo we have the means to tighten monetary policy when the time comes, but do we have the will? I think there should be no doubt about this. It is well understood among all the members of the FOMC that allowing inflation to gain a foothold is a losing game with large costs and few, if any, benefits.\n\nIn this regard, some have argued that Fed officials might be reluctant to raise short-term rates because such increases would squeeze the net interest margin on the Fed's System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. Although it is true that a rise in short-term interest rates would reduce the Fed's net income from the extraordinary high levels seen in 2009 and 2010,4 this will not play a significant role in the Fed's monetary policy deliberations.\n\nFed policy is driven by the objectives set out in the dual mandate, and the net income earned by the Fed is the consequence of the policy choices that advance those objectives. The Federal Reserve's net income statement does not drive or constrain our policy actions. In short, we act as a central bank, not an investment manager.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out in passing that a failure to raise short-term interest rates at the appropriate moment based on our dual mandate objectives would also be a losing strategy with respect to net income. Inflation would climb, bond yields would rise and the Fed would ultimately be forced to raise short-term rates more aggressively, or to sell more assets at lower prices to regain control of inflation. This would almost certainly result in larger reductions in net income than a timelier exit from the current stance of monetary policy. So what does this all imply for monetary policy? First, barring a sustained period of economic growth so strong that the economy's substantial excess slack is quickly exhausted or a noteworthy rise in inflation expectations, the outlook implies that short-term interest rates are likely to remain unusually low for “an extended period.” The economy can be allowed to grow rapidly for quite some time before there is a real risk that shrinking slack will result in a rise in underlying inflation. We will learn more as we go, and, as always, should be prepared to adjust course in a timely manner if incoming information suggests a different strategy would better promote our objectives.\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve needs to continue to communicate effectively about its objectives, the efficacy of the tools it has at its disposal to achieve those objectives, and the willingness to use these tools as necessary. This is important in order to keep inflation expectations well-anchored. If inflation expectations were to become unanchored because Federal Reserve policymakers failed to communicate clearly, this would be a self-inflicted wound that would make our pursuit of the dual mandate of full employment and price stability more difficult. If we consistently and effectively communicate our objectives and our strategies, we can avoid this outcome.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1 However, growth alone will not resolve the longer-term problem of the disparity between promises made to state and local workers in terms of their public employee pension and health benefits and the resources set aside to pay for those benefits.\n2 The IOER rate and the federal funds rate are likely to track each other closely in most circumstances. Banks do not have any incentive to lend reserves in the fed funds market at rates below the IOER rate, and can arbitrage away any significant price gap that emerges from the activity of non-depository institutions that can buy and sell federal funds, but cannot hold reserves at the Fed. Thus, through the IOER rate, the Federal Reserve can effectively control the fed funds rate.\n3 Indeed, even the opportunity cost of making the loan is similar in both instances. A bank that has excess reserves and decides to extend credit forgoes the chance to earn the IOER on the money lent out. A bank that borrows reserves in the fed funds market in order to extend credit pays the fed funds rate in order to do so. The IOER and fed funds rate are likely to be similar.\n4 As a byproduct of actions taken to combat the crisis, the Fed generated record net income in 2009 and 2010, and remitted $125 billion to Treasury. In the early phase a significant part of this income came from liquidity programs. More recently, the main contributor has been net interest on the expanded SOMA portfolio. At this juncture, SOMA continues to generate abnormally high net income. As policy eventually normalizes and the cost of financing assets via interest on excess reserves goes up, the net interest margin on the SOMA assets will return to more normal levels. However, the net interest margin is unlikely to turn negative because roughly $950 billion of assets are—and have been for many years—funded by notes and coins in circulation, on which the Fed does not pay interest."

        "content": "Good morning and welcome once again to the New York Fed's Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region—and through you, to the people in our District. This morning I will discuss national and regional economic conditions, with particular attention to household debt in the nation and especially in the Second Federal Reserve District, which covers New York; northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Following my remarks, my colleagues will provide more detail. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nTo provide context, let me first comment on national economic conditions. Since the Great Recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a modest pace. When we last met, in October, the available data showed that we hit a soft patch at mid-year. The recovery had slowed, extending the time before employment and inflation could be expected to return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. And, with the loss of economic momentum, downside risks had increased.\n\nIn order to foster greater economic momentum, reduce downside risks and speed up the return to more normal levels of unemployment and inflation, in early November the Federal Reserve announced its intention to purchase $600 billion of Treasury securities. These purchases helped to ease financial conditions, thereby stimulating economic activity.\n\nMore recently, we have seen signs of a pick-up in the pace of growth, with activity in the second half of 2010 turning out to be considerably stronger than most analysts expected. Real final sales grew at a 4 percent annual rate over the second half of 2010, up from 1 percent over the first half, led by surprisingly strong growth of consumer spending, continued strong growth of exports and slower but still healthy growth of business fixed investment.\n\nSeveral notable forces combined to encourage the resumption of stronger growth. On the policy side, as I mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee provided further stimulus through purchasing Treasury securities. This, plus the lagged effects of its previous measures, helped to improve financial conditions. Also, the Board of Governors' Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicates that, while the absolute level of lending standards remains tight, banks did begin to ease standards somewhat in the second half of 2010.\n\nThe pick-up in the economy has occurred despite renewed weakness in the housing market. Home prices have softened anew and construction activity remains stuck at a very low level, likely reflecting the continued large supply of unsold homes. We believe that it will take more time, perhaps as much as another year, for enough of these homes to be bought that residential construction might begin a meaningful recovery.\n\nOn the labor front, the most recent employment report for January 2011 is quite difficult to interpret. Only 36,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added, well below expectations. Yet, we get a very different perspective from the unemployment rate, which fell by 0.4 percentage points for the second month in a row and now stands at 9.0 percent. Job growth was undoubtedly held down by the severe winter storms that affected many major cities, including our own. The decline in the jobless rate was not an unmitigated positive, as a significant part of this decline was due to fewer people looking for work.\n\nThus, neither the disappointingly slow job growth nor the welcome steep drop in unemployment seems to paint the full picture. The truth lies somewhere in between. Despite the stronger job growth that we expect in the months ahead, we will continue to have a substantial amount of slack in our labor markets that will take time to absorb.\n\nAt this point, while the soft patch is over and the risk of a double dip has subsided, the economy still faces headwinds as a result of the aftermath of the financial crisis, the housing bust and the high level of unemployment that still prevails. As banks and other financial institutions seek to strengthen their balance sheets and avoid future credit losses, they may keep credit conditions tighter than normal. In addition, many consumers' borrowing options may be limited by their impaired credit histories, and the recovery is not getting the strong boost from home construction that most previous recoveries have benefited from. Furthermore, as I will discuss later, households are still feeling the financial impact of lost wealth and jobs, which makes some cautious about spending and investing.\n\nThe economy is healthier, but it is not yet well. In order to reduce joblessness significantly over the coming quarters, the economy needs to grow at a considerably faster rate than we have seen so far in this recovery.\n\nI am happy to say that we believe that conditions are in place for such higher growth in 2011 and 2012. We entered this year with a fair amount of momentum. Business and household spending has strengthened, presumably reflecting greater confidence in the economic outlook and progress in the repair of household balance sheets. Businesses are expanding their investments in equipment and software at a healthy pace. And, their spending on nonresidential structures, such as office and factory space is no longer contracting as sharply as it was a year ago. Further support comes from the agreement by Congress and the administration to postpone some tax increases, to reduce payroll taxes temporarily and to extend unemployment benefits. In addition, our exports continue to expand, supported by strength in demand abroad, particularly in Asia.\n\nHigher growth, a steady reduction in spare capacity in the economy and continued stability in inflation expectations should also slowly begin to reverse the recent decline in core inflation. Inflation was quite low during the second half of 2010, but we expect that to be the low point of the cycle.\n\nIn short, viewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability—the current situation remains unsatisfactory. However, we appear now to be moving in the right direction.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions (update since the October regional press briefing)\nNow, how is our region doing? Overall—in contrast to the pick-up in the nation—the regional economic recovery appears to have paused in the fourth quarter. More similar to the nation, joblessness in the region has retreated somewhat from the peaks recorded toward the end of 2009, but remains unacceptably high.\n\nAs attendees at previous regional press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the regional economy.\n\nBased on these measures, the upturn in economic activity that we saw for much of 2010 in both New York State and New York City has paused. To be sure, activity in both the state and the city is higher than a year ago, but we saw no increase over the prior quarter. This pause is particularly evident in New York City where the economic recovery had been relatively strong. By the way, let me note that this pause occurred before mid-December, so it cannot be attributed to the recent spate of heavy snow storms.\n\nBy contrast, New Jersey's economy has seen no pick-up in activity and, in fact, activity there continued to decline at a modest pace through the end of 2010.\n\nWe monitor Puerto Rico using an index produced by the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico. This index shows that the recession there, which started back in 2005—well before that experienced in the mainland—appears to have subsided. As of November of last year, activity was no longer falling, although indications of a recovery are still mixed.\n\nTurning to jobs, the latest data indicate that businesses in the region, on balance, were not expanding their workforces at the end of last year. As a result, the total number of jobs in the region has held steady, lagging behind the job growth rate experienced nationally.\n\nMuch of this recent weakness in employment stems from job losses in the retail, wholesale and manufacturing sectors in our region. In the rest of the nation, these sectors expanded during the last quarter. Moreover, our state and local governments cut jobs much more severely than governments did elsewhere.\n\nAt the same time, job gains in some of the region's strongest sectors—professional and business services, finance, education and health—were not large enough to completely offset these losses. At this point, it is difficult to say whether the recent pause in job growth is short-lived or not. As such, we will continue to closely monitor our region's job situation.\n\nMeanwhile, unemployment rates have ticked down across the region. Given the disappointing job numbers, it is not surprising that this change is largely due to a decline in labor force participation. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the labor force of both New York and New Jersey declined by about 0.3 percentage points, meaning that fewer people were actively seeking work. December's unemployment rate in New York and New Jersey, at 8.2 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, were below the national jobless rate of 9.4 percent for that month, though these rates remain painfully high. Puerto Rico's 15.7 percent unemployment rate, although down from its high of over 17 percent, still shows little evidence of a sustained improvement.\n\nOverview of Household Debt during the Crisis\nNow, let me turn to this session's special topic: household debt. This topic provides an important lens into economic conditions in our country and our region. How families are adjusting their saving, borrowing and spending in the aftermath the mortgage crisis and the Great Recession will help shape the path of the recovery.\n\nHere at the Federal Reserve, we try to answer questions such as: what is happening to households' credit, debt and delinquencies and what economic consequences will that have? This monitoring and research on household debt and credit conditions helps us better understand the connections between financial market developments, the broader economy and families' well-being. We follow a variety of metrics, including lending activity, the level of interest rates and of interest rate spreads, survey data on lending standards, delinquency rates on loans, and home and other asset price changes.\n\nOne new, key source of information on household debt and credit conditions is the New York Fed's Consumer Credit Panel. As you heard a few moments ago, these data are now available for all of 2010. They come from a nationwide sample covering all households where at least one member has a credit report. The records tell us about five major categories of household debt—mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and credit card, auto and student loans.\n\nTo set the stage, one can think about the recent path of household debt in three phases.\n\nThe nature of the run-up to the crisis has been well-documented, so let me focus here on the latter two phases: the crisis and convalescence.\n\nDuring the crisis, weakness in the housing market contributed to financial strains as many families found that their mortgages were \"underwater,\" that is, their homes were now worth less than their mortgage balances. As a result, they had no financial buffer they could tap if their finances came under stress. And, as the economy weakened further, many households faced sharply reduced incomes as family members lost their jobs or had their work hours cut. So, more families found it difficult to pay their credit card bills and other debt obligations on time.\n\nAs a consequence of these strains, households began the painful process of deleveraging. They started reducing the amount of debt they owed, relative to their income. During the run-up to the recession, households were saving only about 2 percent of their income; now they are saving around 6 percent of their incomes. This increase in saving was mostly used to pay down their debts, but it also included adding to their savings accounts and borrowing less. Of course some of the reduction in debt reflects loan charge-offs of bad debts. But work done here with the Consumer Credit Panel shows that some consumers also became more frugal, rebuilding their net wealth by paying down their debts. These actions enabled families to rebuild their financial reserves—precautionary funds that could be used in the event of a job loss or illness—to maintain their consumption and keep up with their mortgage payments. But to save more, it also means that they had to consume less, which dampened economic activity further.\n\nInterestingly, student loans are the only part of household debt that continued to rise throughout the crisis. More families and students may have needed to rely on loans to fund education during the difficult times. And going to school was more attractive for some, given the deterioration in labor market conditions.\n\nJust as households began deleveraging during the crisis, banks needed to respond in light of the large loan losses that they were taking. As defaults rose, banks tightened their underwriting standards and raised the margins that they charged on loans. As a consequence, they made fewer loans. This tightening of credit availability exacerbated the decline in real activity. It created an \"adverse feedback loop\" between the financial and real sectors of the economy that deepened the recession.\n\nWhere are we now?\nThere are several signs that we are now convalescing; this damaging dynamic—the adverse feedback loop—now appears to be reversing. From historical experience with financial crises we know that this phase is a gradual transition process—not a quick event—as households and banks slowly complete their painful adjustments. Once the adjustments are completed, households can consume more and regain their access to credit, and these developments help to support a more vigorous economic recovery.\n\nOf course, we don't yet know precisely where we are in this adjustment process. For example, families may choose a permanently higher rate of saving in order to rebuild their retirement savings. What they decide to do will depend in part on their expectations for future income, their outlook for the economy, what they think will happen to housing and stock prices, and prospects for taxes and benefits such as social security and Medicare payments. However, we do know that during good times few households are likely to be delinquent on their bills. And, overall, we'd expect their borrowing to grow at least modestly as the economy strengthens.\n\nThe Household Debt and Credit Report released today indicates that there has been a pick-up in credit flows. Households increased their non-mortgage debt last quarter, a development not seen since the fourth quarter of 2008. The number of credit card applications increased—an indication of a pick-up in consumer demand for credit. And, the number of open credit card accounts also increased slightly—as more accounts were opened than were closed. Of course, signs of distress continued: households are still reducing their housing-related debt and delinquencies continue to be a problem. So, the adjustments remain far from complete.\n\nIt is encouraging that credit flows are no longer contracting because households' renewed demand for credit has no doubt supported some of the recent rise in consumer spending.\n\nTrends in Household Debt in the Region\nOne key question we'll address today is how this process is playing out for households in our region. In general, our region has fared well in comparison to the nation as a whole. Following the three phases of the cycle that I noted for the nation, I will consider three questions:\n\nOne reason that households in our region have weathered this credit cycle relatively well is that debt levels are lower relative to income and this debt rose more modestly in the run-up to recession than in the nation as a whole. Using the debt-to-income ratio to help us make meaningful comparisons across different geographies, debt levels are particularly low in upstate New York and New York City. Three key exceptions to this generalization are Long Island, Edison, New Jersey and Puerto Rico, where household debt-to-income ratios have risen to levels above the U.S. average.\n\nSince the vast majority of household debt is related to housing, it is not surprising that debt-to-income ratios were highest and rose most in places that experienced rapid rises in home prices. So, for example, debt-to-income ratios are among the highest in the nation in those places most associated with the housing bubble, such as California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThis relationship can also be seen within our region. For example, household debt grew more slowly than nationally and has remained relatively low in upstate New York, which was largely bypassed by the housing boom. The key exception is New York City, where a large share of residents rent their homes. Overall, city residents still have relatively low levels of mortgage debt, even though these debt levels rose during the run-up to the recession. Elsewhere in the region, debt levels tended to rise most in places where housing prices increased the most, such as Long Island and parts of New Jersey.\n\nDuring the crisis, in most parts of our region, households reduced their debts. But, because they had not accumulated as much during the run-up, the decline was well below the national average. In general, households in our region—with some exceptions that I will mention in a moment—have not been under as much pressure to deleverage. It's particularly notable that in upstate New York, where debt levels are well below the national level, households have actually continued to very slowly add to their debt. Clearly, deleveraging has not been particularly consequential for many upstate New York households. The deleveraging process in other parts of New York and New Jersey, while quite severe by historic standards, has proved milder than elsewhere in the nation.\n\nNevertheless, many families in the region have had to make painful adjustments to their spending in order to pay down debts. These families tend to be concentrated in neighborhoods where households took on more debt during the run-up or sustained more severe income losses during the crisis. These factors contribute to delinquency rates that run well above average in certain areas, including certain parts of New York City and Long Island. In fact, some neighborhoods in these areas now have delinquency rates two to three times the national rate.\n\nLooking forward, we see some signs that the region is turning the corner on the credit cycle. After declining during the crisis, credit applications have begun to increase, suggesting that the demand for credit is rising. Although housing debt is still declining and delinquencies are still high, households in many parts of the region have sought and taken on some new debt in recent months. In particular, auto debt has been rising over the past year across New York, northern New Jersey and Puerto Rico—a signal that households in the region once again want to increase spending on durable goods, and are willing and able to borrow to do so.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, although the national economy experienced a pick-up in activity during the last quarter of 2010, the region saw a pause. The loss of momentum locally is disappointing because until the fourth quarter, much of the region was recovering somewhat faster than the nation. However, I would not be overly discouraged by this. After all, soft patches are not uncommon during economic recoveries. Both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains stubbornly high, but many indicators suggest that conditions are in place for stronger growth in the coming months.\n\nWith respect to debt, households in most parts of the region are in better shape than the nation as a whole. They increased their debt burdens less during the boom and thus have had less need to deleverage. In addition, there are emerging signs both nationally and regionally that consumers have begun to spend more and appear willing to take on some new debt. This bodes well for another step forward in terms of economic momentum in the nation and the region. However, high delinquencies in New York City and Long Island are a reminder that many households remain under significant stress."
