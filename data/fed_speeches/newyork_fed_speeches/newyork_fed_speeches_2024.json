    "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you for having me here today.1 The topic of today\u2019s forum, the expansion of central clearing in the U.S. Treasury market, is vitally important, and I look forward to learning from all of you over the course of the afternoon. The Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world, and it performs several important functions for our country and the broader financial system. Given the criticality of the U.S. Treasury market, the relevant authorities overseeing the market collaborate to ensure effective surveillance and coordinated policymaking. This work is done primarily through the Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance, called the IAWG, which consists of staff from the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the SEC, the CFTC, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This group has investigated expanding central clearing over recent years, and last December, the SEC finalized its rule for expanded clearing in the Treasury market.2 The rule has set the stage for this change in Treasury market structure that we are all here to discuss.\n\nIn my remarks, I will provide an overview of the market segments that are affected by the SEC\u2019s central clearing rule for the U.S. Treasury market. Then, I will offer thoughts on the benefits that central clearing can provide a marketplace\u2014essentially, the \u201cwhy\u201d behind this policy change. Of course, central clearing is prevalent in the listed and OTC derivatives markets represented by the Futures Industry Association, so I expect this group is very familiar with these benefits and market structure conventions. From there, I will discuss considerations around the implementation of the SEC\u2019s rule in the Treasury market\u2014the \u201chow\u201d of the policy change\u2014including access models for client clearing, margin practices, and the possibility of new central counterparties, or CCPs, entering the Treasury clearing space. Finally, I will conclude by reviewing the timeline leading to the rule\u2019s implementation and a call to action to engage with this change now. Before I go any further, let me provide the standard disclaimer that my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Market Segments Are Affected by this Rule?\n\nThe SEC's clearing rule amendments that were adopted in December 2023 will impact several key Treasury market segments.3 The SEC\u2019s final rule calls for clearing several segments of the Treasury and associated financing markets, with some exemptions: all repo and reverse repo with a direct member of a covered CCP; all purchases and sales occurring over interdealer brokers; and all purchases and sales between a direct CCP member and a registered broker-dealer and a government securities broker or dealer.4\n\nPractically speaking, these changes are expected to result in a significant migration of Treasury repo and reverse repo into central clearing. Additionally, principal trading firms\u2019 electronic cash trading will move into central clearing, due to those trades being predominantly executed over interdealer brokers. Market estimates of the daily transaction volume that will move into central clearing reach as high as over $4 trillion.5\n\nWhy Expand Central Clearing in the U.S. Treasury Market?\n\nAs I interact with Treasury market participants through my role at the New York Fed, I am sometimes asked why central clearing is being expanded in the U.S. Treasury market. Central clearing brings many of the same benefits to the Treasury market that it brings to other markets where it is prevalent. In a centrally cleared ecosystem, all trades are novated to a CCP, and the CCP becomes the counterparty to all of the trades. Central clearing allows for multilateral netting, which means that all of the trades that are novated to a CCP are netted where possible, reducing settlement flows and fails. Another benefit of central clearing is that the CCP sets robust and transparent risk management practices, including margin collection. These practices reduce the risks the original trade counterparties faced. Additionally, the official sector\u2019s visibility into clearing and settlement flows is improved as more trades go through CCPs, providing enhanced monitoring.\n\nThese benefits, while bolstering the market\u2019s resilience in normal times, will be especially valuable during times of stress when increased volumes and any rise in fails will benefit most from the efficiencies of central clearing.6 For these benefits to be realized, it is essential for any CCP clearing Treasuries to be effectively supervised and for its risks to be carefully managed.\n\nCentral clearing has long been a widespread practice in many other markets. For example, the U.S. futures market, near and dear to many participants here, has been centrally cleared for nearly 100 years, following the creation of the Chicago Board of Trade Clearing Corporation in 1925.7 However, in the Treasury market, the clearing and settlement of trades, especially secured financing transactions, is fragmented\u2014as documented in a series of white papers from the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), a committee sponsored by the New York Fed.8 This fragmentation increases systemic risk, and the migration of more trades into central clearing\u2014with its multilateral netting and its uniform, robust, and transparent processes\u2014helps mitigate this risk.\n\nConsiderations Around How Central Clearing Is Implemented in the U.S. Treasury Market\n\nWhile there are benefits to increasing the share of the Treasury market that is centrally cleared, there are also many considerations to take into account around how this expansion will occur. The transition will require CCPs to offer client clearing access models that will facilitate clearing of all required trades, prompt some market participants to change their margin practices, and potentially result in multiple new CCPs entering the Treasury market.\n\nClient Clearing Access Models\n\nFirst, focusing on client clearing access models, a question the market is considering is what clearing models will be needed to facilitate this large expansion to central clearing. The current Treasury market practice is for trade clearing and execution to be bundled together. This is referred to as \u201cdone-with\u201d clearing, since the trade is done with the dealer that sponsors it into central clearing. To be clear, bundling clearing and execution together is a business model practice preferred by the sponsoring dealer, rather than a market structure parameter imposed by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), currently the only CCP in the U.S. Treasury market. \u201cDone-with\u201d clearing provides balance sheet and capital efficiencies for the sponsoring dealer and may carry less operational risk overall. Meanwhile, many dealers lack the appetite to provide \u201cdone-away\u201d clearing\u2014where clearing services are provided to clients that have executed a trade with a different counterparty\u2014which has made centrally clearing these trades very difficult.  \n\nAs more trades are moving into central clearing, this market practice presents several key challenges. In the repo market, the challenge is how to centrally clear repo trades with dealers that do not offer sponsored clearing. The lack of firms providing unbundled central clearing and execution services also presents an issue for the cash Treasury market, since the interdealer brokers, who are the counterparties to the currently uncleared client trades, do not provide client clearing services.\n\nAs this audience is well aware, \u201cdone-away\u201d clearing is commonplace in other markets with central clearing, and trades executed with a counterparty can be cleared separately through a clearing desk at a dealer or a futures commission merchant. In fact, in OTC derivatives clearing, swap dealers are required by law to have conflicts of interest safeguards, including information partitions between business trading units and clearing units within the same intermediary.9 The emergence of increased \u201cdone-away\u201d clearing in the Treasury market could provide a clearer sense of execution costs and greater competition in trade execution and trade clearing provision, which should support improved market capacity and liquidity. I expect innovation in this space, and I look forward to hearing more about firms launching business lines or new models to facilitate growth in central clearing.\n\nMargin Practices\n\nSecond, another topic to consider as central clearing is expanded in the Treasury market is the effect this expansion will have on margin practices. One of central clearing\u2019s benefits is consistent collection of margin, which is sometimes expressed as a \u201chaircut\u201d in repo markets. Margin collected by a CCP is used to protect the CCP from the credit risk of the trade counterparty. Margin collection is a typical risk management practice employed across financial markets, but the use of initial margin in Treasury repo is quite inconsistent. For example, in the non-centrally cleared bilateral market, initial margin is often not collected on repo trades. The Office of Financial Research\u2019s 2022 pilot data collection in the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market found that over 70 percent of Treasury repo trades transacted with zero haircut.10\n\nSome argue that the lack of initial margin paid on Treasury repo trades is reflective of competitive pressures and a desire by the dealers providing repo funding to retain their client\u2019s business. However, others assert that the lack of initial margin paid by clients in repo markets is reflective of counterparty risk being managed by the dealers on a portfolio basis, taking into account all of the client\u2019s trades across the dealer\u2019s various trading desks. While in some cases these risks may be well managed by such bespoke arrangements, it is difficult to validate bilateral portfolio risk management practices from the outside given their opacity. Additionally, as the SEC\u2019s clearing rule is implemented, allowing easier segregation of customer margin, client cross-margining against futures may become possible over time, which should partially alleviate any need for the dealers to provide portfolio margining themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, in the centrally cleared sponsored repo market, sponsoring dealers often fund initial margin paid to the CCP on behalf of their clients, leaving themselves vulnerable to the counterparty risk of their clients. As I mentioned earlier, under the SEC\u2019s clearing rule, much of the currently non-centrally cleared Treasury repo will migrate to central clearing. Increased sponsored repo, at least initially, will likely fuel much of that migration. The expected growth in sponsored repo may make the current practice of the sponsoring dealer paying margin to the CCP on behalf of their clients less sustainable.\n\nIn both the non-centrally cleared and centrally cleared repo markets, the costs of counterparty risk management exist whether initial margin is collected from clients or not, since in a tail event the exposure will have to be unwound. For initial margin collection, those costs are explicit and observable, making them easy to measure and implement. When initial margin is not collected by the dealer providing client repo funding, not only are the counterparty risks not explicitly managed, but the clients are not required to pay for the risk management of their trades, which could potentially allow them to take on degrees of leverage that may be challenging to risk-manage, and which in aggregate can lead to greater financial stability risks.\n\nThese are critical issues to be dealt with as the market progresses toward increased central clearing. That is why the TMPG is currently working on a white paper on risk management in the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, including a comparative review of margin practices across repo market segments.11\n\nProspect for Additional Treasury CCPs\n\nFinally, a third consideration to evaluate as we engage with this market change is the prospect for the entry of additional CCPs into the Treasury market. As I mentioned earlier, FICC is currently the only CCP in the U.S. Treasury market. However, CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange, and LCH Group have all expressed interest in operating CCPs in the Treasury market.12 This possibility raises several questions about what the ideal state of CCPs in the Treasury market might be.\n\nOn the one hand, there may be advantages to having multiple CCPs serve a market. One benefit is that competition can result in improved clearing offerings and pricing by the CCPs. Additionally, market participants that already have a preexisting relationship with a CCP due to their activity in non-Treasury products may prefer to direct their Treasury trades to that CCP for any efficiencies that may be gained. Finally, the existence of multiple CCPs would allow for the clearing and settlement risk in the Treasury market to be dispersed across multiple providers, diversifying where the risk resides.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also important to consider the potential benefits to concentrating central clearing in one CCP. Multilateral netting is a benefit of central clearing, where trades are netted down, reducing settlement flows, fails, and frictions. To the extent that the trades in a market are concentrated in one CCP, the network effects of multilateral netting are maximized. Additionally, a single CCP reduces commercial pressures to potentially reduce risk management standards at the CCP, colloquially known as a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, in other markets where central clearing is prevalent, while there are sometimes multiple CCPs, competitive dynamics have resulted in fairly high CCP concentration.13 Of course, the U.S. Treasury market is unique in its size, depth, and importance, so it remains to be seen which dynamics will prevail in its central clearing space. Ultimately, market participants should determine the number of infrastructures they need to support the payment, clearance, and settlement activities for the U.S. Treasury market.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nRegarding the road ahead, given the importance and scope of this market structure change, it is crucial for market participants to identify how the SEC rule affects their businesses and to develop plans for centrally clearing eligible transactions if they do not do so already. Treasury cash central clearing is required to go into effect by the end of 2025, and repo central clearing is required to go into effect by June 30, 2026. We now have only a little over a year until this first central clearing requirement deadline, and the time will pass quickly given the complexities involved.\n\nMarket participants will need to ensure that they have robust risk management frameworks, legal agreements, and operational infrastructures in place. As we have observed with other complex industry transitions, such as the reference rate transition and the implementation of swaps central clearing, all of this takes time. Market participants should be taking concrete steps now to prepare for expanded central clearing in the Treasury market, and the New York Fed and others in the official sector will be monitoring this progress.\n\nWe are already seeing some market participants proactively engage with this change. FICC\u2019s daily Treasury clearing activity surpassed $10 trillion on September 30, a significant increase from an average daily clearing volume of $7 trillion just six months ago, indicating that some market participants are moving more activity into clearing ahead of the mandate compliance dates.14 I was also pleased to see that SIFMA and SIFMA AMG recently published master Treasury securities clearing agreements for \u201cdone-with\u201d trading, and I look forward to their progress on similar documents for \u201cdone-away\u201d trading and addendums for master repo agreements.15 I am thankful that events like today\u2019s forum will advance the discussion and awareness around these initiatives, and I encourage all of you to make it a priority at your organizations to actively engage in this transition.\n\nThe expansion of central clearing in the U.S. Treasury market that will occur because of the SEC\u2019s central clearing rule is a transformative change. As we go through this transition, it is important to remember why central clearing is beneficial for markets. There are many details to be determined as we figure out the how of expanding central clearing, and it will require all of us to work together to determine the best path forward to bring this market structure change into reality. Thank you."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. I\u2019m so pleased to be here at Binghamton University, a true gem of the SUNY system. Meeting with students, educators, and business and community leaders is a valuable and enjoyable part of my job.\n\nThe New York Fed represents the Federal Reserve System\u2019s Second District, which includes New York State, northern New Jersey, western Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This is a diverse region made up of many smaller local economies. Therefore, it\u2019s important for me and my colleagues at the New York Fed to collect data and learn about the challenges and opportunities facing all of the communities we serve.\n\nThat said, monetary policy affects everyone, and the Federal Reserve is committed to using its tools to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Today, I will talk about monetary policy and how the Fed is working to fulfill this dual mandate. I\u2019ll also give you my outlook on the U.S. economy.\n\nBefore I do, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nObsessing Over Data\n\nAs I\u2019ve traveled around the Southern Tier region, I\u2019ve enjoyed seeing the emergence of the colors of autumn. Tracking fall foliage is a hobby for many. What I like is that it\u2019s all about data. \u201cLeaf peepers\u201d submit field reports on changing color conditions, and experts pore over the information. One forecast predicts we will hit peak foliage in four days.1\n\nAt the Fed, we\u2019re equally obsessed with data. In our case, we study data about the economy\u2014whether here in the district, across the country, or around the world. So, I\u2019ll highlight some of the data that help my understanding of how the economy is performing relative to our dual mandate goals, as well as what policy actions we can take to achieve these goals.\n\nWhen inflation became unacceptably high and the labor market exceptionally tight, the FOMC acted with resolve to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent longer-run target. The Committee\u2019s strong actions have helped bring the economy much closer to our goals. Imbalances between supply and demand in the economy have mostly dissipated, even as the economy and employment have continued to grow. And inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has declined from over 7 percent in June of 2022 to just 2-1/4 percent in the latest reading. There\u2019s still some distance to go to reach our goal of 2 percent, but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction.\n\nThe data paint a picture of an economy that has returned to balance, or in a word that the English majors in the room may appreciate, \u201cequipoise.\u201d In light of the progress we have seen in reducing inflation and restoring balance to the economy, the FOMC decided at its most recent meeting to lower the interest rate that it sets. Simply put, this action will help maintain the strength of the economy and labor market while inflation moves back to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\n\nMoving to Price Stability\n\nI\u2019ll go further into our policy decision and what it means for the economic outlook in a minute. But first, I\u2019ll give more details about each side of our dual mandate, starting with inflation. I\u2019ll use an onion analogy that I have found useful over the past two years to demonstrate how inflation\u2019s three distinct layers are normalizing at different rates.2\n\nThe onion\u2019s outer layer represents globally traded commodities. As the economy started to rebound from pandemic shutdowns and demand began to soar, inflation surged, then rose further when Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, supply and demand have come into balance, and these prices have generally been flat or falling.\n\nThe middle onion layer is made up of core goods, excluding commodities. Demand for goods rose sharply as the economy emerged from the pandemic downturn\u2014just as global pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions significantly hampered supply. But, as seen in the New York Fed\u2019s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, those supply pressures have eased, and core goods inflation has returned to pre-pandemic norms.3\n\nThe inner onion layer comprises core services. Although this category is taking the longest to normalize, the disinflationary process is well underway here too. For example, measures of underlying inflation that tend to be heavily influenced by core services inflation today average around 2-1/2 percent.4\n\nOne positive piece of data that reinforces my confidence that inflation is on course to reach our 2 percent goal is that inflation expectations remain well anchored across all forecast horizons. This is seen in the New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations as well as other surveys and market-based measures.5\n\nA Labor Market in Balance\n\nNow I\u2019ll turn to the employment side of our mandate. And no surprise, I\u2019ll point to data. A wide range of metrics\u2014including the unemployment rate; measures of job openings, hiring, quits, and employment flows; and perceptions of job and worker availability\u2014indicate that the very tight labor market of the past few years has now returned to more normal conditions and is unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressures going forward.\n\nRecent analysis by researchers at the New York Fed provides a useful way to gauge whether the labor market is tight or loose.6 They find that you can effectively summarize the state of the overall labor market in terms of its effect on compensation growth by using just two indicators: the rate at which employees quit their jobs and the ratio of job openings to job seekers. In fact, once you take these two measures into account, other labor market metrics that get a lot of attention\u2014such as the unemployment rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio\u2014don\u2019t provide additional useful information. \n\nCombining these two measures into an index of labor market tightness provides two key insights. First, data as of the second quarter of this year indicate that the labor market is about where it was in early 2018\u2014a period of solid labor market conditions and low inflation. Second, compensation growth should soon return to levels that prevailed prior to the pandemic.\n\nSeasons of Change\n\nSo, the labor market is solid. The economy is in a good place. And inflation is closing in on our 2 percent longer-run goal. With the risks to achieving our goals now in balance, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by half a percentage point, to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. In addition, the Committee continued to normalize the holdings of securities on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet.7\n\nLooking ahead, based on my current forecast for the economy, I expect that it will be appropriate to continue the process of moving the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral setting over time. The timing and pace of future adjustments to interest rates will be based on the evolution of the data, the economic outlook, and the risks to achieving our goals. We will continue to be data-dependent and attuned to the evolution of economic conditions in making our decisions.\n\nWith monetary policy moving to a more neutral setting over time, I expect real GDP to grow between 2-1/4 and 2-1/2 percent this year and to average about 2-1/4 percent over the next two years. I anticipate the unemployment rate to edge up from its current level of about 4 percent to around 4-1/4 percent at the end of this year and stay around that level next year. With the economy in balance and inflation expectations well anchored, I expect overall PCE inflation to be around 2-1/4 percent this year, and to be close to 2 percent next year.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe economy has been on a remarkable journey. In two years, the red-hot labor market has normalized, and inflation has come within striking distance of our 2 percent longer-run goal\u2014all while employment and the economy continue to grow.\n\nWe instituted and maintained a very restrictive monetary policy stance until the data gave us confidence that inflation is sustainably on course to 2 percent. With this progress toward achieving price stability, moving toward a more neutral monetary policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and labor market. Although the outlook remains uncertain, we are well positioned to achieve our dual mandate goals."

    "content": "Good morning. Let me welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and to our second Future of New York City conference. And thank you to the speakers, participants, and organizers who make this such a valuable forum.\n\nThis year we are celebrating the centennial of this landmark building here at 33 Liberty Street. We are proud of our history as a downtown anchor institution and look forward to the next 100 years.\n\nBefore I go further, let me give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt was not too long ago\u2014a little over four years back\u2014when some predicted that the future of New York City was quite bleak. Others even went as far to declare that New York City is dead forever.\n\nWell, that forecast didn\u2019t age well.\n\nI imagine those of you sitting right here in this auditorium would agree with me. Just to get here this morning, you likely had to catch a ride on a crowded subway, train, bus, or ferry. Or maybe you were brave enough to drive over a bridge or through a tunnel and then search for parking. Perhaps you stood in a long line waiting for coffee or a pastry, or dodged tourists taking a photo right in the middle of the sidewalk. I won\u2019t even mention the e-scooters and bikes. And it\u2019s only 9:00 a.m.\n\nThat\u2019s because New York City is again one of the most alive cities on Earth.\n\nIn truth, that 2020 forecast was based on the reality during that moment in time, at least economically speaking. New York City was the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., and our region was hit especially hard. According to New York Fed business surveys, business activity plunged to historic lows in April 2020, as fear of contagion kept many people at home and efforts to stop the spread of the virus shutdown large parts of the regional economy.1 About 60 percent of service-based businesses and more than half of manufacturers reported at least a partial shutdown of their operations early on in the pandemic. Layoffs were widespread. The initial job loss of more than 20 percent in New York City exceeded the national decline of 15 percent.2 You\u2019ll hear more about how the employment situation has evolved over the past four years from my colleague Jaison Abel in a few minutes.\n\nI lived and worked here in Lower Manhattan, so I remember just what that drastic change felt like. The city went from being packed at all hours of the day to being almost unrecognizable. Here at the New York Fed and in offices just like ours across the city, only essential workers came to work in person. And neighborhood businesses and services\u2014and the employees that supported them\u2014suffered as a result.\n\nBut after that chapter came a remarkable rebound. To be clear, things are not exactly the same as they were prior to the pandemic. The city had to adapt to changes in office attendance and commute patterns, and the fallout is still lingering. But we are back on our feet, and the current reality is far different from the onset of pandemic and the period that followed. One indication that\u2019s important for our conversation today is that we\u2019ve recovered the jobs lost during the pandemic and then some.\n\nNow, shows and venues are packed. It\u2019s hard to get restaurant reservations at certain places. Apartment vacancies are low. And office workers are back, even if in some cases it\u2019s only a few days a week.\n\nWhen we first hosted this conference in 2022, the discussion focused on remote work and the city\u2019s infrastructure, with a particular focus on an equitable recovery. The overarching question that shaped our conversations in that moment was, \u201cWhat is the future of New York City?\u201d\n\nNow, that question has shifted. There\u2019s no doubt that New York City has a great future. So today, we\u2019re asking, \u201cWhat kind of future do we want to build for New York City?\u201d\n\nThe future will build and expand on what has worked so well for the city in the past. The foundational aspects that have made New York so successful for so long are still present. The excitement and enthusiasm that draw people to live and work here have not changed. At the same time, many of the challenges have not changed either. For example, the high cost of living and housing availability are still predominant concerns, among others.\n\nThe entertainment, arts, businesses, culture, and landmarks that we have here in New York cannot be replicated elsewhere. But those experiences can only be had if there are jobs and a healthy economy to support it all. It\u2019s important that we invest in the study of the challenges and opportunities for employment in this city, so that we can build the future.\n\nOur conference today will do just that. In our sessions this morning, we\u2019ll talk about how employment was and continues to be impacted by shifts in the city. And we\u2019ll discuss similarities and distinctions across industries and occupations, initiatives that will attract and retain a robust workforce, and more.\n\nThanks again to our speakers and panelists for the knowledge and insight they bring to this event, and to all of you for attending and demonstrating your commitment to shaping the future of this great city."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nWelcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us. And a special thank you to those who make today\u2019s event so powerful: the distinguished speakers, panelists, and event organizers. We have a packed agenda on a variety of important topics, and I look forward to hearing about the progress we\u2019ve made and priorities for the future.\n\nTen Years Gone\n\nToday marks our tenth annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference, and a decade of partnership between our agencies. These conferences have proven to be a valuable forum to share insights and perspectives on the evolution of the Treasury market, identify challenges and risks to smooth market functioning, and, most importantly, discuss ways to enhance its resilience and effectiveness in both good times and bad times.\n\nThe New York Fed is proud to host this conference each year. It leverages\u2014sorry, I realize that leverage is not a popular word in this crowd\u2014it draws upon our strength as a convener of market participants, academics, policymakers, and central bankers. Today, I\u2019ll take a look at how our interagency collaboration has strengthened our understanding of Treasury market resiliency and that of adjacent markets. And I\u2019ll talk about the importance of continuing this work over the next decade and beyond. I will also share some news about our ongoing commitment to ensuring that our financial system continues to stand on a strong foundation of sound reference rates.\n\nNow, let me give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nStairway to the Annual Conference\n\nLet\u2019s think back to the middle of October 2014, when U.S. Treasury yields plunged and then quickly rebounded, an episode later named the \u201cflash rally.\u201d\n\nThis episode was an impetus for the drafting of a joint staff report that ultimately led to the inaugural U.S. Treasury Market Conference in 2015.1 That conference first brought together what is now known as the \u201cJoint Member Agencies\u201d to discuss the evolving structure of the Treasury market. That meeting focused on potential operational risks, regulatory requirements, and repo market considerations.2 It drew about 300 people\u2014an impressive figure for the first year. I know that some who participated in that conference are here again today.\n\nThe organizers recognized that it would be important to have a regular forum to address developments in the Treasury market and adjacent markets, in order to continue to study structural issues and explore ongoing developments as a way to prevent disruptions to the system.\n\nTo be clear, attention on the function of the Treasury market didn\u2019t start in 2015. In fact, if you read Fed history\u2014a genre of literature that I particularly enjoy\u2014it\u2019s clear that the importance of Treasury market functioning was central to the Federal Reserve and the New York Fed for a long time. But what became apparent in more recent times was that as the markets evolved, the need for formal joint-agency collaboration and engagement with the private sector became more pressing.\n\nWhen the Levee Breaks\n\nWhat drives all of our efforts\u2014from staff reports, to conferences, to actions, and all the communication in between\u2014 is that liquid, well-functioning markets for Treasury and related securities are absolutely essential for credit to flow and the economy to prosper.3 It\u2019s not an overstatement that a well-functioning U.S. Treasury market is critical to our economy, and, in fact, to the entire world.4\n\nThe Song Remains the Same\n\nWhat are some of the themes that we\u2019ve discussed at these conferences, and what\u2019s been the impact on our financial system?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look back at that first joint staff report. It made the case on two notable fronts. First, it highlighted that principal trading firms played a much larger role in the electronic trading market than was previously understood. Second, it highlighted the need for improved transparency and increased availability of Treasury market data.\n\nTen years gone, the song remains the same. Those themes are still at the forefront of our conversations. For example, while principal trading firms still continue to be a big presence in the Treasury market, hedge funds now also play an important role. The work monitoring the changing investor base and participant types continues through this forum and the work of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance and the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\n\nOn the data side, we\u2019ve made tremendous progress toward increased data transparency with the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) data initiative. And we\u2019ve seen efforts to further increase the transparency of this data to the public. In March of this year, TRACE began publishing daily transaction data on on-the-run securities at the end of the day. In fact, at this very podium last year, I said that we must continue to prioritize transparency and clarity in financial data, especially in the age of AI, when the sources of data are harder to ascertain.5\n\nI\u2019d be remiss if I did not mention expanded central clearing as another key theme that has emerged over the years. This is a major shift that is an outgrowth of our work. We\u2019ll hear more about that in a panel discussion later today, and I look forward to the continued progress the market will make on this front as we move toward the implementation deadlines of the SEC\u2019s clearing rule.\n\nWhat Is and What Should Never Be\n\nBefore I cede the stage, I will end on a topic that is at the core of the financial system and closely connected to the Treasury market: reference rates. Thankfully, we have said good riddance to LIBOR, and our financial system is now resting on a safe and solid foundation.\n\nI know I promised not to bring up LIBOR again at this conference. But the LIBOR saga taught us all two important lessons. First, enormous systemic risk can build in the global financial system gradually over time, and second, it took a complex, expensive, decade-long effort to fix that problem. We must not repeat that experience.\n\nTo that end, I am pleased to announce that today, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is launching the Reference Rate Use Committee, or RRUC. It will convene private market participants to support integrity, efficiency, and resiliency in the use of interest rate benchmarks\u2014or reference rates\u2014across financial markets, including the rates published by the New York Fed. Its first meeting will occur in October.\n\nThe RRUC will focus on key issues regarding reference rates, including how their use is evolving and how the markets underpinning them may be changing too. It will promote best practices related to the use of reference rates, including the recommendations set out by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) during the transition away from LIBOR.6 In this way, the RRUC will serve as an essential partnership that builds upon the work and accomplishments of the ARRC, by helping to preserve a robust system of reference rates. This work will complement international efforts at the Bank for International Settlements and the Financial Stability Board to monitor developments in the use of interest rate benchmarks and ensure that we never have to face a problem like LIBOR again.7\n\nBring It On Home\n\nI will now bring it on home. We are now at the bridge to the next 10 years of the U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Although there has been significant progress, the growth and evolution of this market remind us of the importance of staying focused on this work and continuing to make progress in the years ahead. In an era of heightened uncertainty and volatility, it is essential that the U.S. Treasury market remain liquid and resilient, so that all financial markets can operate effectively. If you were ever in doubt of how important this is, the experience of the past several years should convince you otherwise.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to today\u2019s conference, and to another decade of partnership and success."

    "content": "For a decade now, the U.S. Treasury Market Conference has been a unique and vibrant forum to discuss developments in the Treasury market.1 A lot of work goes into organizing this event every year, and I would like to thank staff from the Joint Member Agencies for all of their contributions.2\n\nToday\u2019s speakers and panelists discussed the evolving conditions and significant structural changes across various segments of the Treasury market. I would like to focus on one of those key segments: short-term financing markets. Well-functioning financing markets are of course integral to meeting the objectives that the Joint Member Agencies set for the Treasury market\u2014namely, to minimize the cost of debt to the taxpayers, to support the broader financial system, and to support the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.3,4\n\nI will start by providing an update on my assessment of current reserve conditions. I will then discuss the recent moderate pressures we have seen in repo markets and how those have the potential for affecting reserve conditions.\n\nBut, first, let me offer a disclaimer that these views are my own, and not those of the New York Fed, the Federal Reserve System, or indeed any other organization.5\n\nA Review of Reserve Conditions Indicators\n\nFor over two years, the Federal Reserve has been reducing the size of its balance sheet, consistent with the plans the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) issued in May 2022.6 Those plans indicate that the Committee intends to stop reducing the balance sheet once reserves are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with an ample supply of reserves.\n\nIt is very difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the level of reserves associated with an ample reserves regime with a high degree of certainty.7 Because reserve demand is influenced by a mix of factors and can change over time, a better strategy to assess reserve conditions, in my view, is to monitor a variety of signs embedded in market prices and quantities.\n\nA good starting point is to look at the spread between the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB). When reserves become less abundant, the cost to borrow federal funds tends to increase relative to IORB. This spread has been extremely stable since the balance sheet runoff process began (Panel 1)\u2014and indeed, so has the entire distribution of federal funds trades.8 The stability of the market provides a first clue that reserves are still abundant.\n\nBut a stable EFFR-to-IORB spread doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee that all is quiet in money markets. And conversely, that spread could increase or decrease even if reserves remain within the recent range, as I will discuss. To provide more visibility on the conditions of money markets, in a speech in May I discussed a set of indicators that I think can be useful to monitor the transition from abundant to ample reserves.9\n\nOne such indicator is the sensitivity, or elasticity, of the federal funds rate with respect to short-term changes in the supply of reserves.10 When reserves are abundant, the demand curve is flat, meaning the federal funds rate is insensitive to short term changes in reserve supply. When reserves approach the ample level, that curve should start gently sloping down, and the federal funds rate will start to show some sensitivity to changes in reserves. This estimated sensitivity has been, and still is, indistinguishable from zero (Panel 2). That is consistent with an abundant supply of reserves.\n\nWe also carefully monitor the share of domestic bank borrowing in the federal funds market. Because domestic banks tend to borrow federal funds when they need liquidity, increased activity on their part would be a sign of reserves becoming less abundant. As of now, this share remains low, as seen in Panel 3, and if anything, it has declined further in recent months.  \n\nThe timing of interbank payments is another useful metric. When reserves, which are the settlement instrument for these payments, are less abundant, banks will tend to tactically delay payments to keep their balance from dropping to uncomfortably low levels in the middle of the day. Therefore, late payment activity may be a useful indicator of the ampleness of reserve supply. This measure is currently low and little changed from May (Panel 4).\n\nYet another indicator is the average amount of daylight overdrafts. Daylight overdrafts occur when short-term shifts in payment activity result in a temporarily negative balance in a bank\u2019s reserve account. Higher average overdrafts are an indication that reserves are harder to come by in amounts needed to facilitate payments without intraday credit from the Federal Reserve. While peak intraday overdraft activity has occasionally spiked, average overdrafts have remained low and actually have declined in recent months (Panel 5). Average overdrafts are much more informative for our purposes because they abstract from idiosyncratic factors that may affect individual institutions.\n\nWhile clearly not exhaustive, these indicators are useful to monitor what I like to call movements along the demand curve for reserves. By this I mean situations where reserves become progressively less abundant and eventually, as they approach the ample level, lead to a somewhat higher federal funds rate relative to IORB. Since the FOMC has said that it intends to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves reach a level somewhat above ample, these indicators can be helpful in informing the decision of when to stop the runoff process. By looking at the metrics I just mentioned, it\u2019s hard to conclude anything else other than that, as of today, reserve supply remains abundant. And of course, reserves have not declined, on net, since the runoff process began in June 2022.\n\nRecent Repo Market Pressures\n\nSo far so good. But what else should we monitor and consider going forward? In addition to estimating our location along the current demand curve for reserves, we have to be on the lookout for shifts in that curve. In other words, reserve demand can be variable over time and heterogeneous across institutions, and the demand curve can shift vertically even when reserve supply is stable, resulting in pressure on rates. There are several possible drivers of that shift, and one in particular that I would like to focus on today is the repo market. A fifth indicator that I introduced in May is the share of repo transactions that are priced at or above IORB (Panel 6). Unlike the other four indicators, it has increased notably since the spring.\n\nI like to think of the repo market as a mechanism to redistribute liquidity from those who have it in excess (for example, money market funds and government-sponsored enterprises) to those who need it (for example, dealers and levered investors). One reason for higher repo rates is simply that demand for repo has likely increased relative to supply. In recent years, there has obviously been a large increase in securities issued by the Treasury. And while there is no lack of demand for those securities, many investors need financing to acquire them. The ongoing shrinking of the Federal Reserve\u2019s SOMA portfolio also contributes to the higher demand for repo financing because it results in private investors absorbing (and potentially financing) more Treasury securities. But it also contributes to a diminished supply of repo financing because a smaller SOMA portfolio implies that less overall liquidity is available to the financial system.\n\nThere appears to be also a second important cause for higher repo rates\u2014namely, frictions that have developed in the market that are interfering with the liquidity redistribution process. One example of such frictions stems from increased concentration in the repo market, which has made it harder for some dealers and money market funds to increase their exposure to each other. In other words, repo supply can be limited by counterparty risk limits.\n\nThis type of friction has manifested itself fairly clearly in substantial remaining balances at our ON RRP facility despite rates on alternative instruments (including repo rates) that are often higher than the ON RRP rate. Most ON RRP counterparties leave relatively small amounts at the ON RRP these days, but some fund complexes still utilize the facility to a considerable extent. These complexes may prefer to access the higher rates offered by the repo market, but their respective counterparties may not be willing to deal with them in the desired quantities because of their size.11 Be it as it may, liquidity left at the ON RRP does not flow into the repo market as smoothly as it did previously, and therefore contributes to higher repo rates.12\n\nThe good news is that the market likely can adapt to these constraints. For example, large money fund complexes can increase the number of counterparties they do business with\u2014including by adding to their sponsored relationships in the centrally cleared part of the repo market\u2014thereby diluting their counterparty exposure risk. But this process is unlikely to unfold very quickly, because of logistical, legal, and other complexities. In the meantime, repo rates may continue to run higher than they would have otherwise, or even increase further.\n\nSo, what is the connection between repo rates, the federal funds rate, and the quantity of reserves? The point is that higher repo rates could pull up the federal funds rate even if the quantity of reserves doesn\u2019t change much from current levels.\n\nThe key to understanding the connection is to look at how the activity of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) affects both markets. The FHLBs maintain large liquidity portfolios meant to anticipate and fund short-term outflows, such as new lending to their members.13 These portfolios include federal funds lent, repo, interest-bearing deposit accounts, and certain U.S. Treasuries.14 Their allocation decisions among these different instruments are partially informed by internal and regulatory constraints, but they also reflect economic considerations. For example, if the repo market offers higher rates relative to the federal funds market, the FHLBs are incentivized to increase their allocation to repo.\n\nThe FHLBs are currently the dominant lender in the federal funds market, accounting for over 90 percent of total lending activity.15 Therefore, if repo rates rise enough and lure the FHLBs away from the federal funds market, the EFFR may end up higher. Meanwhile, rates in the repo market, which is much larger than the federal funds market, won\u2019t be meaningfully reduced. The result is a passthrough of repo rate pressure to the federal funds market.\n\nPut differently, higher repo rates could be the mechanism through which the reserve demand curve shifts upward. Through this mechanism, we could see higher federal funds rates even if the aggregate quantity of reserves remains within recent ranges.\n\nBut if the EFFR moves up and gets close enough to IORB, foreign banks\u2014which are the largest borrowers of federal funds, primarily to earn the spread between EFFR and IORB\u2014may pull back from that market. At that point, the size and structure of the federal funds market could change, leaving mostly rate-sensitive domestic banks as borrowers. That could increase EFFR volatility, while potentially leading to a downward sloping demand curve for reserves and making the market more susceptible to hard-to-predict shocks.\n\nIf all that happens, some of the indicators I mentioned earlier would join the repo market indicator and start pointing to tighter reserve conditions as well. For example, the share of domestic banks borrowing in the federal funds market would go up mechanically, and other indicators may also move over time.\n\nFor now, pressures in the repo market don\u2019t appear to be close to the point where they would start affecting the federal funds rate. For that reason, I believe there is plenty of room to continue shrinking the SOMA portfolio. Still, in 2018, the repo market arguably served as a leading indicator of pressures developing in the reserves market. There is no guarantee that it will be the same again this time, but my colleagues and I will be monitoring its evolution.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019ll conclude by circling back to the various reserves indicators I mentioned.\n\nTo summarize the signals embedded in these indicators, the \u201cspider chart\u201d in Panel 7 condenses the current level of each against their historical values from 2014 to today. Points near the interior of the chart correspond to abundant reserve conditions, while points toward the exterior correspond with reserves becoming progressively less abundant and eventually scarce. Overall, current values (shown by the blue pentagon) are toward the interior and much lower than those seen between Q3 2018 and September 2019, when reserve conditions were clearly progressively tightening. That is good news. But, given the recent upward pressure on repo rates, the repo indicator has shifted and warrants attention.\n\nWe will be monitoring repo markets and money markets generally, both for early warning signs of shifting reserve conditions and risks of upward pressure to the federal funds rate even if reserve conditions are stable. In the meantime, SOMA portfolio runoff will continue. As Chair Powell noted, that process is part of the normalization of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy stance, just like the 50-basis-point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate the FOMC announced last week.16\n\nThe influence Treasury repo markets can have on the federal funds rate and money markets generally emphasizes the importance of a resilient Treasury market for effective monetary policy implementation. That reinforces the value of the work of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance and others to support the resilience of the Treasury market.17 Let me again thank staff from the agencies for facilitating this conference so the official sector, private sector, and academia can come together to discuss issues facing this important market.\n\nPresentation"

    "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you, Deputy Governor Mauderer, for the nice introduction and for inviting me to the Bundesbank reception.1 It's an honor to be here and a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the strong relationship between our central banks. I also want to formally welcome Simon Keller to New York\u2014I look forward to working together in the future.\n\nBefore I start, let me offer the usual disclaimer that the views that I express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThis evening, I will cover two topics. First, I will provide a sense of my responsibilities as SOMA Manager. And second, since there are many market participants in the audience, I want to talk about the role of the New York Fed\u2019s interaction with you and your peers in shaping my understanding of what markets are telling us, and how that ultimately becomes part of the monetary policy process.\n\nThe Role of SOMA Manager\n\nAs you know, I am the Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the New York Fed. The SOMA is essentially the Federal Reserve System\u2019s entire securities portfolio. The New York Fed manages the SOMA because the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) has selected it every year since 1935 as the Reserve Bank that executes open market operations.2\n\nThe SOMA portfolio contains dollar-denominated assets acquired through open market operations, as well as foreign currency securities. Dollar-denominated securities are a tool for achieving the Federal Reserve\u2019s macroeconomic objectives, and they serve as collateral for U.S. currency in circulation and other Federal Reserve liabilities. Foreign securities, which are currently denominated in euros and Japanese yen, represent the Federal Reserve System\u2019s foreign currency reserves.\n\nAs the SOMA Manager, I am responsible for implementing monetary policy at the direction of the FOMC. This entails managing SOMA portfolio assets and some Federal Reserve liabilities to ensure that FOMC directives are effectively executed. I am also responsible for monitoring, analyzing, and communicating global financial market developments to the Committee. I brief the FOMC at each of its meetings on these developments, and I also advise policymakers as needed on a variety of market and operational issues.\n\nHow We Gather Market Intelligence\n\nHaving a deep understanding of the signals embedded in market prices is critical to my job. My colleagues on the New York Fed\u2019s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) and I decode those signals through our own analysis and expertise and through insights collected from market participants. These efforts to gather, parse, and decipher market intelligence are an integral part of the Desk\u2019s work. So, I want to take the opportunity this evening to explain how we collect information from market participants and what we do with that information.3\n\nOf course, we are not the only central bank engaged in the collection of such information, which we also refer to as market intelligence. In fact, most central banks are, and many\u2014including the New York Fed and the Bundesbank\u2014periodically convene to discuss best practices at forums organized by the Bank for International Settlements.4\n\nThe Desk collects market intelligence in four fundamental ways. First, we are avid consumers of research and market commentary notes written by many market analysts on a wide variety of subjects. Second, we administer the Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants as part of every FOMC cycle. Third, the Bank sponsors several financial market groups, such as the Treasury Market Practices Group, the Foreign Exchange Committee, and the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. And fourth, we speak to market participants on both a regular and ad-hoc basis about market developments.\n\nSince the first three elements of our market intelligence collection efforts are fairly straightforward, I will concentrate on the fourth. Our diverse range of market contacts spans most financial markets, with a particular focus on the markets in which the New York Fed operates. We are interested in understanding a variety of topics, including expectations for monetary policy, financial conditions in the U.S. and abroad, market structure and liquidity, financial stability, and many others. The Desk has over 100 staff members that can collect, summarize, and communicate intelligence from market participants to me and other senior leaders at the New York Fed.\n\nOver the past year, the Desk has had more than 1,400 interactions with market participants affiliated with over 350 different firms, including dealers, banks, research firms, corporates, insurers, hedge funds, pension funds, private equity funds, reserve managers, and industry bodies. That\u2019s an average of nearly 200 interactions per FOMC intermeeting period, with of course some variability depending on specific developments (for example, the number of interactions was higher in March 2023 during the episode of stress in the banking sector). Regarding what the outreach covers, the three most frequent topics raised by contacts during the last intermeeting period were\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014monetary policy, interest rates, and money markets.\n\nI want to emphasize that the Desk staff speaking to market contacts are skilled analysts who are prepared through a well-established and long-running training program on what constitutes appropriate communication with market participants. The training specifically covers FOMC policies and rules of engagement with outside contacts. In addition to adhering to official guidance on topics such as information security, trainees practice various approaches to framing questions in an appropriate manner.\n\nI also want to explicitly underscore that Desk staff are engaged strictly in collecting information. Desk staff do not divulge any information from the Fed as part of our outreach effort, nor do they share what they hear from one market contact with another. Our market contacts understand this very well and don\u2019t seek information from us either\u2014in our experience, our contacts are happy to provide their insights in the interest of promoting better policy decisions, and for that I want to say a heartfelt thank you.\n\nHow We Use the Information We Collect\n\nSo, what do we do with all of the information that we collect? First, the information is anonymized because the focus is not on particular firms or individuals. It is then filtered to extract what we think is relevant, and finally processed through our analytical framework to help cross check and inform any assessment. It is then summarized and incorporated into a wide range of briefings and analyses, including some that are shared across the Federal Reserve System. Ultimately, the main goal of our market intelligence gathering is to support informed policy decisions. This is accomplished through dedicated memos, through my briefings that open each FOMC meeting, and via other communications to policymakers.\n\nIn preparation for last week\u2019s FOMC meeting, market intelligence was especially helpful in three ways:\n\nConclusion\n\nWith that, I hope this overview of how we collect, filter, summarize, and incorporate market intelligence into the policy process was helpful. We deeply appreciate the time and effort that our contacts provide to help the Federal Reserve better understand market developments. I also want to thank Deputy Governor Mauderer, Simon, and the Bundesbank for the kind invitation and excellent hospitality.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to the rest of the evening."

    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/wil240906",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. I always appreciate the opportunity to speak before members of the Council on Foreign Relations.1\n\nBefore I get started, let me give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nJust as you\u2019d expect, I\u2019ll be speaking today about the \u201ce\u201d word\u2014by which, of course, I mean the economy. I\u2019ll talk about where it\u2019s headed, and the process of getting supply and demand in better balance and bringing inflation back down to the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent longer-run goal. I\u2019ll also discuss the progress made toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability, as well as the path ahead for monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Dual Mandate\n\nI\u2019ll start by discussing where the economy stands right now, broadly speaking.\n\nSince it\u2019s back-to-school season, I\u2019ll throw out another \u201ce\u201d word that you may find on a middle school vocabulary list. This word is a little less commonly used\u2014at least in my own conversations. And that word is \u201cequipoise.\u201d\n\nThe definition, according to Merriam-Webster, is \u201ca state of equilibrium.\u201d If I were asked to use it in a sentence, spelling bee-style, I\u2019d say: \u201cThe significant progress we have seen toward our objectives of price stability and maximum employment means that the risks to the two sides of our dual mandate have moved into equipoise.\u201d\n\nThis is because supply and demand imbalances have dissipated, labor market conditions have eased from being exceptionally tight, and inflation has come down significantly. Many factors have contributed to this favorable set of circumstances, including the Federal Reserve\u2019s strong actions to restore price stability.\n\nThe Inflation Onion Is Back\n\nNow let me delve deeper into the two sides of our dual mandate that have moved into equipoise: inflation and the labor market.\n\nWe\u2019ll go in alphabetical order, so let\u2019s start with inflation.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the analogy of peeling an onion\u2019s layers to describe inflation\u2014both how it rose and how it has since moderated.2 In my \u201cinflation onion,\u201d there are three layers. Each layer represents a major category of inflation: prices of globally traded commodities; prices of products or durable goods like appliances, furniture, and cars; and prices of core services.\n\nThe sharp rise in inflation that we saw in 2021 and 2022 was in large part due to aftereffects of the pandemic, as well as Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and consequent actions. Once those effects began to dissipate, the layers of the onion started to adjust in turn. While each inflation layer normalized at a different speed, they all moved in the right direction. This broad-based downward movement has brought the overall inflation rate back down closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nThis disinflation process shows up clearly in the data. The 12-month percent change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index has declined from its 40-year high of just above 7 percent in mid-2022 to 2.5 percent in July. Measures of underlying inflation, like core PCE inflation and the New York Fed\u2019s Multivariate Core Trend inflation, similarly show a sizable decline over the past two years to around 2-1/2 percent today.3 The decrease in inflation has benefited from a moderation in demand and improvements in supply that together have reduced supply-demand imbalances, both here in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nEqually reassuringly, inflation expectations remain well anchored. The New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) shows that inflation expectations have remained in their pre-Covid ranges at all horizons in recent months.4 Other measures of inflation expectations, both survey- and market-based, give a similar signal. And the Atlanta Fed\u2019s measure of business inflation expectations, which reflects the thinking of businesses in setting prices, has similarly returned to levels near its average over the 2012-2019 period.5\n\nThe disinflation phenomenon is not unique to the United States. Canada, the United Kingdom, and most European economies experienced historically high inflation over the past few years and have similarly seen rapid declines. The global supply disruptions experienced following the pandemic and war in Ukraine amplified the rise in inflation, and the restoration of supply and demand balance has accelerated its decline.\n\nLabor Market\n\nNow let me turn to the labor market. Even as the economy has grown at a solid pace, a wide range of indicators have pointed to a continued normalization in the labor market following the red-hot period in 2021 and 2022. Today, most of these measures have moved from the tightest they\u2019ve been in over two decades to levels more consistent with the good labor market that existed in the period before the pandemic.\n\nOne measure that understandably gets a lot of attention is the unemployment rate, which has risen by nearly a percentage point from its very low reading in early 2023. Still, it remains relatively low by historical standards, and some of this increase reflects a cool-down in the labor market from an overheated state. In addition, the increase in unemployment has occurred in the context of a strong increase in labor supply, rather than from elevated layoffs.\n\nTo get the full picture of the labor market and what it means for monetary policy, it\u2019s important to monitor a wide range of data in addition to the unemployment rate. For example, I take the temperature of the labor market by looking at surveys of both households and businesses; the rates of quits, hiring, and job vacancies; and the job-to-job transition rates and flows between unemployment and employment states.\n\nTaken together, these data indicate that the labor market is now roughly in balance and therefore unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressures going forward.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nWhat does this mean for monetary policy?\n\nIn its July statement, the FOMC said it \u201cjudges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance\u201d, and that it is \u201cattentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\u201d6 Regarding the path of policy going forward, the Committee said it \u201cwill carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks\u201d and that it \u201cdoes not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\u201d\n\nThe accumulated evidence has increased my confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. The current restrictive stance of monetary policy has been effective in restoring balance to the economy and bringing inflation down. With the economy now in equipoise and inflation on a path to 2 percent, it is now appropriate to dial down the degree of restrictiveness in the stance of policy by reducing the target range for the federal funds rate. This is the natural next step in executing our strategy to achieve our dual mandate goals. Looking ahead, with inflation moving toward the target and the economy in balance, the stance of monetary policy can be moved to a more a neutral setting over time depending on the evolution of the data, the outlook, and the risks to achieving our objectives.\n\nIn terms of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, the Committee began to slow the pace of decline of our securities holdings in June. That process is going smoothly and as planned, and the level of reserves remains well above ample.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nBefore I close, I\u2019ll share my forecast for the other \u201ce,\u201d the economy. I expect GDP growth this year to be around 2 to 2-1/2 percent. I expect the unemployment rate at the end of this year to be around 4-1/4 percent, and thereafter to move gradually down to my estimate of its longer-run level of 3-3/4 percent. With the labor market in balance, I expect the process of disinflation to continue. Specifically, I expect overall PCE inflation to moderate to around 2-1/4 percent this year and to be near 2 percent next year.\n\nThat\u2019s my base case. But it\u2019s important to emphasize that the outlook remains uncertain, and I am attentive to signs of a shift in economic conditions. Three areas are particularly in focus. One is the possibility of a significant further weakening in the U.S. labor market. The second is a sharp slowdown in global growth that could spill over onto our shores. And third, the experience of the past year shows that the process of disinflation is not always smooth and can surprise both to the upside and downside.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way from the unacceptably high inflation and overheated labor market that we experienced two years ago. Monetary policy has been unequivocally focused on returning inflation to our 2 percent longer-run target. The risks to our two goals are now in better balance, and policy needs to adjust to reflect that balance. Of course, one clear lesson of the past several years is that the future is highly uncertain. Therefore, our decisions will be data-dependent, with a keen eye on the achievement of our maximum employment and price stability goals."

    "content": "Remarks following an introduction by Dr. Peter Blair Henry at the PhD Excellence Initiative\u2019s annual summer research workshop, held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The PhD Excellence Initiative is a nonprofit that prepares high-achieving college graduates of color for top-tier Ph.D. economics programs.\n\nThank you, Peter for that great introduction! Good morning, all, and on behalf of the New York Fed, welcome. It is a joyous thing for me to be able to engage with you this morning.\n\nBut before I do anything else, I want to use this moment to tell you about the length of the right tail of the skill distribution.\n\nThe person who you just heard is an economist of the first order. He is a highly sought-after organizational leader. He is engaged in both civic and corporate leadership at the highest levels.\n\nBut he also ran crossing routes at an ACC school, and apparently(!), he could throw it down in ways that the late great Bill Walton would appreciate.\n\nSo, you must realize now that it\u2019s all downhill from here\u2026.\n\nBefore we go further, I should note that my remarks reflect my personal opinions and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System. And with that, let me turn to the task at hand\u2014to welcome you properly to this event, and to our Bank.\n\nThe PhD Excellence Initiative has a mission that I think is extremely sensible. It works \u201c\u2026 foremost, by identifying high-achieving emerging scholars (college graduates or graduating seniors) who demonstrate a passion for economic research\u2014as well as the deepest commitment to bringing new perspectives\u2014and preparing these students for the rigors of a doctoral program in economics.\u201d\n\nThis mode of attack on the problem is, in my view, exactly correct. And it is important. I\u2019ll start with importance, and then to why I think it\u2019s correct.\n\nIt is important for the students whose trajectory it ultimately alters, of course. But it is most important in my view, as a way to continue a process that will deliver an economics that looks like us\u2014as a nation, as a world, and one that works on all the problems that matter. That is the promise, and what I see being at stake here.\n\nIt is correct, because there is really only one durable way to realize this end state of a healthier profession. And that starts with winning in the first step of the game as it is now played. When I say \u201cgame,\u201d I mean simply the current norms and practices of the economics profession. And when I say \u201cwin,\u201d I mean getting into, and then through, a respected Ph.D. program.\n\nNow, we all know the facts here\u2014the numbers are grim. This in turn means we have, for a very long time now, implicitly left to non-minorities the task of studying the issues of greatest import to minority communities.\n\nDo We Need Diversity to Get at Diverse Concerns?\n\nNow, a beautiful thing about economics is that it is resolutely empirical, even in its theorizing. In macroeconomics alone, the biggest changes by far in how we reason about the economy have come about due to unpleasant collisions of existing theory with data. The Great Depression, the stagflation of the 1970s, and the great financial crisis each led to sizeable shifts in how we thought about the economy. So maybe, just maybe, the profession\u2019s progress is not slowed so much by its staggering non-representativeness? Maybe the facts of the world lead all reasonable people\u2014including the rather non-diverse group of incumbents\u2014to take on all the pressing issues of the day in much the same way as any other group would?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good bet.\n\nIn my own career, I have seen attention to pressing topics seemingly die off due to fashions in the profession evolving as they have. Growth, and cross-country income gaps, which are almost without doubt the most important topic for human well-being one can think of, have lost ground to many other topics. And here I think broader lived experience may well matter hugely. For example, I have no doubt that the economic impacts of climate change would dominate economics if the profession had more representation from South Asia and Africa. With greater diversity in the profession, I have no doubt that even the economics of criminal justice and human capital\u2019s interaction with the carceral system would be richer, and also would not have been left nearly as much to the other social sciences. I have no doubt the scarring effects of recessions would feel more urgent to get a grip on if Latin American economists were more prevalent.\n\nWhat I think is worse is that the topics that do get studied are almost surely poorer for it. When I look at our profession, I see less incremental progress, and more coming from giants who occasionally come along and really change the way we all think. Ken Arrow, Bob Lucas, Ed Prescott, and Mike Woodford are beacons for me on the macro side, and people like Josh Angrist and Al Roth, among a handful of others on the micro side, have changed the entire profession\u2019s aperture and approach to key issues. Yet quite obviously, this is hardly a diverse group. So if we want game-changing thinking on the topics that matter existentially to some, but not all, of us\u2014like how race and gender matter in our economy\u2014I think it\u2019s essential to max out on the talent we attract. This is a numbers game in my view. So\u2026we need the numbers. The Glenn Lourys and Claudia Goldins of our world are still too much the exceptions to give us a chance at the next big breakthrough.\n\nLet\u2019s Talk About Us as Individuals\n\nSo much for how the PhD Excellence Initiative matters for our profession. Let\u2019s return to why this initiative also matters for individuals. We see that it is an effort that starts by identifying those who have an abiding interest in our subject. This is key\u2014life is short, but it is far too long to work on problems you don\u2019t actually care about. So you gotta care\u2014and you do.\n\nPhD Excellence Initiative invests in those\u2014like you\u2014who not only have the interest, but have earned the credibility to be invested in. People who have demonstrated that they are going to grind. And it does so by explicitly pushing its cohorts to meet a bar, never to change that bar. This is what it will take to populate the ranks of professorships, of research departments at Feds like this one, and other places where you belong tomorrow\u2014moving our thinking forward in ways that cannot be ignored. Why? Because you will publish in the best places, and people will just have to deal with it.\n\nSo now, Peter, me, and many others want you to be in a profession where you belong, where your ideas are engaged with, and where you are given the real respect of having those ideas challenged as hard as you\u2019ll ever have them challenged.\n\nLet me turn now to something extremely positive. Our profession may not be diverse, but it is very competitive. Its baseline problem is that too few come to our \u201ctryouts,\u201d not that those at tryouts are no good (which would be a deeper problem).\n\nCompetitiveness Means Forgetfulness, AKA, WHYDFML?\n\nAnd PhD Excellence Initiative is to me all about \u201cgetting more of us to a competitive tryout.\u201d This is why it can\u2014and I think will\u2014move the needle. Let me explain.\n\nOurs is in ways a profession that embodies \u201cwhat have you done for me lately?\u201d (WHYDFML?) WHYDFML means brutal treatment at times, it means relentless pressure perhaps. But it also means a kind of fairness that mere platitudes and words cannot deliver. And that is why I think you will succeed.\n\nIt\u2019s long been noted that hypercompetitive settings are almost unique in the American landscape as being the ones where, despite bias and barriers, minority populations have thrived\u2014sports and entertainment most obviously. Good people cannot, in a competitive world, be kept down. They can be kept out, maybe, but not nearly as easily kept down once allowed or encouraged in.\n\nA far less inspiring, but personal, example is that of my own professional life. I am someone unusual around here because I did not attend one of our most elite schools at any level. I instead attended a sequence of non-elite state schools. And even though I was taught extremely well by excellent economists, I struggled to compete with those who came with much better preparation\u2014often from all over the world.  \n\nEventually, though, I did see things come together\u2014mainly through a grind that I committed myself to. I wrote a decent thesis, and then\u2014and this is the central point I want you to hear: the job market simply reset itself.  As far as employers were concerned, my thesis was \u201cthe last thing I did for anyone lately\u201d (TLTIDFAL!)  And that was the thing that defined me as I looked for my first research economist job.\n\nAnd it got better. Once I had the job, my thesis was no longer relevant\u2014my latest papers were the new \u201clast thing I did for anyone lately.\u201d Then I took on managerial roles, and my performance in those superseded what came before. And so on.\n\nIn that way, economics is a lot like sports: we all know it\u2019s silly to place any weight on where a third-year pro in the NBA went to college. Who cares? You have three years of performance to look at now. But economics is like a sport where the talent-feeder system is a mess. So we miss out all the time on talent in ways that the NBA simply does not. If you have potential to ball out, the Association will find you. We have no equivalent system at scale.\n\nWe are instead a field where it is simultaneously true that the top schools place the most people in elite places\u2014a premise that PhD Excellence Initiative accepts\u2014and that elite performance is rewarded with less regard to where it came from. That second point means that all preparation pays off\u2014even if some of you wind up outside the most elite Ph.D. programs.\n\nSo grind, people, knowing that you\u2019ll get rewarded. We need numbers from your ranks in the better Ph.D. programs in the U.S., and we need completion and more students like you thriving in not just those programs but wherever you end up going. This can work. It will be very hard. But it, and it alone, due to WHYDFML, can and will succeed.\n\nThank you, and I wish you a truly productive day\u2014and also that in a couple of decades, one of you will take Peter\u2019s place, and another, mine."

    "speaker": "John C. Williams",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/wil240705",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon. It\u2019s a privilege to speak at this lecture series in honor of Professor Suresh Tendulkar, the esteemed economist and policymaker. And I\u2019m pleased to be here with my counterparts at the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nWe all operate in a highly interconnected global economy. So, meeting with and learning from central bankers and other experts from around the world is an important part of my job. Many of the issues we face are unique, but many are similar, too.\n\nOne theme that spans the globe has to do with managing the \u201cknown unknowns\u201d of monetary policy. Alan Greenspan, the former Chair of the Federal Reserve, once said:\n\nThat certainly sums up our experience since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic four and a half years ago. And uncertainty will continue to be the defining characteristic of the monetary policy landscape for the foreseeable future. This is especially true as we face issues like artificial intelligence, climate change, deglobalization, and innovations in the financial system\u2014not to mention the perennial challenges of measuring the so-called star variables such as r-star.\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to discuss several key principles that are at the heart of inflation targeting strategies and have proven foundational and invaluable in managing extreme uncertainty. These include accountability, transparency, and well-anchored inflation expectations. While my remarks in important ways are based on the experience of the U.S., these principles have much broader application in preparing policymakers for an uncertain future.\n\nBefore I go further, I need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Pandemic Shocks\n\nTo start today\u2019s discussion, I want to set the context by illustrating the impact of just one facet of the extraordinary shocks and extreme uncertainty we\u2019ve faced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, I\u2019ll look at the path of the New York Fed\u2019s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which gauges global supply-chain disruptions.2\n\nIn the spring of 2020, this index shot up to a level more than three standard deviations above its historical average. That fall, it plummeted to normal levels. By late 2021, it rose to more than four standard deviations above the historical average. It finally returned to normal levels last year.\n\nTo put the rarity of such events in perspective, a single four-standard-deviation event would occur about once every 2,500 years based on a standard normal distribution.\n\nGlobal supply-chain disruptions, along with acute imbalances between supply and demand exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, caused inflation to skyrocket around the world. Inflation began to rise in 2021, peaking at over 7 percent in the U.S. in June 2022,3 the highest rate recorded in over 40 years. It followed a similar pattern in most OECD economies. But its trajectories were different across Asia. For example, in India, inflation was mostly fueled by rising food prices.\n\nWhile there are important differences in the sources of inflation, many central banks\u2014including the Reserve Bank of India\u2014have been faced with the same issue: How to restore price stability at a time when so many parts of our economies are spinning in unpredictable ways?\n\nOwning the Responsibility\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we did this by relying on central tenets of inflation targeting practiced in the U.S. and many other countries. In particular, I will emphasize three key principles that contributed to a prolonged period of price stability in the U.S. during the quarter century leading up to the pandemic.4\n\nThe first principle is responsibility: Central banks must own the responsibility to deliver price stability and have independence to act to achieve it.\n\nThis is a shift in thinking in many economies from prior decades, particularly the 1970s. During that time, many central bankers believed monetary policy could only play a minor role in reducing inflation. Others thought lowering inflation was completely outside of their control.5 This led to finger-pointing and confusion about whose job it was to restore price stability. The end result was persistent high inflation and economic stagnation.\n\nBut history taught us that central banks can be more successful at delivering sustainably low inflation when they are accountable and independent.6,7 Today, regardless of economic shocks, changes in fiscal policy, or globalization and deglobalization swings, central banks recognize that attaining and maintaining price stability is their job to do.\n\nIn the U.S., this responsibility is crystal clear.8 Price stability and maximum employment together make up the FOMC's dual mandate. When inflation rose persistently above our target, we acted decisively to bring inflation back down.\n\nCommitment to Transparency\n\nThe second principle that helped us manage the known unknowns is transparency\u2014including the clear communication of a central bank\u2019s strategy, policy decisions, and an explicit numerical longer-run inflation target.\n\nFor central banks, transparency enhances accountability and keeps them clearly focused on achieving their goals. For households and businesses, an explicit and credible inflation target helps take some of the uncertainty off the table so they can focus on planning for their future without having to worry about what will happen to inflation. By improving the public\u2019s understanding of a central bank\u2019s goals and actions, the central bank can enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy at stabilizing inflation and the economy.9,10,11\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, these concepts\u2014including a 2 percent longer-run inflation target\u2014are outlined in the FOMC\u2019s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which it first announced in January 2012.12 In public communications throughout this latest inflationary episode, the FOMC has clearly, consistently, and repeatedly emphasized its strong commitment to its 2 percent inflation target, as well as its monetary policy strategy and decisions to achieve that goal.13\n\nInflation is now around 2-1/2 percent, so we have seen significant progress in bringing it down. But we still have a way to go to reach our 2 percent target on a sustained basis. We are committed to getting the job done.\n\nImportance of Inflation Expectations\n\nThe third key principle is well-anchored inflation expectations. This principle has become a bedrock of modern central banking, as economic analysis and history have shown that anchoring inflation expectations is important in maintaining low and stable inflation.14,15\n\nIt is now evident that in the 1960s and 1970s, both short- and longer-term inflation expectations in the U.S. became unmoored, rising as actual inflation rose.16 This made it even more difficult for policymakers to maintain stable prices amid the shocks of that period.\n\nIn contrast, well-anchored inflation expectations short-circuit so-called second-round effects in wage and price setting that exacerbate and prolong the effects of shocks like we saw during the 1970s. They also create a more favorable short-run trade-off in balancing inflation and employment objectives.17\n\nCentral banks help anchor expectations by owning the responsibility to deliver price stability, publicly committing to an explicit inflation target, and taking the actions needed to ensure price stability. The connections between policy communications and actions, inflation outcomes, and expectations are at the core of policy strategies that are robust to extreme uncertainty, a topic that Athanasios Orphanides and I studied in a sequence of research papers.18\n\nUnlike the stylized textbook model of monetary policy, this approach recognizes the high degree of uncertainty in the economy. It also views the anchoring of expectations, or the lack thereof, as the outcome of monetary policy actions and communications. We show that when uncertainty is extreme, policies that are focused on keeping inflation near target\u2014and do not rely too much on hard-to-measure variables like the natural rates of unemployment and interest\u2014perform well at stabilizing inflation and unemployment.\n\nSo, what do well-anchored inflation expectations look like? In practice, short- and, to some extent, medium-term expectations will be sensitive to economic shocks, rising and falling as inflation increases and moderates, even with well-anchored expectations. But if a central bank has credibility in achieving price stability, longer-term expectations should remain consistent with its inflation target, and the deviation of short- and medium-run expectations from levels consistent with the target should be temporary.19\n\nWe saw this pattern reflected in the data from the New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations. As inflation started to rise in 2021, medium- and particularly short-term expectations increased considerably. But despite the severity of the shocks, longer-term inflation expectations remained remarkably stable and close to the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent goal.20 Medium-term expectations returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. And short-term expectations followed suit in 2023.\n\nWhen the Facts Change\n\nOur three principles provide a strong framework to manage shocks and uncertainty. But they are not meant to be overly prescriptive on tactics. In monetary policy, it\u2019s important to be nimble in execution even as one is steady in strategy.\n\nAs John Maynard Keynes is often credited with saying, \u201cWhen the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\u201d\n\nHere again, anchored in clear longer-run goals and strategy, communication is key.\n\nPolicymakers base their decisions on the totality of the data. When the facts dictate a change, it\u2019s crucial to discuss the reasons behind the changes and explain how we anticipate the economy will evolve. The FOMC does this through its post-meeting statements, the Chair\u2019s press conferences, the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, detailed FOMC meeting minutes, and policymaker speeches.\n\nUncertainty in the Years Ahead\n\nI have talked about how the key tenets of inflation targeting\u2014ownership of price stability and independence of action, transparency about goals and strategy, and a focus on anchored inflation expectations\u2014have served us well in managing the extreme shocks and uncertainty of the past four and a half years. But uncertainty does not only dwell in the past.\n\nDespite the very best efforts of economists and others to understand how the economic environment is changing and what it means for monetary policy, we must accept that uncertainty will continue to define the future. These principles and lessons provide a strong foundation for monetary policy that is robust to uncertainty. And I am confident they will continue to serve us well against any challenges and uncertainties we may face ahead."

    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/wil240703",
    "content": "For over 125 years, economists have grappled with a dilemma: How can a concept at the very heart of monetary theory be so vexing to quantify? I\u2019m talking, of course, about r-star, the natural rate of interest. The quotations listed in Table 1 reflect the age-old challenges surrounding it.1 Recently, r-star has been in the spotlight once again.\n\nToday, my remarks will focus on longer-run r-star, which is the real interest rate expected to prevail when shocks to the economy have receded and the economy is growing at its potential rate.\n\nBefore I go further, I\u2019ll provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThree Approaches\n\nSubsequent to Milton Friedman\u2019s claim to the contrary,2 there are now three common approaches to inferring r-star from data: using a statistical method to extract a longer-run trend, basing it on financial market or survey data, or looking at r-star\u2019s effects on economic data. Each provides useful information, but each also poses significant challenges. As discussed in one of my papers with Thomas Laubach, univariate statistical methods do not adequately control for economic factors that influence interest rates. And these estimates can be overly influenced by large macroeconomic disturbances, such as the inflation of the 1970s or the pandemic.3 Financial market and survey data are subject to measurement issues and, in any case, tell us what people are thinking about r-star, rather than act as an independent source of information on r-star. This is what I have referred to as a \u201chall of mirrors.\u201d4\n\nFor these reasons, I will focus my remarks on estimates of r-star gleaned from macroeconomic models that do not rely on financial market or survey data\u2014in particular, the Holston-Laubach-Williams (HLW) model, which infers the natural rate of interest through the behavior of interest rates, inflation, and GDP.5 Or, as the economist John H. Williams put it, \u201cby its works.\u201d6\n\nA Global Supply and Demand for Savings\n\nOur estimates of r-star in the euro area and the United States fell dramatically over the quarter century leading up to the pandemic, and they are currently near the estimates from prior to the pandemic. Figure 1 shows the time series of r-star estimates for the euro area and the United States. I\u2019ll focus first on the euro area.\n\nThe estimate of r-star in the euro area is 0.5 percent in 2023, equal to its average over the five years prior to the outbreak of COVID. This assessment of a very low r-star is broadly consistent with analysis by ECB economists using a variety of models.7\n\nThe sizable decline in estimates of r-star during the decades prior to the pandemic is common to many advanced and emerging economies. It reflects developments related to the global supply and demand for savings.8 These include falling birth rates and relatively low productivity growth that both reduce demand for savings, as well as increases in longevity and wealth inequality that increase the supply of savings. I emphasize the word global, because in a world of open capital markets, one should expect r-star to be highly correlated across countries. Indeed, there is evidence that r-star estimates are highly interconnected in advanced economies, although local factors play a role as well.9\n\nThe role of common and idiosyncratic factors is seen by comparing the estimates for the euro area to those for the United States, also shown in Figure 1. Although the two sets of estimates display some shorter-term wiggles, the dominant shared feature is the sustained two-percentage-point decline in r-star over the past 30 years. The same pattern is true of our estimates for Canada. Hence, according to these estimates, the low r-star regime endures.\n\nIs R-Star Rising?\n\nThis finding runs counter to recent commentary suggesting that r-star has risen due to persistent changes in the balance between the supply and demand for savings, such as higher investment in AI and renewable energy, as well as larger government debt. In fact, some measures of longer-run r-star have risen to levels well above those directly prior to the pandemic. For example, market-based measures of five-year, five-year-forward real rates for the euro area and the United States have risen well above the HLW estimates, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nTwo things stand out from this figure. First, until recently, far-forward real rates displayed a broadly similar pattern of decline as the model estimates of r-star. Second, the market-based measures are volatile. Indeed, in the years before the recent rise, they had fallen to very low levels, well below the corresponding model estimates. This points to a significant time-varying risk premium, which interferes with taking market-based measures at face value in assessing what markets are telling us about their perceptions of r-star. For example, based on the D'Amico, Kim, and Wei term structure model, the estimated rise in U.S. far-forward expected real yields since the onset of the pandemic is significantly smaller than that implied by a direct read of real yields.10\n\nWhere does this leave us regarding r-star? Although the value of r-star is always highly uncertain, the case for a sizable increase in r-star has yet to meet two important tests. First, owing to the interconnectedness of r-star across countries, plausible factors pushing up r-star on a sustained basis are likely to be global in nature. This highlights a tension between the evidence from Europe that r-star is still very low and arguments in the United States that r-star is now closer to levels seen 20 years ago.\n\nSecond, any increase in r-star must overcome the forces that have been pushing r-star down for decades.11 In this regard, recent data reinforce the continuation of pre-pandemic trends in global demographics and productivity growth. One lens through which to see this is our model estimates of potential GDP, or y-star, which is a key factor that affects r-star. Many of the explanations arguing for a higher r-star would likely show up in higher potential output growth. However, the HLW estimates of euro area and U.S. trend potential GDP growth in 2023 are nearly unchanged from their respective 2019 values. This is consistent with other estimates of potential GDP growth for the euro area and the United States.12\n\nR-Star and Monetary Policy\n\nI will end with a brief comment on the usefulness of estimates of r-star for policymaking. First, as the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell and others have stressed, r-star is either explicitly or implicitly at the core of any macroeconomic model or framework one can imagine. Pretending it doesn\u2019t exist or wishing it away does not change that. In that context, it is important that we do our best to understand the factors that affect r-star and the uncertainties related to it, so that we have the best understanding possible of the forces affecting the longer-term evolution of the economy.\n\nSecond, and equally important, as shown in my work with Athanasios Orphanides, the high degree of uncertainty about r-star means that one should not overly rely on estimates of r-star in determining the appropriate setting of monetary policy at a given point in time.13 Instead, such determinations must be, and are, based on a wide range of information and assessments, including those related to risks.\n\nPresentation"

It is a pleasure to speak with you tonight, surrounded by an impressive group of women, at the Bloomberg Intelligence Women in Finance: Fixed Income Halftime Report conference. This event gives us an opportunity to reflect on the financial market landscape, discuss topical issues across financial markets, and celebrate our collective contributions to the finance industry over the years. So, welcome!\n\nToday, my remarks will focus on the business case for diversity across the essential work of the New York Fed, in particular the Markets Group. First, I\u2019ll highlight our wide-ranging work and its impact. Second, I\u2019ll dive into our market intelligence-gathering efforts and discuss how this information is used to inform policymaking. Then, I\u2019ll close by talking about how we ensure diverse perspectives are carefully assessed and incorporated into our work, reflecting the range of views held in the market. As always, the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.          \n\nThe Role of the Markets Group\n\nThe New York Fed has a unique role in the Federal Reserve System. The New York Fed is authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to execute open market transactions in both U.S. dollar and foreign currencies for the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities portfolios, and maintain currency swap lines with foreign central banks, among other activities. To effectively implement these responsibilities, the Markets Group is organized along six core functions. First, we implement monetary policy on behalf of the FOMC. Second, we monitor and analyze global financial markets, acting as the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the Fed in the financial markets. As part of this, we also sponsor a number of committees with official and private sector entities. Third, we produce five IOSCO-compliant daily reference rates for the world\u2019s most important U.S. dollar secured and unsecured financing markets. Fourth, we support debt management and foreign exchange activities of the U.S. Treasury Department and conduct auctions and buybacks at the direction of the U.S. Treasury. Over the last four years, on behalf of the U.S. Treasury, our team has supported the auction and issuance of $85.1 trillion in Treasury securities, as well as $5.1 billion under the new buyback program launched in May of this year. While rare, we maintain readiness to conduct currency interventions at the direction of the U.S. Treasury. Fifth, we manage Discount Window activities for the Second District and provide collateral valuation and counterparty risk management for the Discount Window services of the Federal Reserve System as a whole. Finally, we provide account services to foreign central bank customers, including (1) custody services amounting to roughly $3 trillion in U.S. dollar assets, (2) foreign exchange customer transactions, and (3) swap lines and repos to support both broader wholesale funding markets and more targeted U.S. dollar funding requirements arising abroad.\n\nThe Markets Group conducts a wide range of open market operations in global financial markets. At the direction of the FOMC, we participate in repo, Treasury, agency, and international sovereign markets. In the four years following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we executed $3.2 trillion in Treasury outright purchases, $3.1 trillion in agency MBS purchases, and $5.5 trillion in rollover of Treasury securities. Over this time, the daily take-up at the overnight reverse repo facility averaged $1.1 trillion, peaking at $2.6 trillion in December 2022. At the same time, in partnership with the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve System, and with the approval of the Treasury Secretary, we implemented a series of emergency lending facilities under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to support credit and liquidity provision in the market. These facilities\u2014including the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, Commercial Paper Funding Facility, Municipal Liquidity Facility, Primary and Secondary Corporate Credit Facility, and Term Asset-Backed Lending Facility\u2014helped to ensure that businesses and households had access to credit during the economic shock of the global pandemic. At its peak, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility totaled $37 billion in March 2020. In December 2020, all other facilities peaked at $24 billion. Internationally, we passively manage a portfolio of euro- and Japanese yen-denominated assets that totals roughly $18 billion, conducting purchases and sales to meet an internal asset allocation target that is based on the FOMC\u2019s objectives for foreign reserves.\n\nThrough our operations, we gain insights on market functioning, signals about the transmission of monetary policy, and intelligence on foreign exchange markets. We supplement these insights with data and analysis on a wide range of other markets, such as credit and equities. This enables us to share updates on financial market conditions with the FOMC and senior stakeholders across the Federal Reserve System. We collect market intelligence through both structured outreach, such as the Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants conducted before each FOMC meeting, as well as through daily outreach to market contacts.\n\nThis is a lot of work\u2014but it only scratches the surface of what we do in the Markets Group! In addition to our market monitoring and monetary policy operations, we provide liquidity domestically and across borders. Through the Discount Window, the New York Fed also bolsters confidence in our banking system, as do the other Reserve Banks through their engagement with financial institutions in their respective districts. We also support liquidity in the broader payments system through the availability of both intraday and term credit to depository institutions.\n\nLeveraging their daily engagement with financial institutions, Markets Group staff have been key drivers in the design and operation of emergency lending facilities critical to stabilizing the U.S. financial system and the broader economy during periods of crisis over the past two decades. Looking beyond our borders, we maintain standing swap lines with foreign central bank counterparts to ensure well-functioning and liquid U.S. dollar funding markets. We also provide a range of custody and investment services to over two hundred official sector customers from all over the world.\n\nAs all of you know, financial markets are constantly changing. And, as such, so are we. In order to effectively support the mission of the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve System as a whole, we must anticipate, act, and adapt our work to an ever-evolving financial market landscape. We\u2019re in the midst of the largest investment program in the history of the Markets Group, with a focus on its people, platforms, and processes. We\u2019ve learned through crises to break up silos and embrace the importance of an adaptable workforce centered on skills, breadth, and core competencies. To put this into practice, we are evolving our organizational structure to create larger and broader business units. This gives us the opportunity to provide ongoing growth opportunities for our team and develop the next generation of markets specialists who are versatile and have broad knowledge of financial markets, financial market infrastructure, and policy operations, equipping them with the skills to deal with stress and contagion across multiple markets. We know that well designed and executed operations must be seamlessly conducted, with collaborative teams ensuring execution and settlement on platforms that are robust and efficient and use the latest technology.\n\nThe New York Fed has long been designated as the implementation arm of the FOMC, which makes sense given the centrality of New York in both domestic and international financial markets. Effective and efficient monetary policy implementation requires a practical and thorough understanding of the broad range of financial markets through which policy operates. By locating the duties related to the execution of monetary policy here in New York, the Federal Reserve System benefits from the collective institutional knowledge, experience in financial markets, and deep pool of specialized financial talent in the place where it is most concentrated. The New York Fed\u2019s unique insights have been especially valuable during periods of stress, most notably in the 2008 financial crisis and the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Impact of Our Work\n\nNow, I\u2019d like to talk about several concrete ways that the market intelligence we gather contributes to policy discussions globally. First, at each two-day FOMC meeting, the Markets Group\u2014specifically, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) Manager\u2014delivers the \u201cDesk Briefing,\u201d which covers financial market developments and market operations since the previous FOMC meeting. These briefings are built on all of the Markets Group\u2019s core activities: market monitoring, open market operations, discount window lending, Treasury auctions, and reference rate production. FOMC members, some of whom are not as familiar with financial market developments, consider the briefing when discussing and voting on policy decisions. The briefing is a key way we ensure policymakers have a keen understanding of how monetary policy flows through to financial markets. It is also a tangible example of the way in which we leverage all the work of our team\u2014including high-frequency market monitoring, in-depth analytics, and open market operations\u2014in support of the mission of the Federal Reserve.\n\nZooming out a bit, in addition to our briefings and collaboration within the Federal Reserve System, we are one of the main connection points, along with the Board of Governors, for the Federal Reserve System\u2019s interactions with international partners such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). New York Fed President John Williams is the chair of the Markets Committee of the BIS. The Markets Committee serves as a forum for central bank officials to discuss current market conditions, market functioning, and monetary policy implementation. Over the years, the Committee has broadened its discussions from the initial focus areas of gold and foreign exchange to include a focus on core financial markets such as short-term money markets, sovereign debt, and foreign exchange more generally. Much as the Desk Briefing provides the FOMC with insights on the implementation and transmission of monetary policy, the Markets Committee at the BIS facilitates discussion of financial market functioning and implications for central bank policy across the globe. In a parallel to the Desk Briefing, insights from across the Markets Group\u2019s areas of work are key inputs to the Markets Committee.\n\nZooming out even further, insights from our market intelligence gathering complement expertise from the New York Fed\u2019s Supervision Group to support my work as a representative to the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI). The CPMI is a committee of the BIS that brings together nearly 30 central banks from around the world to promote and monitor the safety and efficiency of payments, clearing, and settlement systems globally. As recently announced, the CPMI workplan for the coming year will focus on risk management of financial market infrastructures, enhancement of cross-border payments, and digital innovation in payments, clearing, and settlement. In my contributions to the discussions held in this forum, I rely upon the deep, specialized knowledge of payments systems from across the New York Fed, and in collaboration with the Board of Governors, to support the work of the CPMI.\n\nMultiple Market Perspectives\n\nIn implementing monetary policy and gathering market intelligence, we recognize that insights from our outreach are only as valuable as the set of market participants and counterparties we engage with. We regularly interact with primary dealers and other financial institutions in our open market operations. To ensure that our market intelligence is robust and reflects the full range of perspectives across market players, we actively focus on building and developing relationships with a broader set of investors and market participants, including official sector institutions, both domestically and abroad. We achieve this through not only our counterparty relationships but also our outreach and industry work. As an example, the New York Fed\u2019s advisory and sponsored groups allow us to glean insights from a range of market participants. There are several committees that together represent a wide range of types of market participants\u2014including asset managers, broker-dealers, corporates, financial market utilities, GSIBs, hedge funds, and proprietary trading firms\u2014and span a wide range of asset classes and investment strategies.\n\nThe Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets (IACFM) is comprised of investment industry leaders in both the private and public sector. Through regular dialogue, the IACFM provides a forum for leaders in the investment community to inform the New York Fed about financial market developments, conditions, and practices. We sponsor other committees that have a specific focus on particular segments of financial markets and advance industry wide initiatives. These include the Treasury Markets Practices Group, the Foreign Exchange Committee, and an upcoming committee focused on the use of robust reference rates that builds upon the work of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee.\n\nThrough these advisory and sponsored committees, we facilitate breadth in the universe of our market contacts. This ensures that we hear a wide range of viewpoints, thereby minimizing group think and giving us confidence that the market intelligence we pass on reflects viewpoints of the market as a whole. By design, these groups include different types of market participants. A couple stand out as particularly notable from a diversity standpoint. Last October, the Treasury Markets Practices Group named its first female chair, and members include industry leading women spanning trading, investment management, market infrastructure, and legal disciplines. The Foreign Exchange Committee remains one of the most diverse committees of its kind in the world in terms of women\u2019s membership, including both industry representatives and ex officio members.  \n\nFrom the perspective of our operations, we work to support diversity in our counterparties and procurement efforts. For example, while we regularly transact with some of the largest service providers in the world, we made a concerted effort while operating COVID-related emergency facilities to encourage minority, women, and veteran-owned firms to participate in our operations. We added 12 diverse firms to serve as counterparties or transaction agents, and we awarded a cash management mandate to a majority women-owned firm following a highly competitive procurement process. In our open market operations, we continue to explore opportunities to diversify the set of counterparties we engage with, which currently include not only primary dealers but also money funds, government sponsored enterprises, and depository institutions.\n\nThe Case for Diversity\n\nI began working in the financial industry when it was substantially more homogenous. There were not many women on trading floors back then, and there were even fewer women in leadership roles. When I look at my leadership team now, I see women heading several of our core business functions, including the Trading Desk, the Discount Window, Central Bank and International Account Services, and Technology Product Strategy. As I list those aloud, I realize how amazing and thrilling it is for me to work with so many capable and intelligent women leaders. And I applaud the gains in diversity at the most senior ranks in our organization.\n\nI am proud to share this room with such an impressive group of women who also have risen to the top of this industry due to their depth of expertise and years of hard work. Through events like this, we uplift and inspire one another. I am optimistic for the next generation entering the workforce and the opportunities that will be available to them. So while we celebrate the changes we have seen in our industry, I will note with humility that there is still a lot more work to do to build a more diverse and inclusive workplace.\n\nBefore I conclude, I wanted to express why I believe that diversity and inclusion are essential for our work in the Markets Group. Obviously, there's a moral imperative for diversity, and numerous studies have shown the benefits to both productivity and the bottom line. More personally, one of the principles underpinning my leadership career is that the people are every institution\u2019s greatest asset. That\u2019s why an inclusive culture is so important.\n\nThroughout my time in both the public and private sectors, I have been wary when finding myself in a room full of people who look and sound the same. Perhaps they all come from a similar background, represent similar types of market participants, or are all sharing the same viewpoint on financial markets. We face dynamic challenges in markets, economics, and financial technology, and I want to hear different perspectives on how to interpret data, fresh takes on old problems, and innovative approaches to new challenges. In a time of rapid change, it is imperative to have a range of voices in the room, especially those that bring unique perspectives. As we build and maintain teams, it is crucial that we have not only the best people but a true variety of viewpoints and experiences. Without this, we will be unable to maintain our forward-looking leadership in financial markets.  \n\nAs former Supreme Court Justice and New York native Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, \u201cWe will all profit from a more diverse, inclusive society, understanding, accommodating, even celebrating our differences, while pulling together for the common good.\u201d\n\nBy working to hear as many perspectives and viewpoints as possible, we uncover new ideas and innovative solutions, paving the way for a dynamic, brighter future.\n\nThank you very much."

    "speaker": "Mihaela Nistor",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/nis240611",
    "content": "Good morning. And thank you all for having me.\n\nWe gather here today at an inflection point in the evolution of risk management, a discipline that has already seen profound transformation since the global financial crisis.\n\nAs we navigate this ever-changing landscape, I would like to share a few thoughts about adopting a more nuanced approach to understanding and managing the multitude of risks that confront us as enterprise risk managers. I\u2019ll discuss the overall risk landscape, both externally and internally. Then, I\u2019ll offer my perspective on the evolution of risk management practices, including the topic that everyone is talking about today: the role of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBefore we dive into that, I should note that my remarks reflect my personal opinions and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Risk Landscape\n\nThe external risk environment today is characterized by an unprecedented rate of change and interconnectivity on a global scale. We are witnessing an explosion of emerging risks that develop more swiftly and are more interrelated than ever before. They range from geopolitical conflicts, economic uncertainties, and market volatilities \u2026 to cyber threats, data privacy issues, and disruptive new technologies \u2026 to pandemics, supply-chain pressures, and extreme weather events. This list represents just a few facets of a complex matrix. And these risks do not exist in silos. Rather, they interact and amplify one another in ways that can be difficult to predict.\n\nWithin our organizations, the landscape is equally complex and multifaceted. To simplify our discussion, I\u2019ll divide the internal risk landscape into two categories: \u2018run the business\u2019 and \u2018change the business.\u2019\n\nAs we strive to run our businesses effectively, we are faced with the increasing complexity of operations, products, services, and geographic footprints. This complexity is further compounded by the intertwining of financial and non-financial risks. For instance, a disruption in the supply chain today can have cascading effects on a firm\u2019s financial performance, regulatory compliance, and reputational standing. Moreover, the rapid pace of automation and digitization has magnified the speed and scale at which risks can materialize and spread. The integration of digital technologies into every facet of an organization\u2019s operations means that cyber risks are no longer confined to IT departments but permeate the entire organizational fabric.\n\nIn parallel, organizations are engaged in a multitude of transformation initiatives aimed at staying competitive, leveraging technological innovations, and creating value for shareholders. These projects, while essential, introduce their own sets of risks. One challenge is in balancing these transformation efforts with the ongoing demands of running the business. Moreover, there is often an insufficient understanding and management of the new risks these initiatives create, including dependencies on outsourced work and third-party vendors, which open up additional vulnerabilities.\n\nEvolution of Risk Management\n\nTo navigate this intricate landscape, risk management strategies are evolving to be more adaptive, integrated, and proactive.\n\nOne fundamental principle is to adopt an aggregated and integrated view of risk across an enterprise. This comprehensive perspective allows us to understand the full spectrum of risks, identify hotspots, assess risk concentrations, and evaluate the relative impacts of the multitude of risks an organization has catalogued. Such an approach enables us to prioritize actions more effectively, ensuring that our resources are directed toward the most critical areas. This holistic view also fosters better alignment between risk management and business strategy, ensuring that risk considerations are embedded in decision-making processes at all levels of the organization.\n\nWe also recognized that different types of risks require different management approaches, leading to a \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 and tailored risk-management treatments. For risks associated with running the business, developing a strong risk culture is essential. This involves fostering an environment where every employee understands their role in risk management and is encouraged to identify, raise, and mitigate risks proactively, as part of a culture of continuous improvement and active learning. By viewing mistakes as opportunities for learning rather than grounds for punishment, we can improve and optimize processes. And over time, we can build healthier organizations that create better outcomes.\n\nWhen managing risks related to transformation initiatives, a portfolio view allows organizations to evaluate risks across projects collectively rather than in isolation. By doing so, we can better understand interdependencies and cumulative risk exposures. Proactively reviewing project designs and plans from their inception is crucial, as is maintaining the flexibility to pivot quickly in response to changing conditions. This agile approach enables us to adapt our strategies in real time, mitigating risks before they escalate.\n\nFor external emerging risks, where the impact is often unpredictable in advance, our focus should be on building an organization with a resilient core and implementing defenses in depth. Resilience encompasses all aspects of the business\u2014technology, operations, products, data, third-party relationships, supply chains, and, critically, our people. A resilient organization is one that can withstand and recover from disruptions, regardless of their nature or origin, and then evolve with the changes in the environment. Achieving this requires identifying critical assets and processes, understanding the minimum viable process in a disruption, and evaluating maximum downtime, dependencies, and contingency plans.\n\nPeriodically, resiliency must be tested, and the external risk landscape map should be refreshed to ensure that we capture emerging threats, model and analyze scenarios, and adjust our defenses accordingly.\n\nLeveraging New Technologies\n\nThe advent of new technologies, particularly AI, offers transformative potential for enhancing an organization\u2019s risk-management capabilities. AI can revolutionize how we detect, assess, and respond to risks in several profound ways, a few of which I\u2019ll highlight today.\n\nThe first is through predictive analytics. AI\u2019s ability to analyze vast datasets can uncover patterns and correlations that humans might miss, allowing us to anticipate risks before they fully materialize. This predictive power enables proactive risk management and informed decision-making.\n\nSecond, AI can greatly bolster monitoring and response capabilities. AI-driven systems, especially for information security, fraud, and insider threats, can monitor risk indicators in real time, providing immediate alerts when anomalies are detected. This allows us to respond swiftly, mitigating potential impacts before they escalate.\n\nThe third point I\u2019d like to highlight is AI\u2019s ability to enhance data integration and analysis. AI\u2019s advanced computing capabilities can quickly synthesize data from a large number of diverse sources, providing a more comprehensive understanding of risk factors and their interdependencies. This integrated analysis supports more nuanced risk assessments and better-informed decision-making. This is the hope we hold for Generative AI in the near future.\n\nThe last point I\u2019ll mention has to do with AI\u2019s role in conducting scenario simulation and stress testing around both financial and non-financial risks. AI can simulate various risk scenarios, enabling us to test our responses and refine our strategies in a controlled environment. This helps ensure that we are prepared for a wide range of potential disruptions.\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted in previous forums, while embracing AI, we must also be cognizant of the associated risks, such as biases in algorithms and data privacy concerns. A balanced approach that leverages AI's strengths while managing its risks will be essential.\n\nIn closing, the complex and interconnected risk landscape we face today requires a paradigm shift in how we approach risk management. By fostering a strong risk culture, adopting an integrated view of risks, leveraging new technologies, and remaining agile and resilient, we can build organizations that are not only capable of withstanding disruptions, but are also poised to thrive in the face of adversity.\n\nThank you for your attention to these key issues. I look forward to our discussions and insights throughout this conference."

    "title": "A Season of Change for the U.S. Treasury Market",
    "date": "Jun 5, 2024",
    "speaker": "Michelle Neal",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/nea240605",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you all for having me.1 I want to especially thank Scott O\u2019Malia and the ISDA team for the invitation to speak here at such an important time in the U.S. Treasury market.  As already introduced by Scott and Gary and subject to much further discussion at today\u2019s forum, the Treasury market is undergoing significant and transformative structural changes.  The expansion of central clearing in the Treasury market that will occur as a result of the SEC\u2019s central clearing rule is probably the single greatest change to Treasury market structure since the advent of electronic trading of Treasuries over central limit order books in the early 2000s, which paved the way for the high-frequency trading of Treasuries that is prevalent today.  This change is occurring during a critical period of growth for the Treasury market\u2014the Congressional Budget Office forecasts Treasury supply to increase by more than $20 trillion over the next 10 years.2   \n\nAs the market navigates the legal and operational work related to the expansion of central clearing, many questions will need to be answered with regard to how clearing will evolve and what effects it will have on the Treasury market more broadly.  As the SEC\u2019s central clearing rule is implemented, it will be crucial to carefully monitor market dynamics and track Treasury market liquidity and functioning.  Recent progress on the data and transparency front will help in this regard.  Additionally, as Treasury market structure undergoes this transition, market participants should remain cognizant of, and follow, best practice recommendations, which support the integrity and efficiency of this critical market.  Today\u2019s forum will cover many of these issues in detail, and I am excited to hear views about progress on these topics.\n\nBefore I go any further, let me share the standard Fed disclaimer: the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCentral Clearing Expansion: Transformation for U.S. Treasury Market Structure\n\nTo set the stage for my discussion today, I will first briefly review the segments of the U.S. Treasury market that will be affected by the SEC\u2019s central clearing rule.  Last December, the SEC adopted rule amendments that will expand central clearing in the U.S. Treasury market.3  The SEC\u2019s final rule calls for the clearing of the following Treasury security transaction types, with some exemptions: all repo and reverse repo with a direct member of a central counterparty (CCP); all purchases and sales occurring over interdealer brokers; and all purchases and sales between a direct CCP member and a registered broker-dealer, a government securities broker, or a government securities dealer.4 \n\nPractically speaking, these changes are expected to result in a significant migration of Treasury repo and reverse repo into central clearing.  Additionally, principal trading firm electronic cash trading will likely move into central clearing.  Market estimates for the amount of daily transaction volume that will move into clearing range from $2 trillion to over $4 trillion.  For context, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), the only CCP that clears Treasuries, today clears $7 trillion in transactions each day, on average.5 \n\nIncreased central clearing offers several benefits.  Central clearing reduces settlement flows through multilateral netting, and, in turn, reduces settlement fails and counterparty credit risk.  Additionally, for transactions that are cleared through a CCP, the consistent and robust risk management practices of that CCP are applied, making the market safer by reducing systemic risk.  More trades going through CCPs also would increase visibility into clearing and settlement flows for the official sector, providing improved market monitoring. \n\nThe work of the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), a group of market professionals committed to supporting market integrity and efficiency, provides evidence of these benefits.  The TMPG has documented the current fragmented use of clearing in the U.S. Treasury market in a series of white papers.6  Beyond the risks I have already discussed, these white papers detail additional risks increased clearing can mitigate, including the concentration of clearing and settlement risk with interdealer broker platforms, delays in trade matching, and opaque third-party credit extension arrangements.  Fragmented clearing results in increased systemic risk to the Treasury market, so the more trades that move into central clearing, the more those risks are mitigated.\n\nFor the benefits of central clearing to be realized, however, it is critical that any CCP be well supervised and have robust risk management practices.  The importance of strong CCP risk management only increases with the volume of transactions that flow through that CCP. \n\nAs the SEC\u2019s central clearing rule goes into effect, I see both challenges and opportunities ahead, where the market will need to actively engage and prepare.  For example, as more transactions move into central clearing, market participants will need to work together to develop and adopt various clearing client access models. \n\nCurrently, the most actively used client access model for clearing in the U.S. Treasury market is the sponsored service model, where FICC direct members can sponsor client repo trades into clearing.  The sponsored service model has grown notably over recent years, in terms of both volume and the number of sponsors and sponsored clients.  Sponsored service currently clears around $1 trillion in transactions daily, up from around $500 billion daily in early 2020. \n\nWhile the growth in sponsored service has been promising for greater clearing of Treasury securities, there remain other opportunities for further expansion of repo clearing.  Currently, the sponsored service market practice is to bundle repo execution and clearing services together.  Specifically, FICC direct members that provide sponsored service\u2014typically banks and dealers\u2014generally require that clients execute sponsored repo trades with the sponsoring bank or dealer.  This is referred to as \u201cdone with\u201d trading, since the repo trade is done with the bank or dealer that sponsors it into clearing. \n\nTo be clear, \u201cdone with\u201d trading is a business model practice preferred by the sponsoring bank or dealer, rather than a market structure parameter imposed by FICC.  While there are benefits to this practice, including balance sheet efficiencies for the sponsoring bank or dealer, it makes it extremely difficult for a client to clear transactions that are not conducted with a sponsoring bank or dealer (known as \u201cdone away\u201d trading).  The result is that clients who wish to clear their repo trades will limit their repo counterparties to sponsoring banks or dealers.\n\nAdditionally, while sponsored service is used actively for clearing repo trading, similar client clearing for cash trading is not widely used currently.  As I mentioned earlier, the SEC\u2019s clearing rule will require trades occurring over interdealer brokers to be centrally cleared, creating the potential need for more options for client clearing of cash trades.  FICC has developed a model for agent clearing of client trades, but it is unclear as of yet which firms may choose to provide such services.  A \u201cdone away\u201d option for cash clearing would likely also be beneficial.\n\nThese challenges also present opportunities for innovation and new business models.  Demand for new clearing services may drive the entrance of new central counterparties to compete for that business.  Additionally, the need for particular clearing solutions in the market, such as offering \u201cdone away\u201d clearing and cash trade client clearing, may result in firms launching new business lines to capture those market opportunities.  Treasury market participants may want to look to other markets where client clearing is more prevalent, like the futures market or the swaps market, to learn from experiences there. While regulatory and institutional differences may rule out exact replication of clearing models used elsewhere, studying these markets could be instructive for further development of Treasury market clearing alternatives.\n\nGiven the importance and scope of this market structure change, it is crucial for market participants to engage now to identify how the SEC rule affects their businesses and to develop plans for clearing eligible transactions.  Treasury cash clearing is required to go into effect by the end of 2025, and repo clearing is required to go into effect by June 30, 2026.  While these dates may sound far off now, the time will pass quickly given the complexities involved.  I am thankful that events like today\u2019s forum will advance the discussion around these topics, and I encourage all of you to make it a priority at your organizations to actively engage in this transition.\n\nData and Transparency: Critical to Monitoring Market Structure Change\n\nI will turn now to the important topic of data and transparency in the U.S. Treasury market.  As this change to market structure occurs, it will be important to monitor the Treasury market\u2014across all segments\u2014to assess the effect of the changes.  Thankfully, there have been productive improvements in data availability and transparency recently that will help the market and the official sector observe any changes in trading dynamics.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Research (OFR) adopted a final rule to establish a data collection for certain non-centrally cleared bilateral repo transactions.7  This permanent data collection fills an important gap in data available on the U.S. Treasury market, as the OFR estimates that the non-centrally cleared market is $2 trillion in size, with the vast majority of these transactions occurring in Treasury securities.8  In a 2023 white paper on data availability and transparency in the U.S. Treasury market, the TMPG highlighted that the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market is an area with lower data availability and noted the OFR\u2019s efforts to address these data gaps.9\n\nThis data collection will be critically important as the official sector monitors changes in trading dynamics when expanded central clearing is implemented.  As I mentioned earlier, under the SEC\u2019s clearing rule, much of the currently non-centrally cleared Treasury repo will likely migrate to central clearing.  This data collection will allow the official sector to track that migration and understand the profile of the remaining repo in the non-centrally cleared bilateral market.\n\nAdditionally, this data collection will improve official sector understanding of the margin practices in the non-centrally cleared bilateral market.  Margin, which is sometimes expressed as a haircut, is an important risk management tool used to protect against counterparty credit risk.  In 2022, the OFR conducted a pilot data collection in the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, and it found that over 70 percent of Treasury repo transacted with zero haircut, a finding that warrants additional study.10 \n\nThe data collection under the new OFR rule will allow the official sector to identify how enduring this low-haircut practice has been, and to monitor whether haircut practices change in the non-centrally cleared bilateral market when a greater portion of repo moves into clearing.  However, even in the cleared sponsored repo space, at times margin is not posted by the client but is rather posted by the bank or dealer sponsoring the repo into clearing.  In light of these issues, the TMPG is working on a white paper on risk management in the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, including a comparative review of margin practices across repo market segments.11\n\nElsewhere in the repo data sphere, changes have also been proposed to Federal Reserve\u2019s FR2004 data collection, which gathers information from primary dealers on market activity in U.S. Treasuries and other marketable debt.  The proposed changes would require primary dealers to separate out reporting of sponsored general collateral repo.12  This proposed change would complement other sources of data on the cleared repo market, including the FR2004 data collected currently on the cleared bilateral market and the OFR\u2019s centrally cleared repo data collection.13\n\nAnother important change in data availability and transparency in the U.S. Treasury market is the recent public release of on-the-run nominal coupon transaction-level data by FINRA.14 The data is available to FINRA members and FINRA data subscribers on the same day and available to the general public on a next-day basis.  FINRA has taken several precautions to ensure that the release of this data does not disrupt liquidity provision.  Specifically, the data does not include any identifying information about the transaction counterparties, the data is not published until the end of the day, and the trade sizes published are subject to transaction size caps on large trades. \n\nThe availability of this transaction data to the public will allow for monitoring of trading dynamics in the on-the-run market as the SEC\u2019s central clearing rule is implemented.  As I previously mentioned, trades over interdealer brokers will be required to be centrally cleared, and the majority of trades over interdealer brokers are conducted in on-the-run securities. Additionally, I hope that, following an assessment of this data publication, consideration will be given to increased and carefully curated transparency of transaction data in other segments of the Treasury market, such as the less liquid off-the-run market, a topic I discussed in my remarks last November at the U.S. Treasury Market Conference.15\n\nBest Practices: Important Touchstones during Transitional Times\n\nFinally, I will turn to the importance of market best practices during times of change like today.  The TMPG best practice recommendations provide an important reference for market participants to support the integrity and efficiency of the U.S. Treasury market, along with markets for agency debt and agency MBS.16  The sound functioning of the U.S. Treasury market is critical given the key roles Treasury securities play in the financial system\u2014as global risk-free benchmarks for other financial instruments, as the primary means of financing the U.S. government, and as the instruments used to implement Federal Reserve monetary policy.\n\nEspecially during this time of significant market structure change, it is important to continuously engage with the TMPG best practices to ensure these changes are implemented in a way that promotes market integrity and efficiency.  TMPG best practices evolve over time and are updated and amended as needed to support the resiliency of the covered markets.  In fact, this February, the TMPG updated its best practice recommendations to promote greater repo market price transparency around early morning transactions over interdealer voice brokers, encouraging publication of all voice trades to electronic trading screens when the trades are agreed to.17  I urge you all to review the updated best practices and familiarize yourselves and your firms with the recommendations. \n\nThinking about this time of change in the Treasury market reminds me of the song \u201cTurn! Turn! Turn!\u201d\u2014written by Pete Seeger and popularized by The Byrds\u2014which chronicles the seasons of life.  In particular, the lyrics \u201ca time to plant, a time to reap\u201d are relevant to where we find the Treasury market today.  As we enter upon this season of change for the Treasury market, now is the time to plant the seeds of sound market structure so we can reap the benefits of a more robust and more resilient Treasury market in the future.  The work of promoting U.S. Treasury market resilience is ongoing and requires all hands on deck.  The official sector, private sector, and academia all need to work together to preserve the continued smooth functioning and safety of this most important market.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nI\u2019m honored to be here today among so many Economic Club of New York members, fellows, students, and staff. The Club has the privilege of hosting incredible speakers, but it\u2019s our members who truly create the robust, dynamic environment for our discussions. Thank you for being part of this wonderful organization.\n\nAs I look ahead to the end of my term as Club chair, I\u2019d like to thank my predecessor in this role, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis; our board members; our tireless President and CEO, Barbara Van Allen; and the small yet remarkably productive staff of the Club. When I began my term as chair back in June of 2020, the ECNY was strong and vibrant, all thanks to their vision, commitment, and hard work.\n\nAt the same time, 2020 was a period of tremendous uncertainty for the ECNY. After all, our hallmark was in-person events. With the onset of the pandemic, we needed to reinvent what it meant to be the ECNY in very short order. We all quickly came together and innovated to an incredible degree so that we could reach our members in new ways. Zoom became our meeting room, and we later found success in hybrid events. We launched new programs, including a series focused on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Innovation and Social Impact Challenge, and the podcast. And we did it while maintaining the financial strength of the Club.\n\nHere is one statistic that captures the dramatic evolution of the Club. Over the past four years, we held 100 events, or 25 per year, on average. That compares to 660 events in the prior 113 years, or about six per year. That\u2019s over a 300 percent increase in productivity! There are many exciting things planned for the future, and I look forward to watching the Club evolve and prosper in the years to come.\n\nFor today\u2019s discussion, I\u2019ll transition away from my role as ECNY chair and back to my job as president of the New York Fed. I\u2019ll spend some time focusing on how the Federal Reserve is working to achieve both maximum employment and price stability. I\u2019ll also discuss the progress we\u2019ve seen in the economy in terms of getting supply and demand in better balance and bringing inflation back down to the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC\u2019s) 2 percent longer-run goal. Finally, I\u2019ll share my view on where the economy is headed.\n\nNow I need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dual Mandate\n\nAs I never tire in saying, the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy goals are clear: maximum employment and price stability. The overarching objective of monetary policy today is to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time while maintaining a strong labor market.\n\nEconomic Progress\n\nThe good news is that over the past two years, we have made considerable progress toward these objectives. After last year\u2019s strong GDP and job growth, incoming data point to a slowing, but still solid pace of growth in economic activity in the first half of this year. Demand-supply imbalances have diminished. Global supply chains, which were severely disrupted during the pandemic and early in the recovery, have mostly returned to normal. At the same time, inflation has come down considerably.\n\nLet me dive deeper into the maximum employment side of our mandate. First and foremost, the labor market remains quite strong. Labor supply has been boosted by high levels of labor force participation among individuals aged 25-54 years, as well as by increased immigration flows. The unemployment rate has been under 4 percent for more than two years\u2014the longest such stretch in over 50 years. This measure\u2014now at 3.9 percent\u2014is close to my estimate for the unemployment rate that is likely to prevail over the longer run.\n\nEven as the economy and labor market remain strong, various labor market indicators show that demand-supply imbalances that emerged following the pandemic continue to recede. Most of these measures have returned to pre-pandemic levels. But two are still signaling a tighter labor market than before the pandemic: job vacancies and wage growth. After skyrocketing over the course of 2021 and early 2022, the rate of job openings has subsequently steadily declined, but still remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Wage growth has displayed a similar pattern, including for so-called job switchers for whom wage growth is highly sensitive to labor market conditions.1 That said, wage growth has yet to fully return to levels consistent with 2 percent price inflation on a sustained basis.\n\nThat provides a nice segue to the topic of inflation, the other half of our mandate. Inflation has declined significantly since mid-2022. This drop has been broad-based, with inflation lower in all major categories\u2014food, energy, goods, and services. The 12-month percent change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index has continued to decline, falling from its 40-year high of above 7 percent in mid-2022 to 2.7 percent in the latest reading. The decline in inflation has benefited from a reduction in demand and supply imbalances, both here in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nIndeed, this phenomenon is not unique to the United States. Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European economies experienced historically high inflation and have similarly seen relatively rapid declines in inflation as well. In fact, based on the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, the inflation rates in the euro area, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States are all now nearly the same. While every region has its own set of conditions, global factors affected inflation in advanced economies around the world.2\n\nEven with this good news, inflation in the United States remains too high, and in recent months there has been a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent goal. Extracting the signal from the noise when it comes to inflation readings is especially challenging now, since the economy is still feeling the aftershocks of the supply chain issues and high inflation following the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.\n\nI\u2019ll point to a few areas of research developed by my colleagues at the New York Fed to better understand the data. The most recent reading of our Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation measure was 2.6 percent in March, about the same level as it was in December, and down nearly 3 percentage points from its peak in June 2022.3 Furthermore, measures of inflation expectations from our Survey of Consumer Expectations have remained broadly stable and are generally in line with their pre-Covid ranges at all horizons.4 And global supply chain issues have mostly receded, according to both our Global Supply Chain Pressure Index and evidence from our regional surveys of businesses.5,6\n\nOverall, I see some of the recent inflation readings as representing mostly a reversal of the unusually low readings of the second half of last year, rather than a break in the overall downward direction of inflation. With the economy coming into better balance over time and the disinflation taking place in other economies reducing global inflationary pressures, I expect inflation to resume moderating in the second half of this year. But let me be clear: inflation is still above our 2 percent longer-run target, and I am very focused on ensuring we achieve both of our dual mandate goals.\n\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that many factors beyond monetary policy influence the economy and financial markets. These include global drivers of supply and demand, as well as factors that are currently affecting the supply side of the U.S. economy that are driving up GDP and job growth. Therefore, the stance of monetary policy needs to be considered in this broader context, and cannot be understood simply by looking at the growth rate of the economy, or comparing the interest rate to its longer-run level or r-star.\n\nLooking at this broader context, the behavior of the economy over the past year provides ample evidence that monetary policy is restrictive in a way that helps us achieve our goals. We are seeing clear and consistent signs that the imbalances between supply and demand in the economy are receding. And we have seen a broad-based decline in inflation. Overall, the risks to achieving our maximum employment and price stability goals have moved toward better balance over the past year.\n\nAt its May meeting, the FOMC kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In announcing that decision, the Committee said it \u201cdoes not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\u201d7\n\nAdditionally, the Committee said it will \u201ccontinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities,\u201d and beginning in June, \u201cwill slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings.\u201d The decision to slow the pace is in no way indicating an imminent cessation of shrinking the balance sheet. Rather, by slowing the pace, we\u2019re better able to monitor conditions and facilitate a smooth transition to the appropriate level of ample reserves.\n\nI see the current stance of monetary policy as being well positioned to continue the progress we\u2019ve made toward achieving our objectives. In terms of my forecast for the economy, I expect GDP growth this year to be between 2 and 2-1/2 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to be about 4 percent at the end of this year, and then move gradually down to its longer-run level of 3-3/4 percent thereafter. As the growth of economic activity gradually slows and demand and supply continue to come into better balance, I expect overall PCE inflation to moderate to about 2-1/2 percent this year, before moving closer to 2 percent next year.\n\nIt goes without saying that the outlook is uncertain. The risks are two-sided, with geopolitical events and China\u2019s growth outlook prominent examples. Because of this, we will continue to keep an eye on the totality of the data, so that we make policy decisions that ensure that we get inflation sustainably back to 2 percent while maintaining a strong labor market.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019ll close with this. We have seen a great deal of progress toward our goals over the past two years. I am confident that we will restore price stability and set the stage for sustained economic prosperity. We are committed to getting the job done."

    "content": "The below transcript has been republished from Macro Musings, a podcast hosted by David Beckworth of the Mercatus Center. Listen to the podcast episode.\n\nDavid Beckworth: Roberto, welcome back to the show.\n\nRoberto Perli: David, thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great pleasure to be here, to be back, actually, after, what, three years, I think?\n\nBeckworth: Yes. Last time you joined us, it was October 2020, a very different conversation than we'll have today. Back then, FAIT had just been introduced. We were talking about it. I think we talked about how it was similar to temporary price-level targeting and some of the issues surrounding it. I think that I, back then, was promoting nominal GDP targeting, but that's not our conversation today. Today, we're going to talk about Fed's balance sheet, its runoff plans, and the big announcement that came out at the last FOMC meeting, and your role, your role in all of this as the SOMA manager. So, a lot has changed since we've talked last. You were in the private sector. You're now at the New York Fed, and I'm curious to learn about your role. But for those listeners who weren't there for the first show, maybe go back and tell us, how did you get into macroeconomics and this journey to where you are today?\n\nPerli: Sure. I'll do that. But before I start, let me do this. Let me offer the usual disclaimer that the views that I express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. I say that not because the Federal Reserve will have any official views on what drove me to economics in the first place, but I think you will probably want to talk about something later on, on which the Fed will have some views. So, I think the disclaimer here is important, and so I said it before I forget it.\n\nPerli: Anyway, so what drove me to economics? Look, I grew up in Italy and went to college there, the University of Venice. In Italy, you have to pick your major from the very first day, not like here, where you can take a couple of years to decide. I chose economics because, to be perfectly honest, I didn't know yet what I wanted to do exactly. I thought that an economics degree offered a broad range of future possibilities. That was it.\n\nPerli: Then, the more I learned about economics, about the subject, I started developing, I think, a genuine interest about macroeconomics and how macroeconomic policies can affect the lives of so many people and so I also developed, I think, an interest in research. And with the help of my advisor at the time, I managed to get admitted to a few graduate schools in the US and the UK, and I picked NYU because I wanted to work with a specific professor.\n\nPerli: I was pretty sure that I wanted to become a professor of economics at that time, because I really liked the subject, and so I did. Then, I became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. It was my first official job. But then, I realized, like it often happens, what you think you really like to begin with, you really don't like it after a while [when] you're doing it. And so, I was fortunate enough to be hired into the Board of Governors a couple of years after I joined Penn.\n\nPerli: Vincent Reinhart hired me into a group that, actually, was a pretty interesting group over there, because it included Brian Sack, who was another future SOMA manager, Bill English and Jim Clouse, who went on, both of them, to become secretaries of the FOMC, and of course, Don Kim and Jonathan Wright of the famous Kim and Wright term premium models, Stefania D'Amico and Min Wei of the also famed D'Amico, Kim, and Wei model, which, I think, if I remember, you used to look at in the past. Anyway, it was a very good group, and there is where I really learned how monetary policy is made, and it was an incredible experience. I left for the private sector, but then this opportunity came up in the last year, and it was, I think, too good to pass, so here I am.\n\nBeckworth: I will mention that two of those individuals that you brought up, Brian Sack and Bill English, are previous guests of the show as well, so they've been on here. And you're now the head of the SOMA. You lead it. Tell us about that role. What do you do there? What is it like to manage the staff that you do? What is a typical day in the life of a SOMA manager?\n\nBreaking Down the Role of SOMA Manager\n\nPerli: As you know, the New York Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks spread across the United States, and along with the Board of Governors, we form what's called the Federal Reserve System. So, as a SOMA manager, one of the things that I'm in charge of is managing the SOMA for the System Open Market Accounts. The system is the keyword, so it means that we manage the portfolio for the whole Federal Reserve System, not just the New York Fed. The New York Fed is what is called the selected bank, because the FOMC selects, actually, the New York Fed every year to be the bank that executes transactions for the System Open Market Account. In fact, the FOMC has selected the New York Fed every year since, I believe, 1935 to do this particular job.\n\nPerli: And so, the New York Fed has the Markets Group, which is one of the largest groups within the New York Fed, and it performs a lot of functions, including providing financial services for other central banks and official institutions that have accounts with us, providing capital market services for the US Treasury, housing the discount window function for the New York District, and several other things. But then, of course, within the Markets Group, there is the so-called Desk, the trading Desk, which implements monetary policy via open market operations and monitors and analyzes domestic and also global financial markets.\n\nPerli: And so, in my current role [as] the SOMA manager, I'm responsible for exactly that; implementing monetary policy at the direction of the FOMC, as well as monitoring, analyzing, and communicating global financial market developments to the Committee. So, I participate in every FOMC meeting, and during the meeting, I brief the FOMC on financial market operational developments and answer, or try to answer, their questions. The briefing that I do draws on all of the work that the staff here in the Markets Group does, which includes market portfolio analysis, as I said, but, also, I want to mention our outreach effort, the collection of market intelligence and information, as well as the survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants that we administer regularly every FOMC cycle. So, overall, it's a very fun job, I think, and, definitely, I'm very happy to be in this seat.\n\nBeckworth: Just to be clear, when you say that you oversee the execution of monetary policy, that's every part of it? So, that would also include all of the facilities the Fed has set up, like the standing repo facility, currency swap lines. Would that be a part of your responsibility as well?\n\nPerli: Yes. So, we operate, every day, the overnight repo repurchase agreement facilities, ON RRP. Every day, we do the securities lending operations. Right now, we don't do, of course, outright purchases anymore, but the Desk used to do them when QE was going on. So, all of that is, or was done, here at the Desk. Of course, we also operate the swap lines with five large foreign central banks. Of course, those were much more popular at times of stress in global financial markets. Right now, the utilization of those facilities is minimal, but the fact that, right now, the utilization is minimal doesn't mean that they're not important. Of course, they're very important, should something happen that disrupts financial markets. So, bottom line, we do all sorts of operations here on the Desk.\n\nBeckworth: Okay, so, last time we were talking\u2014 again, it was in late 2020, the Fed was expanding its balance sheet. It grew rapidly, grew to [all-time] new highs, and since then, it's been reducing it. So, maybe you could just recap for us what has happened over the past few years to the Fed's balance sheet, just to bring us up to speed so we can look at your speech.\n\nRecapping the Fed\u2019s Balance Sheet Activities\n\nPerli: Sure. As you know, since June 2022, the Fed has been shrinking the portfolio. So, our portfolio has been reduced, over that time, by more than, actually, $1.5 trillion, about $1.25 trillion, roughly, in Treasuries and about a third of a trillion in MBS. So, it's a big amount over less than a couple of years. Now, the process has gone, obviously, very smoothly in the sense that control over short-term interest rates has continued to be very strong. In fact, the federal funds rate has been extremely stable within the target range almost every day at exactly eight basis points above the bottom of the target range, so, extremely, extremely stable within the range.\n\nPerli: There has also been no utilization of the standing repo facility outside of, of course, test transactions, which basically means that there has been no need, as of now, at least, to rely on this facility to keep the funds rate within the target range. The stability of the funds rate has also propagated to other money market rates. Repo markets, for example, have also been very stable, of course, not as stable as the federal funds rate, but we have seen occasional signs of funding pressures confined mostly to quarter ends, month ends, maybe days where there were large settlements of Treasury auctions, and maybe tax days, but they are occasional, very occasional pressures.\n\nPerli: I think it's true that these modest pressures are something that's relatively new, with respect to the post-pandemic period, because they really started emerging probably in the fall of last year. But before the pandemic, these type of pressures were fairly common. So, the fact that they emerged, I wouldn't attribute it to QT. I would just attribute it to a normalization of the environment [compared] to what it used to be. Anyway, in any case, I think things have gone fairly well so far.\n\nBeckworth: There's a lot of questions I could ask about this, but let me begin with this one. How do you think about QT, which is popularly called the reduction of the Fed's balance sheet? Is it the reverse of QE? Is it different? Does it have less of a bang? How do you think about QT, and how should we think about it?\n\nHow to Think About Quantitative Tightening\n\nPerli: Well, QT is the reduction of the portfolio, and, of course, QE had an effect on financial markets. There is no reason to think, I believe, that QT is not going to have an effect as well. In fact, I would look at the time period between, say, September 2021 and June of 2022, when QT started. So, between September of '21 and June 2022, there was a continuous crescendo of Federal Reserve communications about the portfolio.\n\nPerli: So, we went from no tapering to maybe tapering of QE, definitely tapering of QE, no QT, maybe QT, fast ideas, so faster QT, then even faster QT, and then the final announcement. So, again, continuous crescendo of communication in that direction. And if you look at what term premiums did over that period of time, they increased. Why did they increase? Well, because the market adjusted its expectations about the ultimate size of the balance sheet; very large and a little bit smaller, and smaller still, and smaller still, and continued reduction of the expectation of the ultimate size of the Fed's balance sheet between September and June.\n\nPerli: And so, that's exactly how I would have expected things to work. The market adjusted expectations about the ultimate size, the total stock, of QT, if you want, over time. And progressively, as this adjustment took place, term premiums [and] interest rates went up. So, yes, I do think that QT had an effect. Of course, since then, a lot of other things happened that influenced the total supply of securities. And so, the term premiums go up and down, but over that period of time that I mentioned, we can isolate, pretty well, the impact of just the balance sheet over everything else, and I think that the effect on interest rates was pretty noticeable.\n\nBeckworth: So, two big categories for the Federal Reserve's liabilities on the balance sheet are the reserves and the overnight reverse repo facility, which you mentioned. I think most people who listen to the show know both of those well. For those who may not, maybe talk a little bit about the overnight reverse repo facility. What is its goal, its use, its history, and how do you find it useful?\n\nBreaking Down the Overnight Reverse Repo Facility\n\nPerli: The ON RRP is a facility that was designed to provide a strong floor on short-term interest rates. So, the idea is that by offering an alternative risk-free overnight investment option to a number of counterparties that normally do not have access to remunerated balances at the Fed\u2014 I'm talking about mostly money market funds, but also GSEs\u2014 By doing that, the ON RRP essentially disincentivizes lending in the market at a lower rate, and it has been extremely effective in doing so. So, the funds rate has never been anywhere near the bottom or the very bottom of the target range, so, a very, very solid floor.\n\nPerli: What we learned over time, during all of these last several years, is that the ON RRP has been very responsive to market rates. So, the ON RRP has declined about $1.7 trillion between, say, June of last year, when the debt ceiling was postponed, and today, so, a $1.7 trillion decline. And that decline has come, basically, because over this period of time, the supply of Treasury bills has increased as the Treasury rebuilt the Treasury General Account after the debt ceiling was suspended. So, we had to issue a lot of Treasury bills. A lot of Treasury bill issuance increased the yield of Treasury bills over other market instruments, including over the ON RRP. And so, money funds rationally moved away, progressively, from the ON RRP towards this other instrument, Treasury bills, that provided a higher yield. So, in that sense, the ON RRP has functioned exactly as it was intended.\n\nPerli: It has also, I think, been very useful in absorbing virtually the entirety of the balance sheet runoff. So, if you look at where the ON RRP was when the balance sheet runoff started in June 2022 and where it is today, it declined about $1.7 trillion, about the same amount that the balance sheet declined, which is important, because this also means that over that same period of time, reserves remained roughly constant; up and down a little bit, but on a trend basis, they remained constant. And so, this means that, again, as I said, the entirety of the balance sheet runoff was absorbed, not by reserves, but by the ON RRP. And so, reserves have remained abundant within the banking system. So, overall, I think that the ON RRP has worked, really, as intended, and I should say, it has also been very useful in absorbing temporary shocks. For example, think about the spring of last year, when the banking system was under some stress. Money was flowing out of bank deposits and initially went to larger banks and then eventually ended up into money funds and, therefore, into the ON RRP.\n\nPerli: But, at times of need, the banks needed to borrow liquidity, and they borrowed mostly from the home loan banks. The home loan banks issued notes to meet this demand for bank funding. Because they issued these notes at the yield that was higher than the ON RRP, money funds exited the ON RRP and bought these notes, these home loan bank notes. That means, essentially, that money funds channeled money away from the ON RRP and back into the banking system where it was most needed. Then, of course, the situation normalized, and these dynamics ended, but at the time, when it was needed, the ON RRP, again, functioned as intended. It acted as a buffer against the shocks that were hitting the financial system at the time. So, overall, I think I'm very happy with the way the ON RRP has behaved here.\n\nBeckworth: Were you surprised by any of this? I ask because, ex-post, it seems obvious. Okay, Treasury issues a bunch of T-bills, it pulls funds away from the overnight RRP, but at the very beginning, it wasn't very clear to me whether reserves would drain first or overnight RRP would drain first. In hindsight, it seems pretty clear what happened, but going into it, was there an expectation that one or the other would do most of the work?\n\nPerli: Let me say [that] I'm not surprised that the ON RRP worked the way it did because, look, I think it's rational. So, interest rates on alternative instruments like Treasury bills, repos, home loan bank notes, at times, became higher than the ON RRP. So, why should money market funds leave money at the ON RRP and leave some performance on the table? So, no, I'm not surprised that the ON RRP worked as well as it did.\n\nBeckworth: What is the ultimate objective? Is it to run it down to zero?\n\nPerli: I don't know that we can say that there is an objective here. So, the ON RRP is a facility that is there every day. We run this operation every day. It's up to money market funds or the counterparties in this facility\u2014 money market funds for the most part, but also GSEs, as I said, and others\u2014 yes, it's up to them to decide how much they want to take up every day. I would say, though, that we do expect that the ON RRP will probably continue to do what it has been doing since June of last year, which [it] has been going down. It was going down very fast until a month or so, a month or two ago, but then it slowed down a little bit. Why has it slowed down? Because, among other things, Treasury bill issuance became negative, especially after mid-April with the tax inflows.\n\nPerli: But, eventually, bill issuance will become positive again on a net basis, and so, there is no reason to believe that the ON RRP will level off at the level where it is today, which is, again, in the $400 billion to $500 billion range. I, personally, do continue to expect it to go down. Will it go exactly to zero or will it level off at some positive number? That's very hard to tell. There are some reasons why some money funds may want to leave some funds in the ON RRP, regardless of rates, just for operational convenience, essentially.\n\nPerli: But from a point of view of reserve management, the implications are the same. Whether the ON RRP goes to zero or whether it levels off at some positive level, whatever that level will be, once that happens, reserves will start going down one for one with the shrinking of the portfolio, everything else equal. And so, this is one of the reasons, I think, why the FOMC decided to slow down\u2014 that the slowing down the pace or shrinking of the portfolio was a good idea, was a prudent idea.\n\nBeckworth: Let's talk about that. Before I do, just to acknowledge your point, what you're saying is that the overnight RRP is kind of an endogenous facility. It responds to changes. So, whatever the Treasury does, [and] Congress does, could have a bearing on the future balance that ends up being there. That's a great point. Let's talk about the decision from the last meeting to slow down the runoff. Maybe tell us what it is and what it might mean for the future of QT.\n\nSlowing Down the Runoff and the Future of QT\n\nPerli: Yes, so, as we discussed, the FOMC has been shrinking the portfolio since September 2022. It has been doing so by imposing some caps as to how much Treasuries and MBS securities can be reduced every month. So, those caps have been $60 billion per month for Treasuries and $35 billion per month for MBS. Of course, the MBS cap has not been binding, because interest rates have increased in recent years, and so prepayments have been very low. But, on average, the MBS portion of the portfolio has declined about $16 billion per month. So, in total, $60 billion of Treasuries plus about $16 billion on average, per month, for MBS equals about a $76 billion per month base of shrinking of the portfolio since September of 2022, which is when the caps reached the amounts that I just discussed.\n\nPerli: The Committee decided, at the May 1st meeting, that starting in June, the Committee decided to lower the cap for Treasury securities from $60 billion per month to $25 billion per month and to leave the MBS cap unchanged at $35 billion per month. Also, the Committee decided that any MBS prepayments in excess of the cap should be invested in Treasury securities in a way that roughly matches the distribution of Treasury securities outstanding. So, I think that the chance that there will be MBS principal payments in excess of the cap, I think, is very low, given the current interest rate configuration, but the decision to leave the MBS cap unchanged, even if it is unlikely to be binding, is consistent with the FOMC's intention to hold, primarily, Treasury securities in the long run.\n\nPerli: So, if you do the math, you say that you take the $25 billion in Treasuries, the new cap, which will be, again, binding every month, and you add to it a $16 billion average MBS unchanged from the past, and so that equals about a $40-$41 billion per month reduction in the portfolio, which is just a shade more than half of the roughly $76 billion average per month that we have seen so far. I think it's 54% or so. So, why did the FOMC make this announcement? Well, because they thought that slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure the smooth transition from a regime of abundant reserves to a regime of ample reserves, or closer to ample anyway, and that it would reduce the possibility that money markets would experience stress, like they did a few years ago. Also, they thought it would facilitate the ongoing decline in our securities holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.\n\nPerli: So, it's an important, maybe subtle point, but an important point nonetheless, [that] the announcement did not represent a shift in the monetary policy stance. Instead, it was just the implementation of a policy decision, slowing the pace of runoff at the appropriate time, that was made in accordance with the plans that were set out two years ago, in May of 2022. Now, another important thing that I would like to mention is that the decision to slow down does not mean that the balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would have if the pace had not been reduced. Instead, the reduction just allows the FOMC to approach the ultimate level of the portfolio more gradually. Interestingly, this is something that investors seem to understand very well, judging at least from survey results, like the survey of primary dealers or market participants that we do here at the New York Fed. But I thought it would be, I think, important to mention it anyway. Clearly, it's an important point.\n\nBeckworth: So, just to be clear, the total amount of reduction is not going to change just because the pace has changed, correct?\n\nPerli: That's right. Certainly, that's not the intent. The intent is simply to approach whatever a little more than ample reserves is, more gradually, to give a better chance to the system, to adjust to the lower level of reserves, to give a better chance to the existing level amount of reserves, to be redistributed appropriately across the banking system.\n\nBeckworth: So, maybe a way to think about it, at least for me, is that we don't want to repeat 2019, where we accidentally fell back, at least temporarily, into a scarce reserve system. This way, you feel your way gently to that kink in the curve. Has the Fed thought about looking to the standing repo facility as an indicator for that point? Imagine shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, and then suddenly there's a big uptake of the standing repo facility that would be like a loud signal, \"Hey, it's time to stop.\"\n\nPerli: I do think that the standing repo facility is a very useful addition to our toolkit. You have to think about, if we start seeing sustained usage of the standing repo facility, well, maybe that means that the level of reserves is not what we thought it was going to be, right?\n\nBeckworth: Yes.\n\nPerli: Probably, if we start seeing the sustained usage, maybe we went a little bit over the slightly above ample level of reserves that the Committee intends to achieve. Conversely, I think that where the standing repo facility could be very useful is the situation where there is a one-day shock to the system that temporarily creates a scarcity of reserves, and then the SRF is there precisely for that purpose, and then the next day, we're back to normal. So, I think that short-term temporary utilization would be perfectly consistent with the Committee plans, maybe a sustained usage, maybe not.\n\nBeckworth: Okay, so if we see a sustained use in the standing repo facility, it might be a clear signal. Now, you give some other indicators that you're looking for, to tell you when you've reached that point, in your speech. Maybe walk through those.\n\nHow to Determine the Critical Level of Reserves\n\nPerli: So, before doing that, let me also say that the SRF, the standing repo facility, is extremely useful because, among other things, it gives certainty to the market that they can\u2014 primary dealers and banks that are counterparties to the SRF\u2014 can borrow from the Fed should there be a shortage of reserves. In the past, I think that the market had no doubt that, should there be a big dislocation in funding markets, that the Fed would intervene, but the market didn't know when, how long it would take for the Fed to intervene, and the market didn't know to what extent the Fed would intervene. So, there was a considerable amount of uncertainty, and now, because the SRF is a standing facility, that uncertainty is gone. So, I think that's a very important point.\n\nPerli: Now, you asked, what are we going to look at to decide whether or not we're approaching the critical level of reserves? First, let me say that the Committee, in May 2022, laid out some very clear plans that said that the Committee would slow first and then stop the shrinking of the portfolio when reserves achieve a level that, in the judgment of the Committee, is somewhat above ample. Okay, so the Committee intends to stop before we get to the ample level of reserves, and, of course, that means, even more, wants to stop before we get to the scarce level of reserves, of course. So, what are we going to look at to judge how many reserves are in the system, so, whether reserves are still abundant or how close to ample they are? Well, there are many things. One obvious indicator is the spread between the effective federal funds rate and the interest rate on reserve balances, or the IORB, so, the EFFR to IORB spread.\n\nPerli: So, at present, that spread stands at negative seven basis points. And because the effective federal funds rate has not moved at all, virtually, that spread's being completely stable. It's just that if you plot it, it's just a flat line. So, the fact that it's completely stable tells us that it's one sign, at least, that reserves are still abundant. But when, or if, or when it starts becoming less negative, at some point in the future, it should provide an important clue that reserves may be becoming progressively less abundant. So, that's definitely one thing to watch.\n\nPerli: But even an increase in spread, like between EFFR and IORB, doesn't necessarily tell us where, along the demand curve for reserves, the financial system is operating. For this reason, I think there is value in monitoring other indicators. One other indicator that I think is very important is the elasticity of the federal funds rate to short-term shocks in the reserve supply, which you can think of as the local slope of the demand curve for reserves.\n\nPerli: So, there is a recent research paper, by colleagues of mine here in the research department at New York Fed and John Williams, of course, the president of New York Fed, that presents some econometric techniques that can help us measure and track this elasticity over time. If you look at what this exercise tells us, well, it tells us that, currently, the elasticity is close to, and also statistically indistinguishable from zero. In other words, it tells us that the slope of the demand curve is zero, and so we're very likely to be in the flat segment of the demand curve, which confirms what the EFFR to IORB spread tells us.\n\nPerli: So, I think that these are very important indicators that speak directly to the demand curve for reserves. Now, what we don't know for sure is exactly how abundant reserves are. Put differently, we don't know how far we are from where the demand curve starts showing a gentle local slope, or\u2014 which is the same thing\u2014 we don't know how far we are from the regional ample reserves. And importantly, we also don't know how quickly that slope increases after the inflection point, which means that we don't know exactly how gradual the transition from abundant to ample reserves will be.\n\nPerli: So, given all of this uncertainty, I think it's very useful to try to look at a number of other indicators that can provide some clues, some information, as to how far we are from this inflection point, and also, not just provide some information, but ideally provide some leading information, so that we're looking for potentially leading indicators, because, again, remember that the Committee said that we want to stop shrinking the balance sheet when we are somewhat above the ample level of reserves. So, to try to accomplish that, we're looking at a number of other things, and I can mention the domestic bank borrowing activity in the federal funds market, I can mention the timing of interbank payments, I can mention the amount of daylight overdrafts that we see every day, and I can mention, also, the share of repo volumes that trades at or above the IORB. \n\nBeckworth: This is very fascinating, and Roberto, it kind of reminds me of old-school monetarism. When we were younger, we would have to estimate real money demand, because you don't observe it. You don't observe the demand for a particular asset. And in this case, what you're struggling with is knowing the structural demand for reserves. Where does that kink occur in it? And so, you have to use all of these other indicators to kind of feel your way there. So, it's interesting to think about that process. Do you think that the structural demand for reserves grows over time? We have regulatory reasons [for] why it's elevated. Do you think that there's any kind of a ratchet effect? There's been some literature on this, that maybe banks depend on it, they grow comfortable. What are your thoughts on the structural demand for bank reserves over time?\n\nThe Structural Demand for Bank Reserves Over Time\n\nPerli: Well, we know from surveys, at least, like the Senior Financial Officer Survey, that we, the New York Fed and the board, administer periodically\u2014 I think the results from that survey are pretty clear. The survey says that the lowest comfortable level of reserves that banks want to hold has increased quite significantly in the last several years. The buffers that banks want to hold above that level have increased as well. And so, on net, if you add up the two, the amount of reserves that banks want to hold, so the demand for reserves, has definitely increased over time, so that all of the information that we have points in that direction. \n\nPerli: Of course, we don't know how much. That's part of the uncertainty. The Senior Financial Officer Survey is a relatively small sample of banks, so we cannot really extrapolate, from that sample, to the whole aggregate banking system. But we do know that the amount of reserves that the banking system demands is most likely substantially higher than it used to be in the past. And so, what we're trying to do is, we don't know exactly what this demand is, but we're trying to look at all of these indicators that I mentioned earlier to try to get the early warning signs of when we're getting somewhat closer to that level.\n\nBeckworth: So, let me push you on that just a little bit. Do you think that that growing structural demand for reserves is simply due to the economy growing\u2014 there's more demand for money, overall\u2014 or is any of it just tied to, they've gotten used to such big balances because of QE in the various programs?\n\nPerli: All we know for sure is that the demand for reserves\u2014 well, not even for sure\u2014 All of the indications we have is that the demand for reserve is higher, substantially higher. Certainly, the economy, the growth of the economy, is an important factor. So, the economy grows and [there are] more deposits, more deposits that can flee, and so [there are] more reserves that you need to hold against them. We also know that there have been some regulatory developments that have incentivized the holding of reserves. We also know that the banking system, just last year, not so long ago, went through some period of stress in the spring of March, April of last year. I think that that episode\u2014 again, if you look at the Senior Financial Officer Survey\u2014 might have been another catalyst for a heightened demand for reserves. So, I don't think that you have to go beyond these three\u2014 these different factors that I just mentioned to explain why the demand may be higher.\n\nBeckworth: One of the interesting conversations that's been going on since this banking turmoil last year has been a discussion about having banks use their collateral at the discount window to meet their liquidity requirements, so, make them more able to quickly turn capital into liquidity, so that if something comes up again, like March of last year, it would make it easier to handle that stress. And there's been a lot of push for this, and I suspect that if this does become the way that things are done-- and I know there's stigma. Stigma is a big hurdle to get past. But if banks were comfortable parking the existing, and more, collateral at the discount window and using that for liquidity requirement purposes, maybe some of that structural demand for reserves might go down a bit. Is that fair?\n\nPerli: I don't know that that's true. I think what I can tell you is that, definitely, the events of last March brought a lot of attention to the role of the discount window and the banks\u2019 degree of readiness to utilize the discount window when facing acute stress. More specifically, I think it highlighted that having established discount window access and significant collateral pledged at the window is important, because that's an easy way for banks to face a demand for cash. So, that's very important.\n\nPerli: So, I think that there are efforts, as you know, to try to make sure that banks\u2014 or try to incentivize banks to pledge collateral, to have all of the documents signed to be ready to access the window if needed. Recently, the Federal Reserve Board published some data as to how many banks are ready to borrow from the window, and I think that the numbers were encouraging, especially in terms of percentage of assets. Still, many banks are not ready to tap the window, but as a percentage of assets\u2014 I think 90 plus percent of the assets are covered. So, I think that that's an encouraging result. But, of course, I think more would need to be done there. But I think that this last March really drove home the point that being ready to access the window is important. We saw it very clearly. So, yes, I think that's what I can say. That's how I'm thinking about it at the moment.\n\nBeckworth: Yes, I think it's a very promising development, to see this push towards more discount window use. Let's move to another topic related to this, and that is the Fed's operating system. So, you've used the terms ample, abundant. But I would call it a floor operating system, which is different than what the Fed used pre-2008. They had a corridor, at least an asymmetric corridor, because zero was, really, the lower bound on bank reserves, what they earn.\n\nBeckworth: But you can think of other places like the ECB. They've had a symmetric corridor system before they've collapsed into a floor, and they've actually had talks about trying to tweak it a little bit recently. There's been a number of central banks that have talked about their operating systems, but I believe that you are very comfortable with the floor system that the Fed has. So, maybe talk to us about that. What do you see as its advantages, and why are you pleased with what it's done so far?\n\nThe Advantages of the Floor Operating System\n\nPerli: If you're asking me, why do we have a floor system, I can give you a very simple answer. The answer is because it works very well. [It\u2019s] as simple as that. I can elaborate on that, of course.\n\nBeckworth: Yes, please do.\n\nPerli: That's the gist of the message.\n\nBeckworth: It works very well, yes.\n\nPerli: So, as you just said, the FOMC de facto adopted a floor system during the global financial crisis. Then, importantly, in January 2019, it communicated its intent to maintain this framework, so, in January 2019, like a little more than four years ago. So, if we look at the minutes and other communications that led up to that decision, it's pretty clear why the Committee decided in favor of this floor system. The key advantages are that\u2014 or at least that were mentioned by FOMC members\u2014 are that the floor system allows for very good interest rate control in a variety of conditions, not just in normal time, but also when there is some stress in the market; so, good rate control and a good transmission of the federal funds rate to other money market rates and to broader financial markets as well.\n\nPerli: They also said that a different framework, that controlled the policy rate through active reserve management like we had before, probably would have some disadvantages. In particular, the level and variability of volatility of reserve demand and supply in that situation were likely to be much larger today than in the period before the crisis. Stabilizing the policy rate in different environments would require large and frequent open market operations, the size of which would be very hard to get right every single time.\n\nPerli: That would imply, basically, greater volatility in money market rates, and that's probably not desirable. Think about it, the TGA is much larger than it used to be. Currency is much larger than it used to be. The TGA, especially, is not only larger but is also much more variable than it used to be. And so, forecasting it accurately every day is a complicated task. And, maybe, many times, we would get the forecast right, but several times we wouldn't. And so, the days that we don't get the forecast right, you would see some significant swings in the funds rate and money market rates, and that, I think the Committee said, is not particularly desirable.\n\nPerli: Conversely, if you use a floor system, the floor system aims to make sure that the Fed always supplies reserves in the amounts that the banks demand. So, there is no need to get the forecast right every single day. There is an excess supply of reserves, and so that makes things a lot easier and a lot more stable. So, that's, I think, the definition of good, strong rate control. It's also efficient [and] it's very simple to operate. Maybe, another important thing to say, is [that] this ample reserve, this floor system, also allows more variability in other Federal Reserve liabilities, such as the TGA that we just talked about, but also the foreign repo pools, deposits by the FMUs, and so on. There are other liabilities that we have. So, the ability to accommodate changes, and even large changes, in these non-reserve liabilities, I think, is important, because those liabilities provide actual and concrete benefits to the economy. So, I think that that's another important angle that sometimes people don't consider.\n\nPerli: And finally, let me mention the fact that the floor system maintains interest rate control, also, at the same time that it allows for policies that significantly expand the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, whether that's for policy accommodation or for market functioning purposes, or whatever other reasons, but we can maintain rate control, even when we have to expand the balance sheet a lot, like we did in, say, 2020, for example. Obviously, this has proven to be the case in 2020, 2021, 2022. So, I think there are a lot of reasons, but, again, I would summarize it: It works really well.\n\nBeckworth: Very succinct. So, that's interesting. You mentioned that maybe some of the biggest challenges in forecasting the size of the Fed's balance sheet is the TGA and then, I guess, in crisis times, also, would be these other kind of autonomous, non-reserve liabilities, foreign repo, currency swaps. All of those things can also swing if there's something extraordinary going on, and that makes it harder, is what you're saying, if one were doing a corridor scarce reserve system. Is that right?\n\nPerli: Yes, but I\u2019m saying it is definitely\u2014 it's always hard to forecast anything during crisis times. There's no doubt about it. I'm saying that even during non-crisis times, forecasting the TGA is complicated. It has become a lot more complicated because it varies a lot. It's larger, much larger than it used to be. So, that's something that we don't have to worry about with the floor system. It makes things a lot simpler.\n\nBeckworth: So, you're saying that pre-2008, swings in the TGA were much less significant. I guess we got large budget deficits as far as the eye can see. We're probably going to have more debt ceiling challenges ahead. So, the TGA is always going to be with us, it looks like, going forward. The other non-reserve liabilities, do you think their importance has also gone up, in part, because of the growth of the global dollar market? We have money markets around the world denominated in dollars, and we want to keep that stable, so we need more flexibility in addressing that?\n\nPerli: I think that there are a lot of reasons why the variability of non-reserve liabilities has increased. You can point, certainly, to the stated objective that Treasury have to keep several days of future payments in the TGA, but there are, really, a lot of other factors. For example, as you just mentioned, we have the foreign repo pool where foreign central banks and other official institutions invest their short-term cash. So, that has grown as well, over time. The FMUs are getting bigger as well. The financial system is getting bigger, so, it's only natural that all of these other different liabilities grow over time. It's not the fault of anybody. It's just the financial system that's growing. It's getting bigger.\n\nBeckworth: I guess, to be succinct like you were earlier, if I had to make the case for this system, it's that the global financial system, particularly the global dollar system, is getting so large, and the Fed's balance sheet is kind of endogenous to that. It has to adapt to that development. Let me throw out one critique of that system that proponents of the corridor system often bring up, and that is that the overnight, unsecured, interbank market, if I said [all of that] correctly, isn't what it used to be. The federal funds market, for example, really\u2014 it's not really what it used to be. There's GSEs in it. But you don't have a lot of overnight unsecured lending between banks. There's not this price discovery between banks in an unsecured setting. Is that the market missing a big loss, or do you think it's made up for in other ways?\n\nPerli: The only thing I would say here is that the federal funds rate has been very stable, and not only that, but the stability\u2014 as I said at the beginning\u2014 of the funds rate has propagated to other money market rates. So, it's not that the funds rate exists in a vacuum, and who knows what the rest of the money markets are doing. What happens in the funds rate is propagated to other money market rates very efficiently and, I think, very well. So, I don't think we have, for the moment, a particular problem there.\n\nBeckworth: So, Roberto, it sounds like, then, that the FOMC and you, yourself, are very content with the operating system that we have at the Fed, and unlike other central banks that have taken a look at their operating system\u2014 so, like the ECB, as I mentioned\u2014 for now, we're going to stick with it, and it's good to go. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nPerli: Remember the disclaimer that I-\n\nBeckworth: It's you.\n\nPerli: -opened this conversation with. So, the opinions that I express here are my own and not those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. I speak for myself here. Look, this is a question you should ask policymakers, not me. I cannot front-run them.\n\nBeckworth: Yes, I understand. Roberto, as we wrap up the show, just looking ahead, how confident are you that the Desk has a clear enough sense of whether reserve supply is abundant or ample? What are you focused on moving ahead?\n\nReserve Supply Focus Moving Forward\n\nPerli: I think that we can be fairly confident that we are still very much into the abundant region of reserves. Of course, we cannot know exactly, for sure, how far we are from the ample region, but we are in the abundant region. All of our indicators tell us so. The effective funds rate spread to the IORB, the elasticity of the demand curve, all of the other auxiliary indicators that I mentioned earlier, they all agree at the moment that we are in the abundant region.\n\nPerli: So, going forward, of course, reserves will start shrinking, slowly, starting in June, because the pace of runoff of the portfolio will be halved starting in June. But, eventually, reserves will start going down, and I think it's important that the Committee decided to slow the pace, because it allows us more time to get a sense of how close we are to the ample region, gives the system more time to adapt to a lower reserve level. So, I think that decision was very prudent and made at the right time.\n\nPerli: So, at the moment, I'm very confident that we are still abundant. I'm very confident that the system works well. And so, we should\u2014 I expect that we will approach, smoothly, the ample region of reserves. So far, all [of the] indicators, they flash green. Let's put it that way. Of course, there are a lot of things that we don't know, so we have to be humble and respectful of that fact, and that's why we look, on a daily basis, at all of these indicators. But if, or when, these indicators change, we'll take note of that, but, for the moment, things are going very well.\n\nBeckworth: Okay, with that, our time is up. Our guest today has been Roberto Perli. Roberto, thank you so much for coming back on the program.\n\nPerli: David, thank you very much for having me. It's been an absolute pleasure to talk to you again. Thank you."

    "speaker": "Roberto Perli",

    "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you, Julie, and welcome again to our Annual Primary Dealer Meeting.1 It\u2019s a pleasure to be here delivering these remarks. Perhaps to no one\u2019s surprise, today I would like to discuss progress in reducing the size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, recent communications from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and the tools at our disposal to ensure a smooth journey from an abundant to an ample supply of reserves.\n\nI also think this is the ideal venue for that discussion. Primary dealers are core to the mission of the New York Fed. As the \u201cSelected Bank\u201d operating in financial markets on behalf of the FOMC, we rely on our interactions with primary dealers to implement monetary policy.2 In doing so, we have a shared interest in the continued depth, breadth, and resiliency of the Treasury market. Ensuring that Treasury securities remain the safest and most liquid asset in the world not only enables us to implement monetary policy efficiently, but also is foundational to the safety and stability of our financial system\u2014and indeed of markets around the world.\n\nWith that in mind, I will turn to the balance sheet.\n\nBut first, also to no one\u2019s surprise, I will offer a disclaimer. These views are my own, and not those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Reserve System, or any other organization.3\n\nHow Far We\u2019ve Come\n\nI\u2019ll start with a brief review of our progress in reducing the size of the balance sheet to date. Since June 2022, we have been implementing the plan laid out by the FOMC in May of that year.4 Throughout this process, our policy implementation framework has been performing as expected, and it has allowed us to maintain strong control over interest rates.\n\nLast October, speaking on this topic, I discussed how some notable and unexpected events provided critical tests of the ability of our framework to operate as intended even in times of stress.5 Our framework passed those tests with flying colors.\n\nI am happy to repeat myself and say that runoff has continued to proceed smoothly over the seven months since I delivered those remarks, and our implementation framework has continued to work well. Despite another $520 billion reduction in our holdings, including $412 billion of Treasury securities and $108 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), control over short-term interest rates has continued to be strong (Panel 1).\n\nIn fact, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR), which is our target rate for implementing monetary policy, has remained remarkably stable since the FOMC last raised the target range in July of last year. There has been no usage of the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) outside of test transactions, which means that there has been no need as yet to rely on this facility to keep the federal funds rate within the target range. And, of course, the level of the federal funds rate has affected other money market rates as expected.\n\nThat stability has also generally propagated to other money market rates. Repo markets have shown only occasional signs of funding pressures, confined largely to reporting dates, like some month- and quarter-ends, days of large settlements of Treasury auctions, and, to a lesser extent, tax dates. While these pressures represent a departure from the patterns we have seen since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, some temporary firming of overnight repo rates on those dates was common and more pronounced in the past; a re-emergence of this pattern is therefore not too surprising. In any case, it is worth noting that these seasonal dynamics are generally predictable and not an indicator of reserves conditions, but rather reflect the balance of the supply of and demand for funding in the context of various non-economic constraints.\n\nOur overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility has also remained a primary focus in recent months. As a brief reminder, the ON RRP was established to reinforce the floor on short-term interest rates. By offering an alternative risk-free, overnight investment option to a range of counterparties that do not otherwise have access to remunerated balances at the Fed, the ON RRP disincentivizes lending in the market at a lower rate.6 It has been extremely effective in doing so.\n\nIn addition, usage of the ON RRP has been very responsive to market rates. The over $1.7 trillion decline in ON RRP balances since the debt limit suspension last June is entirely consistent with how that facility was designed.7 As alternative private instruments started offering slightly higher rates, money market funds, which are by far the largest users of the ON RRP, responded by reallocating their investments away from ON RRP and toward those alternative investments.\n\nIn fact, the ON RRP has absorbed virtually the entirety of balance sheet runoff, on net, which is primarily why reserves have not declined since the runoff process started (Panel 2). I can confidently say that the ON RRP has supported the efficient implementation and transmission of monetary policy so far. Overall, our monetary policy implementation framework has performed extremely well, and I expect it will continue to do so in the future.\n\nImplementing the Plans for Balance Sheet Reduction\n\nBefore discussing the FOMC\u2019s recent announcement, I will review the FOMC\u2019s Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Balance Sheet, issued in May 2022, to provide some context about the decision to slow runoff.8 Those plans laid out a sequence of steps for significantly reducing the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities holdings (Slide 3).\n\nThe Committee decided to reduce securities holdings in a predictable manner, primarily by adjusting the reinvested amounts of principal payments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA). The FOMC established caps on the monthly pace of runoff; specifically, since September 2022, three months after balance sheet reduction began, those caps have been $60 billion for Treasury securities and $35 billion for agency debt and agency MBS.9 Note that the latter cap has not been binding, as higher primary mortgage rates have largely eliminated refinancing incentives for the mortgages underlying SOMA agency MBS holdings, resulting in very slow prepayments.10\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition from an abundant to ample reserve supply, the Plans stated that the Committee would first slow and then eventually stop the pace of decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve supply is still somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves. Last week, the Committee decided to start slowing runoff in June.\n\nAs specified in the May 1, 2024 FOMC statement and implementation note, effective next month, the redemption cap for Treasury securities will be lowered to $25 billion per month, while the redemption cap for agency debt and MBS will be left unchanged at $35 billion.11 In the unlikely event that agency debt or MBS paydowns exceed this amount, they will be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.12 This is the same approach the FOMC took in 2019.13 I want to emphasize that the Committee did not shift the stance of monetary policy last week; rather, it implemented a policy decision\u2014slowing the pace of runoff at the appropriate time\u2014according to the plans set out two years ago.\n\nSimilarly, at some point in the future, when the FOMC judges that reserve balances are somewhat above the level consistent with ample reserves, it will instruct the Open Market Trading Desk at the New York Fed (the Desk) to stop reducing the size of the balance sheet. Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, the size of the SOMA securities holdings will be held constant until the FOMC instructs us otherwise. Reserve balances, however, will likely continue to decline for a time, reflecting growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities. When the Committee judges that reserve balances are at an ample level, it will manage securities holdings to maintain an ample level of reserves over time.14\n\nAll of this means that, over the long run, the balance sheet is likely to expand to accommodate trend growth for Federal Reserve\u2019s liabilities, which, in turn, tends to be driven by trend growth in nominal GDP. That growth includes both reserves and autonomous factors such as currency or the Treasury General Account (TGA).15 Again, all of these future steps are consistent with the plans announced in May 2022.\n\nSo, what are the implications of slowing the pace of runoff?\n\nAside from adjusting the caps, the Desk\u2019s day-to-day management of the balance sheet will not change. We will continue to roll over at auction Treasury principal payments that exceed the new redemption cap.16 And, as I just mentioned, we will reinvest as directed any MBS paydowns in excess of the cap.  \n\nWhile implementation will not look much different, slowing runoff nonetheless represents an important and prudent step in the balance sheet reduction process. As I said, up to now, the ON RRP has absorbed the entirety of the portfolio runoff. But the ON RRP has also declined a lot; once it reaches zero or stabilizes at a low level, reserves will start declining roughly one-for-one with portfolio runoff, all else equal. The runoff pace so far has been very fast, averaging about $76 billion per month since September 2022\u2014much faster than the pace of runoff in 2017-19.\n\nGiven that the aggregate level of reserves that is consistent with ample is uncertain, it is sensible to approach that unknown level carefully. Slowing runoff provides more time and opportunity for the FOMC to evaluate changes in market conditions. It also provides more time for individual institutions to adjust to a lower supply of reserves and for aggregate liquidity to be redistributed within the banking system.\n\nUltimately, I expect that this approach will allow money markets to continue to function smoothly with a lower level of reserve supply than would have been the case had runoff been allowed to proceed at its current pace for much longer. Yes, continuing runoff at its existing pace might have meant reaching ample reserves sooner, but at the price of a higher risk of rapid changes in market conditions.\n\nWhere Is the Balance Sheet Headed?\n\nWith SOMA runoff set to slow, an obvious question is where the balance sheet may go from here. As you know, we regularly ask about expectations for the Fed\u2019s balance sheet in our Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants. Over time, survey responses suggest expectations around the end size of the SOMA portfolio have consolidated somewhat (Panel 3). Among other factors, this probably reflects updated views around demand for Federal Reserve liabilities as well as evolving risks to the economic outlook.\n\nThat said, significant uncertainties remain (as seen in Panel 4). Recent evidence to this effect comes, for example, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Senior Financial Officer Survey, which suggests that reserve demand can vary significantly across banks, across market conditions, and over time. The survey also shows that reserve demand reflects a range of factors that are hard to track precisely, both individually and in interaction with each other.17\n\nThus, as runoff continues, it is important to monitor a variety of information sources for any signals of a shift in the balance of supply and demand for reserves. In remarks last October, I briefly mentioned some of the data sources and indicators at our disposal to monitor money markets.18 Today, I would like to spend a little more time elaborating on specific metrics that I think can provide a useful advance signal of the transition from abundant to ample reserves.\n\nIndicators of Reserve Conditions\n\nSince the Global Financial Crisis, interest rate control has been achieved through a \u201cfloor system\u201d that relies on an ample supply of reserves.19 In January 2019, the FOMC communicated its intent to maintain this approach.20 I have used the term \u201cample reserves\u201d a few times already, but what does it mean? Ample reserve supply can be described as an environment in which the federal funds market is not particularly sensitive to significant short-term variations in the supply and demand of reserves but may exhibit some modest response to them.21\n\nThis can be visualized as an inverted \u2018S-shaped\u2019 demand curve along the lines of that described by Bill Poole all the way back in 1968 (Panel 5).22 Since the first half of 2020 we have been in the \u201cflat\u201d part of the demand curve\u2014a region in which the position of EFFR within the target range essentially does not respond to changes in aggregate reserve balances. But eventually, as the supply of reserves declines, EFFR will start experiencing some upward pressure as the system transitions from the flat to the gently upward sloping portion of the demand curve. At that point, we should see modest price response to changes in reserves.\n\nWhen exactly will that happen? Unfortunately, we cannot see the whole demand curve, only estimate our present location along it. Moreover, as my colleagues point out in a recent paper, that demand curve can also shift over time.23 To assess reserve conditions, it is important to have the best read we can on the current state of affairs and look for indicators that contain information on the likely shape and position of the demand curve for reserves.\n\nOne obvious indicator to consider is the spread between EFFR and the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB), which at present stands at negative 7 basis points. Because the EFFR has not moved at all, that indicator is completely stable and is one clear sign that reserves are still abundant. If or when it starts becoming less negative in the future, it could provide an important clue that reserves may be becoming progressively less abundant.\n\nEven an increasing spread between EFFR and IORB, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us where along the demand curve for reserves the financial system is operating. For this reason, there is value in monitoring the elasticity of the federal funds rate to short-term shocks to reserve supply, which is often referred to as the \u201clocal slope\u201d of the demand curve. In the research paper I just mentioned, my colleagues present econometric techniques that can measure and track this elasticity.\n\nThat exercise indicates that, currently, the elasticity is close to and statistically indistinguishable from zero\u2014in other words, it tells us that we are still very likely to be in the flat segment of the demand curve, which corresponds to an abundant reserves regime (Panel 6). What we don\u2019t know for sure is exactly how abundant reserves are. Put differently, we don\u2019t know how far we are from where the demand curve starts showing a gentle local slope\u2014or from the region of ample reserves. Importantly, we also don\u2019t know how quickly that slope increases after the inflection point, which means that we don\u2019t know exactly how gradual the transition from abundant to ample reserves might be. All of this uncertainty is good reason to slow the pace of portfolio runoff now that the buffer provided by the ON RRP is a lot smaller than it used to be.\n\nOther indicators that probe reserve demand from different perspectives can help shed more light on current reserve demand. These alternative indicators can potentially provide\u2014and arguably did provide in the past\u2014an early signal that we may be in the process of transitioning to a different segment of the demand curve. Having early signals is especially desirable in helping the FOMC identify the point at which to stop runoff, which the Committee has indicated will be when reserves are still somewhat above the ample level. Several measures I like for this purpose are the domestic bank activity in federal funds, the timing of interbank payments, the amount of daylight overdrafts, and the share of repo volume trading at or above the IORB. I\u2019ll briefly discuss each of them and explain why they can provide an advance signal of reserve conditions.\n\nFirst is the total amount of federal funds borrowing done by domestic banks (Panel 7). Domestic banks tend to borrow federal funds mostly when they need liquidity, whereas foreign banks do so also to monetize the spread between federal funds and IORB.24 Therefore, when reserves are abundant, we would expect domestic bank borrowing to be low. But when reserves are transitioning to ample, domestic borrowing should move up as domestic banks increasingly use federal funds to meet funding needs. Today, domestic borrowing remains well below levels seen in 2018 and 2019.\n\nSecond, we can track the share of outgoing interbank payments sent late in the day (Panel 8).25 When reserves are abundant, banks have less need to be tactical about the timing of their payment activity. But as supply transitions from abundant to ample, some institutions will find themselves increasingly incentivized to delay outgoing payments to retain higher reserve balances for a larger fraction of the day. In aggregate, this shows up in the data as a higher fraction of late-day payments. As you can see, this was increasingly common in the run-up to the repo market dislocation in September 2019, but is still relatively uncommon today.\n\nThird, daylight (or intraday) overdrafts also tell us something about whether banks have sufficient reserves to process their daily payment activity (Panel 9).26, 27 Daylight overdrafts occur when an institution\u2019s balance in its Federal Reserve account is in a negative position during the business day. They primarily occur due to timing mismatches between outgoing and incoming payments. That can result in short-term negative balances that are quickly cured. In that sense, they are related to the value of tactically timing payments, and thus the availability of reserves.  As reserves become less abundant, more institutions should find themselves dealing with these short-term mismatches. As you can see in the chart, average daylight overdrafts became more common as our balance sheet shrank between 2017 and 2019, but they have been a rarer occurrence since 2020. That is also consistent with abundant reserve supply.\n\nAnd the last indicator I want to highlight is the share of Treasury repo trades conducted at or above the IORB rate (Panel 10). The repo market is the primary source of short-term funding for dealers and other financial intermediaries. That tends to make it more reactive to declining levels of liquidity, and therefore a potentially useful early indicator. When repo counterparties trade at rates above the IORB rate, they are willing to pay a premium to attract cash from banks that would otherwise earn IORB on their balances. That could be indicative of a more urgent demand for liquidity. As with the other indicators, this metric today also tells a fairly sanguine story.\n\nPanel 11 puts all these different indicators together with the elasticity measure I discussed earlier, all standardized so that we can compare them to one another.28 Values near the top of the chart indicate abundant reserves; values that move toward the bottom of the chart are signs that reserves may be becoming less abundant. Clearly, the indicators tend to move together.\n\nDuring 2018 and 2019, when the supply of reserves was declining, all five of the indicators moved to the lower portion of the chart, signaling that reserves were progressively becoming less abundant, then ample, and then eventually even less than ample. All indicators returned to the upper portion of the chart as reserve management purchases and other Federal Reserve interventions in the fall of 2019 restored market equilibrium\u2014and, of course, pandemic-related purchases of securities later expanded the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet and reserves significantly.\n\nFrom today\u2019s perspective, the important thing is that all indicators are currently toward the upper end of the plot, consistent with reserves being abundant. I expect that, as reserves become progressively tighter, some of them will start moving toward the lower portion of the chart sooner than others. The speed and extent of those transitions will be some of the factors that will inform our understanding of reserve demand conditions.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhere does that leave us? As I noted at the outset, the past two years of balance sheet runoff have proceeded smoothly. That is, of course, good news for central bankers. But we cannot take this performance for granted. We therefore continue to manage risks and carefully monitor money market conditions.\n\nSlowing the pace of runoff is one effective way to manage those risks. Doing so allows money markets and the banking system to adapt to progressively lower levels of reserves. It also provides more time for us to collect data and assess the level and evolution of reserve demand. That careful and gradual approach is consistent with the plans laid out by the FOMC prior to the start of our balance sheet reduction program. In that sense, the Committee\u2019s recent announcement is simply the execution of that existing plan.\n\nWe are also continuing to monitor money markets for any sign of strains. Econometric analysis can tell us how responsive money market rates are to changes in reserves. That gives us a reasonably clear sense of whether reserve supply is currently abundant or ample. Other measures can be deployed to get a complementary or more forward-looking view. As I just mentioned, those include, but are certainly not limited to, domestic bank activity in federal funds, the timing of interbank payments, the aggregate amount of daylight overdrafts, and granular data on repo market activity. And I would be remiss if I did not highlight the incredibly valuable money market intelligence we get from market participants, including primary dealers.\n\nWe also have new tools at our disposal to deal with any unexpected turbulence. The SRF supplies additional cash to repo markets at an administered rate, which the FOMC has set at the top of the target range, against Treasury and agency collateral. The SRF is available every day; it can provide a strong defense against the kind of disruption we saw in 2019, and we would expect our counterparties to use it if market rates make it economically convenient to do so. And the same goes for the discount window, which of course is not a new tool but is also available every day, and through which the Federal Reserve can lend to depository institutions against a wider range of collateral.\n\nTaken together, the indicators and tools at our disposal constitute a powerful set of instruments, and they support my confidence that the balance sheet reduction process can continue smoothly.\n\nThank you for your kind attention, I look forward to the rest of the meeting.\n\nPresentation"

    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon. It's wonderful to be back at Stanford\u2014especially with John Taylor chairing this panel. John was my advisor during my studies here, and he hired me as his research assistant in the early '90s. It was an extraordinary privilege to have those two most wanted positions.\n\nBased on some of my past speeches, you may expect me to give a few pop culture references from the '90s that capture my time at Stanford before I move on to the substance of my remarks. But the truth is, I was so focused on my studies that there wasn't time to rollerblade, listen to R.E.M., or go to the arcade just for fun. Instead, like many in this room, I chose to forsake fun for the study of economics. As a result, I am simply useless when it comes to '90s trivia.\n\nWhat brought me to Stanford back then was a sense of purpose. Growing up in the '70s and '80s, I witnessed the toll that economic turmoil, high inflation, and slow growth took on families. By the time I arrived at Stanford in the fall of 1989, the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker had tamed the very high inflation of the late '60s and '70s. But, the work was far from done. Inflation was around 4 percent\u2014a level, I should note, that is well above today's 2.7 percent. And it was not yet clear how the lessons of the past would shape the policies of the future to ensure economic prosperity and stability.\n\nBut change was afoot, and it was an exciting time to be thinking about economic policy. With the advent of inflation targeting, the practice of monetary policy was on the cusp of a revolution. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand led the way in December 1989, and the Bank of Canada and Bank of England soon followed suit. I recall seeing the excitement around this change when I was a student, as I listened to policymakers from New Zealand and Canada describe their new frameworks.\n\nAt the same time, economists were reassessing what good policy looks like and how it could make a difference. In particular, John Taylor and others were reexamining the theory and evidence behind the ways policymakers could consistently deliver low and stable inflation in the post-Bretton Woods era. My introduction to this topic was running multicountry model simulations for John's book, Macroeconomic Policy in a World Economy, which built on years of research by many experts. The book provided a rigorous analysis of alternative monetary policy regimes in an open-economy context. This line of research culminated in John's seminal paper, \u201cDiscretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,\u201d which brilliantly synthesized theory and experience to yield clear prescriptions for good policy.1\n\nWhat I learned then and have carried with me these past 35 years is the importance of connecting theory and experience. The theories that shape good policy are derived from the experiences of the past, and therefore create lessons for the future. This prepared me well for my career, and it's what I'm going to talk about today.\n\nBefore I go further, I need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAct I: The Past\n\nBetween the time I left Stanford and the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the theory and practice of monetary policy changed dramatically.2 Policymakers sought to avoid the mistakes of the past and worked hard to create new frameworks for the future. And economists developed and refined theories to guide policy. The result was a prolonged period of price stability that spanned a quarter of a century.\n\nWe learned three key lessons from theory and experience. The first is that central banks must own the responsibility for price stability and have the ability to act as needed to achieve it. Policymakers have the tools to attain and maintain low and stable inflation. However, too often in the past\u2014most notably in the '70s\u2014central banks behaved as if they were powerless to control inflation. Although accountability for price stability is critically important, history also teaches us that central banks that have independence in their actions are more successful at delivering price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations.3,4 In short, our job is to be the protector of price stability.\n\nThe second lesson is the importance of transparency and, in particular, the clear communication of a goal for price stability in the form of an explicit numerical inflation target. Agreeing on a longer-run target reinforces public accountability for price stability and focuses the internal policy debate on how to best achieve that goal. Central banks that adopted inflation targeting led the way on this. And the FOMC announced its 2 percent longer-run inflation goal in January 2012 as part of its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. 5\n\nThat leads to the third lesson: the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations. By communicating an explicit inflation target\u2014and then delivering inflation consistent with that target\u2014central banks earn credibility with the public. That helps anchor expectations, which, in turn, contributes to low and stable inflation.6,7 This feedback loop between policy actions and communications, expectations, and price stability is now a core tenet of modern central banking, but it wasn't something that was fully appreciated or accepted 30 years ago.\n\nIt's important to note that anchoring inflation expectations at the target level is symmetric. Very low inflation\u2014or, worse, deflation\u2014can be as problematic as high inflation, presenting challenges for policymakers and harming the economy.8\n\nact ii: The Present\n\nAs a result of the linkages between theory and experience, our three lessons became three principles. And they helped us achieve a quarter century of low and stable inflation and well-anchored expectations.\n\nThen came the pandemic, which dealt the most dramatic shocks to the economy in generations. Severe imbalances between supply and demand, exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine, caused inflation to skyrocket in most countries across the globe. In 2022, inflation peaked at 7 percent in the United States, rose to 8 percent in Canada, and exceeded 10 percent in the euro area.\n\nHow did we, along with other central banks, address these spikes in inflation? In the United States, we stuck to our three key principles. First, the FOMC owned the responsibility for reining in inflation.9 Achieving price stability and maximum employment are part of the FOMC's dual mandate, and we took strong, decisive actions to bring inflation down.\n\nSecond, we have been unequivocal and transparent in our commitment to achieving our 2 percent target on a sustained basis. This message has been emphasized over and over in the FOMC's post-meeting statements and policymaker communications.\n\nThird, we have paid close attention to inflation expectations, and our actions and credibility built up over the preceding quarter century helped keep inflation expectations anchored.10 Although medium- and especially short-term inflation expectations rose notably starting in 2021, they retraced those gains over 2022 and 2023.11 Indeed, three-year-ahead expectations returned to pre-pandemic levels by late 2022, and short-term expectations did so late last year.\n\nAct III: The Future\n\nWhat do the lessons of the past mean for the future of monetary policy? I believe they prove, once again, the importance of theory and experience.\n\nYears of experience\u2014and years of careful analysis\u2014have taught us that, first and foremost, central banks must own the responsibility for maintaining low and stable inflation and have the independence of action to achieve that goal. Price stability is absolutely essential for economic prosperity, and it's crucial for achieving and sustaining maximum employment over the longer run.\n\nTheory and experience have also shown the importance of transparency and clear communication, including setting an explicit, numerical longer-run inflation target, and of taking appropriate actions to support the achievement of that goal. These are critical in anchoring inflation expectations\u2014which, in turn, help keep inflation at its target level.\n\nThe future is uncertain. But as we continue to move closer to our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal, I'm confident that we have the foundation of theory and experience to guide us in restoring price stability and set the stage for sustained economic prosperity. We are committed to getting the job done."

    "content": "Thank you, Diego, for inviting me to speak at the BIS Central Bank Legal Experts\u2019 Meeting\u2014and thanks to you and your colleagues for putting together such a useful conference. The remarks so far have prompted productive discussions about the role of in-house lawyers. I hope to follow suit.\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI am looking forward to today\u2019s discussion of legal risk and the Legal function\u2019s role in the risk management framework. There are different views on what legal risk is and how the Legal function fits into the \"three lines of defense\u201d framework, if at all. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much dispute, however, that it\u2019s an important topic for a central bank.\n\nWhen I was thinking about what I wanted to say today, like any good speech writer, I started with the title. Now Chiara set the bar very high by quoting Shakespeare in her title. I couldn\u2019t quite pull off a Shakespeare quote, but I did learn that \u201cjack-of-all-trades\u201d was probably said about Shakespeare, so I started with that. In-house lawyers are called upon to be \u201cjacks\u201d of many trades given the breadth of the roles we play in connection with legal and non-legal issues. We act as shadow project managers, we draft or assist with various non-legal documents and memos, and we help organizations manage all types of risks, including legal risk. But managing legal risk is the raison d'\u00eatre for the Legal function.\n\nToday I would like to start by considering some basic concepts and then offer some hypotheticals to illustrate the different ways in which legal risk manifests itself in an organization. I\u2019ll also discuss where legal risk decisions reside in an organization, and where lawyers fit into a \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model.\n\nWhat Is Legal Risk?\n\nSo let\u2019s start with a definition of legal risk. A definition we have used at the New York Fed is:\n\nI\u2019m sure you all could point out flaws in this definition. Maybe, in some respects, it\u2019s overinclusive\u2014encroaching on other risk types like \u201ccompliance risk,\u201d \u201coperational risk,\u201d or \u201creputational risk.\u201d Or maybe it\u2019s underinclusive, focusing unduly on disputes and litigation and not enough on ethical or moral duties.\n\nWhile I think it is good to have a definition to help frame our discussion, I don\u2019t want to belabor it. The reason to try to define legal risk is that we can now discuss how to best manage and mitigate those risks, which is what lawyers do.\n\nHowever, before we get to legal risk management, we should talk for a moment about a phrase I really dislike: \u201clegal risk appetite.\u201d There are some commercial contexts in which risk is a feature, not a bug\u2014where, for example, risk acceptance provides a higher potential for profit and its negative consequences can be managed. That seems to make intuitive sense with risks like credit risk that (i) can be observed, quantitively modeled and measured, and (ii) are deliberately undertaken in connection with operating a business.\n\nHowever, speaking of \u201clegal risk appetite\u201d or \u201clegal risk tolerance\u201d makes me uneasy. If a bank CEO tells you that after careful analysis, she had decided her bank should take on more duration risk, you probably wouldn\u2019t blink. If, by contrast, she says that, after careful consideration, the bank needed to increase the amount of legal risk it is taking, you would at least do a double take.\n\nDoes anyone really have an appetite for legal risk? It\u2019s not something I crave, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ve never once woken up and thought to myself, \u201cHmmm, I\u2019m a bit peckish this morning and some legal risk would really hit the spot.\u201d\n\nI think we can agree that in practically all circumstances, financial institutions should have virtually no appetite to knowingly violate applicable law.2,3 Financial institutions are not like delivery trucks that willingly accumulate parking tickets around major cities. Violations and fines cannot be seen as a cost of doing business.\n\nBut having said all that, I also think we can agree that an institution\u2019s legal risk tolerance should not be zero. The mere possibility that someone might sue our employer doesn\u2019t mean that a particular course of action should be prohibited or isn\u2019t in our employer\u2019s best interest.\n\nThe OCC has a publicly available Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement that asserts: \u201cRisk appetite [which can be low, moderate or high] articulates the level and type of risk the agency will accept while conducting its mission and carrying out its strategic plan.\u201d4 The section on Legal Risk appetite identifies several topics for which the OCC has low risk appetite (e.g., Noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations, federal directives, mandates, and executive orders) and things for which the OCC has a moderate risk appetite (e.g., Taking a leadership role pursuing and/or defending issues supportive of the OCC\u2019s core mission).5\n\nWhile I\u2019m still working through how I feel about publishing a legal risk appetite statement, I do think the OCC\u2019s formulation is conceptually correct. The OCC\u2019s tolerance for legal risk depends on the kind of legal risk and the context in which it is presented.\n\nTypically, when we talk about managing legal risk and making decisions based on established legal risk appetite frameworks, we are focused on legal risks that have been identified and intentionally accepted by the institution. But not all legal risk manifests in the same way, and legal risk mitigants will vary depending on how the risk arose.\n\nHypotheticals\n\nTo highlight the different ways in which legal risk can manifest, be identified, and be mitigated or managed, I\u2019ve come up with some simple hypotheticals. My examples focus on situations from the private sector, but I think you will see the themes also apply to the public sector.\n\nFirst Scenario\n\nYou are the lawyer for a lending business. The head of the group approaches you to say they have an awesome new credit product they are about to launch. They have been working on it for months and they are absolutely certain it will be vastly profitable. You study it and conclude, with even greater certainty, that your business does not currently have the requisite licensing to offer this product. You believe it would clearly be illegal for your firm to offer and sell this product.\n\nLaunching this product would certainly entail a high degree of legal risk. Assuming the institution does not have an appetite to knowingly violate applicable law, the Legal function will stop the product from being launched and therefore will successfully protect the institution from legal risk.\n\nSo what allowed for this success? I think there were two critical factors: (i) the business discussed the proposed product with their lawyers prior to launch, and (ii) the Legal function competently analyzed the product and spotted the issue. We\u2019ll discuss each of these factors in more depth later.\n\nSecond Scenario\n\nBut life is rarely so black-and-white. Let\u2019s adjust the facts such that when you analyze the product features and the licensing requirements, the regulatory treatment is actually not clear. Turns out there are some good arguments that offering the product does not require a license. However, there are also some countervailing arguments. The regulator might view the product differently and disagree with you. You present this mixed assessment to the business, perhaps with some structuring suggestions that can mitigate the legal risk. But even with these changes, the legal analysis is not clear.\n\nThis is likely the paradigmatic scenario people have in mind when they think about legal risk. Here, the Legal function is identifying a legal risk arising from ambiguity in the law, explaining it to the business, and the business is deciding whether to take it or not. The Legal function identifies the risks, potentially makes structuring suggestions to reduce the ambiguity, but cannot eliminate the legal risk. Based on that advice, the business makes a risk decision.\n\nNonetheless, for the outcome here to be a \u201csuccess\u201d from a legal risk management perspective, it is very important that the legal risk decision is made at the appropriate level and in the appropriate way for the organization. The Legal function typically has a critical role in ensuring that happens.\n\nAt some firms, all risk decisions go to senior management. At others, decisions can be made by more junior people further down in the organization. Sometimes other control functions or processes must be brought in. The appropriate path for approval likely varies with the probability and severity of the legal risk that the action would create. The Legal function is primarily, and potentially solely, responsible for assessing that degree of risk and ensuring the right people are consulted and the right processes undertaken.\n\nThis hypothetical shows the lawyer as a jack-of-all-trades. She is responsible for assessing legal risk as an independent function, but is also asked to partner with the business to come up with ways to reduce legal risk by modifying how a product is structured or sold. She also has a critical corporate governance role in ensuring legal risk acceptance is done in the appropriate way for that organization.\n\nI think some would argue that this example highlights the value of documenting legal risk appetites and specifying the role each function plays in accepting and managing those risks\u2014which is exactly what the three lines of defense model was originally designed to do. Forethought about different kinds of legal risks encourages the organization to establish processes and lines of responsibility, so that escalation choices and decision-making responsibilities are clear ahead of time.\n\nHowever, writing down a set of guidelines is only the first, and likely not the most important step. Application of those guidelines to any particular situation will require judgment. In order to determine the escalation path, the Legal function will need to assess the degree of legal risk. Legal risk assessment is subjective and circumstance specific.\n\nAnd even for a given degree of legal risk, many factors can impact how legal risk acceptance should be undertaken in any particular case. Have there been changes in the external environment since the guidelines were created that increase or decrease the impact of a risk decision? Did our process rely on the judgment of a group head, and now we have a new group head who has a different set of experiences and a different risk tolerance? Have we made a series of appropriate risk decisions that in isolation are fine, but in aggregate seem to have created too much residual legal risk? Documented risk acceptance processes are necessary, but certainly not sufficient to effectively mitigate legal risk.\n\nNote that in this scenario the organization is aware of the legal risk. If they move ahead with the lending product, they have knowingly accepted the legal risk. Things may turn out badly from a legal perspective, but that risk was known and accepted. Now let\u2019s consider other flavors of legal risk where the choices are not as deliberate.\n\nThird Scenario\n\nLet\u2019s return to the original hypothetical. This time when you analyze the product, you have an epiphany. You see that by making one small tweak, you can eliminate the need for your organization to obtain any additional licensing. The business is thrilled, and the product launch is a huge success. Yeah Legal!\n\nBut \u2026 it turns out your legal advice was wrong! You missed something. The product was illegally offered and your institution is hit with a major fine.\n\nThis hypothetical illustrates another and different kind of legal risk, and one that in any particular case, the institution will not know it has incurred. There wasn\u2019t a conscious recognition of legal risk, and therefore no opportunity to conduct a legal risk escalation or undertake an approval process.\n\nDoes that mean this flavor of legal risk cannot be managed or mitigated? No. The risk of an error in legal analysis cannot be totally eliminated, but it certainly can be mitigated by providing appropriate resources for obtaining legal advice. How much has the institution invested in the Legal function? Is it properly staffed? Does it have the expertise it needs? Are the lawyers paid market rates? How big is the outside counsel budget? Are there silos within the Legal function that discourage collaboration across areas of expertise? Organizations make conscious and unconscious decisions about their appetite for this type of legal risk in how they invest in and manage the Legal function.\n\nFourth Scenario\n\nOne final variant on our hypothetical. Your business has developed its great new product, but now instead of bringing you in before launching the product, the business decided to just start selling it. You only find out later when your firm releases financials indicating how profitable the product is and your firm\u2019s stock price has gone up 300%.\n\nWhile the behavior of the business here may have violated some operational policies, and therefore triggered operational or other risks, I think this scenario also falls under the legal risk definition. Like risk arising from a lawyer\u2019s error, this is also a form of legal risk that the business will not know it has incurred at the time an action is taken. Again, there was no conscious recognition of legal risk, and therefore no legal risk assessment conducted or risk acceptance process undertaken.\n\nBut this flavor of legal risk can also be mitigated, and a firm\u2019s culture will give insights into its conscious or unconscious appetite for it. Does the firm have formal or informal policies requiring that certain activities be run past the Legal function? Are there new product/new activity review committees populated with control functions like Legal? Does senior management include the General Counsel or key Legal deputies in strategy or similar meetings? Are lawyers provided with a \u201cseat at the table\u201d?\n\nWhile significant responsibility should lie with the business, I think it is important to keep in mind that the Legal function may not just be an innocent victim here. What type of relationship did the in-house lawyers cultivate with the business line? Did they contribute to a culture in which lawyers are trusted partners? How responsive is the Legal department? Do they check in with the business regularly? Do they understand the business, what it does and how it does it, and speak the business\u2019s language? Do the lawyers have a problem-solving mentality, or do they start at \u201cno\u201d and reluctantly cede ground from there?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to blame the business when the Legal function isn\u2019t consulted at all. Let\u2019s be mindful, though, that the experience the business has when they go to the Legal function can affect that behavior. I\u2019m not saying the lawyers should allow impermissible activity to curry favor. But if the Legal Function is viewed as a partner, and not an impediment, that partnership can be a powerful mitigant against legal risk.\n\nThree Lines of Defense\n\nWhile there are certainly more flavors of legal risk we could discuss, I\u2019d like to address how legal risk fits into the \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d risk management framework.\n\nIn the traditional \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d framework, the first line of defense \u201cowns the risk.\u201d They are responsible for the risks that arise in their business. If they decide to lend to a less creditworthy borrower, they should understand and be accountable for the credit risk that comes with that decision. If they knowingly accept some degree of legal ambiguity in connection with a product, they take on the risk and cost of a lawsuit, adverse court ruling, or regulatory inquiry.\n\nIndependent control functions comprise the second line. They monitor the risks the first line has taken and oversee the controls the organization has implemented to mitigate risks. The second line does not \u201cown\u201d the risk, but they are accountable for their surveillance and mitigation work. At a commercial bank, the standard framework puts the Legal function in the second line, along with functions such as Compliance and Credit.\n\nThe third line of defense provides independent oversight of the first two lines. They provide greater assurance that the risk management and internal control frameworks are working as expected. This role is typically handled by the Internal Audit function, which has a direct reporting line to the top of an organization\u2019s governance structure.\n\nWhile the \u201ctraditional\u201d three-lines-of-defense model has the benefit of simplicity, some have argued that it should not be one-size-fits-all.6 One particular area of discussion is the role of the Legal function. Should it really be part of the second line?\n\nMy view is that a Legal function does not fit neatly into the three-lines-of-defense framework. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s something necessarily wrong with the framework\u2014it can be quite useful. In my view, though, it\u2019s more effective at managing some types of risks than others. The Legal function is a critical part of an organization\u2019s risk management, but I think a more realistic view is that the Legal function operates across, and maybe sometime outside of, the three-lines model.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to our second hypothetical\u2014the one where lawyers identify and describe legal risks accurately to the first line, and the first line knowingly decides to take those risks. That fits quite well into the three-lines framework. The Legal function is identifying risks, but is not making a decision about whether the institution should accept them. The Legal function serves as a control function\u2014ensuring the business is appropriately informed and the correct decision-making processes have been followed. But lawyers are not making the business decision. The lawyer in that hypothetical simply determined that a legal risk existed and kicked off a business risk acceptance process.\n\nLegal risk is different from other risks in that the first line has to consult with the Legal function about the existence of the risk. That\u2019s where the three-lines model begins to come up short. Interest rate risk, for example, can and should be monitored, measured, and managed by the first line. Second-line functions like Risk should also be monitoring and discussing interest rate risk with the first line. But the first line isn\u2019t (or at least shouldn\u2019t be) relying on the Risk function to spot the interest rate risk.\n\nNot so for legal risk. Business managers rely on the Legal function to identify and explain legal risk. In that sense, the Legal function is the first line for legal risk analysis. In the hypothetical where the Legal function did not spot the legal risk\u2014or explained it poorly\u2014it would be inappropriate to hold the business responsible, or at least fully responsible. The Legal function has to \u201cown\u201d its responsibility to identify and explain legal risk.\n\nA Legal function may further \u201cown the risk\u201d by choosing which risks merit attention by the business, and which do not. Through a decision not to raise an issue with the business, a lawyer owns a risk. Lawyers are constantly making judgments about the severity of a legal risk to inform the risk acceptance process. This is one of many ways in which real-life lawyering is not like a law school exam\u2014at least, as law is taught in the United States. You don\u2019t necessarily get more points for spotting more issues. Practicing law isn\u2019t so mechanistic. Good in-house lawyers are not cogs in a machine\u2014getting back to the title of this talk\u2014whose role is limited to issue-spotting. A business client probably doesn\u2019t want to hear about every conceivable thing that could go wrong. They want me to make a judgment about what\u2019s worth being concerned about. Working with a client means focusing their attention on the right issues, not clouding the picture with obscure concerns about remote possibilities with minimal potential impact. So in that sense, too, a Legal function acts as a first line of defense.\n\nAnd, in reality, an effective Legal department works collaboratively with a business line and frequently offers advice that isn\u2019t purely legal. As the NY Rules of Professional Conduct state, \u201clawyers shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice\u201d, and in the process \u201crefer not only to law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social, psychological, and political factors [that may be relevant to the client\u2019s situation].\u201d7 At institutions like the New York Fed, which has a long-tenured Legal department, lawyers offer valuable institutional memory. I think the same is true at many financial institutions. At organizations with high turnover, it may be the case that the lawyer is a source of valuable business experience, not just legal expertise. So there again, a Legal function\u2019s actual role is close to the first line.\n\nBut Legal functions are obviously not fully first-line either. As mentioned before, a Legal function has a control responsibility. What\u2019s more, like the second and third lines, the Legal function has the responsibility to provide independent judgment.8 Where the Legal function believes the business is too aggressive\u2014or has otherwise diverged from the organization\u2019s expectations\u2014there is a responsibility to escalate within the business hierarchy or outside it. This is particularly important when legal risks may be latent, maturing years later after investigations and lawsuits, when the managers making business decisions may not be around to be held accountable for taking legal risks. The Legal function has a unique corporate governance role and ability to influence an organization.9\n\nWhat\u2019s more, independence doesn\u2019t just mean independence from the business. It means independence wherever needed to protect the client\u2019s interest. The \u201cpartner-guardian\u201d model or dilemma\u2014famously expounded by Ben Heineman, the former General Counsel of GE\u2014applies to all three lines of defense.10 Lawyers are valuable partners to Compliance, Risk, Credit, and other second-line control functions, as well as to Internal Audit. We\u2019re also guardians of the corporate client\u2019s interest if any of those functions become conflicted.\n\nOne last point about the special role of a Legal function: You can\u2019t provide legal advice without a license. And, in any financial institution that I\u2019m aware of, there isn\u2019t another function or group licensed to make legal judgments. That means our legal judgments are not subject to review by other functions because such a review would necessarily entail providing legal advice.\n\nOf course, a Legal function is not free from oversight. For starters, second- and third-line functions can and should review organizational processes, budgeting decisions, and many other choices within a Legal function that are corporate in nature. Just not legal advice. When it comes to legal advice, a Legal function needs to take responsibility for its own oversight and rely on its lawyers to exercise good judgment. It\u2019s one thing for internal auditors to question credit decisions. It\u2019s inappropriate\u2014and potentially illegal\u2014for them to offer their legal judgment in place of the Legal function\u2019s.\n\nMore important, the client always gets to decide if the legal advice it receives is satisfactory. And that starts with the service the General Counsel provides to senior management and, where relevant, to the board of directors. Lawyers are always fully accountable to the client, even if their legal judgment is not amenable to oversight within the three-lines-of-defense model.\n\nFinally, lawyers have professional obligations that can take priority over the interests of any particular client\u2014rules governing client confidentiality and conflicts of interest, for example. Lawyers raise their hands and take an oath to uphold the law. That doesn\u2019t mean that some lawyers don\u2019t go astray. But in my experience, lawyers take their professional responsibilities seriously.\n\nIt\u2019s for all those reasons that I don\u2019t think a Legal function really fits in a three-lines-of-defense framework, which wasn\u2019t created to control legal risk anyway. So what should we call the Legal function? We already ruled out \u201ccog in the machine.\u201d Is a Legal function a misfit toy? I ran that by my staff at the New York Fed, and they weren\u2019t thrilled with that label. A jack-of-all-trades may not capture my meaning either. Lawyers are masters of their trade: the practice of law. No single moniker seems apt, and we shouldn\u2019t try to force something when it doesn\u2019t fit. The same goes for the Legal function\u2019s role in the three-lines-of-defense model.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019ve spoken much about \u201corganizations\u201d in general. So, you might be wondering, how are legal risks and legal risk management different for a central bank? I\u2019ll end on this point\u2014and hopefully we can continue the discussion.\n\nIn my experience, Legal functions at private sector firms and central banks have a great deal in common\u2014employment issues, contractual negotiations, and many other issues arise in both contexts.\n\nBut there are also significant differences arising from our public mission and the need to maintain public trust. The question \u201cis it legal\u201d is never the end of the inquiry\u2014for lawyers or our colleagues in other departments. As an organization dedicated to making the economy stronger and the financial system more stable for everyone, doing what\u2019s right by the public is always paramount.\n\nThat\u2019s not always an easy objective to identify or to meet. Essential to maintaining public trust is maintaining objectivity and political independence. As politics becomes more heated, and the economy more interdependent and complex, this is an ever-increasing challenge. I\u2019m sure many of you feel the same way. Every material decision\u2014every act or omission\u2014will have its critics, some of whom are quick to see connections between their acute disappointment and broader grievances about government or society. Technical, legal decisions about approvals for mergers or approvals for accounts or novel activities can be perceived as political or partisan, eroding confidence in a central bank\u2019s objectivity and independence. As a result, a public institution like the Federal Reserve could face legal risk in the form of changes in laws that constrain judgment or require operational pivots.\n\nI also think the stakes we face at central banks are quite different than the private sector, particularly in the context of a crisis. I think there are occasions where a central bank\u2019s mission requires it to accept more legal risk than one might choose in the ordinary course, especially for decisions where all the facts are not immediately clear, governing law is ambiguous, precedents are few, stakes are high, and time is of the essence.\n\nWhether in a crisis or not, good judgment is the foundation upon which all legal risk management lies. There will never be a system of regulation or controls so complete that every risk is identified in advance and successfully mitigated. Good risk management will always require good judgment.\n\nFor lawyers, judgment comes not only through personal experience, but thanks in part to traditions of mentorship within Legal groups, also through vicarious experience. Attorneys need to offer, and accept, critical professional feedback from other attorneys in the department. Individuals should be open to sharing their analysis and welcome critical questions.\n\nLegal analysis gets sharper through challenge, and it is very important to ensure different areas of the Legal function are not operating in silos. When different parts of the function don\u2019t feel like they are competing with each other, and when individuals are willing to check their egos at the door, mistakes are much easier to catch.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s up to the leadership of the Legal function to model how to offer and accept critical, professional feedback, work across reporting lines, and ensure adequate resources.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and happy to take questions."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the New York Fed share a commitment to supporting economic strength in communities and households in our region. I look forward to speaking more about that in my discussion with President Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez in a few minutes.\n\nBefore we get to that conversation, I\u2019ll spend some time focusing on how the Federal Reserve is working to achieve our goals of maximum employment and price stability. I\u2019ll also discuss the significant progress we\u2019ve seen in restoring balance to the economy and bringing inflation back down to the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC\u2019s) 2 percent longer-run goal. Finally, I\u2019ll share more on the trajectory of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet as well as my view on where the economy is headed overall.\n\nNow I need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dual Mandate\n\nI\u2019ll turn to the numbers in a minute. But first, by a show of hands, how many of you witnessed the solar eclipse earlier this week? I\u2019ll leave the complex explanations of cosmic phenomena to Dr. Massimino, who I expect will give a fascinating presentation later today. But simply stated, an eclipse happens when several things are perfectly aligned. Or, in the immortal words of Pink Floyd, when \u201ceverything under the sun is in tune.\u201d\n\nLike Monday\u2019s eclipse, the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate has two goals that need to be in tune with one another: maximum employment and price stability. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all. The overarching objective of monetary policy now is to properly balance restoring price stability and maintaining maximum employment, and the FOMC remains strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time.\n\nStrong Employment, Lower Inflation\n\nThe good news is that over the past year we have made considerable progress toward this objective. Demand-supply imbalances have diminished. Global supply chains, which were severely disrupted during the pandemic and early in the recovery, have mostly returned to normal.1 And the economy grew far faster than anyone expected last year. Labor supply has been boosted by an increase in labor force participation among individuals aged 25-54 years, as well as by increased immigration flows.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market has remained strong. The unemployment rate has been under 4 percent for more than two years, which is the longest stretch at that rate in over 50 years\u2014even longer ago than the release of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cDark Side of the Moon.\u201d\n\nInflation has come down substantially, too. The 12-month percent change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index has continued to decline, falling from its 40-year high of above 7 percent in mid-2022 to 2-1/2 percent in the latest reading.\n\nAll in all, there has been tremendous progress toward better balance. But this episode is not yet over, and I am still very focused on ensuring we achieve both of our goals.\n\nA Better-Balanced Labor Market\n\nI\u2019m going to delve further into the trends underlying both sides of our dual mandate, starting with employment.\n\nWhen the U.S. economy recovered from the pandemic, the labor market turned red-hot. Demand for workers far exceeded supply, and that imbalance contributed to rapid wage growth and high inflation.\n\nNow, the labor market has shown signs of returning to something closer to normal. Nationally, many indicators\u2014such as quits rates and surveys of perceptions of availability of workers and jobs\u2014have returned to ranges seen before the pandemic. The current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent equals my estimate for the unemployment rate that is likely to prevail over the longer run, and job growth continues to be solid.\n\nThe story in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Second District\u2014an area with similar boundaries to that of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York\u2014is much like the national one. Our business contacts indicate that here, too, labor demand and supply are moving into better balance. In particular, we are hearing from businesses that it is becoming less difficult to find qualified workers.\n\nDespite the progress in restoring balance, two important indicators point to lingering tightness in the labor market: job openings and wage growth. Job vacancies, which reached record highs in 2022, have trended lower since then, but are still quite elevated relative to pre-pandemic norms. And while we have seen measures of wage growth come down from their pandemic-era peaks, they remain above pre-Covid rates.\n\nInflation Over Time\n\nOn the price stability front, we\u2019ve seen inflation decline significantly over the past year and a half. This drop has been broad-based, with all major categories of inflation\u2014food, energy, goods, and services\u2014all trending down. The decline in inflation has benefited from a reduction in demand and supply imbalances, both here in the U.S. and internationally. The resolution of global supply-chain bottlenecks has been a key factor as well. The recent event at the Baltimore port is tragic and may have some local economic impact, but the overall outlook for supply chain issues is still broadly on a good path.\n\nImportantly, inflation expectations in the New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations are now again within their pre-Covid ranges at all horizons, consistent with other measures of inflation expectations.2\n\nThe Housing Market\n\nOne key area of the economy warrants more exploration. This audience knows all too well the unique situation that\u2019s playing out in the housing market right now. While restrictive monetary policy is having its usual restraining effects on housing demand, it is occurring amid a period where structural demand for housing has been especially strong. Remote work and other factors drove demand for housing in the aftermath of the pandemic, which in turn has pushed up home prices to elevated levels relative to historical norms. Even so, we\u2019re not seeing the types of risks in housing finance that we saw during the housing boom before the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe strong structural housing demand also has had significant effects on rents, raising broad measures of rent inflation considerably in the aftermath of the pandemic. The restraining effects of restrictive monetary policy have begun to show in more moderate increases in these broad measures. Moreover, data on new rents suggest that rent inflation should moderate further in the coming months toward pre-pandemic norms.\n\nWhile the residential housing market overall has remained strong, commercial real estate presents greater uncertainty and concern. The underlying value of many office buildings has become less clear, and I anticipate a bumpy process as buildings and investments come to market. In my view, this is not an immediate risk, but the situation will take time to resolve.\n\nMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook\n\nSo, the economy is strong, imbalances are diminishing, and inflation has come down but remains above our 2 percent longer-run target. What does that mean for monetary policy?\n\nOver the past two years, the FOMC has put in place a restrictive stance of monetary policy with the aim of bringing inflation back to 2 percent on a sustained basis. Given the progress we have seen, the risks to achieving our maximum employment and price stability goals are moving into better balance.\n\nAt its March meeting, the FOMC kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In announcing that decision, the Committee said it \u201cdoes not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\u201d3 The economic projections we issued at that time indicate that if the economy proceeds as expected, it will make sense to dial back the policy restraint gradually over time, starting this year.4\n\nTaking into account the effects of restrictive monetary policy, I expect GDP growth to be about 2 percent this year, reflecting the continued resilience of the economy and further improvements on the supply side. I expect the unemployment rate to peak at 4 percent this year and move gradually down to its longer-run level of 3-3/4 percent thereafter. I expect inflation to continue its gradual return to 2 percent, although there will likely be bumps along the way, as we\u2019ve seen in some recent inflation readings. I expect overall PCE inflation to be 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent this year, before moving closer to 2 percent next year.\n\nAs has been the case since the onset of the pandemic, the outlook ahead is uncertain, and we will need to remain data-dependent.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Balance Sheet\n\nI\u2019ll now spend just a moment mentioning the Fed\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nIn May of 2022, the FOMC laid out its plan for reducing the size of the balance sheet.5 The execution of that plan is proceeding as we had envisioned, with securities holdings decreasing and take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase facility declining. Federal Reserve staff continue to monitor several indicators of abundance of reserves, and they all signal that the current level of reserves remains safely far above the level consistent with the FOMC\u2019s ample reserves regime.6 We\u2019ve so far reduced the size of our balance sheet by about $1.5 trillion. The next step in the execution of the plan will be to slow the pace of decline in our securities holdings.\n\nWhile the Committee made no decision at our recent meeting, most FOMC participants said it would be appropriate to slow the pace of runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously discussed.7 The decision to slow the pace is in no way indicating an imminent cessation of shrinking the balance sheet. Rather, by slowing the pace, we\u2019re better able to monitor conditions and facilitate a smooth transition to ample reserves.\n\nClosing\n\nI\u2019ll close by saying that price stability is the bedrock upon which our economic prosperity stands. The economy has come a long way toward achieving better balance and reaching our 2 percent inflation goal. But we have not seen the total alignment of our dual mandate quite yet. I am committed to achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long term.\n\nTherefore, I will remain focused on the data, the economic outlook, and the risks as we evaluate the appropriate path for monetary policy to best achieve our goals.\n\nThank you."

    "title": "Culture and Conduct in 2024: An Update from the New York Fed",
    "date": "Mar 12, 2024",
    "speaker": "James Hennessy",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/hen240312",
    "content": "Thank you, Harry, for your kind introduction, and for welcoming me back to the Culture and Conduct Deep Dive. And welcome to everyone who is participating from around the world.\n\nBefore I begin, I should note that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI lead the New York Fed's Governance & Culture Reform Initiative\u2014an effort we started 10 years ago this year, with the aim of focusing the attention of the financial services industry on organizational culture and its role in shaping risk outcomes. Looking back on the decade of our work, and the interactions we have had with both financial institutions and an interdisciplinary collection of experts who are focused on culture, I think it is accurate to say that, together, we have seen some real progress.\n\nFor instance, changes occurring in the broader environment \u2013 especially the rise of remote and hybrid work \u2013 have normalized and given urgency to the conversation around organizational culture.  Culture has evolved from a somewhat nebulous topic to one that is considered a central component of risk management and business success. Looking ahead, technological advances promise to enhance how culture data are collected and interpreted, thereby supporting better diagnosis and interventions, and more desirable outcomes. We are encouraged by these developments, and we also recognize that there are still numerous challenges ahead.\n\nToday I will talk about the three strategic channels or \u201cpillars\u201d through which the culture initiative achieves its mission, and some of the key insights we\u2019ve gained over the past year through engagement with representatives from the financial services industry and others.\n\nThe New York Fed\u2019s Culture Initiative\n\nThe first pillar, Awareness and Dialogue, supports the public conversation by convening industry professionals, regulators, academics, and experts in a wide range of fields to explore the relationship between organizational culture and behavior.  We produce webinars and podcasts, and on Tuesday May 21st, we will host our in-person culture conference. Some of the issues the conference will address include accountability and incentives, culture measurement, and \u201cfuture thinking.\u201d There, we will explore how firms can address the overconfidence, blind spots and hubris that can get in the way of imagining what could go wrong in the future, in periods when growth comes easily and when it\u2019s hard won.\n\nThe second pillar, Education and Research, includes our Education and Industry Forum\u2014the EIF. This committee brings together representatives from academia and industry to integrate ethical decision-making into the education of the next generation of the financial services workforce.\n\nAnd the third pillar of our initiative is focused on Supervision & Governance. This includes the Supervisors Roundtable for Governance Effectiveness, where we, along with supervisors and regulators from around the world, gather to advance collaboration and innovation in governance, behavior, and culture supervision.\n\nInsights from the Past Year\n\nOne lesson from all this work concerns the importance of culture measurement and assessment and the vital role it plays in driving change. Forums like this one provide important opportunities to learn about advances in assessment practices, for instance how technology can help to derive data from new sources, such as natural language processing and network analysis. Such tools provide real-time feedback and indications of trends\u2014more than occasional \u201csnapshots\u201d that can, without the right context, give misleading impressions. Qualitative evidence\u2014anecdotes and other feedback gathered through focus groups, interviews, and other more people- and time-intensive techniques\u2014continue to round out the picture created by the numbers. In my view, the stories we tell each other remain the best means of understanding and passing along an organization\u2019s culture.\n\nApart from assessment, my colleagues and I continue to observe that communication with employees is an essential tool in managing culture. Organizations that articulate expectations for risk culture in clear language help employees understand its benefits. I mentioned already the importance of stories. Tying those anecdotes to common goals, key processes, and risk indicators helps make organizational expectations more tangible and relatable on a personal level. Importantly, explaining the \u201cwhy\u201d of risk culture motivates employees to apply their own informed judgement rather than implement a rigid directive.\n\nCommunication in the other direction\u2014bottom-up, that is\u2014remains important too.  Here, trust and psychological safety are paramount.  Creating channels for speaking up are necessary, but not sufficient.  Employees need to feel comfortable telling others what\u2019s on their minds. One way to encourage speaking up is to normalize it. Make it \u201cwhat we do around here.\u201d For example, groups concerned with risk management can integrate conversations about risk into daily routines. Risks don\u2019t only need to be discussed when something has gone wrong\u2014and understandably, very human fear or blame can have a chilling effect on open, honest communication. Applying a common, everyday framework for discussing risks when things go right \u2013 and when they don\u2019t - bolsters an effective risk culture by making the discussion just \u201csomething we do.\u201d\n\nManagers also play a key role in this process. It is vital for those who daily work alongside staff and create the immediate culture to lead by example. Encourage these \u201cculture carriers\u201d within your organization to share stories and normalize speaking up about risk.\n\nFinally, another lesson emphasized within the last year is that non-financial incentives are powerful motivators for employees to go \u2018above and beyond\u2019 job requirements. These include gratitude and recognition by more senior leadership; the self-respect and self-governance that comes from having greater autonomy in business judgments; a feeling of empowerment that reflects an organization\u2019s trust and, in turn, further links an individual to a group; and having opportunities for innovation, learning, skill development and career growth. In particular, understanding how one\u2019s role adds value to the organization\u2019s purpose and impact is a powerful motivator.\n\nMy colleagues and I launched the New York Fed\u2019s Culture Initiative 10 years ago because we saw misconduct increasing across the industry.  When we examined these incidents closely, we concluded that industry norms were partly to blame.  We recognized that regulation and enforcement alone would not provide solutions.  Each and together, banks needed to pay attention to how culture influences choices and behavior.  Ten years later, we remain steadfast in supporting progress toward stronger, healthier cultures in the financial services industry.\n\nI am heartened that so many members of the industry see culture as an important component of its success. I encourage your efforts to make progress and build healthier cultures in finance on a global scale.\n\nThank you."

    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/gol240303",
    "content": "The below transcript has been republished from EconoFact Chats, a podcast hosted by Michael Klein of the The Fletcher School at Tufts University. Listen to the podcast episode.\n\nMichael Klein: I'm Michael Klein, Executive Editor of EconoFact, a non-partisan web-based publication of the Fletcher School at Tufts University. At EconoFact, we bring key facts and incisive analysis to the national debate on economic and social policies, publishing work from leading economists across the country. You can learn more about us and see our work at www.econofact.org.\n\nMichael Klein: The dollar dominates the world monetary system. Much of global trade in goods and services is denominated in dollars. The dollar is widely used for bilateral trade between countries other than the United States. And the use of the dollar is even more dominant for financial transactions. Debt contracts are often denominated in dollars. Dollars make up more than half of the world's foreign currency reserves held by central banks. What advantages accrue to the United States from the dominance of the dollar? Are there costs associated with this as well? Does the importance of the dollar require a special role for the Federal Reserve at times of crises? To discuss these matters, I'm very pleased to welcome Linda Goldberg to EconoFact Chats. Linda is a Financial Research Advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Previously, she served as Senior Vice President, the Head of global economic analysis, and the Head of the international research function at that bank. She's widely recognized as a leading expert on the topics of global banking, international capital flows, and the international roles of currencies. Linda, welcome to EconoFact Chats.\n\nLinda Goldberg: Thank you, Michael. I'm delighted to join you. I would want to start by emphasizing that the views that are expressed are mine and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMichael Klein: Linda, I alluded to some of the ways the dollar is the central world currency in the introduction. Can you elaborate on this a bit?\n\nLinda Goldberg: The dollar has been at the center of the international monetary system ever since the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944. It set up a system of fixed exchange rates in which countries pledged to keep their currencies stable against the U.S. dollar.\n\nMichael Klein: But the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates with the dollar at its center ended in 1973. So the situation since then is different, right?\n\nLinda Goldberg: Yes, this formal system ended, but the dollar still plays the central role in the international monetary system. The International Monetary Fund tracks this, and about 20% of countries report anchoring their currencies to the U.S. dollar. Many more countries actively limit the volatility of their exchange rates against U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar has much broader roles. As you mentioned, U.S. exports are priced in dollars, but companies abroad tend to price their exports to the U.S. in dollars as well, and use dollars even when they are not transacting with the United States. In this case, the dollar is called a vehicle currency, and in addition, many commodities, for example oil, wheat, and metals, are priced in dollars.\n\nMichael Klein: So how did the dollar maintain this vehicle currency role once the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system ended and the formal agreements of that system were no longer in effect?\n\nLinda Goldberg: Scholars of this topic start out by pointing to the relative political and economic stability of the United States, and the relative size of its economy. Other factors discussed are geo-economic and alliance-related, for example with military alliances complementary to currency use. Inertia also contributes.\n\nMichael Klein: The fact that the dollar was important in 1972-1973 means that the dollar continued to be important. That's what you meant by inertia, right?\n\nLinda Goldberg: That's right.\n\nMichael Klein: So Linda, what's the impact on the United States exporters and importers of having the dollar serve as a vehicle currency?\n\nLinda Goldberg: So when international trade transactions are invoiced in U.S. dollars, U.S. producers are less impacted by movements in exchange rates, at least in the short term. And because commodity prices are also in dollars, producer revenues and costs are not whipped around by these exchange rate movements. And dollars often are used in transactions throughout the global supply chains in which so many of the goods we consume are produced.\n\nMichael Klein: I guess it's useful at this point to mention that exchange rates move a lot, much more than prices of goods and services. So that can really change the price if it was denominated in a different currency, right?\n\nLinda Goldberg: That's absolutely right.\n\nMichael Klein: Another important role of the dollar is in financial transactions. And again, the dollar dominates in these as well.\n\nLinda Goldberg: Yeah, this is huge. For example, when companies around the world want to raise funds or borrow in international markets, around 60% of these transactions worldwide are in U.S. dollars. And when currencies trade globally, almost 90% of the turnover, again, worldwide, involves U.S. dollars. And dollar transaction costs tend to be lower. And using the dollar is associated with greater ease of financing.\n\nMichael Klein: It's a situation where because everybody uses it, it becomes the standard. And once it's the standard, it's easier to use. So it's sort of this self-reinforcing process, right, Linda?\n\nLinda Goldberg: That's right. And Americans do benefit from this. If Americans lend and borrow in dollars, then they are avoiding exchange rate risk. So you don't have to worry that the payment made or received will change in the value of your currency, which would be the case if Americans were using euros or pesos or yen, for example. So this offers stability that is certainly worth something to producers in the U.S. and also on the financial side to borrowers and lenders in America who use dollars in their transactions.\n\nMichael Klein: Linda, some of those borrowers and lenders are banks, and not only U.S. banks, but banks around the world. A lot of your research and policy work is on global banking. And as I mentioned in the introduction, you're known as one of the world's experts in this. Can you describe what's meant by global banking and why it's important?\n\nLinda Goldberg: Sure. Some large banks are also global, meaning that they set up branches and subsidiaries outside of their headquarter countries. These banks go in and they borrow and lend in these locations. And many of them also provide other financial services, for example, like wealth management to local customers. Depending on the specific business models of the global banks, they may be very active in helping to move capital to the places where it is most productive. This is also potentially beneficial to banking systems as the global structure provides diversification benefits.\n\nMichael Klein: So the diversification is the old idea that you don't want all your eggs in one basket. So if you're in different countries, the risk is spread out more evenly, right?\n\nLinda Goldberg: That's right. And if banks in one country are troubled or stressed, there's an opportunity for healthier banks, those that still have access to funding to come in and keep credit flowing.\n\nMichael Klein: What's the dollar's special role in global banking, Linda?\n\nLinda Goldberg: Yeah. So many banks that are outside of the U.S. have some of their funding sources denominated in dollars. They also have assets in dollars, assets like loans, as customers use dollars for international trade and for their financial transactions. And while we're talking about global banking, I want to emphasize it's not just banks that heavily use dollars. A large amount of dollar funding flows through different types of financial intermediaries and through a variety of market instruments. And with this kind of whole structure in place and an interconnectedness of markets worldwide, that means that both favorable conditions, and strains across financial markets and institutions can quickly transmit across the globe. It could affect financial conditions, it could affect credit provision, meaning like lending, and it even can affect monetary policy transmission in the United States and in other countries.\n\nMichael Klein: By monetary policy transmission, you mean the way when the central bank changes interest rates, the effects it has on the economy, correct?\n\nLinda Goldberg: That's right.\n\nMichael Klein: So we talked before about why the dollar has such a dominant role. And one thing we didn't yet mention is that the dollar or more precisely Assets-backed Treasury Bills and Bonds are often viewed as what's called a safe haven. What's meant by that term, Linda, \u201csafe haven,\u201d and what advantages arise from this?\n\nLinda Goldberg: So savers and investors around the world look to hold assets that keep their value in stressful periods. And many of them look to the debt issued by the U.S. government for providing such \u201csafe haven\u201d features. There is a large global demand for U.S. dollar assets and U.S. dollar government debt. And this lowers the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government and for the private sector. And of course, this is especially important, consequential, when we have a big federal debt balance, and the interest burden of the debt is substantial. That burden would be even higher but for the safe haven aspect of Treasury Bills and bonds.\n\nMichael Klein: The central role of the dollar is of special importance at times of stress, for example, in 2008 or more recently at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. What policy responses have been undertaken with respect to the role of the dollar to stabilize the world monetary system at these times of stress?\n\nLinda Goldberg: Yeah. So, the central roles of the dollar are really a support to world financial stability. To give you some examples from times of stress, we could think about what happened in 2008, the global financial crisis, and again in 2020 during the initial pandemic period. The markets were under strain and then the Federal Reserve undertook decisive actions that helped to stabilize international dollar funding markets. So, these are these markets where people outside the U.S. are borrowing and lending. So, one example of this is in 2008 when the Federal Reserve established a network of dollar swap lines with some key central banks around the world. So, these swap lines provided a type of short-term liquidity in dollars to other central banks, that supported the continued provision of credit to borrowers using dollars abroad, as well as to corporate borrowers in the United States that rely on banks for loans.\n\nMichael Klein: These foreign central banks then made the dollars available to banks in their own countries, right?\n\nLinda Goldberg: That's right. So, the way that this works is there's a transaction between the Federal Reserve, our central bank in the U.S., and some foreign central banks, and then the central banks work with their own banking constituencies and allocate those dollars to their own banking system.\n\nMichael Klein: What about in 2020, Linda?\n\nLinda Goldberg: In 2020, these swap lines were reactivated. Some of the terms to make dollars available through these swap lines were adjusted. But in addition, another facility called the FIMA repo facility, FIMA in this case is an acronym for Foreign and International Monetary Authorities. The FIMA repo facility was established, and that allows foreign official institutions to temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury Assets that are held in custodial accounts managed by the Federal Reserves for dollar cash. So, these programs make dollars available to foreign official institutions in another way from the swap lines in times of stress. And this is important because it provides broader access to a dollar liquidity backstop than the central bank dollar swap lines do. And also, it's a way that during a stress period, there's less disruption to U.S. treasury markets. So that's because foreign central banks, for example, that are holding treasuries might have tried to liquidate or sell some of their U.S. treasury assets to get cash during the stress period. And that can be very disruptive to U.S. treasury markets. They also might try to sell other U.S. dollar assets in what's called a \u2018fire sale\u2019 type of transaction, just getting the best price that they can, but sometimes really driving prices down of assets, possibly. And so, with this type of FIMA repo facility, they avoid selling some of these assets, but they can still get the dollar liquidity they need.\n\nMichael Klein: So just to clarify, if there was a fire sale, as you say, that means the price goes down. But the price of a bond going down means its interest rate goes up, and that would be not at all good for the United States or the rest of the world when interest rates would shoot up at a time of stress like that, correct?\n\nLinda Goldberg: Yeah. And some of the types of facilities that are set up for these stress periods are really intended to limit some of the amplification effects that would be caused by somebody else's stress out there.\n\nMichael Klein: So these swap lines were very helpful, not only for the other countries, but for the United States as well. But did they present risks for U.S. taxpayers?\n\nLinda Goldberg: These are fully collateralized transactions. In terms of the swap lines, that means that the Federal Reserve has as its counterparties some of the strongest central banks in the world. For the FIMA repo facilities, when we say collateralized, what it means is that these transactions are secured by the U.S. Treasury holdings of the foreign official institutions that are engaging in these transactions. So, dollars are flowing out just over a very short time period. Maybe these are overnight, one-week transactions. But meanwhile, we are holding on to U.S. Treasuries and that takes away that kind of risk to U.S. taxpayers.\n\nMichael Klein: Linda, there's a famous story attributed to Mark Twain that he read an obituary of himself that was falsely presented in a newspaper and he wrote, \u2018the tales of my demise are greatly exaggerated.\u2019 There have been tales of the demise of dollar dominance for a very long period, at least going back to the end of the Bretton Woods system, and even before that. There is concern now, or at least there's talk, that the dollar could be replaced by the euro or even the Chinese renminbi. These stories are more common when we have political challenges, for example, those associated with debt, especially with the raising of the debt ceiling. Do you see a changing role for the dollar and perhaps an emergence of a parallel or maybe even a replacement currency?\n\nLinda Goldberg: OK, well, first, it's the first time that I've heard Mark Twain brought up in this context. So that's great.\n\nMichael Klein: Mark Twain can apply to many, many things, you know. It\u2019s useful reference for most stuff.\n\nLinda Goldberg: So, I think it's worth just reminding the audience of the dollar's roles, and the status of the dollar here. So, the dollar's roles continue to be strong in international trade and international finance. After the dollar, the euro is the second most commonly used currency. And then after that, others have much smaller roles. And speaking about the euro's use, geographic proximity to the euro area and trade with euro area countries has been one of the important drivers of euro use. So, there are already multiple currencies used in the international context, but the dollar's roles continue to be strong. That said, you're absolutely right about the stories and the concerns. And we heard them when the euro was introduced, and we've heard them at many points in time over recent decades. Most recently, some officials from other countries have made strong statements indicating their intent to move away from using dollars on the international trade and financial transactions. Some of these countries also are geopolitically distant from the United States. For example, if you were to think about how countries vote with or differently from the United States at the UN General Assembly, so some of the countries making these statements are more lower alignment countries with the US. So far, this type of shift in dollar use has not been found to be very material or broad-based across countries.\n\nMichael Klein: So, the dollar was dominant, the dollar is dominant, and the dollar is likely to remain dominant at least for some time.\n\nLinda Goldberg: So far, that is the status.\n\nMichael Klein: So the idea of dollar dominance is often mentioned in the media, but I'm not sure that people really understand what that means and what role the dollar has and what the consequences of that would be. But Linda, you helped explain that very clearly today. So thank you very much for joining me on this episode of EconoFact Chats and discussing this issue.\n\nLinda Goldberg: You're very welcome.\n\nMichael Klein: This has been EconoFact Chats.

    "speaker": "John C. Williams",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/wil240228",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for having me here today. I always enjoy meeting with business and community leaders in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Second District. And it\u2019s a real treat to join you here at the Cradle of Aviation Museum. It\u2019s a great reminder of Long Island\u2019s rich history in aeronautics and innovation.\n\nIf only I had time to visit some of the space exhibits today. Alas, maybe next time....\n\nInstead, in my remarks, I will focus on how the Federal Reserve is working to achieve our goals of maximum employment and price stability. I\u2019ll also discuss the significant progress we\u2019ve seen in restoring balance to the economy and bringing inflation down to the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC\u2019s) 2 percent longer-run goal. And I\u2019ll talk about what we still need to see for a full and sustained return to price stability. Finally, I\u2019ll give my economic outlook.\n\nBefore I get into all of that, I need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFalling Inflation, Low Unemployment\n\nIn thinking about the state of our economy today, and what that means for the future, it\u2019s important to start from where we\u2019ve been.\n\nAs business leaders, you know all too well the impacts of the pandemic. In many ways, Long Island\u2019s economy mirrors New York City\u2019s. Both were hit especially hard in 2020\u2014in fact, much harder than what we saw nationally. And in 2023, both reached an important milestone, returning to the number of jobs we had before the pandemic.\n\nLast year was also a turning point for the U.S. economy. Global supply chains, which were severely disrupted during the pandemic and early in the recovery, returned to normal.1 Demand came into better balance with supply. And the economy grew far faster than anyone expected a year ago, boosted by increases in the labor force and productivity.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate under 4 percent\u2014a mark it\u2019s held for the past two years, the longest stretch in five decades. And inflation\u2014as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index\u2014continued to decline from its 40-year high of about 7 percent in mid-2022, reaching about 2-1/2 percent last year.\n\nGiven that we are in a museum that houses an actual Lunar Module\u2014and all eyes are on plans to return to the moon\u2014I cannot resist the temptation to use the mission to send astronauts to the moon as a metaphor for the economy.\n\nLike traveling to the moon and back, inflation shot up, then came back down. And as with the Apollo missions, it\u2019s the safe return home that\u2019s essential. While we\u2019ve seen great progress toward achieving our goals, the journey is not yet over, and I am very focused on making sure we complete this mission successfully.\n\nA Strong, More Balanced Labor Market\n\nI\u2019m going to spend some time digging deeper into the trends behind both sides of our dual mandate goals. I\u2019ll start with employment.\n\nAs you\u2019ll recall, when the economy recovered from the pandemic, the labor market turned red hot. Demand for workers far exceeded supply, and that imbalance contributed to rapid wage growth and high inflation.\n\nNow, the labor market\u2014both in the nation as a whole and here in the Second District\u2014has shown signs of returning to something closer to normal. Nationally, many indicators\u2014such as quits rates and surveys of perceptions of availability of workers and jobs\u2014have returned to around pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThroughout this process of getting into better balance, the labor market has remained strong. The current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is near my estimate for the unemployment rate that is likely to prevail over the longer run. And job growth continues to be solid.\n\nDespite the very real progress in restoring balance, two important indicators point to lingering tightness in the labor market: job openings and wage growth. Job vacancies, which reached all-time highs in the red-hot labor market of 2022, have trended lower since then, but are still quite elevated relative to pre-pandemic norms. And while we have seen measures of wage growth come down from their pandemic-era peaks, they remain above pre-Covid averages.\n\nThe Return Trip of Inflation\n\nThat leads me to the other side of our mandate, price stability. As I mentioned, inflation has declined significantly over the past year and a half. This drop has been broad-based, encompassing decreases in inflation rates for food, energy, goods, and services. The decline in inflation has benefited from a reduction in demand and supply imbalances, both here and internationally, and the resolution of global supply-chain bottlenecks.\n\nOne way to illustrate the dynamics of inflation is through the New York Fed\u2019s measure of underlying inflation, called the Multivariate Core Trend inflation (MCT).2 Before the pandemic, this measure was 1.8 percent, slightly below the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent inflation target. As inflation rose following the pandemic and the onset of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, it climbed sharply, peaking at about 5-1/2 percent in June of 2022.\n\nSince then, the MCT has fallen significantly, reaching 2.3 percent in December, reflecting declines in all the major categories of core inflation. Like the flight path the Apollo missions took to the moon and back, the MCT\u2019s return trajectory is a mirror image of its rise. But, we still have a ways to go on the journey to sustained 2 percent inflation.\n\nYou see a similar round trip in measures of near- and medium-term inflation expectations. According to the New York Fed\u2019s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations, one- and three-year-ahead inflation expectations rose as inflation surged. Since then, these measures have come back to Earth.\n\nOne-year-ahead expectations are within the range seen in the years prior to the pandemic, and three-year-ahead expectations are now actually a bit below their 2014-2019 average.3 Other measures of inflation expectations show similar round-trip trajectories.\n\nMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook\n\nIn summary, the economy is strong, imbalances are diminishing, and inflation has come down but remains above our 2 percent longer-run target.\n\nWhat does that mean for monetary policy?\n\nOver the past two years, the FOMC has put in place a restrictive stance of monetary policy with the aim of bringing inflation back to 2 percent on a sustained basis. Given the progress we have seen, the risks to achieving our maximum employment and price stability goals are moving into better balance.\n\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In announcing that decision, the Committee said it \u201cdoes not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\u201d4\n\nTaking into account the effects of restrictive monetary policy, I expect GDP growth to slow to about 1-1/2 percent this year, and the unemployment rate to rise modestly, peaking at around 4 percent.\n\nI expect inflation to continue its return journey to 2 percent, although there will likely be bumps along the way, as we saw in the most recent Consumer Price Index data. To be specific, I expect PCE inflation to be around 2 to 2-1/4 percent this year and 2 percent next year.\n\nThe risks to this forecast are two-sided. Inflation may surprise on the upside, or consumer strength\u2014a major driver of the robust growth we saw in 2023\u2014may fade more quickly than I anticipate.\n\nConclusion\n\nPrice stability is the bedrock upon which our economic prosperity stands. While the economy has come a long way toward achieving better balance and reaching our 2 percent inflation goal, we are not there yet. I am committed to fully restoring price stability in the context of a strong economy and labor market.\n\nAs we navigate the remainder of this journey, I will be focused on the data, the economic outlook, and the risks, in evaluating the appropriate path for monetary policy that best achieves our goals.\n\nOr, to paraphrase the words of the astronaut Alan Shepard, we\u2019ll assess incoming data until it\u2019s clear all systems are go."

    "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.  As we approach one year after the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, I will begin by sharing two approaches to assessing financial stability. Then I will discuss the current outlook for financial stability and close with some brief thoughts about financial stability considerations in the policy context.\n\nBefore I go further, I will note that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nFinancial Stability and the Economy\n\nWhen winter approaches, we don\u2019t know when it will snow, or how much snow we will get. While we hope for flurries, we prepare for a blizzard, designing buildings and infrastructure to hold up under the weight of heavy snow. Similarly, the work of financial stability is to understand how our financial system will respond to adverse shocks.\n\nTheoretical models show that higher leverage can make the economy more vulnerable. In these models, an economic shock can trigger a self-reinforcing loop as margin calls impair credit provision. Reductions in credit lower asset prices and depress economic activity. Consistent with these models, empirical evidence suggests that financial crises lead to more severe economic downturns and usually follow credit expansions that were accompanied by asset price booms.1 It is this nonlinear response that creates financial stability concerns and that we seek to gauge in the financial stability outlook.\n\nThe outlook for financial stability is inherently hard to capture. First, like predicted blizzards, shocks do not always happen. Or, if they do, the government might intervene. In these cases, we may not observe the amplification from financial system vulnerabilities that the models suggest. Second\u2014fortunately\u2014in advanced economies, we have experienced few financial crises over the last few decades. But while we do not get many blizzards in New York City, we still invest in snowplows, as the consequences of being unprepared are severe. For that reason, we monitor the financial stability outlook to understand the extent to which the financial system has the potential to amplify a shock, if one were to occur. Then we work to mitigate financial system vulnerabilities that would lead to more amplification.\n\nI will discuss two ways of measuring the financial stability outlook.\n\nStatistical Approach\n\nOne approach to quantifying financial stability risks is to estimate the probability of very bad outcomes in real economic variables such as GDP and inflation using quantile regressions that measure the relationship of these variables in bad times instead of just on average. We know from economic research pioneered at the New York Fed that growth can become vulnerable as financial conditions change and that the probability of a large decline in real activity in the lowest quantiles rises as financial conditions tighten.2 Each month the New York Fed posts estimates of the Outlook-at-Risk on our website, forecasting the conditional distribution of average real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation.3\n\nOne way of visualizing the financial stability outlook is to look at the size of the tail of the GDP growth distribution. While we hope to avoid shocks that land us in the tails of the distribution, when the bad tail is wide, the economy is vulnerable. Figure 1 is based on the most recent release of Outlook-at-Risk, posted February 21.  The dashed vertical line shows the blue-chip consensus GDP forecast. We estimate that the conditional distribution given current financial conditions of the left tail of GDP growth, graphed in blue, is in line with historical standards. That\u2019s similar to the unconditional distribution, graphed in red. This means that the left tail is near its historical average and the probability of a large fall of real GDP over the next four quarters is similar to past levels. You can see that visually, because the conditional distribution lays almost on top of the unconditional one. This compares favorably to the conditional distribution as of December 2022, shown in Figure 2, in yellow. There, the bad tail, measured as the 10th percentile, was much wider.\n\nFinancial Stability Vulnerabilities Approach\n\nA second approach to capturing hidden risks to economic outcomes is examining patterns in the financial system historically associated with the amplification of negative real shocks both in the U.S. and internationally. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Financial Stability Report is anchored in this type of monitoring. It tracks several vulnerabilities associated with the 2008 global financial crisis and other crises.4\n\nThe first vulnerability is high asset prices relative to fundamentals. When prices are high relative to fundamentals\u2014presumably reflecting investors\u2019 willingness to take on risk\u2014the possibility of sudden declines in prices is inherently higher.\n\nThe second vulnerability is business and household leverage. As I mentioned earlier, when borrowing by businesses and households is high, there can be sharp declines in investment and spending if there are declines in incomes or the value of assets securing loans falls. \n\nThe third and fourth vulnerabilities arise from the financial sector, from both its leverage and the extent of maturity and liquidity transformation. These interrelated factors can lead to concerns about financial institutions\u2019 ability to absorb losses or funding withdrawals when shocks happen. This can reduce credit availability or lead to fire sales, causing additional price declines and further stress for markets and financial institutions.\n\nFinancial Stability Vulnerabilities Outlook\n\nI will turn to the current outlook for financial stability with respect to these vulnerabilities, starting with asset prices. Prices across real and financial assets are high relative to fundamental values and historical averages. Residential real estate prices are high relative to rents, and commercial real estate prices have been high relative to rental income even as demand in some office markets has collapsed. Equity market valuations remain high and corporate bond spreads on the low side.\n\nTurning to leverage, Figure 3 shows the historical path of aggregate business and household leverage relative to GDP.  The blue line, nonfinancial business debt to GDP, has exceeded historical trends since well before the pandemic, but appears to have peaked. Interest coverage ratios, the ratio of operating income to interest, also appear to have peaked as fixed-rate debt is refinanced and earnings growth moderates. Despite the theoretical risks of business debt overhang limiting new investment, business credit booms historically have not had the same effect on tail risks to the macro economy as have consumer credit booms.5\n\nIn contrast to high leverage in the business sector, , household sector balance sheets, graphed in the black line in Figure 3, are less levered than average, in aggregate. Note that these graphs are on different scales. Most household debt consists of fixed-rate mortgages, limiting the pass-through of higher interest rates. Mortgage credit risk has remained low, as much of this credit has been issued to prime borrowers and homeowners have a significant amount of home equity. \n\nHowever, we are seeing increasing signs of stress for lower-income Americans. Delinquencies in auto and credit cards loans rose in the second half of 2023, with the increases highest for borrowers with auto and student loans as you can see in Figure 4 in the light blue, red and yellow lines.6 While this trend does not bode well for the prospects for consumption of these younger, cash-strapped borrowers, financial stability implications are limited because this type of debt is a relatively small share of total household debt in the economy. Therefore, the risks of amplification through unexpected credit losses to financial institutions are low.\n\nFinally, most financial crises have emerged when shocks are amplified by fragilities in the financial sector. The New York Fed measures vulnerabilities in the banking system using models of capital and liquidity.7  We revised these analyses last year by marking all securities to market value. \n\nBank capital vulnerability, shown in the top left of Figure 5, remains relatively flat. However, measures of liquidity stress, shown in the bottom left, have increased since early 2022, driven by a shift from liquid to less-liquid assets and from stable to unstable funding. Fire sale vulnerabilities, in the top right, are also higher, capturing similarities in bank assets. The run vulnerability index in the bottom right measures the fraction of runnable funding a bank needs to retain in a stress scenario to prevent insolvency. Our measures suggest a moderate increase in systemic vulnerability compared to the low levels of the previous ten years. In aggregate, systemic vulnerability remains below the high levels preceding the 2008 crisis, especially because the largest banks tend to be less exposed to capital shortfalls, fire sales, liquidity mismatches, and run risk compared to smaller institutions. \n\nThinking about vulnerabilities that can turn snow into an avalanche, many times, nonbank financial institutions are the source of issues. Tighter monetary policy has spurred flows into money market funds, including prime money market funds, which continue to have liquidity risks that make them structurally vulnerable and at risk of fire sales. Funds that seek to maintain stable net asset values such as retail prime money market funds are particularly susceptible to sharp changes in interest rates and asset prices. Since the October 2023 Financial Stability Report, assets under management in prime money market funds increased by $82 billion, driven mostly by inflows into retail prime funds.\n\nAs this audience probably knows, identical risks exist in the stablecoin sector, where investors can similarly treat their holdings as akin to cash. Researchers at the New York Fed have estimated that redemptions for stablecoins accelerate significantly when their prices drop below 99 cents, reminiscent of the \u201cbreak-the-buck\u201d threshold for money market funds.8 Additionally, even funds without stable net asset values, such as open-end corporate bond funds, present fire-sale vulnerability in the face of large price changes because they offer daily liquidity despite holding less liquid assets.\n\nFinancial Stability Vulnerabilities in 2024 and Beyond\n\nBoth the statistical approach and a consideration of factors associated with financial stability vulnerabilities offer reasonably comforting pictures.\n\nThat said, I am keeping my eyes on four key financial stability vulnerabilities for 2024 and beyond.\n\nFirst are pockets of risk in the banking sector. One lesson of the banking stress in March 2023 is that aggregate measures of financial stability, which weight the largest banks according to their sizes, may mask vulnerabilities at some individual banks. While the banking industry overall is sound and resilient, changes in interest rates have negatively affected the value of long-duration assets and the impact of revaluations of commercial real estate has been unevenly distributed.\n\nOffice commercial real estate is an area of ongoing supervisory monitoring. While bank supervisors continue to work to ensure that banks have adequately reserved for credit losses, higher-than-anticipated credit losses may require banks to increase loss allowances, reducing bank capital. Silicon Valley Bank was an outlier along many dimensions, including the scale of its mark-to-market securities portfolio losses relative to capital and its large share of uninsured deposits. Ensuring appropriate risk and liquidity management by banks with a variety of exposures continues to be important.\n\nLooking at banks\u2019 value, we must consider not just their assets but the economic value of banks\u2019 deposit franchises. In the last two decades, bank profits have increased with tightening monetary policy as bank profitability benefits from lagging adjustment of deposit rates to rising rates. This cycle is no different\u2014New York Fed research has found that bank deposit betas have generally been on track with past monetary policy tightening cycles, with betas on total deposits approaching 0.4 using data through the end of 2023.9   However, the value of the deposit franchise can disappear in a run and so needs to be turned from bank profits into bank capital when banks are realizing losses. \n\nI\u2019ll touch on financial conditions for a moment to note that the impact of a range of factors on bank lending supply combined with the potential for higher deposit betas at certain smaller banks means that smaller, bank-dependent borrowers have experienced tighter financial conditions than larger borrowers with access to capital markets.\n\nA second concern emerging from higher rates is the acceleration of deposits into prime money market funds and stablecoins, both of which I mentioned earlier as sources of non-bank vulnerabilities. The structural risks of products that transform securities into cash is well understood and has been a source of official sector interventions in two of the last two episodes of financial market turmoil. The SEC has taken important actions to reduce vulnerabilities and investor incentives to preemptively run. However, there remains a substantial and growing amount of assets susceptible to large redemptions during periods of financial stress. This includes approximately $700 billion in retail prime money market funds, $700 billion in dollar denominated offshore money market funds, and more than $100 billion in stablecoins. It also includes more than $4 trillion in bond mutual funds.\n\nMy third area of focus is U.S. Treasury markets. The New York Fed actively monitors trading conditions across Treasury markets, which are the deepest and most liquid in the world. Treasury market liquidity has been somewhat strained across almost all measures for some time, including bid-ask spreads, market depth, and price impact. These measures also look somewhat worse from a longer-term perspective.10   On the one hand, the reduction in liquidity is exactly what we would expect given interest rate volatility, and trading conditions are orderly.11 On the other hand, lower-than-usual liquidity, even if we understand the reasons for it, means that a demand shock will have larger-than-usual effects on prices, and is more likely to trigger a negative feedback loop between sales, volatility, and liquidity.\n\nReducing vulnerabilities arising from Treasury markets and improving the resilience of market intermediation is a key focus of the New York Fed and other members of the Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance. The Federal Reserve has established the Standing Repo Facility and Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility which support greater resilience.  Interagency efforts have included work to improve data quality and availability through improvements to FINRA Treasury Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine data, and a study of all-to-all trading. The SEC has adopted rules to facilitate additional central clearing of Treasuries and to ensure that market participants who provide significant liquidity are registered with the SEC. We are also working to examine effects of leverage and fund liquidity risk management practices. We know snow can come every winter, so it makes sense to keep investing in boots and shovels.\n\nFinally, a key vector for financial vulnerability is cyberattacks. These have been occurring at accelerating rates, so we must work to reduce their amplification though the financial system.  That means not just leaving cyber to the technologists, but thinking about the real business impact of cyberattacks, vulnerable connections between financial institutions, and what changes to the financial system might mean for cybersecurity. For example, in a study I conducted with New York Fed colleagues, we estimate that a successful cyberattack on a designated financial market utility would double or triple the typical daily payments required for the same transactions, an amount of two to three times firms\u2019 average reserve balances.12\n\nAt times when a significant amount of value is coming from deposit franchises where interest rates on total deposits have increased by less than half of the actual change in the fed funds rate, banks are more vulnerable to runs. This also means that banks are more vulnerable to cyberattacks, including misinformation that could spread rapidly and lead to erosion of the deposit base. \n\nTurning to the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, reserves are little changed since the middle of 2022, when balance sheet reduction began. This is due to reductions in take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility (ONRRP). At its January meeting, the FOMC said that it will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its framework announced in 2022.13   The FOMC has noted its intention to continue operating in an ample reserve regime. Ongoing balance sheet reduction is proceeding well. Thus far, we have seen few signs that reserves are approaching the point where changes in supply have an impact on the fed funds rate. Reserves remain above ample. All else equal, a system with more reserves is less vulnerable to shocks than is one with fewer reserves; therefore, as ONRRP use declines and reserves begin to fall with balance sheet reduction, we will continue to closely monitor money market conditions.\n\nFinancial Stability is not a Goal in and of Itself\n\nThe business of financial intermediation is inherently risky. Banks engage in liquidity transformation: They take savings, offer daily withdrawals, and make loans. Our financial system has vulnerabilities.\n\nThe key to financial stability is understanding when vulnerabilities are so great that we are in danger of a nonlinear response in the economy. We contribute to a more resilient financial system by understanding and mitigating sources of these nonlinearities. Examples of this include the transition away from LIBOR to the adoption of more robust rates like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the ongoing work on Treasury market resilience. Robust bank supervision that ensures banks are prepared to facilitate access to credit even in a crisis also furthers this goal. \n\nConclusion\n\nAchieving a strong U.S. economy and stable prices is paramount, and remaining aware of the impact of policy choices on the financial system is a key ingredient to maintaining the ability to execute policy. To close with the snow metaphor I began with, if there is a blizzard in March, we will be prepared to dig out quickly, plow the streets, and get back to work.\n\nPresentation"

    "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you, Michelle. Your words have special meaning to me\u2014my own career at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has really emphasized the importance of diversity to our success.\n\nI have benefited greatly from the consistent presence of skilled female managers and peers throughout my career. These women have served as role models, mentors, friends, and champions of my work. Their guidance and support enabled me to contribute with confidence when I took my proverbial \u201cseat at the table\u201d\u2014especially when I was the only woman in the room.\n\nNot all women are so fortunate. As we all know, there is still not enough gender parity or diversity in financial markets. This event and others like it provide opportunities for women to build supportive networks to further those goals. My thanks to everyone here for making this gathering possible.\n\nAs the world grows more complex and interconnected, so too, do the issues we face. Everyone brings different perspectives to problem-solving, shaped by their own personal experiences, and wide-ranging perspectives are increasingly essential to finding effective solutions.\n\nIn my experience, fostering a supportive and inclusive culture is embedded in the Federal Reserve\u2019s work. This culture is one of the things that has kept me at the Fed for almost my entire professional career. And drawing from a broad range of views is critical in my role as deputy manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA), where I help to lead the Fed\u2019s monetary policy implementation.\n\nRecently, the evolution and future of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has become a topic of increasingly active discussion. Today, I will describe where the balance sheet currently stands, consider its various components, and suggest how it might evolve going forward. Central bank balance sheets can be technical and obscure, but we\u2019ll go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, please note that the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1 That said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\nUnderstanding the Fed\u2019s Balance Sheet\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set U.S. monetary policy since the 1930s. And for close to half a century, it has been mandated to achieve maximum employment and price stability. The New York Fed is charged with implementing monetary policy, mostly through open market operations.\n\nHistorically, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet consisted of a relatively simple combination of reserves and currency, on the liability side, and securities holdings and loans to depository institutions, on the asset side. Over time, that balance sheet has become more diverse and complex as financial markets have evolved. But at the end of the day, the New York Fed\u2019s core job\u2014supporting the FOMC\u2019s efforts to achieve its dual mandate\u2014remains largely the same.\n\nThree Interrelated Responsibilities\n\nSo how does a central bank use its balance sheet to achieve its key objectives?2 Here I see three interrelated responsibilities.\n\nFirst, central banks provide money for our everyday lives. People use Federal Reserve notes\u2014paper money\u2014to purchase goods and services. Banks use reserves\u2014deposits they hold at the Fed\u2013to settle payments and as a safe and liquid asset. The U.S. Treasury has a \u201cchecking account\u201d at the Fed, called the Treasury General Account (TGA), which it uses to manage its cash flows. These and other Fed liabilities are the foundation for our monetary and banking system\u2014the lifeblood of our economy.\n\nSecond, central banks adjust their balance sheets to support the stance of monetary policy. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve\u2019s primary tool for this purpose is the target range for the federal funds rate, which in turn influences other short-term interest rates and broader financial conditions. At each meeting, the FOMC sets a target range consistent with its dual mandate. Then, the Federal Reserve adjusts a set of administered rates and the FOMC instructs the New York Fed\u2019s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to conduct market operations to achieve that target. Today, two of the Fed\u2019s administered rates\u2014the rate of interest on reserve balances (IORB) and the rate on the overnight reverse repo facility (ON RRP)\u2014together establish a floor under interest rates, below which banks and other money market participants should be unwilling to lend.\n\nFinally, central banks can use their balance sheets to address dysfunction in markets to support the transmission of monetary policy. The Fed, as the lender of last resort, can expand its balance sheet to address temporary liquidity strains. Historically, during periods of acute stress, the Fed has used a mix of lending facilities and asset purchases to restore functioning in critical markets. The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP)\u2014introduced last March to mitigate liquidity stress in the banking system\u2014is the latest such example.3 Supporting financial stability in this way helps prevent broader crises.\n\nBalance Sheet Basics\n\nWith these tenets in mind, I will walk through how the balance sheet reflects these three interrelated responsibilities, through both assets and liabilities.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the Fed\u2019s assets. These are relatively simple: they are primarily loans and the SOMA portfolio. The portfolio includes securities holdings mostly acquired through open market operations. And it\u2019s comprised primarily of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).4 Operations like repurchase agreements\u2014which are also part of the SOMA portfolio\u2014and other monetary policy tools, such as the Discount Window and other forms of lending, can also be used to provide liquidity to the financial system when needed. When the Fed purchases securities or extends credit to financial institutions, the balance sheet grows. When loans are repaid or securities mature without reinvestment, the balance sheet shrinks.\n\nNow I\u2019ll turn to the Fed\u2019s liabilities\u2014the base money we provide to the financial system and the public.  So what are these liabilities and how can they evolve? I\u2019ll divide this discussion in two parts: reserves and non-reserve liabilities since their behavior and drivers can be very different.\n\nI\u2019ll start with reserves. The Fed is a bank to banks, and reserves are the deposits these banks hold with the Fed. The total supply of reserves relative to bank demand is a key part of interest rate control. Demand for reserves reflects actual or expected payment activity, regulations and related factors, and internal liquidity risk practices. Reserve demand tends to grow with the economy, and surveys suggest it increases around stress events.5 The Fed pays interest on reserve balances\u2014one of the two administered rates that I mentioned earlier\u2014which provides a strong disincentive for banks to lend out excess holdings below that rate, and thus acts as a floor on bank lending rates.\n\nOn the other side, non-reserve liabilities can be further split up into two subsets: \u201cautonomous\u201d and \u201csemi-autonomous\u201d factors. I\u2019ll take each in turn.\n\nDemand for \u201cautonomous\u201d factors is driven more by structural dynamics than the stance of monetary policy or other direct actions of the Fed. That distance from Fed actions is what makes them \u201cautonomous.\u201d Currency and the TGA, mentioned earlier, are prime examples. Currency demand has generally increased over time, reflecting nominal economic growth, shifts in consumer preferences, technological changes, and international demand for U.S. dollars. TGA balances are determined by Treasury\u2019s cash management practices and have grown over time, albeit with periodic fluctuations.6\n\nAn important subset of non-reserve liabilities is what I will call \u201csemi-autonomous\u201d factors, the size of which are ultimately determined by economic incentives but are also influenced by monetary policy and its implementation. The ON RRP facility is a prime example.7 The ON RRP rate\u2014the second of the two administered rates that I mentioned earlier\u2014effectively acts as a floor by offering safe, short-term investments to a range of bank and nonbank counterparties, including some that do not otherwise have access to remunerated balances at the Fed. Demand for the ON RRP is driven primarily by money market dynamics. This includes demand for deposit funding by banks, asset allocation decisions by money market funds, and the relative availability and pricing of other short-duration safe assets, such as Treasury bills.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Implementation Framework and the Balance Sheet\n\nNow I will turn to interest rate control and our implementation framework. In 2019 and again in 2022, the FOMC affirmed its intention to continue operating in an ample reserves regime\u2014a framework that has been in place since 2008.8 The merits of this decision have been discussed in other forums and publications.9 I\u2019m going to discuss our framework as a foundation for understanding the FOMC\u2019s current plans to reduce the balance sheet, as well as the likely evolution of the balance sheet over time.\n\nWhen reserves are ample, interest rate control is achieved primarily through administered rates without active management of reserve supply. IORB disincentivizes banks to lend funds at any lower rate, and thus acts as a floor on money market rates. This system ties the price of liquidity to administered rates rather than to changes in reserve supply or demand. This flexibility allows the FOMC to use changes in the size or composition of the balance sheet as a policy tool, while still maintaining interest rate control and influencing broader financial conditions.\n\nThis approach works well in both liability- and asset-driven regimes. When the balance sheet is only large enough to meet the demand for the Fed\u2019s liabilities, the regime is characterized as liability-driven. Assets are adjusted to ensure that the supply of reserves is ample relative to the demand for reserves. This is an environment in which the federal funds rate does not display significant sensitivity to short-term changes in aggregate reserve balances.\n\nBy contrast, the balance sheet is asset-driven when asset purchases are used to provide additional economic stimulus or to address severe market dysfunction. During periods of acute stress, backstop facilities or emergency lending tools also support market functioning and the smooth flow of credit.10 In this regime, the supply of liquidity may grow well beyond ample\u2014and remain there for some time. That means there is an excess supply of reserves\u2014possibly a significant excess supply\u2014relative to bank demand. This is when the floor provided by administered rates is particularly important. Our framework is also designed to maintain rate control through the transition from an asset-driven regime to a liability-driven regime.\n\nThe ON RRP facility is key to that flexibility. After the global financial crisis, it became clear that the \u201cfloor\u201d on rates from IORB was a bit leaky. That was partly anticipated, and it was attributed to bank balance sheet and other intermediation costs. It also reflected the activity of Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), such as Federal Home Loan Banks to name one example. These GSEs participate in the federal funds market, but since they do not earn interest on their balances held at the Fed, it means they are likely willing to lend at rates below IORB. ON RRP reinforces interest rate control by extending administered rates to a larger share of market participants, including GSEs and money market funds.11\n\nHow does this work? When private market repo rates are below the ON RRP offering rate, some counterparties are incentivized to use the ON RRP, and its balance grows. But when private market repo rates are above the ON RRP rate, the facility balance tend to shrink. This way, the ON RRP enhances rate control by securing the floor under overnight funding rates, giving our framework greater flexibility.\n\nIn the long run, the balance sheet will generally be liability-driven. In other words, it will be adjusted primarily to meet demand for reserves and non-reserve liabilities consistent with an ample supply of reserves.\n\nBalance Sheet Reduction\n\nToday, we are in transition\u2014reducing the size of the balance sheet as directed by the FOMC. This process is going smoothly, and I\u2019d like to provide some context.\n\nIn 2022, the FOMC reaffirmed that its primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy is the federal funds rate.12 It also reaffirmed its intention to maintain, over time, securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime. The Committee subsequently communicated its intent to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample.13 That buffer should provide space for the growth of non-reserve liabilities until reserve balances are at an ample level.\n\nSince the start of runoff in June 2022, the SOMA portfolio has declined by over $1.4 trillion, including $1.1 trillion in Treasury securities and nearly $300 billion in MBS. This decrease was partly offset by a rise in lending after the stress to the banking system in March 2023. On net, Fed assets have declined by $1.3 trillion since June 2022.\n\nThis runoff in SOMA securities is passive and subject to a total monthly cap of $95 billion. That approach is designed to be predictable and is intended to reduce the risk of disruptions in market functioning or outsized volatility in asset prices. On average, securities runoff has been about $75 billion per month\u2014a level below the cap owing to very slow MBS prepayments.14\n\nAs I mentioned, balance sheet reduction has been proceeding as planned and reserve supply remains above ample.15 The reserve-draining impact of runoff has been almost entirely offset by the reserve-adding impact of the drop in ON RRP usage.16 And, as a result, reserve balances are nearly unchanged since runoff started. Nevertheless, we are seeing incremental signs of a shift in money market conditions. The distribution of traded repo rates, for example, has moved upward, and repo rate volatility has periodically reemerged around regulatory reporting dates or Treasury settlement dates. However, there is no sustained material upward pressure in the federal funds market. As balance sheet reduction continues, we expect to see further declines in ON RRP, and reserve balances will likely begin to decrease at some point. As this proceeds, we will continue to monitor conditions in a range of money markets.\n\nAmid these developments, there has been increased focus on the factors that would guide a decision to slow the pace of SOMA runoff. The FOMC will ultimately determine the future evolution of the balance sheet, including when to slow and when to stop the runoff of the securities portfolio. Still, I can provide some context on how to think about its future size and associated considerations. Let me walk you through that now.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Future Balance Sheet\n\nThe balance sheet currently stands at $7.6 trillion, including $7.4 trillion in SOMA securities holdings.17 According to recent surveys conducted by the Desk, there is a high degree of uncertainty among primary dealers and market participants over how much further the SOMA portfolio will decline. Most respondents expect runoff to cease between later this year and the middle of 2025, and assign a substantial probability to a SOMA portfolio that is between $6 and $7 trillion when it ceases to decline.\n\nImportantly, the size and composition of the balance sheet will be largely determined by factors that are not directly related to monetary policy. Secular shifts in demand for reserve balances and other liabilities will be key.\n\nIt is, however, clear that recent trends point to a sizable balance sheet in the long run. Federal Reserve notes, which currently total $2.3 trillion, are a primary driver. Currency growth is likely to be steady, but technological change is a wild card. The TGA, which reflects Treasury\u2019s cash management policy, currently averages about $750 billion, but that may change over time and exhibit significant fluctuations.18 Meanwhile, accounts held by foreign central bank and other official international institutions, GSEs, and designated financial market utilities have increased and currently represent about $550 billion in additional liabilities. Together, these liabilities total $3.6 trillion before accounting for reserve balances.\n\nFuture demand for ON RRP is an open question, and an important one. Thus far, ON RRP counterparties have been very responsive to private market prices, which is consistent with the facility\u2019s role in reinforcing the floor on rates through a wide range of environments. If these declines continue, ON RRP balances could return to near-zero levels over time. But that remains to be seen.\n\nFinally, the response of banks to changes in regulations and risk appetite has driven increased demand for reserves. The emergent stress among regional banks last March appears to have been a recent catalyst.19 The Fed will need to be responsive to this change in demand when setting the supply of reserves at a sufficient quantity to maintain interest rate control.20\n\nConsidering all these factors, a return to the $4.2 trillion pre-Covid balance sheet is very unlikely. In the coming months, we will be monitoring money markets for emerging pressures, which may at some point indicate we\u2019re getting closer to a level that is somewhat above ample. Eventually, the balance sheet will have to increase over time to accommodate the long-term growth of the financial system\u2014and with it the demand for Fed liabilities. In order to meet this growth over time, reserve management purchases will be needed to maintain an ample supply of reserves.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, I want to emphasize that balance sheet reduction has been proceeding smoothly. The longer-run size and composition of the Fed\u2019s liabilities will be driven by structural factors that will influence the demand for reserves and other central bank liabilities. This demand will continue to influence the size of the balance sheet needed to operate effectively in an ample reserves regime. For now, we will continue to monitor money market conditions to help policymakers determine when to slow and then stop balance sheet runoff.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the tools may have changed over the years, but our goal remains the same: to help the FOMC achieve its dual mandate. We do that by taking actions to implement its monetary policy decisions. The balance sheet is, in a sense, simply a record of those actions. That makes understanding its past and its evolution key to understanding the role the central bank plays in the economy\u2014how it supports growth and employment, maintains stable prices, and promotes the safety and stability of our financial system.\n\nFinally, to bring it back to the conference today, I will leave you with a sentiment from current Treasury Secretary\u2014and former Fed Chair\u2014Janet Yellen.21 She has said that \"expanding opportunity to women isn\u2019t just the right thing to do. It\u2019s also good economics. And we have much more work to do.\" As we look ahead to today's conference on so many important topics, let's keep this in mind, and keep working towards a better future."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to join you today. I\u2019ll start by thanking you for your commitment to the economic development of communities across the New York region.\n\nMy remarks today will focus on the economic outlook in the United States and how the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy actions are helping restore price stability. I\u2019ll also share some observations about economic developments closer to home in the New York metropolitan area. Before I go further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Mandate\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, our work and actions are guided by our dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhen it comes to employment\u2014the first half of the mandate\u2014things are looking very good. The economy added nearly 2.9 million payroll jobs in 2023.1 The employment-to-population ratio of \u201cprime-age\u201d workers aged 25-54 has regained levels that prevailed in the months before the pandemic. And the national unemployment rate has been at or below 4 percent for two straight years now, the longest such stretch in over five decades. The current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is in line with my 3-3/4 percent estimate for the unemployment rate that is likely to prevail over the longer run.\n\nOn the price stability side, the situation has improved significantly since the sharp rise in inflation that followed the onset of the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, surged to a 40-year high of about 7 percent in June of 2022. Over the past year and a half, the inflation rate has fallen back to just over 2-1/2 percent. This decrease is a clearly positive development, but it is important to stress that we still have a ways to go to get inflation back to the FOMC\u2019s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Price stability is the bedrock upon which our economic prosperity stands and is essential to ensure maximum employment over the long term.\n\nThe Labor Market: U.S. and New York City\n\nI\u2019ll now dive a bit deeper into the economic situation and outlook, starting with the employment side of our mandate. After the recovery from the pandemic, we saw a red-hot labor market take shape across the country. You\u2019re familiar with the story\u2014demand far exceeded supply, and that imbalance contributed to rapid wage growth and high inflation.\n\nOver the past year, even as the labor market has remained strong, we have seen a steady return toward better balance. Job growth ended the year on a strong note but has slowed considerably from the unsustainably high rates recorded in the first half of last year. Quits and hiring rates are back near pre-pandemic levels, as are the perceptions of job availability and the ability to fill jobs. The job openings rate\u2014which reached all-time highs in 2022\u2014has also trended lower but is still high relative to pre-pandemic norms.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a rebalancing in New York City as well, where the recovery in employment has taken longer than in the nation as a whole. Now, New York City has basically regained the jobs lost during the pandemic. Still, the recovery has been uneven. Even though employment in higher-wage sectors such as finance and business services has rebounded, sectors that tend to provide jobs to lower-wage workers that rely on foot traffic from office workers continue to lag, holding back the city\u2019s recovery.\n\nThere have been meaningful improvements on the supply side of the labor market, too. Labor force participation has trended upward, and immigration rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels. But there are limits to how much supply can increase, and some further moderation in demand is likely needed to fully return balance to the labor market.\n\nThree Layers of Inflation\n\nI\u2019ll now return to our price stability mandate. If you\u2019ve read the speeches that I\u2019ve given over the past year or so, you will know that I\u2019ve been using a metaphor of an onion\u2019s layers to explain inflation\u2014how it climbed so high in 2021 and why it\u2019s now moderating.2 In this metaphor, I describe three layers, so it\u2019s become my \u201crule of three,\u201d so to speak. Today, I\u2019ll explain how each of the three layers represents a different sector of the economy.\n\nThe first and outermost layer of the inflation onion represents globally traded commodities. Demand for commodities soared when the pandemic hit, contributing to a surge in inflation, and then rose again when Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nNow that global demand has come into better balance with supply, commodity prices have come down significantly from their peak levels. Food price inflation has dropped below two percent, and energy prices have been falling over the past year, bringing down the overall inflation rate rather than pushing it higher.\n\nThe second layer of the onion\u2014core goods, that is goods excluding food and energy\u2014is also benefitting from the rebalancing of supply and demand, both here and abroad. The inflation rate in this layer of the onion has dropped to near zero, reflecting cooling demand and the resolution of supply chain bottlenecks that contributed to rapid price increases. The New York Fed\u2019s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which measures the extent of supply-chain disruptions, indicates that overall supply-chain pressures have returned to pre-pandemic levels.3\n\nWe\u2019ve now peeled away the first two layers of the onion, which have seen the largest and most rapid improvements. We\u2019re beginning to see significant progress in the third, innermost layer of the onion, too. Core services inflation has come down after peaking early last year. One factor contributing to this is slowing shelter inflation, as the growth of rents for newly signed leases returns to pre-pandemic norms. And the inflation rate for core services excluding housing has also slowed considerably.\n\nFuture Indicators\n\nWith that summary of the inflation onion in mind, what can we expect for inflation going forward?\n\nOne important factor behind inflation is inflation expectations, and the recent indicators here have been quite encouraging. Longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent goal. Medium-term inflation expectations are fully back to pre-pandemic levels. And one-year-ahead inflation expectations, which rose as inflation surged, have fallen dramatically to within the range seen in the seven years before the pandemic for which we have survey data.4\n\nA second useful indicator for future inflation is the New York Fed\u2019s Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation. After reaching nearly 5-1/2 percent in June of 2022, the most recent MCT reading is 2.3 percent.5 Other indicators of underlying inflation are showing significant declines toward pre-pandemic levels as well.\n\nThe third indicator I\u2019ll mention\u2014there\u2019s my rule of three again\u2014is wage growth. Economists at the New York Fed have developed a measure of trend wage inflation, which has declined to about 4-1/2 percent from its peak of near 7 percent in December 2021.6 This is another indicator that the labor market is coming back into better balance.\n\nIf we put all these pieces together, the data indicate that we are clearly moving in the right direction. However, we still are a ways from our price stability goal.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy?\n\nThe FOMC\u2019s policy actions over the past two years have put in place a restrictive policy stance that is helping achieve balance between demand and supply and restore price stability. In December, the FOMC kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.7\n\nSo here is my forecast for 2024 and beyond. Taking into account the effects of restrictive monetary policy, I expect GDP growth to slow to about 1-1/4 percent this year, and for the unemployment rate to rise to around 4 percent. I expect PCE inflation to continue to slow to about 2-1/4 percent this year, before reaching our 2 percent longer-run goal next year.\n\nAll of that said, the future remains uncertain. The risks are two-sided, with the possibility of supply-demand imbalances or inflation remaining stubbornly persistent weighed against that of a weaker-than-expected economy and labor market.\n\nMy base case is that the current restrictive stance of monetary policy will continue to restore balance and bring inflation back to our 2 percent longer-run goal. I expect that we will need to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time to fully achieve our goals, and it will only be appropriate to dial back the degree of policy restraint when we are confident that inflation is moving toward 2 percent on a sustained basis. The outlook remains highly uncertain, and I will continue to carefully watch and assess the data to judge whether the stance of policy is best positioned to achieve our goals. Our policy decisions will be made meeting by meeting and will follow another rule of three: by looking at the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\n\nI\u2019d like to briefly mention the current state of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. At our last meeting in December, the FOMC said that it will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in our framework announced in 2022.8 The strategy and implementation of the reduction in our security holdings is working exactly as designed. Thus far we have reduced our securities holdings by about $1.3 trillion, with no signs of adverse effects on market functioning.9\n\nIn its plans, the FOMC said that to ensure a smooth transition it intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves.10 So far, we don\u2019t seem to be close to that point. The decline in securities holdings has been absorbed almost entirely by a drop in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility (ON RRP). As a result, aggregate reserve balances are little changed from their levels in mid-2022, when balance sheet reduction started. Looking ahead to this year, as the balance sheet continues to shrink and usage of the ON RRP continues to decline, we will closely monitor money market conditions and the demand for reserves.\n\nThe FOMC\u2019s Commitment\n\nI\u2019ll close with a final set of three. One, the strong actions that we have taken over the past two years are working as intended. Two, we have seen meaningful progress on restoring balance to the economy and bringing inflation down. And three, our work is not done. I am committed to achieving our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal and creating a strong foundation for our economic future."
