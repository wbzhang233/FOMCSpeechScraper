    "content": "Good morning.  It is my pleasure to welcome you to the New York Fed for today\u2019s conference on the costs and returns of higher education and higher education financing.  I am delighted to see such broad interest and attention from the academic community on this topic.  The role of education and education financing in today\u2019s labor market and economy has never been more important.  It is a topic that I have spoken about frequently during my tenure here at the New York Fed, especially with regard to education\u2019s importance for economic mobility.  Understanding educational investment decisions and their macroeconomic implications requires rigorous analysis from top academic researchers like you.  Let me briefly discuss some developments that I find particularly significant and worthy of investigation.  As always, what I say represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAs has been well documented by Raj Chetty and his co-authors, income inequality has increased in recent decades, while economic mobility has stagnated.  Meanwhile, absolute mobility appears to have fallen, indicated by the declining share of children who earn more than their parents.  The combination of high inequality and low mobility is problematic, because it means that being born into a low-income family is more consequential today than in the past.  Since education is a key determinant of upward mobility, one way to increase economic mobility in the United States would be to increase overall post-secondary educational attainment.  There are, however, a number of important barriers to achieving that goal.\n\nFirst, many high school students and their parents appear to lack accurate information about the returns obtained from a college education.  New York Fed research shows evidence of systematic underestimation of the average benefits\u2014and overestimation of costs\u2014of a college education, with larger biases among lower-income and non-college households.  Research by Caroline Hoxby and Sarah Turner shows that among low-income high school students, even very high achievers are poorly informed about the academic options that are available and their effects on career opportunities.  This research finds that the provision of relevant information can lead to markedly better outcomes.\n\nA second impediment is the lack of preparedness among new college entrants, with large numbers of those students needing remedial courses that earn no college credit.  Low readiness contributes to persistently low college completion rates, especially among lower-income, part-time, and nontraditional students.  Higher dropout rates, in turn, contribute to a substantial reduction in the net expected and realized returns from college attendance.\n\nThe third major barrier to college attendance and completion is the rise in the cost of a college education.  While a college education is generally a good investment, the cost of attending a four-year college has risen considerably faster than wages over the last several decades.  This means that college has become increasingly unaffordable\u2014which can act as a drag on economic mobility and the growth of a college-educated workforce, and by extension, on productivity growth and living standards.\n\nAs has been well documented by my New York Fed colleagues, many young Americans have adjusted to rising tuition and fees by taking on more debt.  This trend highlights the importance of the federal student loan program, which has helped mitigate the impact of the shift in financing of higher education from state and local funding to students and their families over the past few decades.  However, the end result is that more students leave college with significantly higher amounts of debt.  Student loan debt has more than tripled over the past two decades and now totals over $1.4 trillion.\n\nIt is important to consider what these changes in financing higher education mean for economic mobility.  First, New York Fed researchers have documented that a large percentage of student borrowers\u2014especially those who attend less selective colleges or drop out\u2014have trouble staying current on their loans, and often become delinquent and default on their debt.  We also know that these factors\u2014slow repayment, delinquency, and default\u2014are most prevalent among those from more modest family circumstances.  In addition, there is evidence that student debt acts as a drag on homeownership.  Specifically, our research indicates that when college tuition rises in a state, it leads to higher levels of student debt and a lower homeownership rate.  These factors matter for inequality and social mobility, because increasing home equity is the major form of wealth accumulation for the great majority of American families.  Thus, rising tuition and changes in the way that college is financed appear to have diminished the ability of higher education to lift people from poverty into the middle class.\n\nOf course, students\u2019 reliance on debt and the returns from graduating vary across educational institutions.  Of particular interest here is recent work by Raj Chetty and his co-authors showing that some colleges\u2014some of which can be found in the CUNY and California state systems\u2014appear to be much better at fostering economic mobility than others.  In other words, they accept relatively large numbers of lower-income students while also producing large numbers of high earners, which means that these institutions facilitate considerable upward mobility.  Learning exactly how they do it and how it can be replicated strikes me as a first-order question for further study.  Recent research by Caroline Hoxby to assess differences in productivity across educational institutions makes important progress in that direction.\n\nIn summary, academic research on the financing, costs, and returns of higher education is more important now than it has ever been.  We are pleased to have many of those researchers participating in this conference. I would like to thank Raji Chakrabarti and Wilbert van der Klaauw and the New York Fed\u2019s Research Group for organizing this timely conference, and for bringing together this superb group of scholars.  Thank you all for your participation.  I wish you a very productive and enjoyable conference."

    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",

    "content": "Eugene White:\n\nDr. Dudley is going to first give some general comments about the regional economy, and then we're going to move over here for a fireside chat to talk using some pre-prepared questions, and then from the audience.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nGreat to be here. My wife is a graduate of at the school and she sends her regards. She's the Chair of the Douglass investment fund, so she's actually involved with the college on an ongoing basis. It's also great to see Christine Cumming, whom I worked very closely with at the Fed. She was the First Vice President of the Fed, and is now on the faculty here. So, glad to see you here, Chris, as well.\n\nI thought I'd just talk a little bit about what we're doing on these kind of roadshows. Like, why do we do this? And talk a little bit about the regional economic outlook. The New York Fed\u2014the Second District of the Federal Reserve, it's New York's Fed district, and it consists of New York State, Fairfield County, Connecticut, Northern New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. And we think it's important that in terms of how we interact with our community, to actually go out into the community and find out what's really going on. It's one thing to look at economics, statistics, and data, but it's also very valuable to actually hear from people in terms of what are they experiencing in terms of the economy. What's happening to the labor market, what's happening to job availability, what's happening to the housing market. We learned a lot during the financial crisis about the difficulties people were having with maintaining their mortgages, staying current on their mortgages.\n\nSo, you get that information by reaching out into the community. I basically go out on four road trips a year throughout the district. So this is the fourth one for Northern New Jersey. We're going down to Puerto Rico which has been devastated by the hurricanes, in a couple of months. That\u2019ll be the next one. It's been very valuable for me in terms of really understanding what's going on, on the ground.\n\nSo, basically is important. It informs how we think about the appropriate course of monetary policy. It's one thing to look at economic statistics, it's another thing to hear from real people on how the economy is actually affecting them on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe second thing we do on these trips is we're really trying to understand what we can help bring to the community in terms of our own outreach efforts. We have a function in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which is Outreach & Education, and we like to use that to try to actually help the communities that are in our district.\n\nSome of the ways that we do that, for example, is we recently ran a small business forum in New Brunswick about how small businesses can gain access to capital. In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, we actually had a set of workshops in New York about how could people actually navigate through the various aid programs and help people recover from the hurricane.\n\nWe also publish a lot of economic data that is actually helpful to the policymakers locally. So we do a small business survey for the region. We're also now starting to compile a lot of micro-data at the local level, so you'll actually sort of see how is it one day we're doing well and another day we're not very far away from doing much more poorly. And that actually helps policymakers make better decisions about how they can actually help their local community.\n\nAnd the last thing we do is I think we have a pretty strong ability to convene people. If we say something is important, a lot of people will sort of take this pretty seriously. And so if we can have various stakeholders come in\u2014people from the education communities, from government, from private businesses, from community development groups\u2014and have conversations about real issues, which I think actually pushes the ball forward in terms of making progress on tackling some of the tough public policy issues we face.\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019m very focused on is income mobility. I think people they get in the United States, there's the American Dream, the idea that you can start from the bottom, work hard, and make your way up. But the fact is, income mobility in the United States isn't really good. And that's really something that we need to work on. That's why places like Rutgers are so important because it's really the educational communities that essentially give people that leg up. So, for example, Milton Friedman has a story, I thought was a very interesting one. His parents didn't go to college. Just like my wife Ann. Her parents didn't go to college, and so she came to Rutgers. Her family thought she should go to the local community college, and she said no, I'm going to go to Rutgers, I'm going to go to a four-year college.\n\nSo I think what happens in the educational communities in our region are really, really important in terms of giving people the job skills and that head start so they can actually make a success of themselves throughout their career. That's the one thing in the Second District, where we really have a comparative advantage, the number of really high quality educational institutions in the Second District is really without parallel.\n\nI mean, the only district that could even sort of, maybe slightly compete with us, might be the Boston Federal Reserve\u2019s district. Having those educational communities work closely with business, I think is also important. So that's something else we very much stress. We want to have people graduate with the skills that businesses actually need so that those people can actually get jobs quite easily.\n\nSo that's really sort of the purpose of why we go on these road trips. Also we can give our views about the economy. So Eugene\u2019s going to ask me a lot of questions, which I'll answer. I'm sure we'll cover not just the local economy but we'll also talk about the national economic outlook and things of that nature.\n\nEugene White:\n\nWe're going to have a fireside chat here. We're going to move over here.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI'm looking for the fire.\n\nEugene White:\n\nI don't think in these buildings they allow you to light anything. Except maybe intellectual discussion. So, I've had a series of questions handed to me by faculty and graduate students and undergraduates to ask you.\n\nSo, one question which is submitted was a quote from Charles Steindel, the former Chief Economist for Chris Christie, who used to also work at the Fed. And he said that the New Jersey economy consistently grows at a 0.5 to 1% slower than the national economy. This has been going on for a half century or more. Given this regional divergence, how do regional considerations figure into the Fed's policy decisions?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, clearly, we set monetary policy for the nation as a whole. So some regions are doing better, some regions are doing less well. And we take all that in consideration in terms of monetary policy. We can't set monetary policy differentially. You can't have one monetary policy for New Jersey, another one for New York City, another one for upstate New York.\n\nSo, we have to understand that monetary policy is going to be set for the country as a whole. But the way the Federal Reserve is constructed, you have these 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents, and they can very much come to the FOMC meetings and reflect what's going on in their regions. So the regional views and what's happening in the various regions do get very reflected in those monetary policy discussions and the decision-making.\n\nNow in terms of New Jersey, growing a little bit more slowly than the national average, I think that's part of a much broader story, which is the migration of people from the Northeast and Midwest to the South and West that's been going on for 30 years. Population growth in New Jersey is well below the national average, and that's really probably the primary driver of the fact that the growth rate in New Jersey is going to be a little bit weaker than the country as a whole.\n\nEugene White:\n\nOne of the things I think in terms of the Fed that people aren't aware, they might think that this is all self-chosen by bankers, and so forth. But really the Board of Directors is a very diverse group, right?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes, it is a very diverse group, and in fact, the bankers\u2014so the Federal Reserve Act sets a mandate of we have to have a board of directors, and the board of directors consists of three groups. There's the Class A directors, which are the bankers\u2014three of them. There's the Class B directors that are supposed to represent commerce. And the Class C directors that represent I think the community sort of broadly. The Class A directors, the bankers, they have no part in the selection process for the President of the Federal Reserve banks, which I think is a good thing. So, it makes it very clear that we're here to represent Main Street, not represent Wall Street.\n\nI've announced that I'm going to be stepping down sometime late spring, early summer. So we have a search committee composed of four members of the Board of Directors, excluding the bank directors, and they begin the process of a search for my successor.\n\nEugene White:\n\nSo, yesterday, bitcoin topped $10,000. How does the use of digital currencies impact monetary policy, and should the Fed play a greater role in adopting digital currencies to the payment system?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nRight now, bitcoin is tiny relative to the amount of payment transactions that are executed in the United States. It's essentially trivial in the broad scheme of things. But there are some aspects of bitcoin that are quite interesting. So like the ledger, you know, blockchain ledger technology is something that we think actually could be used in other applications.\n\nI think at this point it's really very premature to be talking about the Federal Reserve offering digital currencies, but it is something we are starting to think about. So, what would it mean to have a digital currency? How would we offer it? Do we actually need it? I think that in terms of bitcoin, I would be pretty cautionary about it. I think that it's not a stable store of value. It doesn't really have the characteristics you would like to have of a currency or a payment medium. It's not a stable store of value. The price goes up and down very sharply. And it's not legal tender. So someone doesn't actually have to accept bitcoin for your transaction. If I go in the store with dollars, or currencies, people actually have to accept my currency and make that transaction. So, I think that I would be, at this point, pretty skeptical of bitcoin. I think it's really more of a speculative activity at this point.\n\nEugene White:\n\nAlthough some central banks have moved ahead of the digital front. Sweden, for example, pushing very hard.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes, Sweden is an interesting case. Sweden, the use of cash is much less than in the United States, so that makes digital currency more easy to migrate to. Also more people are participating in the banking system. One of the challenges for the U.S. to move to a digital currency that a central bank offered is a lot of people are not really actually plugged into the banking system.\n\nSo, you'd have to have a system in place that actually brings those people that are currently unbanked into the financial system. To really have an effective digital currency in the U.S., we have to overcome that challenge.\n\nEugene White:\n\nYou mentioned about the income distribution. We know that in the U.S. that income distribution, we've had vast growth but it hasn't benefited everyone. Is there anything in monetary or perhaps banking policy that the Fed could do to perhaps improve the performance?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, monetary policy is a pretty blunt tool in terms of its ability to affect income distribution. But there are parts of banking regulation that do relate to income distribution, the Community Reinvestment Act basically says that you have to actually supply credit to disadvantaged neighborhoods. You can't discriminate based on location. So there are things in banking regulation that can actually help make sure that credit is flowing freely to areas that maybe otherwise would not get those funds.\n\nI think that the issue of income distribution, income mobility, I don't think we can do much directly in terms of our policy tools, in terms of monetary policy. But I think we can do a lot from the bully pulpit, basically put attention on this issue, underscore how important it is, and talk about things that we can do address it. Educational opportunity, workforce development, job retraining, the ability to actually have the ability to move from the inner city to where the jobs are. Because a lot of times we see, when we're traveling around the region, we see people in the inner cities actually can't literally get to where the jobs are because there's not appropriate transportation networks.\n\nChildcare is another issue. People have trouble holding down a job if they have a young child. Who's going to take care of their child during the day? And how do the economics of that work, if they're not making a very good salary? So I think there's a lot of issues. I think it's really an important issue for us to solve as the country because if you don't have a sense that wherever you're born, you have sort of a roughly similar opportunity to succeed based on your work effort, you don't really have a fair country, in some fundamental sense.\n\nRaj Chetty is a researcher who's done some terrific work on this issue and the work that he's done basically shows that where you're born, where you live geographically affects your future prospects. That is really quite disturbing. That means it's not about the person, it's about literally the luck of the draw of where they were born and raised. And so that shows that we have a lot of work to do on this front.\n\nEugene White:\n\nAnd in fact, mobility in the U.S. has actually declined. Interstate mobility has declined significantly.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nExactly.\n\nEugene White:\n\nLet me ask you a question, which is more about something which is within the Fed's compass of authority. What do you think the biggest risks to financial stability currently are, and where the next crisis\u2014well, hard to ask the question\u2014where the next crisis might originate? But suppose there were another failure on the order of Lehman Brothers. Are you concerned about the limitations that have been imposed on the Fed in terms of emergency lending?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLet's have first with the issue of financial stability, how worried am I about it today? It's true that financial markets are pretty buoyant, and so that's raised the question, how concerned should we be about that? I would say at this point, I would say not that concerned, and the reason for that is that the markets I think really reflect the state of the economy. The economy's doing very well, it's been very stable. The economy has been growing 2, 2.5% a year consistently.\n\nWe're at a very low unemployment rate, 4.1%, and it looks like the expansion has got lots of room to go. There are not a lot of excesses in the economy. The credit growth is growing only slowly. Households seem to be in good shape, businesses are starting to ramp up their investment.\n\nSo, it seems to me like we actually have a very good prospects for this expansion to continue for quite some time. So, the financial markets in my mind sort of reflect that. If the financial markets were behaving in a way totally disjointed from how the economy is performing, I'd be a lot more worried.\n\nThe second reason I'm not so worried is that I think the banking system and the financial system is a lot more robust to stress today than it was 10 years ago. So banks have a lot more capital and have a lot more liquidity. There's a lot less leverage in the system. There's a lot less maturity transformation where people are borrowing short and lending long. And so that means even if markets were to go down, if the market prices were to go down, I think the financial system could bear that stress much, much better today than 10 years ago.\n\nThe issue that I'm actually a little bit worried about that no one else seems to be worried about is really the issue of fiscal sustainability. The budget deficit last year was 3.5% of GDP. In 2007, the budget deficit was 1.1% of GDP roughly at the same point in the economic cycle. So we're pretty deep into this economic cycle, and we still have a sizeable budget deficit, and we have a baby boom generation that's just about to retire, driving up costs for Medicare and Social Security.\n\nOn top of that, interest rates, the Federal Reserve is gradually normalizing interest rates, raising interest rates. So debt service costs, which have been very, very subdued due to the low level of interest rates over the last 10 years, those are also going to be going up. I'm a little surprised that financial markets aren't at all concerned about the sustainability of our fiscal position. I think that's something that people should be more focused on.\n\nEugene White:\n\nSince you brought up fiscal questions, I have to ask, since we have a tax package going through, and there's a partial rollback with the mortgage interest deduction, do you think that would have any effect perhaps on booming house prices? If that was rolled back?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think to the extent that\u2014in terms of the provisions that I see in the two tax bills in the House and the Senate, there could be some downward pressure on high-end housing, but the mortgage interest deductibility I think is going to be retained for about half a million dollars. So that means that for most homes, in most areas, I don't think that you're going to have a big consequence.\n\nI would hesitate to say, get too concerned about the fact that very high-end houses could go down in price a little bit. I think the economy can manage that just fine.\n\nEugene White:\n\nI know you have a busy schedule, but I'd like to take a few questions from the audience, if that's all right?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI was really struck that after a report by the U.S. Treasury in June about financial reform for depository institutions, which really started out with the idea that the principle elements of Dodd-Frank and Basel III, et cetera, should probably stay in place? That both Chair Yellen and you have given very important speeches that have talked about the importance of preserving that basic structure.\n\nAre there particular things that concern you in the environment that led both you and the Chair to speak about this?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think the concern on my part, and I think Chair Yellen can of course speak for herself, is that if you open up the Dodd-Frank Act, make sure you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nThere's elements of the Act that I think are very, very important in making the financial system more strong and stable and resilient. Capital and liquidity for banks, especially large systemically important banks, the ability to have a resolution regime in place where you can actually liquidate a large financial institution that gets under stress; the ability to clear derivatives centrally through central counterparties, and make sure that you can actually then have the ability to examine those central counterparties, and make sure that they're well-run and operated.\n\nSo, as long as you keep those major pieces in place, then I think you can make some minor adjustments to the Dodd-Frank Act. Things that I've talked about and I think other people at the Fed have talked about these same things is relief for smaller banking institutions because smaller banks, if they fail, it's not going to be systemic, it's not going to threaten the viability of the financial system.\n\nThe Volcker Rule probably could be implemented in a way that is less burdensome to banks, and maybe gives banks and securities firms a little bit more flexibility to intervene when prices go up sharply or down sharply, which is what you actually want them to do in financial markets.\n\nI think the news that we've seen in terms of financial reform actually seems to be pretty positive. It's really more of about doing some changes at the margins as opposed to wholesale changes that would really dismantle Dodd-Frank.\n\nI think we really do remember the financial crisis, still, thank God. It was the worst financial crisis that we've had since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate soared, millions of people lost their homes. That's why we got the Dodd-Frank Act. We just have to remember that we need to have a financial system that's strong and resilient, and that the Dodd-Frank Act helps us achieve that goal.\n\nEugene White:\n\nQuestions? Yes?\n\nAudience Member:\nYes, I want to know how did working for Goldman Sachs impact your outlook as the President?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don't think it was the fact that I sort of worked for an investment bank that was important. I think it was more important what I did in the investment bank. I was in the economic research department, and I was basically someone who basically supported the trading functions of the bank. And that was valuable to me when I came to the Fed because it allowed me to learn a lot about how markets actually work, how markets actually function.\n\nAnd we got deep into the financial crisis. What we saw is the financial markets started to not work well. People lost confidence, they lost trust. They started to disengage, and so my experience at Goldman Sachs, I think, actually helped me understand what was going wrong and then maybe how to address it.\n\nSo, in the fall of 2008, we introduced a number of very special liquidity facilities, things that we'd never done before, and I think my experience at Goldman and my understanding of how markets work, and my ability to reach out to people that I knew in the marketplace to talk to them, like what's going on?, and understand what they were saying to me, probably helped me.\n\nYou want to have\u2014we're having a lot of transition at the Federal Reserve right now, and people ask me the question of, \u201cWhat do you want with the Fed?\u201d I think you want diversity. Diversity, I'm not just talking about diversity of gender and ethnicity but I'm also talking about diversity of background. So you don't want everyone to be a PhD economist from academia. You don't want everyone to be a markets person from Goldman Sachs. You want to have a mix because those different perspectives, when blended together, can lead to better policy outcomes.\n\nEugene White:\n\nSomeone else? This is a quiet audience. Yes?\n\nAudience Member:\nI had a question. You mentioned that you wanted diversity, both through academics and bankers. The new Fed Chairman-elect Jerome Powell, he doesn\u2019t have an academic background. He's more of a Wall Street kind of guy. Do you think that's going to have an impact on his term looking at the Fed?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think Jay's going to do very well. The thing that you really want I think as a Fed Chair\u2014I don't think an Economic PhD is required. There are plenty of PhD economists within the Federal Reserve system. The Chair does not have to have a PhD in Economics.\n\nWhat you want is someone who's smart\u2014which he is. You want someone who actually works hard\u2014which he does. And you want someone who's not an ideologue. And the reason why I say not an ideologue, because you don't want people to think that they're so convinced that they know how the world works, that they ignore the evidence that contradicts that. And Jay is not an ideologue. So I think he's a fine choice to lead the Fed. I'm not concerned about it in the least.\n\nEugene White:\n\nOne more question, or two more? Certainly, yes?\n\nAudience Member:\nYou mentioned a lot of things to address income mobility, but I'm wondering where you see the role of community banks going forward? Back in the day, they were very important. But now we have a sort of new different kind of large bank system. Do you see community banks still playing a role in that mobility?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think community banks play a hugely important role. We basically still have about 7,000 banks in the United States. And only about five or six of them are really, really large.\n\nSo, community banks play a unique role because I think they basically are much closer to their customers than large banks are. And so they play a particularly important role in local communities in terms of supplying credit to small businesses and to other customers where they know more about the customer. And so they can actually make more nuanced credit-lending decisions.\n\nSo, I think they're really important. They also play a very important role in community, in supporting the community. So, I'm a big fan of community banks. I mean my great-grandfather was a community banker, actually, in Sylvania, Ohio.\n\nI remember when I was young, I got shown his bank book during the Great Depression, and the bank book had a lot of debits, and these were debits where he was basically putting money into the bank to keep the bank alive during the Great Depression, and the bank did actually make it through the Great Depression.\n\nAnd so I'm very much a supporter of community banks. I think they perform a very important role. Which is why we want to have a regulatory regime that suits, not just the big banks, but also is appropriate for the small banks. We need to have a regulatory regime that's proportioned to the risks that the institution poses to the financial system and the role that the institutions play supplying credit, especially to small businesses and households where I think community banks play a very particularly important role.\n\nEugene White:\n\nWe have time for one more question?\n\nAudience Member:\nTo follow up on that then, could you comment on the role of fintech lenders vis-a-vis community banks?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, fintech lending I think is still very much in its early days, early stages. This is like peer-to-peer lending. I think it's something that we are following quite closely. I think there's a couple of questions about it. One is how will it actually perform through the business cycle?\n\nSo, today, it's performing okay\u2014that doesn't really tell us that much because economic times are relatively good. So the real question is how it's going to perform through the business cycle. And the second question I think is going to be about regulation. Are there regulations that need to be put in place to make sure that they're on an equivalent playing field to lenders that are subject to bank regulations.\n\nSo, I think those are sort of the two questions on the table. I think we want to be careful not to just tamp down any innovation. I think we need to be open-minded to new innovations and developments that we see in the marketplace, but at the same time we don't want to necessarily sort of buy into them hook, line and sinker until we've actually seen that the business models are robust to the entire business cycle.\n\nEugene White:\n\nWell, thank you very much!\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes, thank you."

    "content": "Carla Hesse:\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful to see a sea of blue in this beautiful space here, and to be here for such a wonderful occasion. When we planned this event, I didn\u2019t think we realized we\u2019d be in such an exciting moment, but I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to be here to have a conversation with Bill Dudley, who graduated from Cal with his Ph.D. in 1982.\n\nI want to mention that he got an undergraduate degree from a very small liberal arts college, and that\u2019s meaningful because I think that the depth of having a liberal arts education underneath a very specialized advanced degree really helps people go to the distance in life, and to show the kind of leadership that Bill\u2019s career has exemplified.\n\nAt Berkeley, he studied with Professor James Pierce, who was a beloved professor, and who I didn\u2019t realize until tonight had launched him at the Fed for his first job, having gotten his Ph.D. He then went on to Goldman Sachs and then back to the Fed eventually, in 2009, where he succeeded Tim Geithner. And has been there until now, and now we\u2019re in a very exciting moment of wondering where he\u2019s going next.\n\nSo I\u2019d like to invite him up here and ask him a few questions, and then we\u2019re going to be sure to leave some time so that you can have at him too, because I\u2019m sure he has thoughts that you\u2019re curious to hear his views on.\n\nI thought we\u2019d just start with the elephant in the room. How disruptive do you think this transition event is going to be?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be disruptive. A couple of things I guess I would point out. First of all, so far so good. I mean the quality of the appointments has been excellent. Jay Powell is a really capable, good pair of hands. I think Janet\u2019s done a fabulous job, but if it wasn\u2019t going to be Janet, Jay\u2019s a really, really good choice to be the Chair of the Fed. And Randy Quarles, who has been appointed to be the Vice Chair of Supervision, is also extremely well qualified for his position. So, if things stay in that sort of vein, everything\u2019s going to be really great.\n\nThe second thing I would say is that it\u2019s a committee. When you think about monetary policy, you are really talking about, if you have a full complement, 19 participants on the Federal Open Market Committee. So it\u2019s also important to recognize that changing out one or two people like me isn\u2019t going to change what the committee thinks, because it is truly developing a consensus among the committee members that I think is important in terms of driving policy.\n\nAnother aspect of this is that the committee really is very united right now in terms of what the appropriate policy path is. So if you look at this summer when we announced that we\u2019re going to go and start to normalize the balance sheet, every participant on the FOMC subscribed to the principles of how to normalize the balance sheet over time. There weren\u2019t any dissents.\n\nSo you change out a few people, but I think the committee is really going to stay together.\n\nThe last thing I would just say\u2014two final things I would say on that point. One thing I think is really important is that the Fed\u2019s mission doesn\u2019t change. We have a mandate from Congress: maximum sustainable employment and price stability. So, whoever you are and whatever background you come from, when you come to the Board of Governors or you become a president of one of the Federal Reserve Banks and then serve on the FOMC, your mission is to try to achieve those dual-mandate objectives. It\u2019s not like you can just go off and do something totally different. That mandate doesn\u2019t change.\n\nAnd then finally, it\u2019s not just about the principals. People put so much focus on the Chair and the Vice Chair. The Federal Reserve has thousands of really qualified professionals working every day to help make the people at the top well informed and to help in their decision-making. And all those people are still going to be there, they\u2019re still going to be working really hard.\n\nSo I think people\u2014when you watch the movie \u201cToo Big To Fail,\u201d there\u2019s no staff in the movie. There\u2019s the Bernanke character, the Geithner character, the Paulson character around a table. That is not how policy is made. There\u2019s just hundreds of people involved in thinking about what\u2019s happening in the economy, what\u2019s happening in financial markets. Thinking about various options of how you might respond. And that\u2019s also true in the monetary policy realm.\n\nThe staff is still going to be there, they\u2019re still highly qualified and very much committed to the mission. So, I\u2019m really not worried at all.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nThat\u2019s great. We\u2019re all happy to hear that, I\u2019m sure. So, what I thought we\u2019d do is start with some broad questions, and then we\u2019ll hone in and get a little more insider baseball.\n\nThe first question I wanted to ask you was about your views of the Trump Administration\u2019s policies that are making it more difficult to secure H-1B visas and to limit legal immigration from several countries. Now, what impact do you think this will have on the United States economy, and what immigration policies should the United States have in place?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, we are completely apolitical, so I don\u2019t have any views on any policies of the Trump Administration. That said, I think that when you educate people in the United States, you\u2019re developing a lot of human capital, and I think it\u2019s really logical that you\u2019d want to have that kind of capital stay here in the United States.\n\nI mean, the spots at our leading universities\u2014there are not that many spots. So, if you look at the economics program at Berkeley\u2014when I went there, there were about 30 Ph.D. candidates per class. And about maybe half of them actually finished and got their Ph.D.\u2019s. So, in my class, maybe 15 people actually got Ph.D.\u2019s. Those are pretty scarce resources. If you\u2019re going to educate someone to get a Ph.D. in the United States, wouldn\u2019t it be better to try to encourage that person to stay in the United States and take advantage of that human capital that you poured all these resources into to develop?\n\nI don\u2019t think you want to go quite so far and say if you get a Ph.D., you automatically get to stay in the United States, because obviously you do want to have secure borders. And you do care about any people who might have bad intent with respect to the U.S. So you certainly have to do the appropriate background checks, and things of that sort.\n\nBut I think the presumption should be more the default that if you do get a Ph.D. in the United States, the presumption is that you get to stay as opposed to that you have to leave. That\u2019s just good public policy, in my view.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nYes, I mean you might be interested to know that the Berkeley Economics Department now graduates over a thousand BA\u2019s a year.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI know it\u2019s a very big\u2014I actually spoke to the undergraduates a number of years ago. And it\u2019s done in the stadium now.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nThere are five top-ranked programs in the country, but what really differentiates Berkeley is this incredible multiplier effect of the education that delivers at that very high level. It is a lot of human capital, and precious. So, staying with this sort of broader vein for a minute, I thought we\u2019d ask a little bit about globalization, and what you see are the benefits and risks of globalization, trade, and increased competition.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, we could be here for several hours to really answer that question with any detail. Look, I think first of all, we have to recognize that globalization has had huge benefits for the world. I mean, literally, hundreds of millions of people have been wrested out of poverty over the last couple of decades. So that\u2019s number one. That\u2019s probably a good thing, net-net.\n\nNumber two, I think you have to recognize that globalization has benefits but it also has costs. The benefits for the U.S. have been low-cost goods and services from the rest of the world. But some of the costs in are the adjustment process that has to occur when businesses that were sheltered from competition are no longer sheltered from competition, and therefore have trouble actually carrying on.\n\nI think the big mistake is to think that putting up trade barriers is going to somehow make you better off. I do not believe that putting up trade barriers will make you better off. I think what it will do is it will force you to produce things that you are less good at producing. It will also risk the retaliation by those who you put the trade barriers up to, which will probably make you both worse off.\n\nIn terms of the whole debate about the benefits and costs of globalization, I think what we should be focused on is how to reduce the adjustment cost to those that are hurt by globalization, or by technological change.\n\nFor all the talk we have about globalization, I think technological change is probably actually more important in terms of the amount of stress it puts on certain segments of our citizenry. And I think we legitimately need to do a better job of helping those people adjust, rather than just saying, \u201cWell, too bad, tough luck. Your plant closed down, you\u2019re living in a small rural community, you don\u2019t have many prospects for employment, and that\u2019s just too bad.\u201d\n\nSo I think that we need to temper the sharp edge of capitalism at times, and that means workforce development, job retraining, trade assistance adjustment. We could do a lot more on that front, and if we did that, I think there\u2019d be more acceptance of the benefits of globalization and of free trade, and then you\u2019d have a stronger political consensus for the regime in which we have operated for the last few decades.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nOne more question in this vein of global dynamics and their relationship to the economy. What do you think about the role of U.S. monetary policy in the global setting and its effect on the rest of the world? Is there a need for, in a similar vein, greater coordination between U.S. monetary policy and\u2026?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, there is certainly a need for good communication. I go to Basel, Switzerland five times a year, at least. Basel is where all the central bankers get together to talk about the economy, and monetary policy, and regulatory policy. And that\u2019s actually a really important venue because you get to know your counterparts. So, if you\u2019re in the middle of a financial crisis, and you pick up the phone to speak to someone, you actually know who\u2019s on the other end, and you actually have built up some trust and a relationship with them. So that\u2019s really important.\n\nI think that it\u2019s important to communicate well and clearly. It\u2019s important to have those personal connections. In the middle of the financial crisis, when we were negotiating the foreign exchange swap lines with my counterparts at the ECB, the Bank of Japan, and a number of other central banks\u2014having met the people and having interacted with them on many occasions made it much easier to get to a good place. So it\u2019s really important to have those personal relationships.\n\nIn terms of coordination, I think there\u2019s a limit to how far you can go, though. The mandate that\u2019s set for the Federal Reserve on monetary policy by Congress is about maximum sustainable employment in the U.S. and price stability for the U.S. It says nothing about the rest of the world. So you have to recognize that the monetary policy that we pick here is the policy that we think is best for us.\n\nThat said, if we do the monetary policy well and we communicate well, we can also minimize the disruption to everybody else.\n\nSo, a good example is to compare and contrast the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d in 2013 and 2014 with the balance sheet normalization process this year. When we rolled out the balance sheet normalization process, we were very, very, very cautious in terms of how we communicated and how we actually implemented the program.\n\nWe started to talk about what we were thinking about long before we actually enacted the program, and then when we actually pulled the trigger and said we\u2019re going to enact the program starting in October, it was a program that built very, very gradually. And it won\u2019t be fully in place for another year.\n\nAnd so, there were no big surprises. And I think that was very, very helpful in making it so the markets adjusted to this change in policy very smoothly.\n\nSo we learned some lessons from the taper tantrum. I think communicating clearly, foreshadowing what you\u2019re going to do, explaining why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing, I think can not only be helpful to the U.S. and U.S. financial markets, it can also be helpful to the rest of the world.\n\nClearly, U.S. monetary policy is important for the rest of the world. What we do in the United States does affect financial markets all over the world. And we want to have financial markets globally that behave more well than badly, and to the extent that we can communicate clearly so that the adjustment process is smooth, I think that\u2019s good for everybody.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nSo, let\u2019s move onto the regulatory environment. You had the coverage in the Times, you\u2019ve expressed some views on this, and maybe this will be an opportunity to elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s been covered already in the Times. Let me just start with asking you about how you view the unfolding of the Dodd-Frank Act. We all know that in response to the recession and financial crisis, Congress enacted much greater regulation in the financial industry. Recently, there have been calls to reassess that decision, and particularly to reassess and maybe even repeal the Dodd-Frank Act\u2014or at least modify it in some form. How effective do you think Dodd-Frank has been, and can it be improved? Should it be reformed? Or is repeal a justified decision?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, and go back to the regime that we had in place prior to the financial crisis. I think we learned a lot during the financial crisis about a lot of inadequacies within our financial system. Banks didn\u2019t have enough capital, they didn\u2019t have enough liquidity. A lot of over-the-counter derivatives were cleared bilaterally, which created a huge mess when firms actually got into difficulty. We didn\u2019t have particularly good oversight of the major financial market utilities. So large, systemically important firms weren\u2019t required to have higher levels of capital and liquidity available to smaller firms.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot of really good things in the Dodd-Frank Act. Title II basically provides a mechanism though which you can actually resolve a large, systemically important firm, probably in a way that wouldn\u2019t necessarily threaten to take down the entire financial system. I think there\u2019s a lot more good than bad in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThat said, could it be improved? Yes, I think it could be improved. I\u2019ve been on record saying very clearly that I think that some relief for smaller banking organizations probably makes sense, because small banking organizations are not systemic. A failure of a small banking firm is not going to threaten to take down the entire financial system. So, differentiating between how you regulate large institutions and small institutions I think makes a lot of sense.\n\nAnother change is the Volcker rule. The Volcker rule, as it has been implemented, has a pretty heavy hand of regulatory compliance to it. You could probably get most of the benefits of the Volcker rule with a lot less cost. But it\u2019s important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think that capital liquidity requirements do need to be higher on a permanent basis for large, systemically important institutions.\n\nI do believe that the central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives transactions actually reduces risk in the financial system. I think it\u2019s important to have a viable resolution regime so you actually can resolve a firm or allow a firm to fail without necessarily taking down the rest of the financial system.\n\nI hope in my lifetime we will never have to have the kind of interventions that we had in 2008, with Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG. Those are not interventions that were politically popular. They weren\u2019t interventions that were comfortable to do. But it was really a question\u2014I really viewed that officials that were making those decisions had a Hobson\u2019s choice, and the Hobson\u2019s choice was to rescue the firms to prevent violent failure or let the financial system collapse.\n\nAnd I think they made the right choice in preventing the violent failure of some of the major financial firms. Because I think if we hadn\u2019t done that rescue, I think we would probably have had a Great Depression.\n\nSo I think the right choices were made. They just weren\u2019t pleasant choices. You need the Dodd-Frank Act to never get to that situation again, where we\u2019re forced to make such difficult choices. So hopefully, in my lifetime, we\u2019re never going to see anything like this again.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nOne of the big concerns that is lingering from the way the economy has emerged from the Great Recession has to do with the labor market and employment. And even though the country is now approaching low\u2014record low\u2014unemployment rates, we haven\u2019t seen wages bounce back and improve at the same rate that one might expect if you were really in a full recovery.\n\nYou touched on this a little bit earlier, but maybe you could amplify a little bit more on how much you would see that as a consequence of globalization and the way in which it\u2019s affecting wage deflation in the United States, or changes in the structure of labor markets nationally. And where are we with discussion of the sharing economy? And we\u2019ll continue to talk a little bit more in the next question, too, about inequality in a growing economy.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, the unemployment rate right now is 4.1%, which is a low unemployment rate relative to what we\u2019ve had historically. We think it\u2019s pretty much at full employment. And what we mean by that is the level of unemployment where if you go any lower, you\u2019re actually going to have, over time, an inflation problem.\n\nBut we don\u2019t really know precisely where full employment is. So, if inflation doesn\u2019t go up, sitting at a 4.1% unemployment rate, that means that you can actually let the unemployment rate go lower still.\n\nA lot of people are sort of wringing their hands about, gee, where\u2019s the inflation? We\u2019re at a 4.1% unemployment rate and there\u2019s no inflation. That\u2019s not actually a bad thing. It actually is a pretty good thing, because it means that you should be able to probe, and go to an even lower unemployment rate, which is actually a good thing for all those people that could actually be employed and have jobs and develop skills and grow their human capital.\n\nSo, I\u2019m not particularly concerned about the fact that inflation\u2019s a little bit lower than our target. I don\u2019t really completely understand why inflation is as low as it is right now. We would have thought that at this unemployment rate, we would be seeing more pressure on wages, and that that would be ultimately filtering into prices. It may just be that it takes some time\u2014that you have to be at this unemployment rate for six months or a year or two years to actually see the consequences for wages and prices. But it\u2019s not a bad place to be.\n\nI mean if you told me that you have to live in a world where the unemployment rate is 4.1% and inflation is about 1.5%, and you have to stay there for eternity\u2014most central bankers would say \u201csign me up.\u201d So, it\u2019s important not to overstate the degree of the problem.\n\nI think what\u2019s going to happen is that the economy is going to continue to grow at an above-trend pace. I think that\u2019s going to continue to gradually tighten the labor market further. I think as that happens, we\u2019ll see a little bit more wage inflation, and as that occurs, that will eventually filter into prices.\n\nWhen you look at\u2014people talk about the so-called Phillips Curve. The Phillips Curve is the relationship between wage inflation and the unemployment rate. People saying, well, there\u2019s no wage inflation, therefore the Phillips Curve doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t agree with that. If you look at the economy, instead of looking at the economy on a national basis, if you look at state by state, and you look at those states with a lower unemployment rate, you actually tend to have a higher wage inflation in those states with lower unemployment rates. So that\u2019s suggesting the Phillips Curve is alive and well, it\u2019s just not visible yet on a national basis.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nYou\u2019re not overly worried about what many, many economists\u2014including some of the most notable ones at Berkeley\u2014are worrying a lot about, which is growing inequality?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I am worried about that. In fact, what I\u2019m worried about\u2014 so, people having jobs doesn\u2019t mean they necessarily have good jobs. That\u2019s problem number one. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve and monetary policy can\u2019t do that much about income inequality and can\u2019t do much about income mobility, because monetary policy is really about the business cycle and trying to keep the economy at full utilization of resources.\n\nObviously, if we keep the economy operating at a full utilization of resources, that will help people\u2014because people will have jobs, and they\u2019ll develop skills, and they\u2019ll grow their human capital. But monetary policy is pretty limited on this particular front.\n\nI personally think that people talk a lot about income inequality. I actually think the bigger issue in the country is income mobility. The work that Raj Chetty and others have done basically shows that where you are born affects your lifetime earnings. Not what your family\u2019s background is\u2014literally, where you live as a child. That\u2019s pretty damning. That actually seems fundamentally unfair.\n\nSo, I think there\u2019s a lot of work we need to do to try to address creating greater opportunities for people regardless of where they\u2019re born, who they\u2019re born to, did their parents go to college, did their parents not go to college, were they born in the rural South, were they born in New York City. I mean, the differences are quite vast, and they don\u2019t have anything to do with the endowment of the individual. They have to do with the native environment\u2014where they were brought up. And I think that really tells you that we have a lot of work to do on this front.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve been talking about this and I think the Federal Reserve is paying a lot of attention to this. We have a research institute at the Minneapolis Fed that\u2019s looking at this issue very closely. And we in the New York Fed very much support that work. I think it\u2019s hugely important. I mean, the whole American dream is based on the idea that anyone can be very successful if they really apply themselves. We\u2019ve got to make that true\u2014in fact, not just in theory.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nAnd so, the issue of low interest rates you don\u2019t think intersects in any meaningful way, at least for people who rely on, for example, fixed incomes, or the elderly who are relying on pensions?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell\u2014look, my mom is 94 years old, and she would like to have higher interest rates. But, the reality is that our job is maximum sustainable employment and price stability, and at the end of the day, I think that the country as a whole is better off having an easier monetary policy and a lower unemployment rate. I think that\u2019s more consistent with our mission over time than to have interest rates somewhat higher today, and unemployment higher, because that will probably lead to lower interest rates in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s not interest rates at a particular point in time. It\u2019s interest rates over years and years and decades and decades. And I think the best way you can have the highest sustainable level of interest rates is to get the economy to full employment. And that\u2019s really been what our goal has been over the last seven or eight years. And we\u2019re finally in the vicinity of full employment. As a consequence of that, we\u2019re gradually now removing monetary policy accommodation, and interest rates are going up.\n\nIt\u2019d be really sad to tell people, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but I\u2019m keeping you unemployed for a while longer because we need to have higher interest rates for savers.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that that would feel right. It certainly doesn\u2019t feel right to me.\n\nSo, my mom has had to do without. She\u2019s doing fine. And I just think that\u2019s\u2014and the mandate that Congress has given the Fed\u2014it\u2019s maximum sustainable employment and price stability, and so we\u2019re following the monetary policy designed to best achieve that mandate.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nAnd so you don\u2019t worry, like some people\u2014let\u2019s say Ben Bernanke\u2014about interest rates falling so low that it leaves us with very little room to maneuver?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nNo, I do worry about that. I mean, this is the issue of let\u2019s imagine that interest rates this cycle peak at a relatively low level, 4 or 5%. That would mean that in the next recession, the Federal Reserve wouldn\u2019t have that much room to reduce interest rates before you got back to zero. And the issue there then is, OK, what would monetary policy do at that point? Would you have the tools in place to actually lift the economy out of recession?\n\nAnd that\u2019s a legitimate issue. But two things I would say about that. Number one, we have a better toolset today to deal with the zero lower bound for interest rates than we did 10 years ago. We actually learned a bunch of things through this last episode\u2014forward guidance, large-scale asset purchases, open-ended large-scale asset purchases until our goals were actually achieved\u2014which means that the toolset is actually quite a bit better now than it was before.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if monetary policy has to do all of the lifting. You can imagine the next recession, fiscal policy can also provide supports to the economy if you\u2019re trapped at the zero lower bound for interest rates.\n\nI think that\u2019s a real issue. How big an issue it is at this point, I think it\u2019s really too early to say. We\u2019ve only had one episode in history of being trapped at the zero lower bound for interest rates. How often this is going to happen in the future, I think it\u2019s really, really too soon to say.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nI\u2019m going to ask you one more question, then we\u2019re going to open it up, and it\u2019s a big question. I\u2019m going to ask you to be brief in your response to it. But it\u2019s such an important one, and I\u2019d really be curious to have your thoughts about it. What do you think the work of the Fed in the last decade has had an impact on in the culture and ethics of the business community, the financial community in general? And how do you assess the state of things now? Do you think that there\u2019s been a taking in of some of the more\u2014let\u2019s call them ethical or cultural questions\u2014that were raised by the financial crisis?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I think there was a lot of bad behavior in the financial industry in the run-up to the financial crisis, and even in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The classic example I always use is the LIBOR issue, where people were calling up their treasury functions and saying, \u201cCould you change the bid that you submit for your LIBOR submission because that will benefit me in terms of the trading positions I have outstanding?\u201d\n\nCompletely illegal, unethical, should never have happened. The treasury function should have said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do this.\u201d They should have reported the person to compliance. Compliance should have done an investigation. The traders should have been fired. That\u2019s how it should have worked. It didn\u2019t work that way on all occasions.\n\nSo, clearly there\u2019s a lot of work to be done in the banking industry\u2014work on culture, in conduct, and in ethics issues. And this has been a priority for me to talk about this issue over the last number of years, and I think we\u2019ve actually had pretty good take-up from the banking industry, that they really do understand now that this is important for them. That if they don\u2019t address the culture and conduct issue, this could be potentially existential for them.\n\nBecause what\u2019s happened is, number one, the reputation of the industry has been really hurt, and so it makes it hard for them to attract people, good people, into the industry.\n\nWe had a conversation with a number of deans from business schools a couple of years ago, and a number of them said that they have a number of students that won\u2019t into the financial services industry because they don\u2019t view it as ethical enough. And that\u2019s not a really good self-selection process. So, if you\u2019re not getting the people that think ethics is important, you\u2019re only getting all the other people. That suggests that you have a lot of work to do. So I think that the banking industry now gets this\u2014I mean obviously to different degrees, at different institutions\u2014and I think they\u2019re working a lot harder on this issue.\n\nSo I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. I think we need to do more, though. I think there could be more industry-wide efforts, where banks actually have a valuation of their culture and ethics, a questionnaire that evaluates\u2014they all have the same questionnaire. They get each other\u2019s results anonymously, see how they are doing relative to their peer group, and learn where they actually need to improve.\n\nThis is being done in the U.K. There\u2019s a Banking Standards Board that\u2019s actually doing work on\u2014they actually have a questionnaire and they share the results, and it really allows you to sort of benchmark yourself, \u201cHow am I doing relative to others?\u201d\n\nWhat they\u2019ve also found is they are getting better, more honest answers. So on the same question asked through this questionnaire that\u2019s anonymous from the Banking Standards Board, they get slightly more pessimistic answers than when the bank has just done its internal engagement survey.\n\nSo I think that we made quite a bit of progress, but I think there\u2019s still more to do.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nI\u2019ll just circle back to the beginning, saying I think this is another area where educational institutions have to play a really big role. And one of the things that I\u2019m very proud of at Berkeley is the liberal arts foundation. Our business majors have to start in letters and science, and they get a very broad formation before they specialize in any particular technical area. And I just think that this is going to be the long-term solution.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nCan I add just one thing? One thing on that where I think academic institutions can do even better is to embed the ethics stuff in the course material for all the different subject matters. A lot of times the ethics course is off to the side. So, you take your finance, you take your marketing, and then over here is the ethics course. I think you really need that ethics material embedded in each course so that people can see some of the tricky decisions they might be faced with.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nI absolutely agree with that. In fact, I wrote a sentence just like that this morning to a member of our advisory board about the need to have very broad domain-specific ethics curriculum, whether it\u2019s in STEM or the sciences, where also so many important ethical questions are emerging.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou know, a lot of them are not black and white. A lot of them are gray. And so, to really draw them out by a particular example, where it\u2019s something that\u2019s not abstract, I think makes it much more real to people. Just to give you an example about how you can effect change: there\u2019s always an issue with cybersecurity and phishing. And one of the things that you want to do is sensitize people to phishing.\n\nSo one of the things we did at the New York Fed to sensitize people to phishing is I sent a message to everybody in the New York Fed, with a line in the message: \u201cNew York Fed restructuring.\u201d\n\nAnd so that really made people really curious. And so people went in to open the e-mail. And the e-mail had a lot of things that made it very clear that it wasn\u2019t from me. For example, in the e-mail my name was signed \u201cWilliam.\u201d I never sign my name \u201cWilliam\u201d in an e-mail. I always sign my name \u201cBill.\u201d And there was a bunch of other things. But a lot of people clicked through because they just couldn\u2019t help themselves to find out what was on the other side of the \u201cNew York Fed restructuring.\u201d And I think that was actually pretty effective at making people much more sensitized to the phishing. It\u2019s no longer abstract. It\u2019s something where they could actually see how they could get fooled.\n\nAnd so you\u2019ve got to get people engaged, where they internalize it. It\u2019s like the difference between taking a class and auditing a class. I audited statistics in graduate school at Berkeley. It was a prerequisite for econometrics. It was a disaster. I\u2019d nod my head through all of the audit, and then when it came down to when they handed out the final exam, and I had to ask myself to actually answer all these questions, I couldn\u2019t answer any questions. Because I wasn\u2019t being forced to actually internalize it by the problem sets, and all of the hard work that it takes to understand a subject like statistics.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nYes, learning by doing. OK, so now we\u2019re going to open it up, and I see this gentleman right here first. But just feel free to raise your hand. We don\u2019t have a roving mike, so if you can, speak up.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nAre you concerned that the increase in debt-to-GDP over the last 16 years in the U.S., but also in other developed economies, is potentially an enormous problem as rates start to go up? And how are we going to get out of that problem?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think that your question is well taken in the sense that right now, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is quite a bit higher than it was prior to the financial crisis, number one. Number two, our deficit is quite a bit higher now than it was at the same point in this business cycle during the last cycle. So, in 2007, our budget deficit was 1.1% of GDP. Last fiscal year, which ended September 30th, it\u2019s 3.5% of GDP.\n\nAnd the baby boom retirements and Medicare and Social Security are right ahead. And as you point out, interest rates are rising. So, debt-service costs, which had been held down by the low level of interest rates, are going to rise as we go forward.\n\nSo, this is an issue that is going to be a significant one at some point in time. It\u2019s really not a market focus at all right now. It\u2019s sort of surprising to me how relaxed the financial markets are about the whole issue of fiscal sustainability. It just doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue that people are concerned about. But ultimately, debt can\u2019t grow faster than GDP indefinitely. So, eventually, you\u2019re going to have to get on a more sustainable fiscal track. I have no idea when the market is really going to focus on that point, but it seems to me that that\u2019s something that\u2019s relevant, not just in the United States, but in a lot of other countries.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nCrypto-currencies: Is it a medium of exchange, is it a commodity, is it a roulette wheel, or is it a tool?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nTime will tell. I\u2019m not going to fixate too much about crypto-currencies, except to say that a good medium of exchange has stable store of value. And it\u2019s also widely accepted as a medium of exchange. I personally think the U.S. dollar has those attributes much more than the crypto-currencies that we see outstanding.\n\nI essentially feel like if the Federal Reserve does its job properly, and keeps inflation at a lowest sustainable level, confidence in the dollar as a currency will remain high. And the dollar will do just fine as a medium of exchange.\n\nIs there a possibility down the road that central banks will get more involved in offering digital currencies as a substitute for cash\u2014for the actual physical currency? I think that\u2019s something that could happen potentially down the road, and certainly central banks are thinking about that.\n\nSo what do digital currencies mean for\u2014would that be a more efficient medium of exchange than cash? With cash, there\u2019s danger that you could lose your cash. The cash could get stolen. So maybe there are other forms of currency that might be a better medium of exchange than cash. So I think that\u2019s something that central banks should be looking at. I think it\u2019s a legitimate question.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYou spoke of the ethical unease among students. Do you think any of that may be linked to the fact that there was not a single prosecution that arose out of the financial crisis? Do you think one day we may look back and rue that even more than perhaps some of us do now?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I don\u2019t have a good basis for judging what was actually possible in terms of successful prosecution. The problem, of course, is that doing dumb things is not against the law. Doing illegal things is, and so the question is where is that line between just doing dumb things versus doing illegal things.\n\nBut I think that people that have broken the law should be prosecuted and held to account. I absolutely agree with that. I\u2019m just not a lawyer, so I can\u2019t really make a good judgment about whether the judicial branch of our government could have been more effective in that realm. I just don\u2019t know enough to give you a really informed answer.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI\u2019m glad you brought up tech and disruption and potential massive unemployment due to tech disruption of the workforce. The response to this has been the idea of universal basic income. What is the feeling among policy makers of this concept, and what are your personal opinions on how it might affect both the country\u2019s economy and the world economy?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, before we get to the question of the basic income support, I\u2019m not that worried about technology eliminating all the jobs and us having no employment opportunity\u2014at least not in the near term. I mean, what percent of the U.S. workforce was in agriculture 100 years ago\u201470, 80% of the workforce?\n\nAnd now what percentage? It\u2019s 1 or 2% of the workforce. It seems to me that there\u2019s always new things that come along, new things for people to, new services to provide. So I\u2019m not convinced at all that we\u2019re on the cusp of this new thing. We\u2019ve been having this conversation about what\u2019s going to come next for several hundred years now. I\u2019m just not convinced that all of a sudden there\u2019s going to be no job opportunities for anyone.\n\nIf there aren\u2019t job opportunities, presumably it\u2019s going to be because we\u2019re just so incredibly productive and rich. And I suppose if we\u2019re really in that environment, where all the robots are doing everything, the robots are making more robots, which are making more robots, that we\u2019re going to actually have a pretty high standard of living.\n\nAnd so, I imagine in that regime we\u2019re probably going to be able to afford something like a minimum income support payment. Right now, to do it would be very, very expensive, and I\u2019m not really sure that people\u2019s satisfaction in life would necessarily be higher if they were given minimum income as a choice versus being forced to seek out employment opportunities.\n\nThey might in the short run think it\u2019s better to just take the income stipend, but I always wonder whether in the longer term, whether the quality of life and how they experience life would actually be better in that kind of regime.\n\nI think the big question, though, in the short run, is just the fiscal costs, which would be pretty large. This is being debated in some smaller European countries right now. I think that if it happens, they\u2019re certainly going to go first. I think the U.S. would be quite a bit further behind. And so I think for the people who decide to go down this path, we\u2019ll sort of see how it works, and then we\u2019ll learn more about how feasible this is in practice. And does it generate the quality of life that the people hope it will.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, that\u2019s what we really care about, right? It\u2019s people having a good quality of life. And it may be that having a stipend improves your quality of life. But it may be having a stipend doesn\u2019t improve your quality of life, because it makes your life empty and less fulfilling. So I think it\u2019s an experiment, and we\u2019re going to have to see.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nMy question is back on the fiscal side. This is of course an important month ahead of us, with regard to tax policy. So, it\u2019s sort of a two-part question: Do you see a need for tax stimulus to the economy at the present moment, and if you had your druthers and could design a tax policy that would encourage a healthy growth in the U.S. economy, what would be a couple of key features of it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI definitely am in favor of tax reform. I\u2019d love to see the tax code simplified. I\u2019d love to see the base broadened. I\u2019d love to see it much easier to comply.\n\nMy spouse does our tax returns every year. We don\u2019t send them out to an accountant or anybody. And I watch her slave through the tax returns, and I watch how much time it takes to do the tax return. That can\u2019t be efficient, it can\u2019t be productive. So I think a much simplified tax code with a broader tax base would be very, very desirable. And I think that also applies to the corporate taxes.\n\nSo I\u2019m definitely in favor of tax reform. I\u2019m not as in favor of tax stimulus at the current time because the economy, as your question implies, doesn\u2019t really need that. So the tricky part, though, is what\u2019s the trade-off between if I can get tax reform, but it requires a bit of fiscal stimulus to develop the consensus\u2014is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nSo I think that the devil is in the details. And so I think everybody has their own view. We\u2019ll see actually emerges from Congress. And everyone will have their own view about is that trade-off a good trade-off, or not a good trade-off, in terms of how much is done on the tax reform side versus how much is done on the fiscal stimulus side.\n\nFiscal stimulus\u2014we don\u2019t really need fiscal stimulus from an economic perspective. And as a question before came up, we do have to worry about the long-term fiscal sustainability of the U.S. But on the other hand, if there\u2019s a price to pay to get tax reform, maybe that price is worth paying. So I think you sort of have to judge the whole package and whether you think those trade-offs are appropriate or not.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nThis somewhat relates to the previous question. What is your view of the movement to increase the minimum wage or the living wage\u2014however one wants to define it\u2014versus unemployment, versus, I don\u2019t know, interest rates, whatever\u2014it\u2019s kind of a triumvirate of factors.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I\u2019ve been very clear for a long time in what I\u2019m for in the minimum wage. It\u2019s very simple. I want the minimum wage set as a ratio to the median wage. And none of this, minimum wage flat for X years, and then a debate about how big an increase are we going to have.\n\nIf you actually had a minimum wage indexed to some percentage of the median wage\u2014and what that percentage is a political decision that needs to be made by politicians\u2014then you actually would have better plans for businesses. They\u2019d know what the minimum wage was going to be over time\u2014it was going to be X percent of the median wage. And it would also be better for the minimum wage earners, because rather than have a period of fallowness, where minimum wage is stuck at a very low level for a long time, then all of a sudden the minimum wage goes up a lot, they\u2019d be compensated at a fairer proportion relative to the median wage.\n\nSo I think that\u2019d be a much better improvement in the regime. The problem with that proposal, of course, is the legislature gets to make that decision once. And that may make it hard for people to reach agreement. I think it\u2019s a political decision, where you set that minimum wage relative to the median wage. Different states could decide to set it at different attachment points. That\u2019s a political decision.\n\nCongress is not very good about equity. Congress is very good about efficiencies. Telling me that minimum wage should be 50% of the median wage or 45% of the median wage, or 60% of the median wage\u2014that\u2019s really a political decision. Congress isn\u2019t going to do very well at telling you one is better than the other.\n\nNow presumably, the higher the minimum wage is relative to the median wage, the more there\u2019s going to be a consequence in terms of unemployment. And so you\u2019re going to have to weigh how you\u2019re going to pay that cost in terms of unemployment for having a higher minimum wage.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be free. There\u2019s going to be a trade-off there, and you\u2019re going to have to decide where you want to set that trade-off. But indexing the minimum wage to the median seems to be a definite improvement over the current regime. Better for the minimum wage earner, and better for business in terms of planning what their costs are going to be over time. It seems to me that it\u2019s a win-win for both sides.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nBill, you\u2019ve done an amazing job. It\u2019s probably the system in terms of meeting the mandates of full employment and price stability. But if you were to step back as Berkeley economist and say what should the mandate be\u2014if you had a magic wand, what should the mandate be for the central bank?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI\u2019m not uncomfortable with the current mandate. I think the current mandate is completely reasonable. First of all, it doesn\u2019t really matter what I say. This is something for Congress to decide, and the Federal Reserve is supposed to carry out the mandate.\n\nSo first thing is, it really doesn\u2019t matter what I think. But I think the current mandate has been really good. You want a little bit of inflation in the system because that actually helps lubricate the wheels of the economy. It helps lead to more efficient allocation of labor resources, because otherwise you have less flexibility in the labor market.\n\nI think George Akerlof and others have done work showing that maybe about 2% inflation is probably better than zero percent inflation, just because it allocates labor resources more efficiently. You also want to have a little bit of inflation because you probably want to be a little bit off the\u2014you want to reduce the risk of the zero lower bound problem. So, I\u2019m very comfortable with 2% inflation as a target.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nWhat about the full employment?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don\u2019t think the two goals are inconsistent. I think if the Federal Reserve is doing their job properly, the two goals are actually compatible with one another. So if we go to maximum sustainable employment\u2014and the important word there is sustainable. Yes, you could drive the unemployment rate lower for a short period of time, but that would generate inflation, and then the Federal Reserve would have to slam on the brakes, and you\u2019d be worse off than if you actually stayed at a level of unemployment that was consistent with 2% inflation over time. I think the two goals are very compatible with one another. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge tension between those two goals."

    "title": "Remarks at The Evolving Structure of the U.S. Treasury Market: Third Annual Conference",
    "date": "Nov 28, 2017",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud171128",
    "content": "On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and our co-sponsors\u2014the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2014I would like to welcome you to this year\u2019s conference on the structure of the U.S. Treasury market.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThis is the third year the New York Fed has co-hosted the Treasury market structure conference, which provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the changing landscape of the Treasury market.  Many of you remember the market volatility of October 15, 2014, that precipitated the need for additional engagement between the private and public sectors about Treasury market structure.  The Joint Staff Report on the Treasury flash event, the Treasury Department\u2019s subsequent request for information, and the work that has followed identified a number of changes that have reshaped the Treasury market over the last decade.  These include the increased electronification of trading, the changing nature of intermediation and liquidity, and the entry of new market participants.  In light of these changes, the Joint Staff Report highlighted four important priority areas for additional work.  In taking these efforts forward, we have benefited from ongoing engagement with market participants and other members of the public. \n\nThe first priority is gatherings like this one, where both private and official sector participants come together to study and share views on what the market\u2019s evolution means for its structure and liquidity.  Understanding how the Treasury market is evolving can enable us to be good stewards of its trajectory.\n\nA second priority is improving the availability of data on activities in the cash market.  After the historic volatility that occurred on October 15, 2014, the official sector had limited access to transaction data.  This resulted in a months-long lag in the process to gather and analyze data from the event.  The introduction this year of transaction data reporting by broker-dealers to the official sector is thus a critical step forward.  While closing this data gap for the official sector is an important milestone, work remains to ensure that the scope of collection is sufficiently complete and dynamic to maintain coverage of relevant firms, as intermediaries and liquidity providers evolve.  One initiative in this direction is the Board of Governors\u2019 plan to collect transaction data from depository institutions. \n\nLooking ahead, I expect that a continuing priority will be increasing data transparency to all market participants and to the public in a manner that supports\u2014and does not harm\u2014market liquidity and integrity.  Part of the successful evolution of the modern Treasury market will be adapting to the data needs of its participants. I believe transaction data reporting to the public based on careful study will ensure that the Treasury market does not fall behind other markets, will promote a robust and level playing field, and will help safeguard the liquidity characteristics that make the Treasury market the benchmark for risk-free trading around the world.\n\nThe rise of electronic trading, another market feature highlighted in the Joint Staff Report, helped to identify a third priority area: the market practices and risks associated with the Treasury market.  Market infrastructure\u2014including the financing of Treasury transactions, as well as the clearing and settlement of those transactions\u2014seldom merits investor attention until an element that is vital to smooth functioning of the market goes awry.  The history of financial markets is filled with examples\u2014some recent\u2014in which confidence in trading collapsed after market participants no longer knew or could assess the underlying risk of market engagement, leading them to disengage.  While such disengagement may be rational from the perspective of an individual participant, it is destructive to the collective market function. \n\nA major infrastructure issue for the Treasury market has been the clearing and settlement practices of the cash market.  This can be opaque, with a majority of trades cleared away from central counterparties (CCPs).  While central clearing is more uniformly used in other segments of the Treasury market\u2014such as futures\u2014many market participants elect to clear and settle cash Treasury transactions in a bilateral fashion.  This process includes many market participants: trading venues, clearing agents, and clearing banks.  No single participant has a view of the entire clearing and settlement system.\n\nThe Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), a New York Fed-sponsored group of market professionals working to support the integrity and efficiency of the Treasury market, has concentrated its recent efforts on this topic.  Preliminary findings include an increasing volume of linked trades that clear centrally on one side and bilaterally on the other. This work has also uncovered information asymmetries in clearance and settlement risk management, which potentially could lead to a mispricing of these risks.  Moreover, increased understanding about the depth, breadth, and durability of credit arrangements that support clearance and settlement seems desirable.  This would improve market integrity through greater understanding of risk throughout the clearing and settlement process and how it is affected by different conditions.\n\nSince the financial crisis, there has been an effort to strengthen the resiliency of repo market infrastructure, which is another important element of Treasury market plumbing.  Immediately after the crisis, the Federal Reserve was active in pushing reform of the tri-party repo market, which had been a locus of stress in 2008.  More recently, Treasury repo markets have undergone further changes, including market adaptations to post-financial crisis regulations, and the introduction of multiple programs expanding access to central clearing to a wider range of market participants.  These markets also have been affected by efforts to set heightened expectations for CCPs with regard to liquidity risk management, margins, and governance and recovery planning.  This is consistent with the Treasury Department\u2019s recommendation that regulators ensure appropriate risk management at CCPs and other financial market infrastructures.  For example, earlier this month, the SEC approved the Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility\u2014a liquidity risk management tool for the DTCC\u2019s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC).  This tool helps to ensure that FICC will have sufficient liquidity to cover the default of a Government Securities Division member to which FICC has the largest exposure.  This development reflects another positive step toward a safer centrally cleared repo market, and aligns well with broader official sector efforts to maintain a well-functioning and robust Treasury repo market.\n\nFinally, the Joint Staff Report identified the importance of strong interagency monitoring of the Treasury market, in close collaboration with the public.  Judging by this gathering, the commitment to this task is strong\u2014which is good because many questions remain.  How can the Joint Member Staffs and private stakeholders best collaborate to ensure stability in the Treasury market as the market structure evolves and new technologies are applied?  How should practices and culture evolve accordingly?  Will new technology and automation in the marketplace introduce unexpected challenges or risks to Treasury market participants?  Are there opportunities to improve market transparency in a way that sheds light on risk issues that emerge as the market continues to evolve?  Are the regulatory requirements imposed upon the Treasury market appropriate in the current environment?  Has a competitive level playing field been maintained given the evolving structure?  And, are there any changes that could improve the functioning, efficiency and/or integrity of the Treasury market?\n\nAs I highlighted before, answering such questions well could require greater transparency.  It is important for officials and market participants to fully understand the range of market elements.  These include the relative size of transaction volumes by various players, the breadth and resiliency of platforms used to facilitate risk transfer, and the robustness of market infrastructure under contingent circumstances.  More broadly, interagency efforts and collaboration with the public to shed light on the evolving structure and its risks are critical to protecting Treasury market function and supporting investor confidence.  Because we benefit from the Treasury market being the deepest and most liquid market for government securities, complacency should not be an option.  We need to work together to ensure that the longstanding confidence in the Treasury market is sustained in the future.\n\nThis conference provides an excellent opportunity to continue this discussion and work on these issues.  Thank you for coming.  I look forward to today\u2019s dialogue and the ongoing engagement between the Joint Member Staffs and the public."

    "title": "Lessons from the Financial Crisis",
    "date": "Nov 6, 2017",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud171106",
    "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak again at the Economic Club of New York.  As we mark the tenth anniversary of the onset of the financial crisis, I would like to focus on some of the lessons we should draw from that harrowing experience, and the implications of those lessons for regulatory policy going forward.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe first lesson is that financial crises can have grave consequences\u2014for the economy and the nation\u2014that can linger for many years.  The toll from the financial crisis was severe, with nine million jobs lost and eight million housing foreclosures amid the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression.  Moreover, the road back has been long and slow.  Despite economic policies oriented toward supporting recovery, it has taken eight years to push the unemployment rate down to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s employment objective.  Other residual impacts include the large size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet; significantly higher public debt; and substantial damage to public trust in the nation\u2019s government and financial institutions.  \n\nThe second lesson follows from the first.  We need to ensure that we have a resilient financial system.  To that end, we must ensure that the safeguards put in place in response to the crisis are fully appreciated and respected.  But, it also means that we need to finish the job\u2014for example, by building out a fully workable regime for resolving a complex, global firm if one were to become insolvent.  We need to ensure that our financial system can continue to provide critical services not just during good times, but also during periods of stress. \n\nThese objectives are particularly relevant today, when reopening the Dodd-Frank Act and modifying our regulatory framework are under consideration.  While it is appropriate to evaluate adjustments that might improve our regulatory regime, it is critical that we do not forget the hard-learned lessons of the crisis and\u2014in the haste to reverse course\u2014undermine the robustness and resiliency of the financial system. \n\nThe U.S. Housing Market Boom and Bust\n\nAt the heart of the crisis was the U.S. housing boom and bust.  Between 1997 and 2006, U.S. home prices nearly doubled in real terms on a national basis.  Then, when the boom turned to bust, real home prices reversed course, declining by about 40 percent on a national basis, with larger price declines in several states.2   The magnitude of the national price declines was unprecedented during the postwar period.\n\nThe evolution of the financial crisis illustrates a number of key issues, including the potential hazards of financial innovation, the procyclicality of the financial system, and the importance of confidence in sustaining effective financial intermediation.\n\nThe housing boom resulted from several factors.  Innovations in subprime mortgage lending enabled moderate-income households to purchase homes with negligible down payments.  This led to an increase in the demand for housing, which helped push up home prices.  Home price appreciation masked the potential riskiness of such lending and, in turn, sustained the wisdom of the easier underwriting standards.  As long as home values were rising, subprime borrowers could either refinance their loans or sell their homes when the initial teaser rates expired.  Thus, losses on subprime and other mortgage lending were low, reinforcing the belief that such loans were \u201csafe.\u201d \n\nEasier mortgage underwriting practices were also supported by the ability of mortgage originators to pool their mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), transforming low-quality assets into triple-A-rated securities.  Investors, including banks, relied too heavily on credit ratings and didn\u2019t do sufficient due diligence on the underlying quality of the assets and the assumptions that underpinned the triple-A ratings.  Implicit in these ratings was the assumption that a large, national decline in home prices was extraordinarily unlikely. \n\nThe rise in home prices led to a surge in construction activity, which helped to sustain the housing boom for a time.  This effect was particularly powerful in states such as Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada.  Rising home prices also bolstered the economy by supporting consumption, as households monetized these gains by cash-out refinancings and home equity lines of credit. \n\nThe housing boom was also supported by an accompanying financial boom.  The financing activity associated with the surge in mortgage originations and securitizations pushed up the earnings of the major banking and securities firms.  These strong earnings created incentives to ease underwriting standards further. \n\nBut, as housing supply responded to the increase in home prices\u2014housing starts rose from a 1.5 million annual rate in mid-2000 to a 2.3 million annual rate in early 2006\u2014the positive feedback loop began to run in reverse.  Home prices began to soften, subprime borrowers found it more difficult to refinance, and mortgage loan defaults and delinquencies rose.  As the bust got underway in earnest, residential investment declined and consumer spending was undercut as home equity levels fell. \n\nThe housing boom and bust underscores several important lessons.  First, the financial sector is not only a very complex system, but also one that can be inherently unstable\u2014subject to excess, then sharp reversal.  This is especially the case when an important innovation occurs and market participants don\u2019t fully appreciate the powerful feedback loops that first sustain a boom and then contribute to a bust when the process runs in reverse.  This means that we as regulators must continually evaluate the financial system and monitor the landscape for new developments and innovations that, if taken too far, could lead to excess and put the system at risk. \n\nSecond, when there are potential excesses that could threaten financial stability, we should look to temper them.  For example, in the run-up to the financial crisis, macroprudential tools\u2014such as requiring larger down payments or more closely evaluating the incomes of borrowers\u2014could have been implemented to limit the demand for housing.  If such an approach were successful, home prices would not have risen so dramatically, and the subsequent bust would have been less severe.  Another approach would have required financial intermediaries to build stronger capital and liquidity buffers as protection against a housing bust and an economic downturn. \n\nPrior to the financial crisis, the conventional wisdom was that asset bubbles could not be identified in real time\u2014rather, they could only be cleaned up after they burst.  While there are significant challenges to identifying asset bubbles, it is clear that cleaning up only after they burst does not always work out well in practice. \n\nThird, we need to carefully monitor the incentives that govern the behavior of borrowers, savers, and financial intermediaries. \n\nDuring the crisis, some examples of bad incentives that sustained the boom included:\n\nCulmination of the Crisis\n\nOnce the housing bust got underway, stress on the financial system increased sharply as asset prices fell and bank earnings plunged.  In the spring of 2008, such pressures led to a forced sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase.  Later in the year, the government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship.  In September, Lehman Brothers failed.  And, a day later, AIG was rescued in order to protect the rest of the financial system against further losses and even broader contagion.  With confidence in financial markets and financial intermediaries badly frayed, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government intervened and provided a range of liquidity backstops, debt guarantees, and capital infusions to forestall a complete collapse of the financial system and the economy. \n\nThe bust exposed many structural flaws in the financial system that exacerbated its instability.  Without being exhaustive, these included the instability of the tri-party repo system, which supported the nation\u2019s short-term funding markets; the risks of runs in the money market mutual fund industry; and the risk of contagion caused by the huge volume of outstanding bilateral (non-centrally cleared) over-the-counter (OTC) derivative obligations between the major financial intermediaries. \n\nThe tri-party repo system was centered on two of the major U.S. banks.  The system matched investors and borrowers each day\u2014with the investors lending cash, secured by Treasuries and other collateral, to the major securities firms.  But, the system was unstable.  In times of stress, clearing banks could be faced with very large single-firm exposures\u2014of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars.  Not surprisingly, when such counterparties became troubled, the clearing banks were less willing to take on these large intraday exposures.  As a result, repo investors, who were primarily worried about getting repaid each morning, were motivated to simply withdraw from the market.  As short-term investors withdrew funding, the liquidity buffer of the troubled securities firm was quickly exhausted, particularly as other counterparties to that firm demanded additional collateral to secure their own exposures. \n\nStructural weaknesses in the money market mutual fund industry\u2014which was a major source of short-term wholesale funding to the securities industry and various non-bank financial corporations\u2014also exacerbated the crisis.  When Lehman Brothers failed, the value of its outstanding short-term obligations collapsed.  The Reserve Primary Fund \u201cbroke the buck,\u201d and investors rushed to withdraw their funds from prime institutional money market mutual funds in a modern version of a classic \u201cbank run.\u201d  The funds generally did not have sufficient cash available to meet these runs because they offered overnight liquidity at par value against a portfolio of assets with weighted average maturities that were considerably longer. \n\nAnother important source of instability was the large volume of bilateral OTC derivatives positions outstanding among the major firms and the right of a firm to immediately close out such positions if their counterparty became insolvent.  For example, when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, counterparties to Lehman terminated OTC derivatives in which the contract was in the money (i.e., Lehman owed money to the counterparty) and liquidated the collateral held against those obligations, but kept open obligations in which the exposure went the other way, from them to Lehman.  Not only did this create an imbalance in the risk exposures of the failed firm, but it also generated significant market churn and risk as firms scrambled to rebalance their own risk exposures.  The contagion generated by the complex web of outstanding bilateral OTC derivative exposures significantly worsened the crisis and was responsible for much of the losses Lehman incurred in its bankruptcy.3  \n\nThe near-collapse of the U.S. financial system underscores three critical lessons. \n\nFirst, financial institutions must be robust to stress.  In particular, they need to have enough capital to be considered solvent even after sustaining significant losses, so that they can maintain the market access needed to recapitalize.  They also need sufficient liquidity buffers so that they can respond to shocks without having to sell illiquid assets.  The forced sale of illiquid assets can push asset valuations far below their fundamental value, which can increase insolvency risk.  And, it is important that they not be overly reliant on short-term wholesale funding, which can evaporate during times of stress. \n\nSecond, when we identify potential sources of instability that could amplify shocks, we need to make structural changes to the financial system to reduce or eliminate them.  For example, the financial crisis made it clear that changes were needed in how tri-party repo transactions were unwound each day, net asset values were calculated for prime money market mutual funds, and OTC derivative obligations were cleared, settled, and risk-managed. \n\nThird, there should be a viable and predictable resolution regime.  We need to be able to resolve a large, systemically important bank or securities firm in a way that limits contagion and stress on the rest of the financial system, while at the same time protecting the taxpayer against loss. \n\nMeanwhile, central counterparties (CCPs)\u2014through which most standardized OTC derivatives must now be cleared\u2014need to be open for business for the financial system to operate effectively.  Here, the emphasis should be on ensuring that these financial market utilities can open for business the day after the failure of one or more of their participants.  Credible resolution regimes for large banks and securities firms\u2014and credible recovery regimes for CCPs and other critical financial market utilities\u2014should help support confidence during times of stress. \n\nThese measures would make the financial system less prone to booms and busts.  Financial intermediaries would be more robust to stress when busts inevitably occur, and contagion to the broader system would be reduced when a systemically important firm fails.  Such changes should reduce the likelihood of the failure of a large, systemically important firm and the negative consequences of such a failure on the broader financial system.  These steps should help to ensure that credit flows can be sustained throughout the business cycle.\n\nConsiderable Progress\n\nSo, where are we relative to what is needed?  As I see it, there has been considerable progress.  The nation\u2019s largest banks are much safer as a result of substantially higher capital and liquidity requirements, as well as robust stress tests.  This enhanced resiliency has been achieved without a significant negative impact on the broad availability of credit\u2014recognizing that it is now more difficult for households with low credit scores to obtain a mortgage.  Most importantly, improving the capacity of such firms to continue to lend during times of stress should make the overall economy more stable. \n\nWe have also made significant progress in addressing many of the structural weaknesses uncovered by the financial crisis.  Money market reform has made the prime money market mutual fund industry smaller and safer.  The elimination of the net asset value convention for institutional prime money market mutual funds has made these funds smaller and less prone to runs during times of crisis.4   The tri-party repo system has been made more stable as intraday exposures of the large clearing banks have been dramatically reduced.5   This means that they have less reason to back away from a firm if it were to become troubled.  And, firms are much less reliant on short-term wholesale funding. \n\nWe have also reduced the amount of risk in the system by requiring that most standardized OTC derivatives be cleared through CCPs, where multilateral netting occurs.6   In a centrally cleared regime, major intermediaries have net exposures to individual CCPs that replace much larger bilateral exposures to other financial intermediaries.  Of course, this means putting more eggs in the CCP basket.  So, it is particularly important now to closely watch that basket.7 Greater oversight of CCPs is necessary to ensure that they have good governance, sound risk management, robust technological infrastructures, and adequate liquidity support.  In addition, we have made considerable progress in developing a viable resolution regime for large, systemically important banks and securities firms. \n\nMore Work Is Still Needed\n\nYet, we should not be complacent, as there are important areas where our work is not complete.8   Relative to other countries, the United States has limited ability to implement effective macroprudential tools.  That is because oversight is shared by several different entities, and the power to implement macroprudential tools is constrained.  Another challenge is the diverse structure of the U.S. financial system, in which non-banks and capital markets play a substantial role in credit intermediation.  Although the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) could conceivably play a greater role here, whether it will be able to do so effectively remains uncertain. \n\nAnother issue that needs attention is the ability to resolve large, complex financial firms that operate on a global basis.  The framework of requiring such firms to hold a large buffer of debt that could be converted into equity at the time of non-viability is an important step forward.  But, the task of operationalizing this on a global basis in a way that is fully credible to these firms\u2019 customers and counterparties has not been completed.  Achieving clarity about the roles and responsibilities of home and host country authorities is still a work in progress. \n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s lack of authority to lend to a major securities dealer that gets into difficulty is another outstanding issue.  The Dodd-Frank Act narrowed the Federal Reserve\u2019s authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.  No longer can the Federal Reserve lend to an individual securities firm or non-bank financial intermediary.  Such authority may not be as necessary now that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has the power to lend under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and firms are required to have sufficient resources to support their resolution plans.  But, I would prefer having such a tool available in extremis given the potential need to buy time for coordination and critical decision-making.  I think it is important to ensure that one can \u201cget to the weekend.\u201d  Finally, the work needed to ensure that CCPs can always recover has not yet been completed.  This is an issue of increased importance given that their role in the financial system has become more prominent.\n\nWhere the Pendulum May Have Swung Too Far\n\nAt the same time, there are some areas where the pendulum may have swung too far, where the costs of regulation\u2014including compliance costs and the potential impact on the provision of services\u2014are likely to exceed the benefits.  In this vein, I favor regulatory relief for smaller banking organizations.  First, such firms individually are not systemically important, and therefore do not pose a significant risk to the viability of the U.S. financial system.  Second, the regulatory burdens on smaller firms can be heavy because they don\u2019t have the scale over which compliance and other regulatory costs can be spread.  Regulatory requirements should be appropriately calibrated to avoid inadvertently creating a competitive advantage for larger financial firms. \n\nI also think that the Volcker rule could be modified so that its implementation would be less burdensome.  As I see it, regulators could review the criteria for permissible market-making.  Trading activity should be viewed as market-making when it is customer-facing and inventories are not excessively large or stale.  Market-making serves an important function, and it is important that trading desks can intervene and buy during flash crashes or sell during flash surges.  Permitting this could provide greater liquidity and stability to financial markets.  I would also exempt smaller banking institutions from the Volcker rule since they rarely, if ever, engage in proprietary trading. \n\nDo No Harm\n\nMany speculate that Congress will make changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.  If the scope is confined mainly to small bank relief and adjusting how the Volcker rule is applied, I have no objection.  But, because the Dodd-Frank Act addresses many of the key lessons of the crisis, I think it appropriate that changes be made carefully\u2014with a paring knife, rather than with a meat cleaver.  Here, I would underscore the importance of preserving higher capital and liquidity requirements for systemically important banks; Title VII, which mandates the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives; and Title VIII, which gives the Federal Reserve an oversight role for financial market utilities that are systemically important, and which helps promote more uniform risk management standards. \n\nWhile Title II gives the FDIC the authority to resolve a large, complex financial firm by converting its debt into equity and establishing a new holding company, I do not think this is necessarily the only way to have a viable resolution regime.  However, if Title II were to be eliminated, then the Bankruptcy Code would need to be bolstered.  There are two essential requirements: the ability to initiate an effective resolution strategy over the weekend, and a government entity\u2014be it the Federal Reserve or the FDIC\u2014that can provide a credible liquidity backstop to the recapitalized entity when it opens for business on Monday morning.  If resolution cannot be accomplished in this timeframe, confidence would suffer and there would be contagion.  Without a credible liquidity backstop, clients and counterparties would run, making it much more difficult for the recapitalized firm to conduct its business. \n\nI would also preserve the authority of the FSOC to designate non-banking firms as systemically important and subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve.  As I see it, the designations of GE Capital and AIG were successful in two important respects.  First, Federal Reserve supervision resulted in improved corporate governance and risk management. Second, it created incentives for the firms to alter their operations to become less systemically important in order to be de-designated.  We should also retain this designation tool because we cannot predict which firms and activities may emerge and become systemically important in the future.  After all, I do not think many were focused on or worried about the activities of AIG\u2019s Financial Products Group several years before the financial crisis, though in retrospect those activities proved to be systemically important.  That part of the firm should have been better supervised and regulated. \n\nSumming Up\n\nIn conclusion, as we reflect on potential changes to the U.S. regulatory regime, we should not lose sight of the horrific damage caused by the financial crisis, including the worst recession of our lifetimes and millions of people losing their jobs and homes.  We had a woefully inadequate regulatory regime in place, and while it is much better now, there is still work to do.  We should finish the job as quickly as possible, and we should do no harm as we adjust our regulatory regime to make it more efficient. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

    "content": "Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this Council for Economic Education (CEE) event, marking the CEE\u2019s 56th Annual Financial Literacy and Economic Education Conference.  Given the hard lessons of the financial crisis\u2014and the economic challenges still facing many Americans\u2014there are few goals more worthy than promoting greater financial and economic literacy.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nPersonal Educational Experience\n\nBefore discussing the economic outlook and the role of education in income mobility, I will offer a few remarks on my own educational experience.  While it may not be surprising that I have a Ph.D. in economics, the path that led me to the University of California, Berkeley, is a bit unusual. \n\nI started college in the 1970s at Columbia University.  On the positive side, the professors were engaging, and I had the opportunity to read the great books of the university\u2019s core contemporary civilization curriculum.  But, I was troubled by the emphasis on grades and test taking.  I wanted something that was more free-form.  The idea was to find an environment that fostered learning for learning\u2019s sake.  So, in a small act of rebellion\u2014after all, it was the early 1970s and I was a teenager\u2014I decided to transfer to New College in Sarasota, Florida.  New College provided a strong liberal arts, cross-disciplinary, and flexible education program that relied\u2014as it does today\u2014on an unstructured format of evaluations, study programs with individual professors, and contracts rather than grades.  I like to call it \u201cgraduate school for undergraduates,\u201d because it really is a place that encourages students to engage intellectually, read and think critically, and communicate effectively. \n\nThis experience made me a strong advocate of a liberal arts education, which I believe is now more valuable than ever, given the greater importance of synthesizing and evaluating the vast array of information we have at our fingertips.  The cross-disciplinary approach of a liberal arts program is also vital to understanding and solving complex problems.  I believe that training\u2014combined with the excellent education in economics I got at Berkeley\u2014helped me to better diagnose what was going wrong in 2007 and 2008, and how the Federal Reserve could be most effective in our response to the crisis. \n\nEconomic and Monetary Policy Outlook\n\nTurning to the economic outlook, the damage wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria has imposed immeasurable hardship on many.  And, the damage will undoubtedly disrupt commerce for some time.  However, these effects are likely to be relatively modest in the context of the national economy.  Natural disasters tend to depress economic activity initially, but once the recovery and reconstruction efforts get underway in earnest, such disasters actually serve to lift economic activity. \n\nLooking beyond the storm effects\u2014which will make interpreting near-term economic data releases more difficult\u2014the economy remains on a trajectory of slightly above-trend growth at about 2 percent, and the fundamentals supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable. Low unemployment, sturdy job gains (recognizing the near-term negative impact of the storms), and rising wages (even at a pace below previous expansions) are lifting personal income.  Household wealth has been boosted by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing relatively slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet.  Thus, consumer spending should continue to advance in coming quarters. \n\nBusiness fixed investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise.  With the supply of labor tightening, there are greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies.  Investment spending should also benefit from a better international outlook and the improvement in U.S. trade competitiveness caused by the dollar\u2019s recent weakness.  The softer dollar and solid growth abroad also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on economic growth. \n\nTurning to the outlook for inflation, I have been surprised by the persistence of the shortfall from the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent long-run objective.  While some of this year\u2019s shortfall can be explained by one-off factors\u2014such as the sharp fall in prices for cellular phone service\u2014its persistence suggests that more fundamental structural changes may also be playing a role.  These include the increased ability of prospective buyers to compare prices across different sellers quickly and easily, the shift in retail sales to online channels of distribution from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and the consequences of these changes on brand loyalty and business pricing power.\n\nOver the coming months, I hope that we will be better able to differentiate between these competing explanations.  If it turns out that structural changes have played a significant role, I would generally view this as a positive, rather than negative, development.  It would imply that the U.S. economy could operate at a higher level of labor resource utilization without generating a troublesome large rise in inflation.  More people could be put to work on a sustainable basis, enabling them to gain opportunities not just to earn greater income, but also to develop their skills and grow their human capital.\n\nSlightly above-trend growth is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market, which should support a rise in wage growth over time.  When combined with a firmer import price trend\u2014partly reflecting recent depreciation of the dollar\u2014and the fading of effects from a number of temporary, idiosyncratic factors, I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Thus, even though inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.  This judgment is supported by the fact that financial conditions have eased, rather than tightened, even as the FOMC has raised its short-term interest rate target range by 75 basis points since last December. \n\nBut, the upward trajectory of the policy rate path should continue to be shallow, in part because the level of short-term interest rates consistent with keeping the economy on a sustainable long-run growth path is likely to be considerably lower than it was in prior business cycles. \n\nThe FOMC recently launched the process of balance sheet normalization\u2014in which an increasing proportion of maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) repayments are allowed to run off the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet.  While this process also should exert some monetary policy restraint over time, I believe the impact will be quite modest.  Not only was this shift in policy widely anticipated, but we also have seen that the impact on the level of long-term interest rates has been small as expectations have adjusted. \n\nThe economy has made great strides in recovering from the Great Recession, as the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.2 percent, aided by accommodative monetary policy.  Measures of underemployment have also improved considerably and are near pre-crisis levels.  Stronger labor market conditions are perhaps the best means to improve the economic well-being of most Americans, particularly those who have been struggling and are most vulnerable to economic downturns. \n\nAnd, as discussed in the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report and in Chair Yellen\u2019s accompanying testimony before Congress, it is encouraging that unemployment rates continue to fall for most demographic groups, including African-Americans and Hispanics.2  At the same time, we should remain concerned that the jobless rates for those groups remain above the unemployment rate for the nation. \n\nRecent U.S. Census Bureau estimates of household income growth also provide some reason for optimism.  Median real household income rose 3.2 percent in 2016, after strong gains the prior year.  Gains were particularly notable among African-American and Hispanic households, and the poverty rate fell to near pre-crisis levels.  While this is good news, I think we can all agree that we have a long way to go to improve income inequality and mobility in the United States.  As I see it, these are among the most important issues we face as a nation.\n\nIncome Mobility and Education\n\nNow, it is clearly the case that, given differences in individuals\u2019 abilities, a free-market society will generate some level of inequality.  However, there are persistent trends toward growing inequality and diminished economic mobility\u2014and in my view, these are problematic.3  First, income inequality has widened notably since about 1980.4  Second, and more distressing, is a relatively low rate of economic mobility, or the degree to which individuals or families can move up or down in the income distribution over time.  For example, the fraction of children who earn more than their parents has fallen from 90 percent to 50 percent over the past half century, and only 37 percent of parents believe that their children will be better off financially than they are, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.5\n\nHigh inequality combined with a low rate of mobility is particularly problematic in a democratic society. In short, it means that being born into a low-income family is likely to severely limit an individual\u2019s opportunities and well-being over his or her lifetime.  The United States fares notably weaker on both dimensions relative to its OECD peers.6  That is concerning, and something we should be working to address.\n\nOne significant initiative we have taken within the Federal Reserve System is the establishment of the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Minneapolis Fed, which conducts research and makes recommendations on the structural barriers to economic advancement in the nation.  The New York Fed has been, and will continue to be, an active participant and supporter of this initiative. \n\nLet me now turn to the primary routes of economic mobility and the impediments that too often block them.  The primary avenue to higher incomes for most people is investment in their human capital, namely through education.  Indeed, the income returns on education are very high, and they continue to rise in spite of very significant increases in the supply of highly educated workers during much of the 20th century.  Since the 1980s, however, increases in the supply of well-educated workers in the United States have slowed, while demand for these workers has accelerated due to technological change.  These forces have been a major contributor to the increase in the college wage premium.7  While college graduation rates in the U.S. have stagnated, those in many other OECD countries have continued to rise.  As a result, only one-quarter of those in the 25-to-34 age bracket in the United States have more education than their parents, compared with an OECD average of one-third.8  This represents a dramatic decline in college education\u2019s influence as an engine of upward mobility.  So, part of a solution to the increase in inequality and the reduction in social mobility is to increase the level of educational attainment in the population.\n\nThere are many barriers to expanding post-secondary education, however. From the potential student\u2019s perspective, a lack of information, low college preparedness, and high costs are all substantial barriers to college attendance and completion, and these barriers restrict social mobility.  Let me discuss each of these in turn. \n\nBy lack of information, I mean the recognition that in spite of its high price tag, a college degree typically offers an even larger payoff in terms of future earnings.  Many aspects of the college attendance decision are complex and hard to predict, especially for students from families without much experience with higher education.  For example, research indicates that decisions about college attendance are highly correlated with an understanding of the future payoffs from attendance and particular majors.9  New York Fed research shows evidence of systematic underestimation of the average benefits\u2014and overestimation of the costs\u2014of a college education, with larger biases among lower-income and non-college households.10  Families may not realize that listed tuition prices may not be what a particular student actually pays.  Moreover, misperceptions about the net return from a college degree can be consequential, influencing parents\u2019 expectations and intentions for their children\u2019s college attendance. \n\nImportantly, however, these expectations are not hardwired.  Evidence from an information experiment indicates that students do respond to new information by revising their expectations and their education choices.11  This suggests that making information about higher education decisions more available to families\u2014particularly those with less experience with higher education\u2014is a promising way to expand economic mobility.  I was fortunate as a child that I didn\u2019t face this problem.  Both my parents went to college and there was no doubt among us about the payoff from higher education. \n\nAnother concern is the lack of college preparedness among new college entrants.  Nearly seven out of 10 students entering public two-year institutions and four out of 10 students entering four-year public institutions take remedial courses in college.12 Generally, these are courses they should have taken in high school. The costs of taking these courses in college are high, especially because they do not count for college credit.  Low readiness contributes to persistently low college completion rates, with only 55 percent of first-time undergraduates completing a degree within six years.13  College dropout rates are especially high among lower-income, part-time, and nontraditional students, with high costs, low perceived ability to pay, and a lack of information about the returns to degree completion also contributing to the high dropout rate.\n\nThe importance of college readiness underscores the value of high-quality K-12 schooling.  But, research indicates that fewer than half of five-year-olds from low-income families possess the math and reading skills, behaviors, and overall health required for learning success, compared to 75 percent of children from middle- and high-income families.14 These differences are important because they have long-lasting effects on academic achievement and future careers.  A substantial body of evidence, including research by economists at the Minneapolis Fed, points to very large economic returns to high-quality preschool and early-childhood development programs.15  Clearly, such programs can play an important role in improving economic mobility. \n\nI benefited from nursery school and kindergarten and a mother who taught me to read before I entered elementary school.  And, when my junior high school tried to move me out of an accelerated math program, my mom intervened and got me back in. \n\nPaying for college is another major impediment to college attendance and completion.  While college is generally a good investment, it has become increasingly expensive over the last several decades to attend a four-year program, as costs have risen considerably faster than wages\u2014especially wages for all but the very top of the income distribution.  This means that college has become increasingly unaffordable for those families who need it most, if we are to increase social and economic mobility.  Of course, one result of the increasing unaffordability of college education is that fewer people get a college degree, which could help account for the slowdown in the growth rate of the college-educated workforce that I discussed earlier.  However, recent research by my colleagues at the New York Fed shows that young Americans have mostly adjusted to rising tuition and fees not by foregoing college education, but rather by amassing more debt.  \n\nOver the past few decades, funding for higher education has shifted from state and local sources to students and their families. While the federal student loan program has helped ease that transition, the result has been that more students are leaving college with significantly higher amounts of debt.  In fact, student loan debt has grown 170 percent over the last decade and now totals over $1.3 trillion.16 \n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t want to downplay the importance of student loans. When accompanied by college completion, they allow students to make what generally turns out to be a very worthwhile investment.  I personally benefited from student loans while at Berkeley.  But, compared to alternative ways of financing higher education\u2014such as greater government support for public universities and increased federal education grants\u2014student loans can have adverse consequences.  This is especially true when loans are taken on by those who don\u2019t complete their education.  For borrowers with large student loan balances, such consequences include slow or late repayment, serious delinquency, and default.17  New York Fed researchers have shown that such unfavorable outcomes are related to family background.  Thus, at times, student loans can have the perverse effect of limiting social mobility.\n\nIn addition, our research indicates that, for any given level of educational attainment, workers who have student debts are less likely to own homes than those who got their education without incurring debts.  Certainly, for those who have difficulty repaying their student loans, the resulting damage to credit scores will make obtaining a mortgage very difficult, especially under today\u2019s lending standards.  A student loan default, which is unhappily common, means that borrowing to buy a home is essentially impossible.  And, we know that these factors\u2014slow repayment, delinquency, and default\u2014are most prevalent among those from modest family circumstances.\n\nThis connection between rising college costs, increased student borrowing, and reduced homeownership is important for inequality and social mobility because, for the great majority of American families, increasing home equity is the major form of wealth accumulation.18  Thus, changes over the last few decades in the way that college is financed mean higher education is less able to lift people from poverty into the middle class.\n\nI should note here that economic education has an important role to play in mitigating these challenges, which increasingly arise as debt becomes a more common part of the college experience.  For example, financial literacy and the skills taught by educators have been demonstrated to better prepare young people for the management of their finances, enhancing their well-being.  Financial literacy allows people to better understand the terms of student loans and the consequences of missed payments, and how to accumulate wealth.19  I strongly support the CEE\u2019s efforts to bring economic knowledge to young people, as I believe that it is increasingly vital for everyone, and has an especially important role in fostering social and economic mobility.\n\nOther factors that can foster or inhibit social mobility are the practices of universities themselves.  In some very recent work, Raj Chetty and his co-authors have documented the role that different universities play in fostering economic mobility.20  From my perspective, the most important findings are that access to the best universities is very closely related to parent income\u2014children from wealthier families are more likely to go to Ivy League schools, for example.  Yet, those students from poorer families who actually are admitted to the best universities do just as well in their future earnings as those from more advantaged backgrounds.\n\nPart of the problem, aside from cost, is the legacy admission policies of elite schools\u2014where children of alumni receive preferential access.  This is patently unfair, and scrapping such policies would help increase economic mobility.21I really don\u2019t see how our best universities can continue to justify this practice.  Yes, fund-raising might suffer slightly over time\u2014but I suspect the impact would be very small.  More importantly, do we really want to encourage what is essentially a \u201cdonate to admit\u201d policy at our major universities?  Such an approach only preserves the status quo and constrains economic mobility.\n\nThe research shows that upward mobility differs substantially across colleges.  Ivy League schools are good at producing top earners, but, as I noted, they accept very few lower-income students, so their impact on income mobility is small.  Meanwhile, other schools with economically diverse student bodies produce few high earners, and their impact is likewise small. Then there are certain schools\u2014some of which can be found in the CUNY and California state systems\u2014that manage to produce a large number of high earners from economically diverse student bodies.  Learning exactly how they do it and how it can be replicated strikes me as a first-order question for further study.\n\nWhile I am distressed by the high and increasing levels of inequality and diminished mobility that our economy has delivered over the last several decades, I remain optimistic about the future.  There is more attention now to inequality and low intergenerational mobility than I can recall at any time during my professional life.  Organizations like the CEE and the National Association of Economic Educators exist to improve awareness of economic concepts.  This enhances the ability of young people to make better financial decisions and helps to close the gaps in knowledge that contribute to inequality.  Top-tier researchers in both academia and the Federal Reserve System are focusing their attention on the causes, consequences, and solutions of this social problem, using better data, methods, and means of communicating their results.  Even more importantly, policymakers are also paying close attention.  Ultimately, I believe we will identify and implement policies that can make the dream of a better life a reality for more of our fellow citizens.\n\nThank you again for your kind attention. I would be happy to take your questions."

    "content": "Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here with you in Syracuse, and I want to thank Onondaga Community College for hosting us. This is my fourth visit to Central New York as president of the New York Fed, and I always look forward to coming back as part of our regular visits to different parts of our district. These trips and our meetings with stakeholders in the region give me and my colleagues important insight into what\u2019s happening in the economy.\n\nToday, I will briefly discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and what we are seeing at the regional level, and offer some reflections on the challenges and importance of workforce development in the region and across the nation. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nTwo years ago, I spoke in nearby Rochester on the topic of workforce development.2 Since then, the need for effective workforce development has become no less pressing, and both the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve System have focused greater efforts on this critical issue. This morning, I will return to some of the themes from that speech and look at lessons we have learned.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\n\nAlthough the damage wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria has imposed immeasurable hardship on many and will undoubtedly disrupt commerce for a time, these effects are likely to be relatively short-lived in the context of the overall economic outlook. Natural disasters tend to depress economic activity initially, but once the recovery and reconstruction efforts get underway in earnest, such disasters actually serve to lift economic activity.\n\nLooking beyond the storm effects\u2014which will make interpreting near-term economic data releases more difficult\u2014the U.S. economy remains on a trajectory of slightly above-trend growth, which is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market. Over time, this should support a rise in wage growth. The fundamentals supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable. Low unemployment, sturdy job gains, and rising wages\u2014even at a pace below previous expansions\u2014are lifting personal income. Household wealth has been boosted by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing relatively slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet. Thus, consumer spending should continue to advance in coming quarters.\n\nBusiness fixed investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise. With the supply of labor tightening, there are greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies. Investment spending should also benefit from a better international outlook and improvement in U.S. trade competitiveness caused by the dollar\u2019s recent weakness. The softer dollar and solid growth abroad also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on economic growth.\n\nWith a firmer import price trend and the fading of effects from a number of temporary, idiosyncratic factors, I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective over the medium term. In response, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.\n\nThe Regional Economy\n\nWhile the national economy has been growing steadily since the end of the Great Recession, the economies of Upstate New York have lagged behind, with job growth running at only about half the national pace through much of the expansion. And, over the past year, job growth in Upstate New York has slowed considerably, particularly in Rochester and Buffalo.\n\nHere in Syracuse, job growth has also been disappointing through most of the expansion, with an even slower pace of growth than many other upstate areas. In fact, today, almost 10 years after the Great Recession, Syracuse has still not fully recovered all of the jobs that were lost\u2014a benchmark most of Upstate New York passed some time ago.\n\nHowever, this slow growth does not imply that the region is standing still. Indeed, there is a lot of activity going on beneath the surface. The Syracuse economy and labor force are evolving and becoming better positioned for the future. But, more needs to be done to help workers adapt to change, a theme I will return to in a moment.\n\nAs is the case in much of the country, Syracuse has experienced a dramatic decrease in manufacturing jobs, reflecting the dual forces of technological change and globalization. These were well-paying jobs that supported a vibrant middle class. Now, I am a firm believer in the overall positive effect that open trade has had on the United States, but I also recognize that its benefits and costs are distributed unevenly, and the positive and negative consequences can be geographically concentrated.3 On the whole, we have not done enough to recognize the vast consequences of these changes and to help those hurt by technological change and globalization.\n\nThe Syracuse economy has changed considerably from 25 years ago, when manufacturing was the dominant source of jobs and income. The number of manufacturing workers has been cut in half since then, reducing the sector\u2019s share of employment from 15 percent to 8 percent\u2014a share that is now on par with the nation. This transition has been painful, but has resulted in a more diversified and stable regional economy.\n\nIn manufacturing\u2019s place, the healthcare and education sectors have picked up the slack, and have been a stabilizing force for the Syracuse economy. Offsetting the 20,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost over the past 25 years are around 25,000 jobs added in education and healthcare. Those two sectors now employ almost 20 percent of the workers in the region. Other sectors, like business services and leisure and hospitality, have also been creating new job opportunities that differ from the ones the region previously relied on.\n\nIn addition, jobs are being created in innovative hot spots in the region. For example, start-up companies rising from the Syracuse Tech Garden, as well as a new global center for unmanned aerial systems, are providing exciting new opportunities. While these particular efforts are still relatively small in scale, they have the potential to change the trajectory of the regional economy over time. However, Syracuse will need workers with deep skill sets to fill such jobs.\n\nTo that end, it can be difficult for workers to adapt to these changes, and they may need help to get there. Taking a broader view, the good jobs being created in today\u2019s economy require more education, training, and, ultimately, skill than ever before. The skill requirements for virtually all jobs are increasing, and workers will need to rise to the occasion to thrive in today\u2019s economy.\n\nThe challenge facing all of us is how to best help workers develop the skills necessary to land a good job, and how to enhance those skills over time as work requirements evolve. Workers with years of experience in jobs that are no longer in demand have it especially hard, as their skills may not be sufficient or match current opportunities\u2014an all-too-familiar story for workers in the Syracuse area.\n\nWorkforce Development\n\nWorkforce development must, therefore, be a top priority for everyone involved: workers, employers, communities, government, and educational and training institutions. There is no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution. This is a complex challenge that requires a combination of strategies. But one thing is clear: it requires a holistic approach encompassing the \u201cthree P\u2019s\u201d I described two years ago\u2014Partnerships, Programs, and Placement\u2014and then some. Before delving deeper into these, let me first explain why we, as the nation\u2019s central bank, care about workforce development.\n\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve is tasked by Congress with a dual mandate: maximum employment in the context of price stability. Clearly, we cannot declare success if we have people who want to work but lack the skills to fill available jobs. A skilled workforce that is matched to the needs of employers is necessary for the economy to grow and prosper, and for individuals to reach their potential. Monetary policy can help labor markets recover by providing incentives for firms to invest and grow. However, monetary policy cannot by itself solve skill mismatches and gaps that exist in the economy.\n\nSo, what can we do? The Federal Reserve provides research and analysis, and leverages its convening ability to bring together diverse stakeholders to better understand the issues and identify practices that work. For example, we run the Leading the Way video campaign with P-TECH schools and employer partnerships.4 This competition challenges teams of high school students in the Rochester area to create public service announcements detailing skills required to work in industries that are currently hiring. We also participate in the New York City Data Science Task Force to increase the number and diversity of students in the metropolitan area prepared to enter graduate school or the workforce with data science skills. And, we are finalizing the results of a survey of community colleges across New York State that looks at their engagement with employers for the purposes of workforce development. I will talk a bit more about the survey\u2019s preliminary results shortly.\n\nIn addition, we are working with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and our fellow regional Reserve Banks on broader initiatives to promote investment in workforce development and encourage partnerships, including next month\u2019s Investing in America\u2019s Workforce Conference in Austin, Texas. The conference is a joint effort by the Federal Reserve System and several leading institutions in the field5 intended to connect businesses, government agencies, non-profits, academics, and philanthropic organizations. The goal is to reframe workforce development as an investment, attract new resources, and leverage existing ones to improve economic mobility and job opportunities for potential workers.\n\nThe Three P\u2019s of Workforce Development\n\nThe core of any workforce development effort is the need to help workers build the skills necessary to adapt to change, meet the challenges of an evolving economy, and find good-paying jobs. We have been hearing from business owners across our district, on our advisory councils, and through surveys for several years about the skills gaps they face, in areas as diverse as engineering, long-haul trucking, welding, and metalworking. What they all have in common is that they require specific skills and training, whether through a certification program, a two- or four-year degree, or a formal apprenticeship\u2014an approach that has been very successful in countries such as Germany and the UK, but has not been as widely used here.\n\nThis is where the partnership concept comes into play. Partnerships entail cooperative efforts between local employers and educational institutions to determine the best strategies to help workers develop the skills employers need. The good news is that New York State seems to be ahead of the curve in this area.\n\nAs I mentioned, we are in the process of completing a survey of community colleges in New York State. The early results are encouraging: we have found that all community colleges in the state offer some workforce development programming, and partnerships with employers are the norm. In fact, the median number of employer-partners among community colleges is over 100, and there are partnerships in every industry, from healthcare to utilities to agriculture. Such partnerships are growing in importance and fill a need for both local workers and employers. This goes to my second P: Programs. Community colleges in New York are becoming very adept at creating programs tailored to the current skills required by local employers.\n\nLocally, I\u2019d like to highlight Onondaga Community College\u2019s partnership with Madison County manufacturers, which trains workers through the Apprentice Career Training program. This program provides paid training for students that can lead to four-year apprenticeships in participating businesses in advanced manufacturing, where they will develop skills necessary for jobs that are in high demand, including maintenance mechanics, tool makers, and machine operators.\n\nI would also like to call attention to Work Train\u2019s job training and industry collaboration,6 as well as the work of the Onondaga Citizens League to quantify the types of jobs that are in Central New York, what job opportunities will likely exist in the future, and other critical workforce-related questions. I anticipate that the Citizens League\u2019s report on how Central New York works will serve as an important resource for shaping workforce development programs in the area.7\n\nHowever, while training and skill-building are foundational, they are not enough. Placement into good jobs\u2014my third P\u2014is a critical component of effective workforce development, especially for those currently unemployed. Recent work by Federal Reserve economists highlights some of the hurdles to job placement that will need to be overcome. This research leveraged the New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations to examine how people find work.8 The difference between those looking for work while employed versus those who are unemployed is stark. Relative to the unemployed, employed workers spend less time searching for jobs but have three times higher contact rates and two times as many job offers. Furthermore, workers hired from another job do better than those who are unemployed, receiving 28 percent higher wages and twice the level of benefits. While we have always known how difficult it is for recent high school or college graduates to find their first job, it seems that those currently unemployed face an even greater hurdle, and this is an issue that we need to address.\n\nAnother finding from this work is the importance of networking and references for those seeking employment. Referrals accounted for 40 percent of total job offers, and while 60 percent of all job applications were the result of job board searches, these accounted for only 24 percent of offers. This all suggests that workforce development providers need to build relationships and trust with employers as a way to help their job-seekers find available opportunities and successfully apply for them.\n\nHaving covered the three P\u2019s, I\u2019d like to now focus briefly on the \u201cand then some,\u201d which refers to addressing a number of social and structural factors that work against even the best workforce development efforts.\n\nIn my travels throughout the region and my interactions with workers, business leaders, workforce development practitioners, and others, I regularly hear how access to transportation and childcare are preventing able and willing workers from actually working. People\u2019s inability to get to jobs relatively far from where they live\u2014either because they can\u2019t afford a car or there is no viable and reliable public transportation. This is a challenge we are seeing both in sparsely populated areas, like the North Country, and in cities, where jobs may be available in the surrounding suburbs and exurbs with no easy public access. With regard to childcare, cost and access are what we hear most as hindering people\u2019s ability to fill jobs. And, even for those who can afford childcare, irregular scheduling by employers makes it very difficult to plan effectively. Additional adverse factors include a decline in geographic mobility\u2014that is, people\u2019s ability or willingness to relocate to where the jobs are\u2014and the opioid epidemic, which Chair Yellen recently spoke about as having a significant negative impact on our workforce.9\n\nWhile I am not an expert on these subjects, I can say that the inefficiencies these impediments create are keeping us from realizing our full potential individually and as a country, and that addressing them as part of a comprehensive workforce development solution is essential.\n\nI would like to conclude by saying that Syracuse, as well as Upstate New York more generally, has been dealing head-on with the consequences of economic change for a long time. Perhaps because of this, the region has developed a deep understanding of the importance of helping its people adapt through workforce development programs. The issue of workforce development is a complex one that requires a holistic approach and close collaboration among all interested parties. The good news is that many great organizations in the area are trying different approaches to discover what works best. Our region is in many ways leading the way, and we at the New York Fed will continue to support these efforts.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would now be happy to take a few questions."

    "title": "The U.S. Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy",
    "date": "Sep 7, 2017",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170907",
    "content": "Good evening.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this Money Marketeers event.  In my remarks, I will focus on two topics:  1) The economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy, and 2) the Fed\u2019s balance sheet normalization process, which is likely to begin relatively soon.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nOverall, the economy remains on a trajectory of slightly above-trend growth, which is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market.  Over time, this should support a rise in wage growth.  When combined with a firmer import price trend\u2014partly reflecting recent depreciation of the dollar\u2014and the fading of effects from a number of temporary, idiosyncratic factors, that causes me to expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  In response, the Fed will likely continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.  But, the upward trajectory of the policy rate path should continue to be shallow, in part because the level of short-term interest rates consistent with keeping the economy on a sustainable long-run growth path is likely to be considerably lower than it was in prior business cycles. \n\nThe process of balance sheet normalization\u2014in which an increasing proportion of maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) repayments are allowed to run off the Fed\u2019s balance sheet\u2014should also exert some monetary policy restraint over time.  But, I believe this impact will be quite modest.  Not only is this shift in policy now widely anticipated, but we have also seen that the impact on the level of long-term interest rates has been small as expectations have adjusted. \n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nSo, why do I anticipate that the economy will likely continue to grow at a slightly above-trend pace?   The fundamentals supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable.  Low unemployment, sturdy job gains, and rising wages\u2014even at a pace below previous expansions\u2014are lifting personal income.  Household wealth has been boosted by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing relatively slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet.  Thus, consumer spending should continue to advance in coming quarters.  \n\nBusiness fixed investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise.  With the supply of labor tightening, there are greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies.  Investment spending should also benefit from a better international outlook and the improvement in U.S. trade competitiveness caused by the dollar\u2019s recent weakness.  The softer dollar and solid growth abroad also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on economic growth.  \n\nTurning to the outlook for inflation, I have been surprised by the persistence of the shortfall from the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent long-run objective.  While some of this year\u2019s shortfall can be explained by one-off factors, such as the sharp fall in prices for cellular phone service, its persistence suggests that more fundamental structural changes may also be playing a role.  These include the increased ability of prospective buyers to compare prices across different sellers quickly and easily, the shift in retail sales to online channels of distribution from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and the consequences of these changes on brand loyalty and business pricing power. \n\nOver the coming months, I hope that we will be better able to differentiate between these competing explanations. \n\nIf it turns out that structural changes have played a significant role, I would generally view this as a positive, rather than negative, development.  It would imply that the U.S. economy could operate at a higher level of labor resource utilization without generating a troublesome large rise in inflation.  More people could be put to work on a sustainable basis, enabling them to gain opportunities not just to earn greater income, but also to develop their skills and grow their human capital.\n\nBefore I go further, let me say a few words about the impact of Hurricane Harvey.  The massive flooding in Texas has been a tragedy for countless people.  My heart goes out to all who have suffered and face a long and difficult recovery. \n\nWhile the human toll of such a storm is immense, past disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy have shown that the impact on the national economy tends to be modest and transitory.  At first, activity dips as normal commerce is disrupted.  But later, when rebuilding gets underway in earnest, economic activity receives a modest boost. \n\nAlthough I expect that the Texas floods will make it more difficult to assess the economic data in the months ahead, I do not expect it to fundamentally alter the underlying trajectory of the national economy.  Of course, for parts of Texas, sadly, the consequences will be immeasurably greater.\n\nMonetary Policy Outlook\n\nAs I noted earlier, I still anticipate that above-trend growth will lead to higher utilization of the economy\u2019s resources, and that, over time, this will help push inflation higher.  Thus, even though inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually. \n\nThis judgment is supported by the fact that financial conditions have eased, rather than tightened, even as the Fed has raised its short-term interest rate target range by 75 basis points since last December.  For example, equity prices have risen, credit spreads have narrowed modestly, longer-term interest rates have declined, and the dollar has weakened.  On balance, these movements have been large relative to the upward drift in short-term interest rates.  The easing in financial conditions is important because monetary policy does not directly influence the trajectory of economic growth and inflation.  Instead, as I have noted in previous remarks, short-term interest rate changes are an important factor that affects broad financial market conditions.2 Financial conditions, in turn, influence the demand for goods and services by households and businesses.  But, if financial conditions ease even as we are removing monetary policy accommodation, this may have implications for further policy adjustments.  All else equal, an easing of financial conditions may warrant a somewhat steeper policy rate path.  Conversely, if financial conditions were to tighten unduly, then this might necessitate a shallower rate path to temper that tightening. \n\nTo be clear, this does not mean that the Fed should mechanically target a particular set of financial conditions.  That is because the set of financial conditions appropriate to achieving the Fed\u2019s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability will evolve over time as the economic outlook changes.  Financial conditions are just a means to an end\u2014the achievement of the Fed\u2019s employment and inflation objectives. \n\nWith that background, I would like to comment on some of the criticism of Fed policy decisions.\n\nSome of the commentary surrounding the FOMC\u2019s June decision to raise the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points illustrates the current tension between \u201ctoo low\u201d inflation and \u201ctoo buoyant\u201d financial conditions.  On one hand, some observers question the decision to reduce policy accommodation given that inflation has fallen somewhat further below our objective.  I would respond to these concerns by noting that monetary policy is still accommodative and that financial conditions have eased.  In addition, the long and variable lags between monetary policy adjustments and their impact on the economy imply that the FOMC may need to remove accommodation even when inflation is below its goal.  In particular, if the unemployment rate were already below its longer-run natural rate, as may be the case currently, the impact on wage growth and price inflation would still likely take some time to become evident.  This would be particularly true if inflation expectations were well-anchored at or slightly below our 2 percent objective, as is the case currently. \n\nOn the other hand, some Fed watchers have argued that we are helping to create financial asset bubbles by not removing accommodation more quickly.  My view is that asset valuations are not particularly troublesome given the economic environment in which we\u2019ve been\u2014that is, a long period of moderate growth, low inflation, low interest rates, and low recession risks.  I would be much more concerned about asset valuations if financial market performance were disconnected from the economy\u2019s performance\u2014for example, if market volatility were very low and asset valuations elevated at a time when the economy was performing poorly and the outlook was highly uncertain.  Stretched valuations would also be of greater concern if credit growth were unusually strong and financial institutions were becoming more leveraged and dependent on wholesale funding.  The good news is that the substantially higher capital and liquidity requirements enacted in response to the financial crisis have helped to reduce the risks to financial stability. \n\nRelatedly, some critics have argued that our asset purchases have unduly distorted financial asset prices.  My response to this critique is that monetary policy\u2014including large-scale asset purchase programs\u2014works through its influence on financial conditions.  We turned to asset purchases to provide additional monetary policy stimulus when the federal funds rate was constrained by the effective zero lower bound.  In buying longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS, we sought to reduce risk premia to provide additional support to economic growth at a time when the economy was operating far from full employment.  The argument that monetary policy should avoid affecting asset prices\u2014that it be somehow \u201cneutral\u201d\u2014is not one that I find compelling.  Such an argument essentially implies that monetary policy should not be utilized to achieve the Fed\u2019s dual mandate objectives. \n\nAnother recent critique is that the Fed has contributed to the low volatility of financial markets by making monetary policy too predictable.  Some argue that we should surprise market participants in order to manufacture greater uncertainty and generate more market volatility.  The notion is that if the Fed were more unpredictable, market participants would be less complacent.  And, if markets were perceived as riskier, this might hinder the development of financial asset bubbles. \n\nI am not supportive of such a strategy for several reasons.  First, I don\u2019t think it is necessary to be unpredictable to keep financial market participants \u201con their toes.\u201d  There are plenty of potential surprises from the economic environment without the Fed seeking to deliberately generate its own.  Changes in the economic outlook affect financial asset prices and market participants\u2019 expectations for future monetary policy actions.  I don\u2019t see a significant benefit to artificially adding \u201cnoise\u201d to this process.  Developments in early 2016 provide a good example.  As the economic environment changed and financial conditions tightened, we responded by raising short-term interest rates much more slowly than had been anticipated. \n\nSecond, deliberately degrading the signal of how we are likely to react to changes in economic circumstances would likely lead to higher risk premia.  This would represent a real cost that would have to be borne by households and businesses.  Third, a less reliable Fed would also presumably loosen the linkage between the stance of monetary policy and financial conditions.  Because the monetary policy impulse works through its impact on financial market conditions, I don\u2019t see why the Fed would want to act in a way that deliberately made this linkage less predictable.  In actuality, I have been pushing in the opposite direction.  By explaining the importance of financial conditions as part of our monetary policy decisions, I am trying to tighten the linkage.   \n\nBalance Sheet Normalization\n\nI\u2019d like to wrap up my comments tonight by discussing the likely next step in the monetary policy normalization process: beginning to allow maturing Treasuries and agency MBS paydowns to run off the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, in contrast to our current practice of reinvesting all of the proceeds.  As you are aware, following the June FOMC meeting we issued an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.3   In that addendum, the FOMC outlined how it planned to gradually reduce the Fed\u2019s securities holdings over time.  Namely, when that program is implemented, the FOMC will decrease its reinvestments in an orderly way, with repayments reinvested only to the extent they exceed gradually rising caps.  For maturing Treasury securities, the FOMC anticipates that the monthly cap will be $6 billion initially and will increase in steps of $6 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion.  For repayments of agency MBS, the monthly cap will be $4 billion initially and will increase in steps of $4 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $20 billion.  \n\nFor Treasury securities, when the caps are fully phased in, they will generally only be binding during the middle month of each quarter, when there is typically a spike in maturing Treasuries in the Fed\u2019s portfolio.  For agency MBS, as long as long-term interest rates are steady or rising, we expect that the fully-phased-in caps will not be binding.  However, if long-term interest rates were to fall sharply\u2014provoking a surge in refinancing and mortgage repayments\u2014the caps would likely bind, limiting the amount of agency MBS that would have to be absorbed by the private market.\n\nAs currently anticipated, once we start the balance sheet normalization program, we expect it to continue in the background until the FOMC judges that the Fed\u2019s securities holdings are no larger than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  Adjustments to the target range of the federal funds rate will remain the primary tool of monetary policy.  However, if economic circumstances were to change during the normalization process in a way that would warrant a sizable reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC would be prepared to resume reinvestment. \n\nThe program has been designed to be implemented gradually and predictably so that market participants and the U.S. Treasury can anticipate when and at what pace the portfolio is likely to run off over the course of normalization.  This should keep expectations more stable and reduce the risk that a sharp shift in expectations could generate undesirably large movements in interest rates and asset prices. \n\nAs I see it, a few questions about this program remain and are worth addressing.  The first question is why do this at all.  After all, the Fed has had a large balance sheet for many years now.  In my view, the balance sheet expansion was undertaken in response to an extraordinary set of circumstances\u2014a deep recession, short-term interest rates at the zero lower bound, and the economy far away from our dual mandate objectives.  Now that these circumstances no longer hold, it seems appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet.  \n\nIn thinking about the decision to reduce the size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, I see two important, opposing factors.  One is that a large balance sheet could conceivably make further asset purchases less attractive.  This factor suggests that we should use the opportunity to shrink the balance sheet during good economic times so that this tool will be fully available to us in the future if necessary.  However, on the other side, reducing the size of the balance sheet is another form of monetary tightening, one with which we have little experience.  This suggests we should proceed with caution.  The FOMC has judged that a gradual, predictable approach to normalization is the best way to appropriately balance these two factors.  \n\nAnother question is how long the normalization process will take.  Assuming that this process begins later this year and continues uninterrupted, the balance sheet size would likely normalize in the early part of the next decade.4 There is uncertainty about the exact timing for several reasons.  We don\u2019t know how fast our agency MBS holdings will pre-pay, how quickly currency outstanding will grow, how many bank reserves will be required for the efficient execution of monetary policy, or the evolution of other liability items on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet that affect the amount of bank reserves. \n\nAgainst that backdrop, one major issue that remains outstanding is whether the Fed will continue to operate with a \u201cfloor\u201d system, in which the Fed maintains a relatively abundant supply of reserves and the effective federal funds rate is managed by periodic adjustments to the interest rate the Fed pays on bank reserves.  Or, whether the Fed will move back to a \u201ccorridor\u201d system, in which reserves are relatively scarce and the effective federal funds rate is managed by frequently adjusting the supply of reserves to meet demand at the desired federal funds rate level.  In this type of regime, it is the quantity of reserves, rather than the interest rate the Fed pays on reserves, that is the primary driver of the federal funds rate.5    \n\nHaving managed the System Open Market Account during the financial crisis\u2014a period during which the demand for reserves was very volatile\u2014I very much favor a floor-type system.  It is much easier to manage on a day-to-day basis.  It also eliminates the need for a lot of interbank trading activity to move reserves to banks that would otherwise find themselves short of reserves on a particular day.  In my view, this type of intermediation activity does not have much social value.\n\nWhile the FOMC has discussed these issues, it has made no decision about its choice of long-term monetary policy operating framework.  This seems appropriate to me because over the next few years we will gain considerable further experience about operating with a floor-type system.  Nevertheless, my expectation is that the FOMC will ultimately favor maintaining a floor-type system similar to what is in place today.  As support, I would point to the minutes of the November 2016 FOMC meeting, in which participants observed that the current framework had been working well. \n\nThis leads us to the next question:  Assuming that a floor system is retained, what amount of reserves will be needed in the banking system so that day-to-day open market operations are not necessary to keep the federal funds rate within its target range?   In other words, how small can the amount of excess reserves be before banks begin to compete and bid for such reserves, introducing unwanted volatility to the federal funds rate?  First, there will need to be sufficient excess reserves to accommodate day-to-day fluctuations in the \u201cautonomous factors\u201d that influence the amount of reserves in the banking system.  These include shifts in the Treasury\u2019s cash balance, the foreign repo pool, and overnight reverse repo facility usage.  Second, there will have to be an additional buffer to meet banks\u2019 underlying demand for reserves.  We expect that the demand for reserves will be considerably higher than it was prior to the financial crisis because reserves can be used to satisfy the more stringent liquidity requirements that are in place today, and because the opportunity cost of holding reserves is much lower now since the Fed pays interest on reserves. \n\nTogether, as a rough starting point, we have suggested that the necessary amount of excess reserves could be in a range of $400 billion to $1 trillion.6   Coupled with uncertainty about the likely growth in other factors, such as currency outstanding, this implies a normalized balance sheet size of, perhaps, $2.4 trillion to $3.5 trillion in the early 2020s.  \n\nAfter reaching that level, one should anticipate that the Fed would resume purchases of Treasury securities.  These purchases would allow the balance sheet to expand to accommodate the growth in currency outstanding and in banks\u2019 demand for reserves as the economy grows.  They also would make up for ongoing paydowns of the agency MBS that remain in our portfolio. \n\nAlthough there is considerable uncertainty about the long-run size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, I would stress that the balance sheet is likely to shrink by much less than it grew between 2007 and 2014.  Based on New York Fed staff projections, I would expect the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, which currently stands at $4.5 trillion, to shrink by roughly $1 trillion to $2 trillion.  This compares to an increase of about $3.7 trillion in the wake of the financial crisis.  This is another reason why I anticipate that the impact of balance sheet normalization on financial markets is likely to be quite mild.  This view is supported by empirical research carried out within the Fed7 and is consistent with the results of surveys of private sector economists, including the Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants conducted by the New York Fed\u2019s Markets Group.8  \n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, I expect that the U.S. economy will continue to perform quite well, with slightly above-trend growth leading to further gradual tightening of the U.S. labor market.  As this occurs, I would anticipate that wage growth will firm and that price inflation will gradually rise.  In response, I expect that we will continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation.  Balance sheet normalization will likely be part of this process.  But, we expect this to have only a mild impact and to run passively in the background.  Short-term interest rates will remain the primary tool of monetary policy. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

    "title": "Remarks at the Economic Press Briefing on the Regional Economy",
    "date": "Aug 10, 2017",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170810",
    "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the New York Fed\u2019s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  Today, we will provide an update on economic conditions in the region, and then discuss the issue of regional wage inequality.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions\n\nThe Federal Reserve has pursued an accommodative monetary policy since the Great Recession to facilitate achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  This policy stance has provided support to the economy and helped lower the unemployment rate from 10 percent at the depths of the Great Recession to 4.3 percent currently.  Measures of underemployment have also improved considerably and are near pre-crisis levels. \n\nStronger labor market conditions are perhaps the best means to improve the economic well-being of most Americans, particularly those who have been struggling and are most vulnerable to economic downturns.  Improved job opportunities have helped to support household income growth, consumption, and saving, as well as the housing market.  And, as discussed in the Fed\u2019s recent Monetary Policy Report and in Chair Yellen\u2019s testimony before Congress, it is encouraging that unemployment rates continue to fall for most major demographic groups, including African-Americans and Hispanics.  At the same time, we should remain concerned about those groups, for which the jobless rates remain above the unemployment rate for the nation.  Our outlook anticipates a continued moderate growth trend, with some further strengthening in the labor market and an increase in inflation over the medium term toward our objective of 2 percent. \n\nAlthough job growth in our region has slowed somewhat in recent months, economic activity continues to expand.  After outpacing the United States as a whole for a number of years, job growth in New York City is now running a bit below the national average.  And, as has been the case for some time, job growth in Northern New Jersey remains a little below New York City\u2019s pace.  Over the past year, job growth has flattened out in much of upstate New York, with Albany remaining a bright spot in the region.  Unfortunately, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands both remain mired in economic difficulties with no clear signs of a revival.\n\nWhile the post-crisis expansion is now the third-longest on record, by historical standards it has been marked by a relatively weak pace of growth, with annual GDP growth averaging just 2.1 percent since mid-2009.  Wage growth has also been comparatively modest even as unemployment has declined.  In part, this likely reflects the fact that productivity growth has been sluggish compared to historical experience.  Relative income differences are likely to get more attention when economic growth is weak and people do not see significant improvement in their absolute income levels.  With that in mind, as we consider how to address the issues of income inequality and mobility, we should also consider how to improve flagging productivity growth, because that would help raise the level of household income.\n\nWage Inequality\n\nToday\u2019s briefing will focus on labor market inequality, including wage inequality in our region.\n\nCurrently, we see comparatively high levels of inequality in the labor market in terms of differences in the wages workers earn.  This situation has been in the making for several decades.  Since the early 1980s, wages have increased more rapidly for workers toward the top of the income distribution than for the median worker, and much more rapidly than for workers toward the bottom of the distribution.  Further, this increase in inequality can be seen throughout the entire distribution of wages.\n\nIn my view, two main factors are responsible for this pattern of differential wage growth and the resulting increase in wage inequality.  First, advances in technology have dramatically changed the nature of work, increasing the skill requirements for many jobs while displacing others.  Second, the pace of globalization has accelerated in recent decades, with increased cross-border trade, investment, immigration, and the emergence of global supply chains.  Together, these economic forces have contributed to significant job losses in certain sectors, most notably manufacturing.  The resulting decline in demand for middle- and lower-skilled workers has resulted in fewer jobs and has depressed wages for many in those industries.  Other, less important factors behind the rise in inequality include the decline in private sector labor unions and the falling real value of the minimum wage. \n\nAt the same time, technological change and globalization have created jobs in areas such as engineering and software development.  Demand has been particularly high for knowledge workers, resulting in strong wage growth in certain sectors.  All told, the forces of technological change and globalization have contributed to wage inequality by pushing up wages for those toward the top, and stifling wage growth for workers toward the middle and bottom of the wage distribution.  As I have said in previous remarks, we need to do a better job of helping those hurt by globalization.2\n\nMonetary policy can help support economic growth, but it is much less powerful in addressing the structural factors that underpin inequality in the labor market.  That said, understanding the causes and consequences of economic inequality is important to the Fed.  We are working hard at producing research, information, data, and analysis so that we can better understand inequality and participate in an informed debate on how to best address it.  One significant initiative within the Federal Reserve System is the creation of the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Minneapolis Fed.  The Institute conducts research to measure, analyze, and make recommendations to improve the economic well-being of all Americans, with a particular focus on structural barriers that limit full participation in economic opportunity and advancement.\n\nLagging Economic Mobility\n\nIn a free market economy, some wage inequality is inevitable given variability in individuals\u2019 endowments, skill sets, and education levels.  These attributes influence the demand for their services and the wages they are paid. We don\u2019t expect those just starting out to have the skills of more experienced workers. \n\nBut, the access and opportunity needed to attain the attributes associated with higher wages may not be uniform\u2014and that is concerning.  Inequality reflects impediments to people reaching their potential.  These include limits on access to education, credit, transportation, and housing.  Such impediments may discourage workers from investing in themselves, and may lead some to drop out of the labor force.  We should all work to ensure that people have opportunities to develop their skills, build human capital, and improve their job prospects. \n\nTo me, inequality is especially problematic when it reflects and reinforces barriers to economic mobility.  Too many parents are increasingly pessimistic about their children\u2019s economic future.  According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, only 37 percent of American parents think their children will be better off financially than they are.3   This is a deeply troubling finding.  I believe that income inequality is generally less problematic when it does not impede economic mobility and when economic mobility is high.  While the \u201crags to riches\u201d story has been a popular theme in U.S. history, income mobility in the United States is now notably lower than in many other advanced economies.\n\nUnfortunately, substantial differences in economic mobility exist within the United States.  Important research by Raj Chetty and his co-authors suggests that upward mobility strongly depends on where one grew up.4   That is, places themselves seem to have a measureable effect on economic outcomes for children as they reach adulthood.  In particular, this research indicates that higher upward mobility is associated with areas that are less residentially segregated by race or income, and that have higher-quality schools, stronger social networks, greater community involvement, and stable family structures.  Significantly, they find that places with greater upward economic mobility tend to have lower income inequality.  This evidence suggests that there is a fundamental inequality of opportunity for advancement that is tied to where people live.  Reducing inequality of opportunity is something we should all work toward. \n\nDirections for Policy\n\nSo, what are some specific ways policy can address inequality and improve economic mobility?  While this is a difficult and complex set of issues with no easy answers, I do have a few thoughts.  First and foremost, we can improve the quality of education for our most vulnerable citizens.  Children who attend better schools and attain higher levels of education have more favorable long-term outcomes, including better job prospects and higher earnings.  There are large disparities in the quality of education a student receives, which are highly correlated with where that student lives.  We need to look for ways to provide higher-quality education regardless of where people live. Reducing the role of local property taxes in school financing to better equalize school quality across locations is one example.5    \n\nIn addition, education\u2019s benefits start very early in life and are cumulative.  While we need to further strengthen primary and secondary education, there is convincing evidence that educational investments in early childhood have especially high rates of return in terms of lifetime earnings and are associated with many other positive outcomes.6\n\nWorkforce development is another key policy area that can improve economic mobility and reduce inequality.  Because of the swift pace of economic change driven by advances in technology and globalization, we ought to step up efforts to help workers build the skills necessary to adapt to change.  This means providing these types of services at the local level.  These efforts should include innovative workforce development programs, coursework and certifications in key skills that are in demand, and fostering partnerships between higher education institutions and local employers.  Here, I would point to Monroe Community College in Rochester as a model of successful collaboration with employers to create job-training programs that align with current employment opportunities.7\n\nConclusion\n\nThe issues of economic inequality and income mobility are among the most important that we face as a nation and as a region.  These issues are particularly relevant for our region because the Second District is home to some of the highest and lowest levels of wage inequality in the country.  Next, Research Officer Jaison Abel will discuss regional economic conditions and wage inequality.\n\nThank you for your kind attention."

    "title": "Panel Remarks at Bank for International Settlements' Annual General Meeting",
    "date": "Jun 26, 2017",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170626",
    "content": "Let me start by thanking Jens Weidmann and the Bank for International Settlements for the opportunity to respond and comment on Professor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rey\u2019s thoughtful remarks and on the issue of international spillovers associated with U.S. monetary policy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAs is characteristic of her work, what H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has to say is well-argued and provocative.  It is also very relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and the functioning of the international monetary system.  I mostly agree with the major points she makes. \n\nFirst, I wholeheartedly agree with her on the hazards of financial booms.  Rapid increases in credit and capital flows, asset prices, and leverage can lead to potentially severe corrections that can impose great stress on financial systems.  As we have seen repeatedly, this stress can impair the ability of the financial system to perform well in intermediating credit between savers and borrowers, and in helping households and businesses manage their financial risks.  When a financial system becomes impaired, there can be dire consequences for economic activity and the ability of central banks to achieve their macroeconomic objectives.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s work highlights an important global dimension to financial cycles, showing that gross capital flows, asset prices and credit often move in a synchronized way across countries as perceptions of risk change.  As we now know all too well, the global financial crisis dramatically underscored the fact that instability in the U.S. financial system and those of other advanced economies imposed extraordinarily high costs on the entire global economy. \n\nMaking the global financial system more resilient and less procyclical has been a key focus of policymakers since the financial crisis, and most countries have made substantial progress on this front.  This is evident in stronger capital and liquidity buffers for banks, lower reliance on wholesale short-term funding, reforms of over-the-counter derivatives markets, and the development of resolution and recovery regimes for banks and key financial market infrastructures, among other efforts.  Nonetheless, we must continue to work on these issues.\n\nIn particular, the U.S. financial system\u2014the epicenter of the crisis\u2014has been considerably strengthened.  Here, I would highlight additional reforms such as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) regime, which imposes annual capital stress tests on systemically important banks; tri-party repo reform; and money market mutual fund reform.  Policymakers globally have also made good progress on strengthening supervisory oversight, and are making headway\u2014albeit more slowly\u2014in developing effective macroprudential frameworks and toolkits. \n\nBut, more work remains to be done in several areas.  I would put particular emphasis on the tasks of completing the creation of a credible bank resolution regime that will work on a cross-border basis, and developing effective recovery regimes for key financial market infrastructures. \n\nI also agree with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne that monetary policy in the United States\u2014given the size of its financial markets and the U.S. dollar\u2019s status as a reserve currency\u2014can have a significant impact on global financial conditions, including exchange rates, and that shifts in U.S. monetary policy can lead to consequential shifts in global capital flows.  However, it is also important to note that the impact of U.S. monetary policy restraint on emerging market economies (EMEs) has varied widely across tightening cycles.  The impact depends on many factors, including EME fundamentals, asset valuations, and the extent and composition of prior capital inflows to those economies.  Importantly, the impact has tended to be more benign when U.S. yields rise in response to good U.S. growth prospects.  In contrast, spillovers have tended to be more adverse when increased monetary policy stringency is associated with a deteriorating U.S. economic outlook.2  \n\nThese observations point to the need for the United States to keep its own house in order.  Promoting economic growth and financial stability in the United States, I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to promoting growth and stability worldwide.\n\nLike nearly all central banks, the Federal Reserve has a domestic mandate set for it\u2014in our case, by the U.S. Congress.  It cannot subordinate its legal mandate of maximum employment and price stability in the United States to alternative international goals.  But, given the role of the United States and the U.S. dollar in the global economy and financial system, the Federal Reserve is\u2014and indeed, needs to be\u2014mindful of the international effects of its policy.  That is because those consequences can have important potential spillbacks to the U.S. economy and financial markets. \n\nThe bond market \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d of 2013 highlighted that prospective changes in U.S. monetary policy could affect the EMEs\u2014particularly those with existing vulnerabilities\u2014and how those consequences, in turn, could spill back to the United States.  This episode underscored the need for clear communication and transparency around U.S. policy so that expectations can adjust smoothly and be appropriately calibrated to what is likely to occur. \n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve has become increasingly transparent in recent years, in part to mitigate such risks.  Good communication and transparency is always important during periods of conventional policy normalization.  But, good communication and transparency may be even more important when one begins to unwind unconventional monetary policy actions, such as balance sheet policies with which we have little prior experience.  Moreover, I would surmise that adjustments to balance sheet policies undoubtedly affect asset prices in ways that differ from changes in short-term interest rates. \n\nEarlier this month, we announced an addendum to the FOMC\u2019s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.3   In this addendum, we spelled out how the balance sheet normalization program would work.  This was another step in a long chain of communications about the balance sheet\u2014incremental steps that highlight the evolution of our communication practices. \n\nI hope you would agree that we have taken a very measured and careful approach. \n\nThis process started with the initial release of the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans in September 2014, which indicated that the FOMC planned to reduce securities in a gradual and predictable manner.  Related comments followed in the minutes of the July 2015 FOMC meeting and the December 2015 FOMC statement.  Subsequently, FOMC participants discussed potential long-run frameworks for monetary policy implementation as detailed in the November 2016 FOMC minutes. \n\nNext, the March 2017 FOMC minutes reaffirmed that a change in balance sheet policy would be gradual and predictable, and achieved primarily by changing the reinvestment policy.  These minutes also noted that most participants judged a change in reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate this year, should economic data develop as they expected.  Then, in the May 2017 minutes, it was noted that nearly all participants had a favorable view of a phased-in, cap approach whereby reinvestments would be decreased gradually.  Participants favored this strategy because a preannounced schedule would be gradual and predictable, limiting the magnitude of the runoff could help mitigate any adverse market effects, and the strategy would be relatively easy and straightforward to communicate. \n\nFinally, as I noted earlier, we followed up in our last FOMC meeting with the release of an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that outlined how our balance sheet normalization plan will work when it is implemented.  We also said clearly in the FOMC statement that if the economy evolves in line with our expectations, we expect to begin this process this year. \n\nIn response, market participants have progressively increased the probability assigned to a change in reinvestment policy this year.  Yet, Treasury and agency MBS markets have responded little at the time of these announcements\u2014including those undertaken most recently.  To me, this suggests that these communications have generally been effective in fostering an orderly adjustment in expectations about how we are likely to normalize our balance sheet. \n\nI also agree with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne about the important role of financial conditions in influencing economic activity.  As I see it, financial conditions are a key transmission channel of monetary policy because they affect households\u2019 and firms\u2019 saving and investment plans and thus influence economic activity and the economic outlook.  If the response of financial conditions to changes in short-term interest rates were rigid and predictable, then there would be no need to pay such close attention to financial conditions.  But, as we all know, the linkage is in fact quite loose and variable. \n\nFor example, during the mid-2000s, financial conditions failed to tighten even as the Federal Reserve pushed its federal funds rate target up from 1 percent to 5\u00bc percent.  Conversely, at the height of the crisis, financial conditions tightened sharply even as the Federal Reserve aggressively pushed its federal funds rate target down toward zero.  As a result, monetary policymakers need to take the evolution of financial conditions into consideration.  For example, when financial conditions tighten sharply, this may mean that monetary policy may need to be tightened by less or even loosened.  On the other hand, when financial conditions ease\u2014as has been the case recently\u2014this can provide additional impetus for the decision to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation. \n\nWhile I agree with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in most respects, there are a few points where I am less convinced.  While the global financial cycle complicates policymakers\u2019 ability to guide financial conditions in their own economies, I\u2019m not persuaded that the trilemma has been replaced by a dilemma\u2014that is, essentially an \u201ceither/or\u201d choice between an independent monetary policy versus an open capital account. \n\nWhile there is no panacea to insulate countries from financial spillovers\u2014particularly when policy in some areas is constrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates\u2014I think a combination of exchange rate flexibility, a credible monetary policy framework, sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and a strong financial system can help mitigate the effects of such spillovers.  Moreover, it strikes me that market participants have become more discriminating over time about the circumstances of different countries, rather than painting all EMEs with a similar broad brush. \n\nThat said, I accept H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s suggestion that there may be other good alternatives, such as operating with less financial leverage and the increased use of macroprudential policy, including more aggressive stress testing.  Also, the current regime\u2014in which countries mostly have to self-insure against external shocks\u2014seems inefficient.  I believe that a regime with more risk-sharing across countries could be beneficial for the global economy. \n\nThank you for your kind attention. \n\nThe Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture, 2017"

    "title": "Benefits and Challenges from Globalization",
    "date": "May 11, 2017",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170511",
    "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and thanks to the U.S.-India Business Council, the Confederation of Indian Industry, and the Bombay Stock Exchange for organizing this event.  As always, what I have to say reflects my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nIt is a pleasure to have the opportunity today to talk about the issue of globalization.  Although the debate about the benefits and challenges of globalization is not new, it has recently come into sharper focus.  This debate is important to all of us, and I think it is particularly relevant to India given its growing role in the global economy. \n\nGlobalization means different things to different people.  In my remarks today, I will focus on the role of globalization as a force for international economic integration and economic development.  I will highlight three themes:\n\nFirst, the important role that trade plays in promoting higher standards of living globally. \n\nSecond, how changes in trade can create challenges for industries that become less competitive.  We have not adequately considered and remedied the very large costs this can impose on certain communities and households. \n\nThird, the answer to those challenges is not greater protectionism.  Instead, we need to provide greater support to displaced workers so they can obtain the skills needed to find new well-paying jobs.  We need to do better in preparing workers to deal with the challenges of globalization and technological change.  \n\nThese issues are important to me as a central banker, as they affect the long-term health and productivity of the economy, and the economic opportunities available to our people. \n\nThe debate around globalization, particularly in advanced economies, reflects a range of factors.  Undoubtedly, the global financial crisis and subsequent slow recovery have been significant.  But, just as important have been longer-term trends, such as growing income inequality, the loss of middle-income jobs, and the rise of large emerging market economies such as China and India. \n\nAlthough the debate about globalization is not new, I believe we are at a particularly important juncture.  If support for liberalized trade and an integrated global economy were to suffer a significant setback, the consequence could be slower economic growth and lower living standards around the world. \n\nWhile considerable effort has gone into liberalizing trade and developing the existing set of trade agreements, that does not mean they cannot be improved upon.  I have no doubt some trade agreements could be enhanced or updated.  Some may not adequately address recent changes in the global economy\u2014such as the rise of digital trade\u2014and may need to be refreshed.  And, important trade barriers still remain and should be addressed.  In particular, from a U.S. perspective, the access of U.S. firms to some foreign markets and the protection of intellectual property rights are issues that deserve close attention.  But, in addressing these issues, we should take care to preserve the vital benefits of trade to higher standards of living in both advanced and emerging market economies.  Our focus should be on further strengthening an open trade regime, and, as appropriate, amending and improving these agreements.\n\nThe Pace of Globalization\n\nTo begin, let me briefly describe the pace of globalization as a reminder of what is at stake.  Global economic integration has increased dramatically in recent decades.  Trade, for example, has grown from nearly 40 percent of global GDP in 1990 to 57 percent in 2015.  Over the same period, the stock of foreign direct investment has increased from roughly 10 percent of global GDP to 34 percent.  Ultimately, economies have become more integrated and interdependent.2\n\nThis rapid growth in trade reflects falling trade barriers, declining transport costs, and improved information and communication technology.  These trends have enabled the development of complex global supply chains that allow companies to manage their production more efficiently.\n\nEmerging market economies now make up a much larger share of global trade, the global economy and global growth.  As an illustration, emerging market economies have accounted for 70 percent of global output growth since the crisis\u2014double their share from two decades ago.3   This growth has provided much-needed support to world economic activity, as advanced economies have recovered slowly from the crisis. \n\nRising economic integration is also very evident when we examine the trade relationship between India and the United States.  Bilateral trade flows have risen tenfold, from $11 billion in 1995 to almost $110 billion in 2015.  In particular, half of U.S. imports of computer services are now sourced from India.  In 2015, the stock of bilateral foreign direct investment in both countries was $37 billion, up from $4 billion in 2002.4 The potential for further increases has been reinforced by the liberalization measures India announced last year to encourage greater foreign direct investment. \n\nBenefits of Open Trade\n\nIncreased trade, through its longer-term impact on productivity, has been a key contributor to global growth and prosperity since the Second World War.  Openness to trade brings many benefits to the supply side of the economy.  These include:\n\nCollectively, these forces lead to a more efficient allocation of a country\u2019s scarce resources\u2014one that is more closely aligned to its international comparative advantage. \n\nAs a consequence, consumers can benefit from lower prices, higher real incomes, and greater variety and quality of goods and services.  Increased openness may also reduce wasteful rent-seeking behavior on the part of protected industries and the related costs of corruption.\n\nThese benefits from open trade are very evident in India.  Academic research has found substantial gains for India following its dramatic trade reforms in the 1990s, which benefited consumers via lower prices and firms via higher markups.  These higher profit margins spurred innovation and provided funds for the development of new products. Looking ahead, the upcoming implementation of the goods and services tax in India\u2014which will create a common market internally\u2014is expected to provide many of the same benefits as trade liberalization does internationally. \n\nOpenness to trade has certainly played a large role in the economic ascent of Asia.  Following the rise of Japan, Korea, Taiwan and others, fast growth in China and India has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty\u2014an unprecedented feat in human history.  The benefits of economic integration and other reforms are exemplified in India\u2019s higher growth rate since the introduction of market reforms in 1991.  Growth has averaged 6.5 percent annually in the post-reform period, compared to about 4 percent annually over the prior 40 years.  Indeed, India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world today.  Reflecting these gains, a number of emerging market countries have been strong supporters of open trade, a sign of how much the world has changed in recent years. \n\nA few examples can help to illustrate some of the benefits of globalization. India\u2019s green revolution\u2014which helped to greatly increase its agricultural productivity and food security\u2014was facilitated by U.S. technology and scientists working with their Indian counterparts.  Similarly, as is well known, Indian engineers and entrepreneurs have played a key role in the technology sector\u2019s tremendous achievements in recent decades and now lead some of America\u2019s largest companies, including Google and Microsoft.  This success, in turn, has had important benefits for India as well, including increased foreign investment flows and employment opportunities that have helped develop a vibrant information technology ecosystem. \n\nBut, increased openness to trade is not a panacea in and of itself.  Actual benefits depend on a range of other critical factors, including macroeconomic policy, the business and regulatory environment, the legal regime, the quality of infrastructure, and the quality of public services, including education.  While the gains from a liberalized trade regime are not guaranteed, the alternative of trying to achieve a high standard of living by following a policy of economic isolationism will fail.  Trade has played a key role in nearly all of the high-growth success stories since the middle of the last century.\n\nChallenges of Open Trade\n\nIt is important to recognize that while trade and international integration tend to increase the overall economic pie, the distribution of the larger pie may be very uneven.  In fact, slices for individual groups may shrink.  Some workers\u2014particularly those in industries that are less able to compete and whose skills have become less relevant\u2014can be hurt and find it difficult to adjust.  This often requires individuals to change industries and to relocate to different regions.  So, while trade is almost always a win for a country\u2019s economy, not everyone within that economy will be a winner.  This is especially the case where there are no policies to cushion the negative consequences of trade and to facilitate adjustment. \n\nEffects are also country- and industry-specific, and depend on initial endowments and conditions.  Low-income workers in emerging markets, for example, may find it more difficult to adapt given weaker safety nets and less financial resources available to deal with adverse economic shocks.  The bigger the adjustment process, the more the gains from trade will tend to be eroded. \n\nWhile the rise in the skill premium from trade liberalization has been well established for both developed and developing countries, determining the aggregate impact of trade on jobs has been more challenging.  To date, the evidence has been mixed.  We need further research in this area to determine with more confidence a reasonable range of estimates for these employment effects.  Although evidence on the extent to which jobs have been lost due to global trade is inconclusive, job losses that are attributed to trade tend to be viewed differently.  That is, they are seen as having been \u201clost to foreigners\u201d and are often viewed as a consequence of the policy decision to liberalize trade in the first place.\n\nHaving said that, the challenge of adjusting to open trade is a serious issue that has not received the degree of attention it fully deserves.  This may partly reflect the fact that the burden has been borne unequally and spread out over a long time period.  It also may reflect the fact that the winners from trade have often tended to have a stronger voice than those who have been the losers. \n\nResearch has documented that the effects on individuals of job dislocation\u2014including those resulting from trade\u2014can be significant and long lasting.  Older workers tend to suffer larger earnings losses, and may face larger transition costs.  Displaced workers may not have the appropriate skills to find good jobs in other areas of the economy, including in growing export sectors.  When the affected industry represents a large share of the local economy, the damage is often magnified.  In this case, the burden is more widespread because wages across the community are likely to be hit as well.  And, this doesn\u2019t begin to capture the full human toll\u2014including the impact on workers who have lost confidence in the future and the poorer health outcomes that occur because of increased stress.  For too many individuals in the United States, for instance, the American dream has been put at risk, with parents increasingly pessimistic about whether their children will have the opportunity to do better than they did. \n\nWe should find better ways to help communities that are struggling because of the effects of free trade.  In the United States, we have historically experienced a high degree of geographic labor mobility\u2014much higher than in other advanced economies.  The ability to move in search of better opportunities, when possible, has helped to mitigate some of the adverse effects of trade.  But, mobility has declined in the United States in recent years, implying that the adjustment costs to trade may have increased.\n\nProtectionism Is Not the Answer\n\nGiven these costs of global integration and more liberalized trade, what is the best path forward?  Protectionism can have a siren-like appeal.  Viewed narrowly, it may be potentially rewarding to particular segments of the economy in the short term.  Viewed more broadly, it would almost certainly be destructive to the economy overall in the long term. \n\nCountries need to compete better, not compete less.  Trade barriers are a very expensive way to preserve jobs in less competitive or declining industries.  They blunt opportunities in export industries and they reduce the affordability of goods and services to households.  Indeed, such measures often backfire, resulting in harm to workers and diminished growth. \n\nA better course is to learn from our experience.  From a U.S. standpoint, we should work to reduce remaining foreign trade restrictions that impair our ability to capitalize on our comparative advantages.  For example, market access restrictions can mean that certain U.S. industries cannot realize their full potential.  Similarly, weaknesses in the protection of intellectual property rights limit the ability of U.S. producers to realize the full returns from their investments.  This lowers profits and diminishes incentives to grow the business and employ more workers. \n\nIf we are going to enhance the benefits of free trade and better manage its costs, it is critical that we continue to strengthen the global rules-based system.  On the positive side, I would point to the WTO\u2019s recent Trade Facilitation Agreement, which addresses customs procedures and could reduce global trade costs by almost 15 percent.  But, at a broader level, the momentum behind global trade reform has clearly waned in recent years.  This has occurred notwithstanding the fact that there are substantial areas in need of further reform, such as agriculture, services and non-tariff barriers.  That momentum needs to be rekindled and reaffirmed.  Although advanced economies historically have tended to lead the way, it is important that large emerging market countries now play a greater role.  This is appropriate given their growing prominence in the global economy. \n\nThere are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end.  Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions.  While such measures might generate temporary boosts to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs.  Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.  As an illustration, import substitution models that were pursued by many emerging market economies following the Second World War eventually led to lower long-term growth outcomes.  This was the experience in India, which helped trigger the reforms of the early 1990s. \n\nIn assessing the benefits and costs of trade, it is important to understand that a nation\u2019s trade balance reflects much more than its trade policy.  Just as important are the country\u2019s saving and investment spending proclivities, which are affected by many factors, including tax and fiscal policies.  For example, in the United States, we have a chronic trade deficit because domestic investment spending exceeds our domestic saving.  Foreign capital inflows make up the gap.  In this process, the foreign exchange value of the dollar plays an important equilibrating mechanism.  If the domestic saving/investment imbalance is unchanged, then any reduction in the trade balance from higher trade barriers will be offset by lower exports.  The domestic currency will appreciate to cause the trade deficit to widen to accommodate the desired capital inflows.  Thus, trade restrictions affect the composition of trade but not the gap between exports and imports, which is determined by the difference between domestic savings and investment.  At the end of the day, the protectionist country would produce more goods in sectors protected by higher trade barriers but also fewer goods for export.\n\nThe expectation that higher trade barriers would save jobs ignores these critical second-round effects.  Moreover, the story may not end there.  What happens if another country that now faces higher trade barriers responds by raising its own barriers?  That would push production even further out of high-value-added exports that are now deterred by the higher foreign trade barriers and into those exports that face lower trade barriers, or into the goods protected by the higher domestic trade barriers.  Raising trade barriers would risk setting off a trade war, which could damage economic growth prospects around the world. \n\nMeasures that raise trade barriers typically would protect lower-wage, import-competing jobs, but would also weigh on the prospects for jobs in the more efficient export sector, which tend to be higher-paying.  The outcome would be countries producing more where they have a competitive disadvantage, and less where they have a competitive advantage\u2014the exact opposite of what we should be aiming for.  For example, in the United States, one of our largest manufacturing exports is aerospace parts (which requires skilled labor) and one of our largest imports is apparel (which requires less skilled labor). \n\nThese second-round effects would also likely hurt productivity growth.  Scarce resources would be used less efficiently and trade protection would likely lessen the level of competitive pressure that helps drive innovation.  Moreover, lower productivity growth would likely lead to a slower improvement in a nation\u2019s living standards over time. \n\nThis negative consequence of higher trade barriers can be illustrated most starkly by the estimates of the costs per job saved through protectionist measures.  Researchers that have studied this closely estimate that the costs per job saved from protectionist measures in the United States typically run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  To illustrate, consider the case of import restrictions on Chinese tires.  The cost of a job saved was estimated at $900,000 per year while the measures were in place, or more than 20 times the average worker\u2019s compensation.5\n\nBetter Approaches to Deal With Globalization\n\nRather than protectionism, a better policy would be to help domestic workers and companies compete more effectively, rather than compete less.  We need additional mechanisms that allow us to more fully capture the benefits from liberalized trade and to more proactively mitigate its costs.  Ideally, policy should also better address job losses and income inequality from automation and other technological advances.\n\nHow we respond should depend on regional and industry circumstances.  These include the nature of trade impacts, the skill sets and location of the workers that have been affected, and the amount of resources that can be mobilized to facilitate adjustment. \n\nIncreasing specialization brings real economic benefits, but can also leave workers more exposed to shifts in demand for their services, potentially on short notice.  These issues are not going away, especially as emerging market economies take on a larger role in the global economy and automation continues apace.  If we are to maintain a more open trade regime, globalization must be socially and politically sustainable.  For that to be the case, we have to provide greater support to those who are hurt by trade. \n\nPolicies should include more assistance with job retraining, help with job search and mobility, and broader unemployment support.  We need to do more research into what measures have been effective in economies around the world, and we should encourage greater experimentation with new approaches.  Getting the balance right between providing assistance and making sure that individuals hurt by trade can get back on their feet and achieve their earning potential will be a challenge, and we need a better understanding of what actually works. \n\nMore generally, we need to do a better job positioning our workforce to cope with globalization and technological change.  This will involve improvements across a range of areas, including not only education and training, but also the business regulatory environment and infrastructure investment that could support greater worker mobility.  These measures would also promote higher productivity growth.  While the scope and scale of issues differ substantially by country, many of these policy areas may also be relevant in India. \n\nLastly, there are various measures available in current trade agreements, such as antidumping measures and countervailing duties for dealing with \u201cunfair\u201d trade, as well as escape clauses that provide safeguards for industries that face a sudden surge of imports.  Again, the challenge is to ensure that such measures are effective, that they help facilitate rather than retard adjustment, and that they are not abused so as to avoid foreign competition.  But, both sanctions and temporary relief have been provided for in global trade rules.  We should be willing to use them when their use would lead to more equitable outcomes and would help sustain political support for a more open trade regime. \n\nConclusion\n\nFree trade is a concept that remains compelling but periodically will be tested by economic change.  That is an inescapable fact of life and is a good thing because it requires the economics profession to articulate anew the value of a liberalized world trade regime.  While the value from trade is very high, the associated adjustment costs can be significant and will require greater attention if globalization is to work for all of us.\n\nThank you for your time. I would be happy to take some questions."

    "title": "Principles for Financial Regulatory Reform",
    "date": "Apr 7, 2017",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170407",
    "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today on the important topic of financial regulatory reform.  As always, what I have to say reflects my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nA robust financial system is central to our economic well-being.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession wreaked havoc on millions of American households and businesses, and much of this damage was due to a flawed regulatory framework.  In particular, many large banks and securities firms had inadequate capital and liquidity buffers, and the financial system had a number of important structural weaknesses that made it vulnerable to stress.  In response, legislators and regulators made significant changes to strengthen our regulatory framework.  Importantly, as we consider further changes, we must avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater. \n\nAs I see it, an effective regulatory regime for the financial system must do three things: \n\nIn contemplating changes to the regulatory regime, the good news is that the U.S. financial system is much sounder today than it was on the eve of the financial crisis.  The quantity and quality of capital and liquidity for U.S. banks have markedly improved, meaning that the banking industry can support the economy even under considerably more adverse economic conditions.  And, although returns on equity have dropped as balance sheet leverage has declined, banks remain profitable enough to cover their cost of capital and continue to serve their household and business customers.\n\nMuch of this progress is due to regulatory changes enacted since the crisis.  In addition to buttressing the capital and liquidity standards for major banks, the regulatory community has made significant strides in many other areas.  We developed a resolution framework for systemically important banks that better enables a failing bank to recapitalize with less risk to the rest of the financial system, and in a way that should not require taxpayer assistance.  We reformed key segments of the financial system such as the money market mutual fund industry.  We reduced the aggregate risk in the system by mandating the centralized clearing of OTC derivatives.  And, we strengthened the prudential oversight of those systemically important financial market utilities (FMUs) that clear such activity.  Collectively, these reforms make the system more robust and resilient to the failure of a large, systemically important institution.  Thus, we have made considerable progress toward ending a regime in which some financial firms were \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d  We want to avoid the unfortunate situation where authorities are faced with a Hobson\u2019s choice: save a failing firm to prevent it from taking down the entire financial system, or allow the firm to fail but risk the collapse of the financial system.\n\nNearly a decade ago, we suffered the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression.  In fact, we were perilously close to experiencing another depression.  The harm the crisis caused Americans can only be described as catastrophic.  From November 2008 to April 2009, the economy lost an average of 700,000 jobs per month.  Total employment in the United States fell by nine million jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to more than 10 percent.  There was also a broad-based decline in home prices\u2014about 30 percent on average, nationally.  As a result, nearly 8 million foreclosures occurred, and the homeownership rate declined to levels not seen since the late 1980s. \n\nThe crisis exposed many significant structural weaknesses in the U.S. and global financial systems.  Among them:\n\nWe should never forget how close we came to a full-blown depression, and we must resolve to never allow a return to conditions like those that existed prior to the financial crisis.\n\nThat said, it is entirely appropriate to take a critical look at the changes that were made to the regulatory regime.  While we do not yet have evidence of how these reforms will hold up during the next economic downturn, many have been in place long enough that we can begin to evaluate their efficacy.\n\nIn such an evaluation, we should keep in mind the three goals I mentioned in my introduction.  First, we must ensure that the probability of failure for a systemically important firm is exceedingly low.  Such a failure can lead to contagion that can damage a broad set of financial market participants, and impede the ability of the financial system to support the economy.  The failure of a single systemically important firm\u2014because of its size and interconnectedness\u2014can significantly weaken the entire financial system.  We saw this firsthand following the failure of Lehman Brothers.\n\nSecond, if a systemically important firm does fail, we must have mechanisms in place to minimize the damage to the rest of the financial system.  While we can make individual firms stronger, more robust and less prone to failure, I expect that there will still inevitably be failures in the future.  In principle, we could make individual institutions completely bulletproof in all possible environments. However, this would require such high levels of capital and liquidity that it would likely make them uncompetitive in their ability to provide financial services to their customers.\n\nThird, we must keep in place the structural changes that have made the global financial system less vulnerable to adverse shocks.\n\nSo, what does this imply when we consider revisions to the Dodd-Frank Act and other aspects of reform? \n\nCapital and Liquidity Standards\n\nIt is important to maintain appropriate capital and liquidity standards for large, complex firms to mitigate external shocks and the risks they pose to the economy.  In particular, we need to maintain our focus on firms whose impairment would have significant negative consequences for the rest of the financial system.  Effective capital and liquidity standards help to limit these adverse consequences.  At the same time, they work against conferring a competitive advantage to large banks from a perception that they may be too big to fail.  Accordingly, large financial firms have had to more than double their stock of high-quality capital since the crisis. \n\nPrior to the financial crisis, large financial firms were not required to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to protect against runs, and, as a result, several would have failed if not for extraordinary government intervention.  Today, the liquidity buffers for large financial firms have dramatically improved in terms of both their size and quality.  This is due in part to investors\u2019 demands, but also to the efforts by regulators and supervisors in the United States and abroad to develop appropriate liquidity standards for large banking institutions. \n\nSome have argued that capital standards alone would be sufficient to mitigate the risks of failure.  I am not convinced.  As I just noted, the crisis clearly demonstrated the added importance of liquidity, as the firms that failed appeared to have been appropriately capitalized based on traditional regulatory metrics at the time.\n\nMoreover, I strongly favor a system of capital and liquidity requirements that is harmonized on a global basis.  Some believe that the United States should no longer participate in international forums\u2014such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2014that discuss and recommend minimum capital and liquidity standards for global banking institutions.  The argument is made that these international bodies are dictating to and constraining the choices of the United States.  That is simply not the case.  The Basel standards and other international efforts actually benefit the United States and its banks.  In the preponderance of cases, agreements struck in these forums raise international standards closer to existing U.S. standards.  Establishing a more level playing field enhances the competitiveness of internationally active U.S. firms.  It also makes the global financial system safer by ensuring that foreign banks are subject to appropriate standards that cover their global operations.  This protects the U.S. households and businesses that transact with these banks in the United States and abroad.2 \n\nAlso, it is important to note that the recommendations of these international standard-setters are not automatically legally binding in the United States.  They do not go into effect unless they are adopted by a U.S. authority acting under U.S. laws following an administrative process. They are also subject to a period of public notice and comment.  When appropriate, U.S. authorities have adopted different standards than those proposed in international forums. \n\nFinally, following the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve developed a capital stress testing supervisory program\u2014known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).  CCAR has become an integral part of ensuring appropriate capital levels.  By imposing a discipline of forward-looking capital assessment on our largest firms, CCAR helps protect the safety and soundness of the largest financial institutions\u2014and therefore the stability of the entire financial system.\n\nThe CCAR process consists of two parts.  First, the quantitative assessment evaluates whether a firm holds a sufficiently large capital buffer so that it can continue to be a viable financial intermediary even in a stressed market and macroeconomic environment.  Second, the qualitative assessment evaluates whether the firm\u2019s risk management and capital planning processes are well-developed and well-governed.  CCAR has helped to strengthen the capital levels of the largest financial institutions, and has pushed these firms to steadily improve their risk management and capital planning processes.\n\nResolution\n\nWe also must have an effective resolution mechanism that allows a firm to fail without threatening to bring down the entire financial system.  We are not quite there yet\u2014given some of the challenges in executing resolution on a cross-border basis\u2014but we have made significant progress.  In particular, I would point to two developments that are especially important.\n\nThe FDIC and the Federal Reserve have used the authority provided by Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act to oversee the so-called \u201cliving will\u201d process\u2014the resolution planning that large financial firms must do as a contingency for their potential failure.  Developing living wills necessitates that firms and regulators consider, in advance, how bankruptcy can serve as the basis for resolution, and take actions to address any obstacles to an orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code.  This effort has helped to reduce the complexity of large financial firms and has made them better positioned to enter bankruptcy without imposing large costs on society.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve recently finalized a rule that requires systemically important bank holding companies to have minimum levels of total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). Firms are expected to meet this requirement mainly via the issuance of long-term debt by the holding company parent. In bankruptcy, this debt could be used to recapitalize these firms and would be available to absorb any additional losses. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created a \u201clast resort\u201d option for the resolution of a large financial firm\u2014Title II Orderly Liquidation Authority.  This authority can be triggered only in special circumstances, and requires the action of a number of regulatory and fiscal authorities. \n\nThere is an understandable reluctance for the government to be directly involved in resolving a large firm.  It creates the perception that the largest firms get special advantages.  This is why many would prefer to eliminate Title II and rely exclusively on a bankruptcy process.3\n\nBut, if we were to rely on ordinary bankruptcy rather than Title II for the resolution of a systemically important financial firm, we would need to ensure that the bankruptcy regime would work in a way that does not destabilize the financial system.  First, such a regime would need to enable a systemically important firm to initiate a resolution strategy over a weekend while markets are closed so that the firm\u2019s subsidiaries could continue to operate.  Otherwise, the remaining franchise value of the troubled firm would quickly evaporate and we would experience significant contagion across the financial system.  Second, there would need to be a credible liquidity backstop for the restructured firm in place by Sunday evening when Asian markets open.  Many of the troubled firm\u2019s counterparties would undoubtedly initially run because the cost of doing so would be very small.  They would be especially likely to do so if there were no credible liquidity backstop.  Debtor-in-possession financing would not be not a viable option because it simply would not likely be available in a timely manner and on the scale\u2014potentially hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014needed to fill the hole created when counterparties run away from a systemically important financial institution. \n\nThere is also another difficulty.  In the event of a financial holding company\u2019s bankruptcy restructuring, there are limits on the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to lend to subsidiaries that continue to operate.  The Federal Reserve has the legal authority to lend through the discount window against a subsidiary bank\u2019s high-quality collateral, with appropriate haircuts.  But, under existing laws and regulations, the Federal Reserve cannot lend to the securities affiliates.  Moreover, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act restricts the commercial bank subsidiary of a systemically important firm from on-lending the funds borrowed from the Fed to its broker-dealer\u2014even if the broker-dealer has good collateral to pledge against the loan. \n\nPut simply, in today\u2019s legal and regulatory regime, there is a large potential liquidity gap.  There is not a credible liquidity backstop for a broker-dealer in bankruptcy.  In contrast, Title II provides for temporary funding through the Orderly Liquidation Fund, which can support the resolution of the recapitalized entity, including the broker-dealer.  This means that if one were to eliminate Title II, one should develop an alternative means to provide a temporary, comprehensive liquidity backstop to the restructured firm.\n\nReforms to Market Structure\n\nWe should also keep in place the key structural reforms of financial markets that are making the financial system safer.  In my mind, the most important of these include money market mutual fund reform, tri-party repo reform, and the mandate for the centralized clearing of OTC derivatives.  In each case, the post-crisis structural reforms have made the system more resilient to the potential insolvency of a major financial institution.  As a result, the level of stress placed upon the entire financial system by the failure of a single firm should be considerably lessened.\n\nAs part of this, we must maintain the capability for robust oversight of key FMUs.  Centralized clearing is a beneficial development for financial markets.  It reduces the amount of risk in the system by facilitating the netting of exposures to the central clearing party.  As a result, centralized clearing makes the financial system more resilient and enables greater efficiency and transparency for trading counterparties.  However, the trade-off for these benefits is that more residual risk is now concentrated in the FMUs.  Consequently, it is important to retain the protections contained in the regulatory framework provided by Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act.  We must ensure that FMUs are appropriately supervised and can withstand the failure of one or two of their largest counterparties and continue to operate.\n\nWorth Another Look\n\nSo, what hasn\u2019t worked as well as we might have expected, or might be less crucial in light of the principles that I discussed earlier? \n\nFirst, I would start with regulations for small and medium-sized banking institutions.  As I discussed earlier, we must ensure that the firms whose failure could impose the greatest costs on ordinary borrowers and savers have the capital, liquidity and risk management standards appropriate to that risk.  But, the majority of banks in the United States do not come close to falling into this category.  For smaller institutions, the regulatory and compliance burdens can be considerably lighter because the failure of such a firm will not impose large costs or stress on the broader financial system. \n\nAlso, we must recognize that smaller firms have less ability to spread added compliance costs across their business.  All else equal, an increase in compliance burden can create an unintended competitive advantage for larger institutions.  We should also recognize the important role that smaller banking institutions have in supporting local communities around the country.  The ability to lend to local businesses often depends on close bank-customer relationships, and on knowledge that is often difficult to develop when the home office is very distant.\n\nThere have been efforts by regulators at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere to reduce the regulatory requirements for such institutions, and that is something that we should continue to work on.  Lawmakers could also evaluate statutory thresholds to see if they should be raised to apply to fewer, larger institutions.  For example, the Dodd-Frank Act sets a higher prudential regime for those firms with $50 billion or more in assets.  I believe that this threshold could be raised significantly without unduly increasing the risk to the broader financial system.\n\nSecond, policymakers might reexamine the implementation of the Volcker Rule to ensure that it is efficiently achieving its policy objectives.  The fact is that most market-making activity has an element of proprietary trading.  The market maker that bids successfully often does so based on a view on which way the market might be headed in the near term.  Thus, the line between market-making and proprietary trading is not always clear-cut, which makes regulation in this space difficult. \n\nSome market participants have argued that the Volcker Rule has contributed to the decline in market liquidity of corporate bonds.  Although I view the evidence on this point as inconclusive, it may be worth considering giving greater discretion to trading desks that facilitate client business to intervene when markets are illiquid and volatile.  Also, community banks are subject to the Volcker Rule even though they typically do not engage in proprietary trading, or sponsor or retain ownership interests in hedge funds or private equity funds.  This seems like an unnecessary burden that drives up compliance costs without a significant corresponding public benefit, so we also should exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule.\n\nThird, although CCAR is a vital part of our bank regulatory toolkit, I believe that we should consider changes that might lessen the burden it places on banks.  In this vein, the Federal Reserve recently removed the CCAR qualitative assessment for large, non-complex firms.  This is a good example of identifying regulatory burdens that are not worth the cost.  We are also considering the implementation of a stress capital buffer that would better align the dynamic stress capital requirements of CCAR with our more static, point-in-time regulatory capital rules.  Other potential adjustments include changes to the assumptions about the pace of a firm\u2019s planned dividend and share repurchases, and how a firm in a stressed environment would likely manage its balance sheet and business footprint.\n\nThe financial crisis provided a vivid reminder that a well-functioning financial system is a necessary condition for a vibrant economy.  The efficient intermediation of funding from savers to borrowers supports economic activity and, over time, raises living standards.  This means that we need a financial system that is robust and resilient to shocks.  Most of the changes that have been implemented since the financial crisis have moved us in this direction, and it is important that any new changes to laws and regulations be grounded in what we have learned.  Our central purpose must be to ensure a safe and sound financial system that efficiently provides financing to households and businesses through the ups and downs of the business cycle.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

    "title": "Opening Remarks at the Economic Press Briefing on Household Borrowing, Student Debt Trends and Homeownership",

    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",

    "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the New York Fed\u2019s Economic Press Briefing.  Today, we will focus on recent developments in household borrowing, with special attention on student debt.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nFollowing a period of steady deleveraging that began during the Great Recession, households have gradually increased their borrowing during the past three years.  Later this year, total household debt is expected to reach its previous peak, from the third quarter of 2008.  Given past experience, one might wonder whether this level of indebtedness is sustainable or a reason for concern.  Answering this question requires a fuller consideration of household balance sheets and a deeper analysis of who is indebted.  The increase in liabilities in recent years has been accompanied by significant improvements in the value of assets held by households, due to strong growth in housing and stock prices.  Moreover, household incomes have been rising at a moderate pace due to sturdy job gains and modest wage increases.  As a result, the household sector\u2019s financial condition today is in unusually good shape for this point in the economic cycle.  In relative terms, household indebtedness is low, and\u2014thanks in part to low interest rates\u2014debt service burdens relative to household income have fallen to levels not seen since at least the early 1980s.\n\nAs we will show in today\u2019s presentation, compared to 2008, a greater proportion of overall debt today is now held by older households that have higher and more stable incomes and more experience as borrowers, on average.  Consequently, a much larger proportion of debt is currently held by borrowers with higher credit scores.  The resulting higher overall debt quality is reflected in historically low overall delinquency rates.  Transition rates into new delinquency are below the levels of the early 2000s, and foreclosure and bankruptcy rates in 2016 are the lowest since our data series began in 1999.\n\nNotwithstanding this overall rosy picture, the improvement in aggregate debt quality and performance conceals important underlying changes in debt holdings that could be consequential, with implications for the housing market and for consumer spending over the longer term.  While older borrowers hold more debt of all types, there has been a significant shift among younger people toward student debt and away from mortgage and other debt.  Student debt has increased more than fivefold over the past 14 years, with more young adults taking out loans and borrowing larger average amounts.  And, while debt delinquency rates overall have fallen, those for student debt have remained elevated.\n\nSince 2012, the New York Fed has devoted considerable attention to the rapid growth in student debt levels and delinquencies by publishing a number of reports.  The findings in these reports were largely based on data from our Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a nationally representative dataset sourced from Equifax credit reports.  This unique dataset has enabled us to provide new insights into the overall state of the student loan market and into individual student loan borrowing and repayment behavior not available from other data sources.\n\nToday, we will first provide a brief overview of aggregate household debt and its borrowers, followed by a presentation based on new research on student debt, which focuses on delinquency and repayment rates.  We find that recent cohorts of college students are defaulting at a lower rate than those who left higher education during the recession.  But, at the same time, their repayment rates are also lower.  Despite an improving labor market, overall delinquency rates on student debt remain stubbornly high, and repayment progress has slowed further, likely reflecting the recent introduction of more accommodative payment plans.  Payment progress is particularly low for those with larger debts and for those from lower-income areas.\n\nMuch remains to be learned about the causes of the observed expansion of debt burdens and repayment problems among recent college graduates.  Over the past two decades, there has been a significant change in the financing of higher education\u2014with state and local funding covering a smaller share, and students and their families bearing a greater proportion of rising college costs.  While the federal student loan program has undoubtedly helped mitigate the impact of higher costs on college enrollment, more students now leave college with higher amounts of debt.  At the same time, college dropout rates remain stubbornly high, and empirical evidence indicates that graduates from some colleges have had trouble finding good-paying jobs.\n\nAnother important question concerns the consequences of growing student debt for the overall economy.  To investigate this question further, we linked our CCP dataset to student enrollment records from the National Student Clearinghouse in order to analyze the relationship between homeownership, educational attainment and student debt.  Not surprisingly, our research shows a strong positive association between educational attainment and homeownership, consistent with the fact that higher educational attainment is associated with higher average earnings.  Interestingly, this relationship appears to hold irrespective of family background, suggesting that colleges may be successful in \u201cleveling the playing field\u201d across students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nAt the same time, our analysis reveals that those with significant student debt are much less likely to own a home at any given age than those who completed their education with little or no student debt.  This finding is consistent with other past and ongoing research here at the New York Fed that points to the potential longer-term negative implications of student debt on homeownership and other types of consumer spending.  Of course, homeownership is more than just consumption\u2014it has historically been an important form of wealth accumulation.  For a large share of households, housing equity is the principal form of wealth.  Thus, changes in the way we finance post-secondary education could also have important implications for the distribution of wealth.\n\nBefore turning it over to my colleagues, I would like to comment briefly on the importance of college costs, financing and access to higher education.  It is well known that the average earnings premium from having a college education is high and has risen over the past few decades, in part because of a decline in real average earnings for those without a college degree.  In addition to higher earnings, a college education is associated with increased homeownership, as I just discussed.  The economic and social returns to having a well-educated and skilled labor force are also well documented.  However, I would like to highlight another important role of higher education: it is a pathway to and engine of upward income mobility.\n\nI believe that income mobility\u2014the degree to which individuals or families can move up or down in the income distribution over time\u2014is a foundational element for a well-functioning society and indicates the ability of an economy to provide opportunities for all.  As I have discussed previously, important research by Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his co-authors has shown that intergenerational income mobility in the United States\u2014a child\u2019s chances of moving up in the income distribution relative to his or her parents\u2014has remained stable over the past half century.2   However, because of the increase in income inequality and stagnant or declining incomes for the least well-off, the consequences of being born to low- versus high-income parents are greater today than in the past.  These trends have contributed to a steady decline in \u201cabsolute\u201d upward income mobility in the United States, as defined by the share of children who earn more in real terms than their parents.  This fraction has fallen from 90 percent to 50 percent over the past half century.\n\nRecent work by Chetty and his co-authors has investigated the importance of higher education in achieving upward mobility.  They find that many highly qualified lower-income students do not attend selective colleges, while those low- and middle-income students who do\u2014despite facing greater challenges\u2014fare almost as well as affluent students who attend the same colleges.  Their research also indicates that some colleges are better engines of upward income mobility than others, and that colleges that offered the largest number of low-income students pathways to upward mobility have become less accessible to them during the 2000s.  As a result, higher-education\u2019s contribution to increasing intergenerational mobility has diminished.\n\nIt is unclear why access has fallen to colleges with relatively high mobility rates.  One possibility is that recent budget cuts may have forced these colleges\u2014which tend to be mid-tier public institutions\u2014to raise tuition and change their admissions policies more than other institutions, such as less budget-constrained elite private institutions.  Empirical evidence points to a greater sensitivity to college costs in the higher education decisions of low-income populations.  As a result, continued increases in college costs and debt burdens could inhibit higher education\u2019s ability to serve as an important engine of upward income mobility.  In my view, these developments are important and deserve increased attention.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I will now turn it over to Wilbert van der Klaauw, who will give a brief overview of the current state of household debt."

    "content": "It is a pleasure to be here today.  I would like to thank the University of South Florida for sponsoring this conference.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1 \n\nOne aspect of today\u2019s event is the dedication of a financial laboratory to help students learn about financial markets, which I think has great value.  Knowledge of how financial markets operate is an important aspect of financial and economic literacy, and it leads to greater financial security over time.  For example, one important lesson is that when the promised returns on an investment offering are extraordinarily high, it is because the investment is either very risky or fraudulent.  When investing, it is important to remember that if it seems to be too good to be true, it likely is!\n\nToday, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the importance of financial markets in influencing the economic outlook and, in turn, U.S. monetary policy.  This is a subject near and dear to my heart.  Nearly 20 years ago\u2014when I was working in the private sector\u2014my colleagues and I introduced an index of financial conditions.2  I believe that my long-standing focus on financial conditions has, over time, helped me become a better economic forecaster.  And, I am pleased that economists and analysts increasingly incorporate financial conditions into their assessments of the economic outlook.\n\nAs I will argue, financial conditions in the United States play an important role in influencing economic conditions.  Because movements in financial markets are a major factor influencing broader financial conditions, it is necessary to understand how financial market developments can affect the economic outlook and, therefore, the appropriate setting of monetary policy.  But, this story gets more complicated, as the setting of monetary policy, in turn, affects market developments and financial conditions.  This two-way feedback is an important feature of the interaction between financial conditions and monetary policy.\n\nTo begin, let me be clear about what we mean by \u201cfinancial conditions.\u201d  Focusing on the United States, financial conditions can be broadly summarized by five key measures: short- and long-term Treasury rates, credit spreads, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and equity prices.  Although many other measures and prices can also be included in one\u2019s assessment, I think these five are the most essential.3 \n\nIn the conduct of monetary policy, the FOMC does not have targets for either specific components of financial conditions or for financial conditions more broadly.  We care about financial conditions not for themselves, but instead for how they can affect economic activity and ultimately our ability to achieve the statutory objectives of the Federal Reserve\u2014maximum employment and price stability.  Let me provide a few examples.  A decline in mortgage rates can lift the demand for owner-occupied housing and support construction activity.  A rise in equity prices can boost household wealth, which is one factor that underpins consumer spending.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar can affect the relative competitiveness of importers and exporters, which, in turn, influences the country\u2019s trade performance.  Narrower credit spreads can reduce the cost of capital for business and help support greater business investment.\n\nIn sum, financial conditions affect households\u2019 and firms\u2019 saving and investment plans, and, therefore, play a key role in influencing economic activity and the economic outlook.  This is why the evaluation of financial conditions is so crucial in the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nThe FOMC traditionally implements monetary policy by adjusting the federal funds rate\u2014the short-term interest rate paid by banks that borrow reserves from other financial institutions.  However, few economic decisions directly depend on the federal funds rate.  Rather, changes in the federal funds rate affect the economy through their impact on other interest rates, which, consequently, influence broader financial conditions.  If financial conditions moved predictably with the policy rate, then there would be no need for the FOMC to focus on financial conditions.  In such a world, by adjusting the level of the federal funds rate, the FOMC could be fully confident that it could generate the appropriate financial conditions necessary to support achievement of full employment and price stability.\n\nIn fact, the response of financial conditions to changes in short-term interest rates is not rigid and predictable.  Instead, as we shall see shortly, the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial conditions changes over time, as it is influenced by a whole host of other factors.  Recent evidence suggests that even the relation between short-term and long-term rates has shifted substantially over the past 15 years.4  Moreover, at times, we have observed cases in which financial conditions did not move in the same direction as the monetary policy stance.  Let me highlight two recent divergences which indicate that we need to keep a separate eye on the evolution of financial conditions. \n\nThe first occurred in the mid-2000s.  In June 2004, the FOMC decided to begin raising the federal funds rate target in order to remove policy accommodation.  It raised the target in 25-basis-point increments at 17 consecutive meetings, pushing the rate up from a starting point of 1.0 percent to a peak of 5.25 percent.  Despite this tightening of monetary policy over two years, financial conditions failed to tighten in a similar manner.  This can be seen by looking at the behavior of well-known measures of financial conditions during this period (Exhibit 1).  The rise in short-term rates was offset by a decline in long-term yields, a rise in equity prices and narrower credit spreads. \n\nIn contrast, there have been times when financial conditions tightened even as the FOMC reduced short-term interest rates.  For example, consider what happened during the heart of the financial crisis.  Even as the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate in the fall of 2008\u2014eventually hitting its effective lower bound that December\u2014credit spreads widened sharply, household and business loan underwriting standards tightened sharply, liquidity in many financial markets dried up, and the U.S. stock market plummeted.  Financial conditions tightened despite the aggressive easing of monetary policy during this period.\n\nThere are many explanations for why the relationship between the federal funds rate and financial conditions is so variable.  Without being exhaustive, let me highlight three.  First, animal spirits in financial markets wax and wane, pushing asset values up or down in a manner that can more than offset the effects of movements in short-term interest rates.  The movements in many financial markets following last year\u2019s presidential election are a notable example of this phenomenon.  Second, domestic financial conditions are influenced by what happens abroad.  If the monetary policy of major U.S. trading partners becomes easier relative to policy in the United States, then it could lead to a dollar appreciation that would weigh on U.S. trade performance, all else equal.  Third, financial instability and stress can cause risk-averse investors to increase their demand for safe assets.  This can push up risk premia and credit spreads, and push down stock prices\u2014which can more than offset the impact of an easier monetary policy. \n\nDivergences between short-term interest rates and financial conditions often appear to be larger and more persistent in the United States than in most other advanced economies.  There are several reasons for this.  First, the U.S. financial system depends less on its banking system to intermediate financial flows than in other countries.  The share of credit supplied by the banking sector fluctuates around 50 percent in the United States, which is much lower than in the euro area, Japan and the United Kingdom (Exhibit 2).  Second, in contrast to most other countries, U.S. residential housing is financed mainly by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, rather than\u2014as is the case in most other countries\u2014adjustable-rate mortgages with rates that much more closely track their central banks\u2019 short-term interest rate targets.  Third, the equity market plays a much more important role in the United States than elsewhere.  The total market capitalization of the U.S. equity market is considerably higher than in the euro area and Japan (Exhibit 3).\n\nBecause the evolution of financial conditions can diverge from the path of the federal funds rate, financial conditions need to be carefully considered in the conduct of monetary policy.  However, I want to reiterate that what we care about is not financial conditions themselves, but rather their influence on economic activity.  Accordingly, we should care much more about longer-term movements in financial conditions than about higher-frequency, transitory movements.  That is because behavior in firms and households will be influenced much more by how financial conditions evolve over time, rather than by where they happen to be at a particular moment.\n\nTo emphasize this point, let me give two contrasting examples\u2014one where financial conditions moved sharply but not persistently, and another where financial conditions moved systematically over a longer time period.  We will see that it is the long-lived movements that have the largest influence on the economic outlook. \n\nFor the first example, consider the U.S. equity market in 1987.  The S&P 500 index began the year at 242, shot up to a peak of 337 in August (an increase of almost 40 percent) and plummeted to a trough of 225 in October (a fall of 33 percent).  When the stock market fell more than 20 percent on October 19th\u2014which came to be known as \u201cBlack Monday\u201d\u2014many feared that the decline would lead to a recession.  After all, that crash was the largest-ever one-day percentage decline of the U.S. stock market.  But, no recession occurred.  Importantly, households sustained their spending despite the sharp decline in household wealth.  This happened, in part, because household spending had not yet responded much to the sharp run-up in stock prices earlier in the year, so consumer spending turned out to be relatively insensitive to the market\u2019s sharp reversal.  In addition, the damage from the sharp stock market decline was mitigated by the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment \u201cto serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.\u201d5\n\nA contrasting example is the sharp appreciation of the dollar that began in 1978 and reached a peak in March 1985.  The persistent strength of the dollar had a significant negative consequence for U.S. trade performance.  Our trade deficit widened sharply in 1985 and 1986, which contributed to the sharp slowdown in U.S. manufacturing production growth\u2014and a milder slowdown in GDP growth\u2014over this period. \n\nThis leads to an important question:  When should the FOMC take changes in financial conditions into consideration in its conduct of monetary policy?  I don\u2019t think there is a simple answer.  Financial conditions matter in influencing the economic outlook, but so do many other factors.  It is true that monitoring financial conditions can help improve the effectiveness of the policy decision-making process.  However, as I hope is clear from my previous examples, there is no mechanical link between policy rates and financial conditions that monetary policymakers can systematically rely upon to set policy.\n\nAnother key question is what one should focus on in assessing financial conditions.  Again, I don\u2019t think there is a simple answer, as the significance of any particular aspect of changes in financial conditions depends on the economic circumstances and environment.  In the early- to mid-2000s, the combination of looser mortgage underwriting practices and home equity withdrawal were major financial factors contributing to that economic expansion.  The subsequent housing crash was exacerbated by the sharp reversals of mortgage lending standards and home equity withdrawal, which together contributed to the severity of the Great Recession.  Today, these factors seem less important because lending practices in the housing market have been much more stable in recent years.\n\nThe importance and complexity of financial conditions also underscore the need for caution in following any mechanical monetary policy rule.  For example, the most well-known rule\u2014the Taylor Rule\u2014does not explicitly take financial conditions into account in terms of its monetary policy prescription.  In that rule, the federal funds rate depends only on the deviations of output from its potential and inflation from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent objective, and on the level of the real short-term interest rate consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy.  Because the interactions can shift between financial conditions and the economic outlook\u2014as well as between financial conditions and the federal funds rate\u2014the absence of financial conditions in this rule can cause it to perform poorly as a guide for monetary policy.\n\nAs a case in point, consider what the 1999 variant of the Taylor Rule indicated as the appropriate monetary policy setting in September 2008, just prior to the failure of Lehman Brothers.  In the Bluebook document that the Federal Reserve Board staff prepared for the September 2008 FOMC meeting, the 1999 Taylor Rule called for a federal funds rate setting of 3.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2008, well above the 2 percent setting at the time of the meeting.  The standard 1993 Taylor Rule\u2014which puts a greater weight on inflation\u2014called for an even higher federal funds rate target of 4.1 percent.  Given the rapid deterioration in financial conditions, instead of following the prescription from these rules, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate rapidly over the next three months, pushing the federal funds rate down to a range of 0 to a quarter of 1 percent by year-end.\n\nConsistent with this episode, such rules often perform poorly at times when the economic environment and outlook are rapidly changing.  This is one important reason why I do not support proposals that would require the Federal Reserve to explain to Congress whenever its federal funds rate target deviates from a particular prescriptive monetary policy rule.  As Federal Reserve Chair Yellen explained in a recent speech, not only are there a plethora of rules to choose from, but following any monetary policy rule in a perfunctory manner would likely lead to inappropriate monetary policy at times\u2014especially during economic turning points when the outlook is changing rapidly.6 \n\nAlso, requiring the Federal Reserve Chair to explain frequently why the FOMC had deviated from a particular rule would unduly impinge on the ability of the FOMC to conduct monetary policy in a manner insulated from short-term political considerations.  Of course, Congress has the right to hear from the Federal Reserve about its conduct of U.S. monetary policy.  There are already several opportunities, including regular testimony and semiannual monetary policy reports.  If Congress desires, such communications could become more frequent or enhanced.  But, my point is that these exchanges should not be triggered by deviations from a mechanical rule.  And, of course, I feel that this is especially true for a rule that does not account for financial conditions. \n\nNow that I have expounded upon the importance of financial conditions, I would like to discuss their implications for the current stance of U.S. monetary policy.  As I see it, there were a number of factors behind the FOMC\u2019s decision in March to take another step in gradually removing accommodation by raising the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points to a range of three quarters of a percent to 1 percent. \n\nMost importantly, the economy has continued to grow modestly above its sustainable long-term pace.  This has led to continued, sturdy monthly job gains and a gradual diminution of the amount of slack in the U.S. labor market.  Forward-looking indicators foreshadow a continuation of this trend.  For example, household and business confidence has increased markedly over the past few months. \n\nThe economic outlook abroad also appears to have brightened.  Growth has picked up in Europe. Commodity prices have risen, reducing the pressure on emerging market economies that are major commodity exporters.  There are still significant uncertainties and risks abroad, but overall, these risks seem significantly lower than they were a year ago. \n\nInflation has moved closer to our 2 percent longer-run objective.  Headline inflation on a year-over-year basis has moved up in the past few months as the sharp declines in energy prices in late 2015 and early 2016 have fallen out of the calculation.  Core inflation\u2014which ignores the more volatile movements in energy and food prices\u2014also has moved slightly higher.  Over the 12 months through January 2017, the core personal consumption expenditure deflator has risen at about 1.75 percent, up from 1.6 percent a year earlier.  Thus, I have become more confident that inflation will stabilize around the FOMC\u2019s objective over the medium term. \n\nWhile there is still considerable uncertainty about fiscal policy and its potential contribution to economic activity, it seems likely that it will shift over time to a more stimulative setting.  Consequently, it appears that the risks for both economic growth and inflation over the medium to longer term may be shifting gradually to the upside. \n\nEven after the latest increase, the federal funds rate target range at three quarters of a percent to 1 percent is still unusually low in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms.  While most FOMC participants judge the equilibrium short-term real interest rate that is consistent with a neutral monetary policy to be low\u2014perhaps in a range of 0 to 1 percent\u2014this is still above the current inflation-adjusted federal funds rate.  In such circumstances, it seems appropriate to scale back monetary policy accommodation gradually in order to reduce the risk of the economy overheating, and to avoid a significant inflation overshoot in the medium term. \n\nFinally, prior to the March FOMC meeting, financial conditions were generally easing rather than becoming tighter, even as the FOMC raised its policy rate in December and market participants increasingly expected further policy tightening in the coming year.  Between the December and March FOMC meetings, U.S. equity prices rose by about 4 percent, and credit spreads, such as those for high-yield bonds, narrowed.  Long-term yields and the trade-weighted dollar were little changed over this period.\n\nWilliam McChesney Martin, the ninth chair of the FOMC, once famously opined that the Federal Reserve is \u201cin the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.\u201d  I don\u2019t think we are removing the punch bowl, yet.  We\u2019re just adding a bit more fruit juice. \n\nBefore I conclude, let me make a few comments about the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet.  As you are undoubtedly aware, the Federal Reserve dramatically expanded the size of its balance sheet during and following the financial crisis to provide accommodation to support the economy when short-term interest rates were constrained by their effective lower bound.  Currently, we are reinvesting maturing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities repayments to keep the size of the balance sheet generally stable.  We have said that we plan to continue this policy of reinvestment until we are well along in the process of normalizing the level of the federal funds rate.  As the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate three times, this process seems to have proceeded smoothly so far, prompting renewed interest in our balance sheet and reinvestment policy.\n\nThe anticipation of and actual announcement by the FOMC of changes in reinvestment policy is likely to push up longer-term interest rates and tighten financial conditions somewhat, just as the earlier purchases pushed down long-term interest rates.  To what extent is difficult to judge.  Presumably, financial conditions would tighten by more if we were to end reinvestments earlier and more abruptly.  This suggests a better course may be to taper reinvestments gradually and predictably. \n\nIn addition, because changes in reinvestment policy will likely tighten financial conditions, we will have to take this into account in our interest rate decisions.  My view is that reducing the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet and raising short-term interest rates are two different, yet related, ways of removing monetary policy accommodation.  Therefore, I would expect that, when we begin to end reinvestment, we will have to consider the implications for the appropriate short-term interest rate trajectory.\n\nIn conclusion, financial conditions are important.  They matter enormously to monetary policy because their movements can often diverge from the trajectory of short-term rates, and because they affect economic activity and the economic outlook.  While it is essential to account for financial conditions appropriately in conducting monetary policy, it is also important not to overreact to every short-term wiggle in financial markets.  In addition, it is important to remember that the policy goal is not the level of financial conditions per se, but the achievement of the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate objectives.  Sometimes, that will be consistent with easing financial conditions, and at other times, it will be consistent with tighter financial conditions.  At all times, our focus will be on achieving our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, thereby supporting the livelihoods of households and businesses throughout the United States.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

    "content": "Dr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nPresident Dudley, can you please share with us the purpose of your trip here today to Queens?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nSo, there are 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the United States, and one of them is the Federal Reserve Bank in New York that sits downtown in Manhattan, and near Wall Street. Our Second District consists of New York, Northern New Jersey, Fairfield County, Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Haven't gotten to the Virgin Islands yet.\n\nAs part of our Mission, we want to represent the communities in our District, and so four times a year, I get on the road, and I go out to visit people, to find out what's really happening on the ground. It's meeting with businesses, meeting with people from educational institutions, going to visit manufacturing facilities, community development organizations.\n\nIt's really designed to do two things. One, explain sort of a little bit of what we do \u2013 like for example there, in the introduction, talking about this BIS. What the heck is the BIS?  Well, BIS is a bank for central banks that sits in Basel, Switzerland.  In fact, what did I do last weekend?  Well, I was in Basel, Switzerland, at the BIS. This is where central bankers get together from across the world, exchange information with one another.\n\nSo, the first thing is to explain ourselves to people in the community. Because the Federal Reserve is pretty mysterious in terms of \u2013 when I went to grad school even, I wasn't really sure again what the Federal Reserve was. Had to be explained to me.\n\nThe second thing we do in the community, and this is the more important piece, is to really learn what's going on, on the ground, in the community. What's happening in terms of businesses \u2013 are they successful? If they're having trouble, what are the reasons for the trouble? Do they have access to the credit? Can they find people with the job skills they need to support their businesses?  What are the challenges in the community, in terms of education, in terms of transportation?\n\nQueens, one of the issues is that if you're not located near a subway line, it's pretty hard to get around in Queens, and that has pretty significant implications for people's ability to get to and from work, which is important in terms of economic development.\n\nAnother issue is the affordability of housing. Queens is actually doing quite well. If you look at the employment growth in Queens over the last few years, it's been very strong. Just like New York City as a whole. But one of the consequences of economic development can be gentrification, where richer people move in and they make housing less affordable for people who have been living here for a much longer period of time.\n\nSo, all these type of issues that we talk about when we visit. And oftentimes I get some personal stories and anecdotes that are actually pretty valuable to me in terms of how I think about how the economy is operating and what we need to do as the Federal Reserve in terms of how we set monetary policy.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. The economy is coming out of a serious crisis that started in 2008. From your perspective, where do you see the greatest growth in the economy right now?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, the good news is the economy is actually in a pretty good place right now. Not for everybody, but if you think about the unemployment rate today, it's 4.7%, which is pretty close to what we think is full employment. You could probably push that unemployment rate even lower, but if you did, you'd probably start to have an inflation problem. So, that would not be something that you could sustain over the longer term. The Federal Reserve has two missions: maximum sustainable employment and price stability. And so we're trying to find that balance. Right now we're doing pretty well. We're pretty close to both our objectives. In fact, if you could tell me that we could just stay here for the next 20 or 30 years, I would be very happy with that.\n\nSo, things are going pretty well. What's driving the economy? I think in the local economy in Queens, it's very dependent on transportation, very high level of transportation employment, in part because of La Guardia and JFK. Those industries are doing quite well.\n\nTourism is important to this region, so New York City has really benefited from tourism. And the fact that people want to live in cities now as opposed to live in suburbs or more rural areas is also helping a lot.\n\nIn terms of actual employment in this area, you have the transportation component.  Healthcare is also very, very important. A lot of uncertainties on that front. Maybe we'll get some resolution of some of those uncertainties today. Also business and professional services is a very important driver of growth in this area.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. From your perspective, which sector do you think is actually propelling the growth?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think \u2013 one thing that's been really good for New York City over the last few years, it's become much more diversified as an economy. In the old days, New York City was sort of rise and fall, depending on how the financial services industry was doing, especially the securities industry. And what's happened in the last few years is the securities industry employment has been pretty flat. And the securities industry, while they're making some money, it's not at all as profitable as it was back in the days of 2005, 2006, before the great financial crisis. Now that profitability was a little bit ephemeral because it was not built on a strong foundation.\n\nSince then, the city I think has become a lot more diversified. Tourism has become more important. Technology \u2013 the technology sector really is about the same size now as the financial services sector. We still see pretty good manufacturing. The hollowing out of the city in terms of manufacturing seems to be over. In fact, manufacturing employment is actually doing pretty well in the city, in certain parts of Queens. It's actually quite supportive.\n\nSo, in general, it's a pretty positive story. The city still faces challenges. I think one of the most significant ones is going to be: how does the change in the conversation about trade and immigration affect people's willingness to visit New York City?\n\nI think there is some prospect that international tourism to New York could decline over the next few years, and that would be something that would hurt the hospitality industry in New York City. So, that's something that we're going to have to keep a close eye on.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. The Dodd-Frank Act, which is often referred to as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, placed regulations on the financial industry. I wanted to ask you, do you think the removal of the Dodd-Frank Act would be productive for the economy? And if so, why?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nSo removal of the Dodd-Frank Act be productive for the economy? I'm going to give you a little bit more nuanced answer. I don't think it's a question of either the Dodd-Frank Act or no Dodd-Frank Act. I certainly wouldn't want to go back to the world we were in 2006, 2007, because that financial system led to the worst financial crisis that we've had since the Great Depression, and as you know the economy suffered greatly. The unemployment rate climbed over 10%. So clearly, we don't want to go back to that.\n\nBut at the same time, is the Dodd-Frank Act as it exists today perfect? I doubt it. What I tell people is we really want to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. What we want is a system where we have banks with adequate capital, adequate liquidity \u2013 number one \u2013 so the probability of a large bank failing is a lot lower today than it was back in 2006 and 2007.\n\nNumber two, we want a system where if a large bank were to get into difficulty, we have the ability to resolve it in a way that it doesn't threaten to take down the rest of the financial system.\n\nThe Federal Reserve intervened in a very unusual and aggressive way in 2008 because the failure of a large financial institution was threatening to basically push the U.S. economy into a Great Depression. We didn't do it because we wanted to save the institution. We did it because we wanted to save the economy. We don't want to be in that situation again. So we need to have a regime in place, so if a large institution were to fail, it doesn't threaten to take down the rest of the financial system.\n\nAnd the third thing we need is we need to a financial system that's robust and resilient to bad economies, to financial stress. One of the things that the Dodd-Frank Act does that I think is important is it mandates central clearing of derivatives activity. Now derivatives activities are things where corporations exchange interest rate payments, fixed income interest rate payments for floating interest rate payments, et cetera. During the pre-Dodd-Frank era, most of these were firm-to-firm. Financial institution to financial institution. Now they're all cleared centrally. This is a tremendous innovation because it reduces the amount of risk in the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act has one of its chapters or titles all dedicated to the clearing of over-the-counter derivatives.\n\nAnd finally, we have some entities called financial market infrastructures. What is a financial market infrastructure? So, let's say I buy a stock, and then that stock has to be transferred to me through some entity that actually clears and settles that stock transaction. The entity that actually manages that stock transaction \u2013 you selling stock to me, or me selling stock to you \u2013 that's a financial market utility. They have to be robust as well. And one of the things the Dodd-Frank Act does is it allows the Federal Reserve to have some oversight capacity to make sure that those financial market utilities are sound.\n\nSo, there are definitely things that could be changed. I think you could definitely relax the regulatory burden on smaller banking organizations because I don't think they pose a systemic threat to the U.S. financial system. I think you could take a look at certain regulations like the Volcker Rule to see if they could be administered in a less aggressive way.\n\nSo, it's not in my mind a question of Dodd-Frank or no-Dodd-Frank. I think it's a question of better financial reform legislation.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. Just like you said, the economy is picking up now, and at the same time, we are experiencing a kind of upward trend in interest rates. I wanted to ask you, do you think the current movement in  interest rates is politically-driven? If not, what is the business reason for the upward movement?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, if I said it was politically-driven, that would be an unbelievable news story. Because we try to stay as apolitical as possible and set monetary policy, not based on the political winds and fortunes of the different political parties, but what we think is appropriate to keep the economy on an even-keel and to achieve our goals of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. So, we're basically trying to set the level of interest rates in a way that will keep the economy close to our objective of full employment, with relatively stable price. It's 2% inflation.\n\nThat's sort of where we are right now. So, why are we raising interest rates a little bit?  First of all, I would point out that the interest rate rise that we've had in place has been extraordinarily gradual. The short-term interest rates that the Federal Reserve sets, the federal funds rate, that range is three-quarters of a percent to 1%. If you lived like I did through the 1970s and '80s, you realize that that's an extraordinarily low level of interest rates.\n\nMonetary policy over the last few years has been what we think is accommodative. In other words, it's been supporting economic activity. As we get closer to full employment, we want to make monetary policy a little bit less accommodative because if monetary policy were too accommodative, we would actually get an inflation problem over time. Then the Federal Reserve would have to slam on the brakes, we'd have a recession, people would be thrown out of work. Not a good situation.\n\nSo, the idea is to have an economy that moves in a smooth way. And so by taking out a little bit of that accommodation, moving up interest rates just a little bit, we think it's more likely that we'll achieve a soft landing and keep the economy about where it is today in terms of employment. So, it's a delicate adjustment. It's not something that's very harsh. We think it's appropriate and necessary. But I think the economy will be able to adjust to this just fine.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. Sometime ago, I think that was 2012, 2013, I took some students to the Federal Reserve Bank. And you do have annual events at the Fed which I attend every year, often in March. A question that came to mind is that the students were very excited when they went to the Federal Reserve Bank. The question I wanted to ask you is what are the skills required to work at the Fed?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, there's lots of different parts of the Federal Reserve. There isn't one particular skill. There's a lot of economists because we think about how the economy is working and operating and the conduct of monetary policy. There's a lot of people that work on overseeing banks. Supervision is one of our biggest groups. We have a lot of bank supervisors who typically get degrees in public policy or business, and come and work at the Federal Reserve and become bank examiners.\n\nWe have a lot of people in the Markets Group, which I ran prior to becoming President of the Bank. We monitor the markets. We talk to market participants to understand what's going on.\n\nWe execute monetary policy on behalf of the Federal Reserve System.  We have people that are in Operational Risk, who assess risk. We have people who manage custody accounts for foreign and central banks. We have about $3 trillion of foreign central bank assets in custody at the New York Fed.\n\nWe have the largest holdings of gold in the world in the vault of the New York Fed, so someone has to protect that. We have a number of people in the Protection and Law Enforcement Services that make sure that the gold is safe regardless of what one of the Die Hard movies implied, that it could be robbed pretty easily. That's not the case.\n\nWhen I became the President of the Bank, I actually rented out the Die Hard movie because I wanted to see if it was plausible \u2013 the way they stole the gold from the New York Fed, and it turned out that they sort of glossed over that. There was apparently supposedly a subway line that was really close to the gold vault, and so they just had to punch a little hole in the subway tunnel and the gold vault was right there. But it doesn't really actually work that way. So sorry.\n\nMy point is, there's a lot of different activities that we do. Obviously in education, Bachelor's or Master's, is sort of I think probably a good place to start. The more analytical skills you can get in terms of math and economics and business \u2013 those are the skills that are very attractive to us. Training and public policy because that's what we do, is very important.\n\nIt's a great place to work. The typical New York Fed employee joins the Bank and says I'm going to be here two, three years. And then the next stop I ask them how long have you been here? \u201c25, 30 years.\u201d  Which I think means that it has \u2013 it's a good place to work. Reasonable pay, good benefits  But mainly, a great culture. People are very committed to what we do.  People have a strong sense of mission and integrity.\n\nI tell people that one of the great things about working at the New York Fed is there's no moral ambiguity at any day about why I'm going to work. We're there to serve the public interest, and that's a nice thing to think about every day when you go to the office.  You don't have to think about, well, why am I doing this exactly?  Well, we're trying to serve the public interest, keep the economy on an even-keel, and execute on our mission as the New York Fed.\n\nThe New York Fed is a little different than the other Reserve Banks because we're really the operational arm of the Federal Reserve System for many, many different things. So, it's sort of interesting.  We do policy, and we do operations. Very unlike most central banks around the world, where the policy and operations are all in headquarters down in Washington. In the Federal Reserve it's split, with the New York Fed doing a lot of the operational activities of the Federal Reserve System. It's a pretty cool place. Check us out!\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nI will surely do. The Federal Reserve has been around since 1913. How would you compare the 1929 Depression to that of 2008?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, very different outcome. In 1929, the stock market crash led to a widespread banking panic, where people basically tried to get their money out of banks because they were afraid the banks were going to fail. And of course in the process of trying to pull all those deposits out of the banks, the banks didn't have enough money, so a lot of banks actually did fail. And in fact, in 1933, FDR declared a national banking holiday where all the banks were closed for a period of time.\n\nFortunately, we didn't get to that point during this crisis. The Federal Reserve, and many other people around the world, pulled out all the stops to avoid the collapse of the banking system, of the financial system, and as a consequence, we had a bad recession \u2013 worst recession that we've had since in the post-WWII period, but far short of what happened in the Great Depression.\n\nThe Great Depression, the unemployment rate I think climbed above 20%. The price level, the level of prices dropped by about I think a third. So it was a really absolutely horrendous experience. If you talk to someone like my mother, my mom's 94 years old, she was a relatively young girl during the Depression. She still remembers and talks about it, just incredibly searing. People were out of work for really until WWII. The Crash started in 1929, the U.S. economy really didn't get back to close to full employment, only in the 1940s, and because of WWII.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nSo this time was quite a bit different, thank God.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nI'm sure that everybody here invests. And they are ... students in economics and finance. We talk about investment. I wanted to shed light or your perspective on how the fixed income investor performed in the last eight years, please.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, the fixed income market has been a good place to be because, basically, interest rates  have been generally coming down, if you look at long-term bond yields. So, we would like to look at the government debt issue by the U.S. Treasury. Ten-year government debt is trading today about 2.4% which is pretty low, and credit spreads have narrowed over that period. So, fixed income has been a pretty good place to be invested in over the last 8 years.\n\nSame thing with U.S. equity market, though, for that matter. If you bought the U.S. equity market at the very bottom in 2009, it's more than tripled in price since then. As an investor, you've done pretty well if you've stayed invested through that entire period.\n\nNow, I would expect that fixed income investing is going to be less attractive going forward because interest rates still are at a very, very low level. So, some of the gains that people have seen in fixed income have been really prices going up because interest rates were declining. And I think that you're probably not going to see prices going up a lot because interest rates are declining going forward.\n\nSo I would guess most likely, most people think that short-term interest rates will gradually rise over the next couple of years. That certainly is what the Federal Open Market Committee expects, and as that happens people generally expect that longer-term interest rates will eventually rise. And so that means that there will probably be a little bit less good returns in the fixed income market compared to the last 8 years.\n\nWe've had a bull market in fixed income really going back to 1982. My first house I ever bought, mortgage rates at the time were 17%. They're now around 4%. I got financing from the seller. I got a 12% mortgage. I thought it was a really good deal. So now mortgage rates are around 4%. We've had a very, very long bull market in fixed income. People are debating now whether this is the end of that bull market or it's going to go on for a little bit further. So, we'll see.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. If you look at the global economy, it's looking buoyant now. Also the national economy, which is the United States economy, is looking buoyant now. I wanted to ask you, looking at the United States, which region do you think is growing at the moment?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI would answer that question, which region is growing at the moment, in two ways. Regionally, in terms of the geography of the United States, it's really the South and West, and this has been a pattern for a long time, that there has been sort of a migration to \u2013 when they invented air\u2011conditioning, they made the South a lot more attractive to people. And so the South and West have been growing faster than the country as a whole for a very long time.\n\nNow there are some pockets of weakness there because we had a big collapse in energy prices, so some of the areas in the South and West that are very dependent on the energy sector are probably a little bit less robust. So, that's the first way I would describe it.\n\nThe second way I would describe it is rural/suburban/urban. There's been a tremendous shift in people's enthusiasm for living in big cities, and that's really one reason why New York City is doing so well because people basically want to live in the big cities, especially younger people. And so you're seeing the cities, especially the big cities, outperform the smaller cities and outperform the rural areas. New York City has actually been very much a beneficiary of this, relative to many other parts of the country.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.  I'm sure now that we may have questions from the audience. To my right we have \u2013 a stand there.  And to my left, we have another.  If you have questions, please, students, colleagues?  It's time for Q&A. If you have any questions, please.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGood morning, and welcome to your college. Although the Die Hard scenario may not work in reality, cybercrime has been a greater threat to the financial system. And recently, it was reported that North Korea was able to illegally transfer monies from a Bangladesh account at the Fed to an account at the Philippines. What's being done to protect funds that are held not only at the Fed but also at other financial institutions?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, that's a good question. Cybersecurity is a really important activity for us at the Fed. We want to make sure that not only is the Federal Reserve well-protected but also the banks that we supervise are also well-protected against cyber-risk.\n\nThis is a particularly hard risk to evaluate on any given day because we're trying to improve our defenses, but the bad guys are also improving their capabilities. So, we do a lot of different activities within the bank to make sure that we're secure from a cyber-perspective. For example, we phish our employees, and we send them emails that sort of suggest that if you'll click on this, and if you click on this you get a message from our Information Technology Department that you've been phished and you learn that you have to be a lot more careful about what you actually click on. That's important because a threat can both come from outside, but it can also come from within.\n\nThe other thing we've done is we're spending a lot of time internationally to try to make the financial system safer by making sure that the payment executer, their systems are secure. So, think of that as Bangladesh. That the messenger, who the person is who's transmitting the payment, this is SWIFT, is secure. And the receiver.  So in this case, the New York Fed is secure.  That goes for anybody who is executing payments.  It doesn't have to be Bangladesh, through the SWIFT, to the New York Fed. It's anybody executing a payment through any payment medium to any receiver.\n\nThe thing that we're trying to work on internationally is to try to make sure that everyone understands their responsibilities in that chain. So, it's really important that the person executing the payment, that their facilities are secured.\n\nWhat seemed to be the case in the Bangladesh situation was their facilities were not secured, so someone executed a payment that looked completely authentic through the SWIFT pipes to the New York Fed. It was an authentic payment \u2013 it looked like an authentic payment when we executed on some of those payments \u2013 not all of those payments.\n\nSo, we need to make sure that that first leg is buttoned up, and also we need to make sure that everyone understands their responsibility along that chain.\n\nSo, this is something that we take very seriously. We're working also with the institutions that we interact with. One of the things that the Federal Reserve runs \u2013 the New York Fed runs \u2013 is called FedWire, so if you have to wire money, if someone needs the money immediately, you can wire that through a New York clearinghouse in the CHIPS system, or you can wire that through FedWire. It's really important that \u2013 and FedWire interacts with lots of institutions around the country. We need to make sure that all those institutions that interact with FedWire also have their systems secured.\n\nSo, it's a big issue. We spend a lot of resources on it. We're going to continue to spend a lot of resources on it. We take it very seriously.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nWe welcome you to Jamaica. I'd just like to ask, there have been some other regulatory measures taken over the past couple of decades. As I understand it, they repealed the Glass-Steagall Act and also passed the Sarbanes-Oxley laws. Would you say that these things had any effect on the 2008 recession, or has Congress been more responsible than not for the recession?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think that \u2013 well, I think Sarbanes-Oxley is actually \u2013 was basically about good financial reporting, good financial accounting. Accountability of the people at the top of the house for all the financial records and statements. The Federal Reserve is not subject by law to Sarbanes-Oxley, but we actually follow Sarbanes-Oxley nevertheless. We think it's good governance. So, I would say Sarbanes-Oxley generally makes the system safer because it makes it much harder for people to \u2013 it really deters fraud and manipulation of financial accounts in a way that I think is very, very positive.\n\nThe second part was?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGlass-Steagall?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nGlass-Steagall. Well, I think that \u2013 the Glass-Steagall Act was an act that was passed in the 1930s that basically said that you could either be in commercial banking or you could be in investment banking. You couldn't be in both. And so this is an act that basically forced the Morgan Company to separate into Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan. Now what happened was many years later in the 1980s, I actually was involved with this because I was working at J.P. Morgan at the time, people started to say, \u201cLook, if I'm a big commercial bank like J.P. Morgan, I'm losing all my customers who are going to the securities market. I need to follow my customers, but I can't because of Glass-Steagall.\u201d And they found that there was a loophole, Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act basically said that you can't be principally-engaged in securities activities. So, it meant that you could be engaged but just as long as it wasn't principally-engaged. And so this is a little loophole that a number of firms managed to exploit. And so they actually found a way to get into some securities activities, and then Glass-Steagall Act a number of years later was actually formally repealed because the firms were already, essentially, in the business.\n\nNow my own personal view is that I don't think the Glass-Steagall Act had much to do with the great financial crisis. If you look at the firms that got into great difficulty, at the earliest stages \u2013 Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, AIG \u2013 they really had nothing to do with Glass-Steagall because they really weren't banks and securities firms. They were securities firms and insurance companies. My own view is that the Glass-Steagall Act was not a major \u2013 the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was not a major factor behind the Great Recession and the financial crisis.\n\nNow this is something that people probably would debate. Other people might have somewhat different views. You could repeal the Glass-Steagall Act again. I think it would obviously require a lot of financial corporate restructuring because there are a lot of firms in the U.S. that are in both the securities business and the commercial banking business today. I think that there are links between those two businesses. It probably helps those firms, satisfy the demands of their large corporate clients more easily than if you had to separate them into separate entities. But you could do it.\n\nOne thing I would say if you do do it, you better have a mechanism in place to make sure that those large securities firms that are left actually are well-regulated, well-capitalized, have enough liquidity, and have access to a lender of last-resort.\n\nOne of the problems that we had in the financial crisis is there wasn't a good method to lend to securities firms. By law, the Federal Reserve discount window \u2013 this is the facility that we have open to commercial banks \u2013 were not allowed to have that discount window open to securities firms.\n\nSo, in the crisis, we had to do extraordinary lending activities to securities firms. We need a better lender of last resort backstop for securities firms.\n\nIf you decide to repeal Glass-Steagall and separate commercial banks from securities firms, that's not something that I would recommend, but if you were to do that, make sure you have a way of backstopping the securities industry, too, so if a big securities firm gets in trouble it doesn't threaten the entire financial system.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.  I'll be expecting questions from students, too.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nNot a student.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nBut you\u2019re a student of something, right?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nMy concern is MWBEs. I feel that the racist element within our capitalization has not allowed us to participate in the economy on an equal level by having access to capital. The government's asking for 30% on major projects. For example, at LaGuardia, we have a $5 billion project. Contracts to facilitate that will probably be too high for many minority and women-owned businesses. Therefore, if we don't have access to capital, we won't even be allowed to bid on that work. And that's when fraud comes in, when a major contractor proposes to a small contractor, \u201cI'll help you out if you bid, give you give me a number on this contract.\u201d\n\nIf we had access to capital, we then bid. I'd like you to take a look at what the New York State Department of School Construction Authorities are doing. They worked out a system that allows us to bid on major contracts. If you took a look at that, because we need some ingenious new ways of financing. We don't have a black bank per se. There were 94 black banks across this country, now there's only 23. Some of the banks that's going out of business, I don't think is kosher, but something has to be done to allow us to participate in the marketplace.\n\nOn your material, you have listed some organizations within the minority community that you deal with. I'd like to recommend some additional organizations. For example, the ones that are primarily interested in the flow of contracts and development. I'm not in a prime area of what's going on today. In addition, for example, we have here at York College one of the best small business development sectors.  They're number one in the state a couple of times.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI agree with your concern. Is there a question?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYes, what can you do to set up financial resources for minority and women-owned businesses to become involved in the economy? Whether that's establishing a bank \u2013 we've asked the controller to control this, let him set up a funding source for us using pension funds, and there's a way to do that, if you look at it. But we need you to be an advocate for us in that area, but help us come up with an ingenious idea for how we can develop access to capital.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I certainly agree with the importance of access to capital, and I certainly agree with you in the importance of having minority work enterprises have the ability to participate in economic development and bidding on contracts. We don't have the legal authority to do anything direct, but we have a lot of convening authority. One thing that we do do is we do continuing workshops, conferences, symposiums. We've had a number of things with small businesses on how small businesses can get access to credit, how small businesses can figure out how to export their goods and services.\n\nAnd so this is something that for you to talk to our regional development people on how we could be helpful. Because we definitely think this is an important issue, and we definitely want to be helpful and use the resources we have, both in terms of research and our convening power, to try to take this forward. So, let's have a conversation.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nNext question please. I'm still expecting a student.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nGood morning. My question will be in the form of appeal. This is for small homeowners. Recently, the Fed announced about increasing the interest rate. But I don't know how long the Federal Open Markets Operations committee will actually sit for that. But what I'm appealing for is for that period to be extended. We just came out from an economic recession. Thank God we didn't get to the depression part of that business cycle. Many homeowners basically, particularly small homeowners, they are struggling to fix their credits. And because their credit scores are so terrible, they cannot refinance, and therefore they are locked in with high interest rates \u2013 we are talking about thousands and thousands of dollars. Banks are making money off them because they cannot refinance.\n\nIf you go ahead and increase that interest rates when they are still struggling to pay what they have now, I think many will lose their homes. So, my appeal is for the Fed to please, let the current interest rates stay \u2013 give a little bit more room for small homeowners to fix their credit scores so that they can refinance. Thank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, first thing I would say is the level of interest rates are still pretty darn low. The federal fund rate, that's the rate we target, is three-quarters of a percent to 1%. And we've only raised interest rates twice since the end of the Recession eight years ago. It's important to recognize that the trajectory has been very, very shallow because we are aware of some of the issues that you're raising and we're trying to get the balance right.\n\nEnd of the day, what are we trying to accomplish? We want to have an economy that can grow for a long time. So, we want to keep the economy in balance growing at a rate that is sustainable over the medium- to longer-run. What we're trying to do is find that level of interest rates that's just right. Now we recognize that anytime that we change interest rates, it's going to help some people, and it's going to hurt other people. So, on the other side of the story are all the people, like my mom, who are savers and they're unhappy. They've been unhappy for the last eight years because interest rates have been so low. So, we're trying to get that balance right.\n\nI think we've been pretty cautious in terms of how we've been raising interest rates because of some of the concerns that you raise. Janet Yellen, who's the Chair of the Federal Reserve, has talked about the headwinds that have been slowing down the U.S. economy.\n\nOne of those headwinds is exactly what you're talking about, the fact that people are locked into homes because their homes are either underwater, the value of the homes are less than the value of their mortgages, or because their credit-rating was damaged during the Financial Crisis because people lost their jobs, and so their credit-rating was impaired. And so that's really the reason why we've been so delicate and so slow in actually raising interest rates. It's partly exactly what you're talking about.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGood morning. Thank you for being here. One of the things that we've been looking at here in Southeast Queens is the establishment of CDFIs, additional CDFIs to support the growth and the access to capital of small businesses. Would you comment a little bit about what do you see as the future of CDFIs going forward in this economic climate, and any suggestions that you would have to support us in doing that? Thank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I guess I sort of think of CDFIs as doing God's work in some ways because the hardest thing for someone with a really good idea and starting a small business is to get that initial bit of capital to establish a track record. Banks, as you know, are reluctant to lend to start\u2011up businesses because the firms don't have collateral to pledge against the loans, and they don't have a track record of experience. So CDFIs are really the group that can provide that lifeblood to small business enterprises at the start-up stage.\n\nIt's also very resource-intensive to lend to small businesses, so the economics don't work very well for a for-profit company. So, I'm a big fan of CDFIs. We think it's really an important avenue, especially in less developed areas where getting a small business well-established can create local jobs which can create a virtuous circle in terms of economic development. So, this is something that we definitely want to encourage over time, and anything that we can do to be helpful \u2013 we try to partner with the CFI community to be helpful, in terms of providing data, information. We have a lot of very detailed information about the local economies and we can be, I think, helpful in actually providing some information and support to the CDFIs.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGood morning. I want to thank you for coming here and sharing some information with us.  I have two specific questions I wanted to ask. A lot of us, we've already talked about access to capital, which is a huge thing.  For those who don't know, Sen. Sanders is the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee for New York State. My first question is how do we establish a better relationship with your organization in an effort to \u2013 we can get this information that you have and its resources on the grassroot level? And my second question is \u2013\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nAll you have to do is give me your card afterwards.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nOh, okay. My second question is we've done an assessment of the economic state of Southeast Queens, Sen. Sanders' office, and a majority of our residents here are considered banked and under-banked. My question to you is a lot of ... especially for \u2013 we have a huge population of Millennials, we're looking to purchase homes in our area. A lot of us make under $50,000 and probably have some problems with credit.\n\nBut my question with the home buyers programs is there a way, or how can we have a conversation about increasing the matching funds because the highest that the rates for the federal home buyers program is 4:1. And we want to talk about how we can get that to 10:1 so it can help, it can match the demographics, economic demographics, of our community, so people can start receiving in tangible resources like purchasing a home with the resources that they have.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI'm not an expert in the issue of how much money you need to match. I don't think I can speak to that directly. But clearly getting people the resources so that they can become homeowners in a prudent way is a good thing. And what we saw in the financial crisis, in the run-up to the financial crisis, is that we were giving credit to people in an imprudent way. I think as long as it can be done in a prudent way, where people understand the responsibilities, have the income to pay on their mortgages, I think it's something that we definitely want to encourage.\n\nSo, what I would suggest is give me your card, and I'll give it to the right people in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and we'll have a conversation and see what we can do. This is not something that we could probably be involved in directly, as a funding provider. Legally, we don't have the authority.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is pretty powerful in terms of monetary policy. But our mandate is also pretty narrow in terms of what we're allowed to do.\n\nI remember during the financial crisis, people were coming in and saying, \u201cyou should do this, you should do that, you should do that.\u201d  And most of the things that they were suggesting that we do were some things that were not actually allowed by the Federal Reserve Act that was passed back in 1913. Come talk to us and we will see what we can do.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGreetings, good morning to \u2013 or good afternoon to you and your guest. Now while it would be interesting to speak of why the New York Fed and the Atlanta Fed are differing on their economic forecasts, that might be interesting, but I want to speak to something far more local. Far more local.\n\nThis community, and communities like this, were devastated, were ravaged \u2013 and I could use a stronger word \u2013 during the financial crisis of 2008.  We've never recovered from this. The black community lost approximately 50% of its wealth in four years. 50% of the wealth accumulated from slavery till today lost in four years. No one, of course, was ever jailed for these things, no one was ever \u2013 very little punishment, if anything, was done. I understand that while you may want to do or feel strongly it's not the purview of the Federal Reserve \u2013 I understand that.\n\nUsing your researchers at Liberty and other parts of your organization, I need to know what laws that I can put on the books to protect communities like this. We're about to go back into another phase of exotic mortgage-lending, and I will humbly differ with you on Glass-Steagall, of course.\n\nWe're about to go into another phase of exotic lending. They call it exotic lending. We call it predatory lending, and we pay for it. We can expect that again. What laws can I \u2013 what do we need to put on the books to protect communities like this? Liberty and other organizations, research organizations, that you guys have can come up with some of these things. I look forward to speaking with you later today.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nOkay. On this issue of predatory lending, I mean this is \u2013 I think you raised a very good point, and this is something that we actually heard about small business lending when we were up I think in the Bronx awhile back, where, basically, people have these come-ons to lend money to small business, and it seems attractive on the surface, but it turns out that the actual rate of interest that people are paying is prohibitive to be able to run a successful business. So, I think the predatory lending thing is a completely important issue that we do need to address. Obviously, the Small Business Administration can play a role in this. I think we would certainly be interested in having a conversation about it, because I think it is a really serious issue.\n\nI mean one of the problems, just more broadly, is financial literacy in the United States. Part of the reason that predatory lending can work is because people don't really have a good idea \u2013they don't know enough about the financial system, about the economy, about what's a good value or not. They just say, \u201cWhat's my payment going to be next month?\u201d And if the payment is low, they don't look at the fine print about what the payment is going to be not next month, but a year from now, or two years from now. And that's how they get into a great deal of difficulty. So, I think not just working on the predatory loans writ narrow, but also on the issue of financial literacy writ large, I think colleges like this one can do a lot in making sure that when people graduate, they have a level of financial literacy that can help them navigate through the world.\n\nThe number of scams that are out there now are just extraordinary. Sometimes people will pretend that they're me and they send letterhead out supposedly from me telling people that if they were to send a bunch of money to someone, the New York Fed would release a check for a large amount of money, and people actually believe this. Now, my advice to people always is if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. But unfortunately people offer these things, and it's really quite tragic, because the people who fall for these things often are people that are not so sophisticated, of not so large means, and they can't afford to be sending money to fraudsters hoping that there might be a big prize from the Federal Reserve Bank in New York or somewhere else down the road, which of course there's not.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. I think we have \u2013 I just have time to take only one more question.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nActually, the question I wanted to ask is for the students. Why do you refuse to ask questions?\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nSomebody wants to ask now.  Thank you.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nHow are you, sir? My question for you today is what are, or were, your daily habits or rituals that helped you get to the level of success that you have today?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nOooh, I can't think of any rituals. Habits. I guess what I would say is I've always just tried to learn more. So basically, it's always about trying to find opportunity to, what I call, grow my human capital. So, I think \u2013 my view of the way to success is find a job that's interesting to you, because you need that passion about what you do. If you don't have passion about what you do, it's not going to feel like a lot of fun and you're not going to do it with a great enthusiasm. So, if it's not fun and you're not enthusiastic, you're probably not going to do very well at it. So, the first thing is to find something that you're really liking, you're enthusiastic about.\n\nAnd two, basically find something where you can continue to learn. If you get into a job and you've been in the job for a long time and you're doing the same thing, you've sort of mastered the job, then it's probably time to move on.\n\nI was at a large investment bank for many years \u2013 20 years to be exact \u2013 and I decided at the end of 2005 that I was going to retire because there was no job that they had that they would give me that I wanted. And vice versa. There was no job I wanted that they would give me. So it was sort of, I can keep doing my same job of being the Chief U.S. Economist and continue to do that for a great many, many years. But at that point I felt I was no longer learning so much. I was bringing in a little bit less enthusiasm to the job, and so, it was time for a change. I didn't know what that change was, and after I announced I was retiring, Tim Geithner, who was the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time, called me up. First conversation was, he asked me if I'd be an advisor at the New York Fed. I said, \u201cTim, that's a great job. I really like you, I'd love to work with you, but what do I do the 39 other hours of the week besides advise you?\u201d And then a couple of weeks or months later, I can't remember exactly how long it was, he called up again and said, \u201cWell, how would you like to come to the New York Fed and run the Markets Group?\u201d Markets Group at the time had about 230 employees. They executed monetary policy for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  I wasn't sure I was going to have any time to talk to Tim Geithner in that role. And so I said yes immediately.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nYou have a question? Are you a student?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYes, I am.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI am a student.  Thank you so much for taking the time and speaking to us. My question was, being from a younger generation, I'm definitely interested in investing, but what would be your biggest piece of advice. Especially for us, the younger generation, with a limited budget, what would you \u2013 how should we go about it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I don't think I've ever been asked for investing advice before now. It's probably not appropriate for the Federal Reserve to give out investing advice. I think the first thing is you want to get knowledgeable. I think the first thing is you want to get some knowledge before you start to invest. And recognize that there are no quick, get-rich-quick schemes. If something seems to be too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nI remember when I got out of college, back in 1974, a long time ago, I decided \u2013 I had this very small amount of money that my great-grandmother left to me, I think it was $2,000, and I decided I was going to go out and invest. And I have to say, at the beginning, I didn't really know what I was doing. But I read a lot of books and I got really pretty well educated. There's a lot of good books in the market, and I think you can actually educate yourself. And if you do that I think then you can start to gingerly start to invest. And you'll learn as you go. It's a long journey. I've learned things as I invested over the years. Now I don't do anything, but I'm sort of retired from investing in my current role. But part of that I found that I kept learning it over a very long period of time. So, it wasn't like the journey of knowledge was over at any point in time. But first thing is to find a really good book on investing, and read that. When I did it, I read probably five or ten different books, and that gave me a good sort of basis for thinking about investing. But before investing, make sure you have that $400 that you need in case an emergency comes up.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nThank you.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nWith two good questions from our students, I think I'm comfortable now to bring the discussion to an end."

    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170321a",
    "content": "First, let me thank Governor Carney, the Lord Chief Justice, and Dame Colette for including me in today\u2019s discussion.  It is an honor to be here.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI also want to thank the Banking Standards Board for its important work on improving standards of conduct in financial services.  The effects of this work will, I think, be felt throughout the industry, not just in the City of London. \n\nWe learned from the LIBOR and FX scandals that poor conduct can proliferate quickly throughout the global marketplace.  That\u2019s because short-term thinking\u2014maxing out this year\u2019s compensation bonus or this quarter\u2019s accounting profits\u2014is a catalyst for poor conduct.  In contrast, good conduct may take longer to catch on.  Good conduct depends on a longer-term frame of reference.  It is building a viable career that one can be proud of, and, at the firm level, building franchise value and reputation that takes decades to accomplish.  In both cases, though, the same enabling mechanism is at work: culture. \n\nCulture\u2014within a firm or across an industry\u2014is not determined primarily by rules or laws, though certainly rules and laws can amplify good or bad attributes.  Culture comprises, instead, what people observe and do, resulting in accepted and mostly unspoken norms.  Mostly, people look for what succeeds and what does not, and they try to align themselves with the former.\n\nIf we want to improve culture and conduct, we need to start by being realists about human behavior.  At the New York Fed\u2019s culture conference last October, Dame Minouche Shafik observed pragmatically that an end to all misconduct is not the goal of reform.  There will always be a few bad apples.  Rather, the goals should be far fewer instances of misconduct and far less scope, magnitude and duration when such misconduct inevitably occurs.\n\nI submit that the best way to keep problems small is to encourage a culture that spots issues and raises concerns early.  In my view, the most dangerous type of culture in finance occurs when people see something wrong but do not say something. \n\nI think back to the chat room transcripts from the LIBOR and FX scandals.  The way traders communicated so openly about their manipulation of markets makes it hard to imagine that others in their firms did not know what was happening.  So, why didn\u2019t those people say something?\n\nThere are understandable, human tendencies that can cause each of us to avoid rocking the boat.  People want to be team players.2   Those behavioral traits can be amplified through a firm\u2019s culture, which can weigh on one\u2019s willingness to do the right thing.  This is, unfortunately, what seems to have occurred at Wells Fargo, one of the largest retail banks in the United States.  Whether to obtain a bonus or simply to keep a job, employees felt they had to keep quiet and meet sales targets despite the cost to customers.3\n\nSo, how do you change a culture where silence leads to misconduct?  I will offer two ideas that might help and one idea that will not. \n\nHere is what will not work: Merely telling your employees to speak up.  Cultures do not change simply by exhortation.  Eloquent speeches, a well-phrased value statement, and an annual requirement to acknowledge the code of conduct are just not sufficient.\n\nThat\u2019s the easy one.  The two ideas that might work are harder. \n\nFirst, managers have to lead by example.  Senior executives must be seen within the firm to expect and respect challenges, and in turn must challenge ideas themselves.  And, they have to explain difficult decisions to their employees\u2014sharing not only the news of what they have done, but why.  More important, mid-level managers have to do the same.  Of course, mid-level managers will not generally behave that way unless they see their senior leadership setting the example.\n\nSecond, if your organization values people when they raise their hand, your incentives have to reflect that.  Employees who speak up should be recognized.  The courage it takes to speak up, despite the perceived costs, should be counted as a very positive factor in evaluations.  And, where raising one\u2019s hand has saved the firm\u2019s money and reputation by avoiding or keeping a problem small, that action should be rewarded.\n\nIt\u2019s only natural for an economist like me to consider the issue of unintended consequences.  One that comes to mind is creating a culture of distrust and suspicion, where everyone looking over his or her shoulder.  That would be unfortunate and costly.  But, I think it is more likely that a different culture will result. Instead, talented and conscientious people will be happy to remain at a firm or in the industry because their personal and professional values are well aligned.  Such employees will feel relief that they can speak up without fear of reprisal, and they can enjoy a clear conscience for having done the right thing.  There is significant value in being able to sleep well at night.\n\nMoreover, being receptive to diverse and dissenting views will likely yield better results. It is in the industry\u2019s self-interest to deter silence, not only because money will be saved on fines not incurred for misconduct, but also because better ideas will be brought to the table.  I believe that business performance will benefit from having a culture in which people feel empowered to speak up.\n\nLet me give you a few examples from my own experience at the New York Fed.\n\nI want employees to speak up.  That\u2019s why, at the start of my tenure as president, I made it clear that I wanted the \u201cbest idea to win,\u201d regardless of where it originated or whether it contradicted something that I thought.  In some instances, that will require people to admit mistakes.  In that regard, I have to set the example that we all make mistakes, and that recognizing and addressing them head on\u2014and, importantly, learning from them\u2014is the best approach. \n\nA few years ago we created a new group at the New York Fed called Integrated Policy Analysis.  Its purpose was to consolidate teams from many parts of the organization to develop a more integrated view of the economic and financial environment to help inform our policy responsibilities.  I was a strong advocate for the idea.  But, after two years of effort, it became clear to me and others that it was not working as well as we had hoped.  There were a lot of reasons for that, and in the end we dissolved the group and reassigned the work and staff.  I let our employees know that I took a calculated risk and it didn\u2019t work out.  By doing this, I aimed to show that when things do not go as planned, the best approach is to address it, not to be silent.  I hope that, when our people are confronted with disappointing results in their work, they will do the same.\n\nI mentioned earlier that we also need to reform incentives in order to encourage people to speak up.  This is hard.  I\u2019ll share with you some of the change we have made at the New York Fed, recognizing that we do not have a monopoly on good ideas, nor can we claim to have a perfect culture.\n\nNone of these ideas is a panacea.  And, I know that we have not yet achieved our goal: a culture in which employees perceive that, by raising their hands and challenging what may be an orthodoxy or conventional wisdom, they are contributing to the mission of the New York Fed.  I hope, however, that with the right incentives and good leadership models, we can move closer to that ideal state: an organization characterized by fresh ideas and open dialogue.  \n\nAt conferences like these, we tend to focus on the cost of misconduct. But, getting rid of scandals should not be the sole reason for changing culture.4 The public expects more from the financial sector than a lack of another financial crisis or scandal.  The industry would do well to listen to Baroness Onora O\u2019Neill: Think about your purpose.5   What are you for?  Surely, no one would answer that question by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re for a lack of misconduct.\u201d\n\nRather, the financial services industry should support a well-functioning, growing economy, reflecting the interests of all its stakeholders.  Banking in particular should provide critical intermediation services\u2014the economic infrastructure that allows businesses to grow, families to save and invest, and standards of living to improve over generations for as broad a cross section of people as possible.  When society prospers, the financial services industry prospers, too.  Creating a culture that encourages and rewards diversity of thought, perspective, and experience is one means by which the industry can both do good and do well at the same time. \n\nThank you for your kind attention."

    "title": "Reforming Culture for the Long Term",
    "date": "Mar 21, 2017",
    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170321",
    "content": "Thank you for your kind welcome.\n\nI am grateful to the Banking Standards Board for organizing this meeting.  For several years, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Banking Standards Board have each worked to improve culture within the financial services industry in the world\u2019s two most important financial centers.  I would like to especially thank Sir Richard Lambert, Dame Colette Bowe, Alison Cottrell, and the members of their team\u2014all of whom have traveled several times to New York to attend meetings and conferences on this issue of culture.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to reciprocate and to join you today in London.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThis morning, I would like to highlight three issues that are critical to improving culture within the financial services industry:\n\nI will then conclude by offering some thoughts on why good culture is critical to success in financial services. \n\nLet us start with purpose because it is a prerequisite for the other two.  Baroness Onora O\u2019Neill, a member of the Banking Standards Board, was the keynote speaker at the New York Fed\u2019s third culture conference, held in October 2016.  Her message to the audience of senior bankers and regulators was a challenge to think about the purpose of their organizations.  Namely, what are you for?2\n\nI believe the question \u201cwhat are you for\u201d can be a litmus test for a firm confronted with challenges.  Let me give you just one example, from the Salz Review in 2013.  Employees in the eight divisions of Barclays were asked to state their core values.  Three of the eight divisions did not rank \u201ccustomer service\u201d as a core value.  Two of these divisions were retail lines\u2014UK retail banks and the Barclays credit card.  The third was the firm\u2019s African subsidiary, which also offered retail banking services.3  \n\nMy intent here is not to pick on Barclays. Indeed, the firm should be commended for first commissioning and then publishing the Salz Review\u2014Sir David Walker set an example of leadership in his candor and transparency.  Instead, my purpose is to make the point: If you cannot answer the question \u201cwhat are you for,\u201d or if your answers do not make sense in light of your business, then it is time to re-examine your purpose. \n\nFor any bank, a statement of purpose should emphasize sustainable success, not short-run profit.  This is because of the many important roles that banks play in the economy.  They are critical intermediaries between savers and borrowers; they provide essential infrastructure; they support well-functioning financial markets; and they act as custodians of our wealth.  These functions require long-term commitment.  They should not be erratic or ephemeral.  The economy needs a steady supply of competent, honest, and reliable banking services in order to function.  That is why any bank should emphasize the long term over the short term.\n\nAfter purpose comes measurement.  In the context of culture, however, calculating particular metrics is less important than the goals of such measurement.  The first goal is to assess how you are doing compared to what you have set out to do.  In other words, are you fulfilling your purpose?  The second goal is to assess how you stack up against your peers.  In both ways, measurement provides critical benchmarking, without which firms and the industry cannot assess whether they are making progress. \n\nSince the beginning of our work on culture, my colleagues and I have recognized that measurement is indispensable to improving bank culture.  We have not been alone in this view. \n\nAt the New York Fed\u2019s first conference on cultural reform, in October 2014, Sir David Walker encouraged banking leaders to measure behavior within their firms in order to promote accountability.  Pursuing this theme, several panelists addressed the use of measurement as a corporate governance tool.  They argued that standardized metrics could help quantify the judgment and behavior of individual employees, making the behavioral components of annual performance reviews more objective.  The same information could also aid a firm\u2019s senior leaders in assessing the effectiveness of their communications about how the firm conducts its business.  For my part, I encouraged the industry to collaborate on a common culture survey that could serve as a benchmark for behavior.  I also agreed with Sir David that measurement and accountability should not be decoupled.4\n\nLast week, the BSB published the results of its industry-wide benchmarking survey on culture.  This is a critical step forward in the industry\u2019s effort to get better data on how firms are doing on cultural issues, to identify areas for improvement, and to demonstrate a public commitment to improvement.  Several facets of the BSB\u2019s report struck me as particularly significant. \n\nFirst, in addition to creating a benchmarking survey\u2014which generated approximately 28,000 responses\u2014the BSB conducted focus groups with junior employees and interviews with senior leaders to add depth to what the survey results indicated.  That represents a significant investment of time by the BSB and those who participated in the qualitative review.  That commitment is essential for understanding the context and meaning of responses within individual firms.\n\nSecond, the survey asked respondents to agree or disagree with a number of statements.  Those statements were direct and cut to the core of cultural issues in banking.  Some of the standouts, in my view, included:\n\nThird, the results suggest that the respondents did not pull their punches.  Nearly 30 percent answered that they would be worried about negative consequences if they raised concerns at work.  That shows, perhaps more than any other finding, that there is still a long way to go in creating a culture for long-term success in banking.  In addition, approximately one quarter of employees did not affirmatively agree that their organization puts customers at the center of business decisions.  That is also of concern if we want an industry that is sustainable over the long term.\n\nI encourage you to read the BSB\u2019s report, if you haven\u2019t already.  And let me emphasize that the report is not intended as a cudgel or to assign blame.  Rather, as I see it, the report gives the industry an opportunity to improve against a benchmark.  Again, I want to acknowledge the BSB\u2019s contribution and thank them for all their work.\n\nNow the burden shifts from the BSB to you, the industry.  What will you do with these results?  We all want to see progress on culture and behavior.  How will you\u2014both within firms and collectively\u2014move the needle on culture and behavior over the next few years? \n\nI suggest that if you want next year\u2019s results to be better than this year\u2019s, you might start by focusing on incentives. \n\nAs I have argued before, incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture.  If you want a culture that will support your long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors that will sustain your business over the long haul.6\n\nIncentives\u2014compensation and promotion, in particular\u2014are powerful tools for communicating the conduct and culture you desire for your firm.  Of course, the cultures of firms can and should vary.  But, the culture of every bank should share a common theme: stewardship\u2014a word that implies professional care, exercised year after year for the benefit of the firm and its stakeholders.  A commitment to the long term must be at the core of banking.  Incentives within a firm should support that goal, not undermine it.\n\nMy emphasis on incentives is not new, but it bears repeating.  Bad incentives were a key contributing factor in the financial crisis.  In the United States, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that \u201cCompensation systems\u2014designed in an environment of cheap money, intense competition, and light regulation\u2014too often rewarded the quick deal, the short-term gain\u2014without proper consideration of long-term consequences.\u201d7   This theme applied to all levels of banking organizations.  One notable example was mortgage brokers, who were paid based on the volume of loans they generated, not their quality.8\n\nThe financial crisis came to a head in the fall of 2008.  Fast forward eight years to the fall of 2016.  Wells Fargo\u2019s chairman and CEO resigned after regulators uncovered what appeared to be widespread fraud in the retail bank.  Compensation, once again, seems to be at the center of a scandal.  Neighborhood bankers were paid based on the volume of new accounts opened, apparently with utter disregard for whether customers wanted them or even knew about them.  And, like mortgage brokers in the early 2000s, it appears that job security depended almost exclusively on meeting targets, regardless of how those targets were met.  There was a serious mismatch between the values Wells Fargo espoused and the incentives that Wells Fargo employed.9  \n\nInvestigations into what happened at Wells Fargo are continuing, so I will wait before drawing more definitive conclusions.  For now, though, it is sufficient to note the powerful role\u2014for good or for bad\u2014that incentives can play in an organization.  I understand that making progress on culture is difficult.  But, if you want the next round of metrics to look better than the last, use a powerful lever\u2014use incentives. \n\nToday\u2019s discussions\u2014here at Mansion House and later at the Bank of England\u2014are evidence that the issue of culture is important to the private and public sectors alike.  We have to keep working on this.  The public sector must continue to shine a spotlight on the issue, and the industry must continue to demonstrate that it is taking responsibility for its culture.  And, culture cannot be a subject that only receives attention because bad conduct has occurred in the recent past. \n\nI am convinced that a good or ethical culture that is reflected in your firm\u2019s strategy, decision-making processes, and products is also in your economic best interest, for a number of reasons:\n\nGood culture is, in short, a necessary condition for the long-term success of individual firms.  Therefore, members of the industry must be good stewards and should seek to make progress on reforming culture in the near term. \n\nThank you for your kind attention, and thank you again to the Banking Standards Board for inviting me to speak and to the Lord Mayor for hosting.  I would be happy to answer your questions."

    "content": "Maureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nBill, let me start off with kind of the low-hanging fruit. The post-Trump economy has been confusing, with low Q4 growth, yet record-setting stock market levels. So let me just throw you an easy one here. What does the Fed see as the outlook for the next year?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nFor the near-term I think more of the same. I mean, we think the economy is going to continue to grow, a little bit above-trend. That's going to generate job gains that put, you know, more pressure on the labor market, and as a consequence of that, we think inflation's going to move back towards our 2% objective.\n\nSo, you know, we could be completely wrong, but that \u2013 the data that's come out over the last couple of months, is very consistent with that pattern.\n\nA lot of uncertainty in the outlook. I mean we don't know what's going to happen with the whole host of policy choices: healthcare reform, immigration policy, trade policy, tax policy, fiscal policy. So, how that, how those policy questions get answered will also be an important aspect in terms of how the forecast actually falls.\n\nBut the baseline forecast is pretty similar in 2017 to 2016, slowly above trend growth, a little bit more pressure on the labor market, gradual rise in inflation, back towards our 2% objective. And if that happens, if we stay on that trajectory, I think as Chair Yellen said yesterday and today, we would expect to gradually remove further monetary policy accommodation, snug up interest rates a little further in the months ahead.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nWell I think that's somewhat encouraging, isn't it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nBut the uncertainty around that forecast is pretty high.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nIs pretty high.  Although, you know, it's interesting, think about the U.S., um, you know, our situation in the last couple of years has clearly been improving. What's been interesting is seeing the news out of Japan, that, you know, Japan seems to be able to keep out of deflation, which they haven't for a long time. Even Europe seems to be eeking some growth out.\n\nDo \u2013 do you think everybody's going to be doing better or is this just a blip?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think that \u2013 a couple of things. Just let me touch on the U.S. first. One thing that's interesting is post-election you've seen a pretty big improvement in household and business confidence, especially business confidence among smaller businesses.\n\nNow it's hard to say how much weight to put on that because historically consumer confidence goes up and down, and it doesn't just necessarily feed into consumer spending. But the increase in business confidence is quite striking, especially for smaller businesses. And so one of the big open questions that we're going to be assessing over the next few months is: is that improvement in animal spirits, so to speak, going to actually feed through and lead to more spending?\n\nSo, I think where a year or two ago, I think our anxieties were more about the risks to growth to the downside, so as that \u2013 well, a year ago, we were worried about events in China, we were worried about uncertainties about Europe. I think now the balance of risk is gradually shifting, where the possibility is that growth could actually be stronger than expected, rather than weaker than expected.\n\nThe markets expect fiscal stimulus out of this Administration. That's another factor that probably will over time tilt the equation more to the upside.\n\nBut on fiscal policy, it's really hard to factor into your forecast at this point because we don't know what it is, how big it is, or when it will happen. Other than that, we have it completely nailed down.\n\nSo, it's really hard to sort of put that into your forecast. And so the way I think about the fiscal policy outlook is that we're probably going to get some fiscal stimulus at some point.  And so that's just another factor that maybe tilts the risk to the economy a little bit to the upside.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nSo, Bill, how about we think a little bit more broadly. You talked about where \u2013 it looks like interest rates are going up, at least that's what, you know\u2026\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nGradually, right.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nWhat Janet Yellen indicated would happen. There's this interesting question, though, about will interest rates over the next year go to quote normal levels, or is there a new normal, right? I mean we've struggled through how many years now of zero interest rates, and the distributional consequences those have had, is there a \"new\" normal?  Do we have an idea what that \"new normal\" is going to be?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell I think if you look at what the FOMC publishes, the so-called Summary of Economic Projections, one of the things that they forecast, we forecast, is the long-run federal funds rate, where we think the federal funds rate is going to end up in the long-run. So think five, six, seven years out. And that estimate has come down over the last few years. So what that's telling you is that people on the FOMC think that the normal federal funds rate is lower now than it's been in the past.\n\nAnd the idea behind that is a very simple one. One, there's probably still some residual headwinds left over from the financial crisis that are going to persist for some time. Think about how difficult it is to get a mortgage if you're a lower credit-rated borrower today compared to 2005, 2006. And two, productivity growth in the economy has been very anemic, and I think generally, most economists think there's a relationship between productivity growth and the inflation-adjusted level of interest rates in the economy.\n\nSo, productivity growth is strong, you tend to have high real rates. At 2% inflation you get a relatively high federal funds rate. If productivity growth is weak, you have low real rates. Add 2% inflation, you get a little bit lower level of interest rates.\n\nSo generally, if you look at the FOMC projections, people think that the federal funds rate in the medium term is going to more like 3% rather than the 4% that might have been attained historically.\n\nNow there's one little problem with this. Economists are terrible at actually forecasting productivity growth. So just because productivity growth has been weak over the last few years doesn't mean it will necessarily be weak over the next five years.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nWell, it's a tricky one. Here's one that's tricky, too. Are there issues connected with financial market valuations that concern you? And that's kind of the grown-up question. Here's the one we all want to know. Any predictions on the Dow reaching 30,000 this year?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nNo way.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nOh, quick, call your brokers.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLet's put it this way, if it did reach 30,000, I would be concerned about the stock market valuation. I think one of the things that's interesting post the election is, I think the uncertainty level about policy has gone up enormously, yet markets have actually performed very well, especially the equity market.\n\nAnd that's actually pretty unusual. Usually markets don't like uncertainty. And so, one thing to ask yourself the question is, why are markets going up even though the uncertainty level has climbed so much?\n\nI think one of the reasons, perhaps, is the notion that political deadlock in Washington is going to ease. Another thing is maybe fiscal policy is going to ride in and provide some support for the economy. But it's an unusual environment, where uncertainty level goes up and the stock market goes up. There's a little tension there between those two things.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nThe VIX which is \u2013\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, that's the other thing. Volatility in the market is extraordinarily low. So, that's another thing that doesn't quite fit. You would think if uncertainty was high, you'd have a little bit more volatility. If I was going to write something down as a prediction, I guess I would think volatility will go up. At some point.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nWell, it is a confusing structure right now. I think it's hard for anyone to kind of predict this economy. But that kind of makes it fun. Let's talk about something else that is somewhat hard to fathom. What are your thoughts on the election? Let me make it a little more \u2013 are there lessons from the election that you think are particularly important for the economy going forward?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, obviously, the Federal Reserve is completely apolitical, so we don't take sides in terms of elections, and whether the Democrats or Republicans win. But I do think there is an interesting lesson in the election in the sense of support around the country and around the world for globalization, and why that support did not seem to manifest itself in terms of our election outcome.\n\nYou know, I think that globalization has lifted literally hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the last decade or two. And so I think net-net from my perspective it's been a good thing. But people have been left behind from globalization. I think a lot of people in the United States didn't put enough weight on those people. You look at income distribution in the United States it\u2019s become a lot more skewed. You look at income mobility in the U.S., it's not very good.\n\nI think those are things that we really need to work on is the country.  I think we really want to make it so that globalization lifts all boats rather than just some boats because if you don't have that, you're not going to have support for globalization. You're not going to have support for free trade. And if you don't have that, then I think that has its own set of consequences.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nYes, well, I think you've raised a great point, that there are both positive and negative consequences of globalization. Let me raise something that may have similar negative and positive, and that's the impact of technology. I think we're all beginning to see a brave new world in which technology is entering ways that even 10 years ago were hard to fathom. And you know, I think that just as globalization seems to have made people nervous about the future, so has technology.\n\nNow, what are your thoughts on that? Is technology going to be the bigger influence over the next decade? Is that what's going to change our economy and the ability of people to make that leap-up that you just talked about?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell I think technology is always challenging. I think it's been challenging for decades, even centuries. My mom for many years lived in Westville, Massachusetts, and if I have this right, it was the buggy whip capital of the world at one point.\n\nWell, Westville had to make the transition from being the buggy whip capital of the world to other things. And I think \u2013 so, I don't think this is new. I don't think this is a new story about technology.\n\nWhat I think is what's new is we have to do a better job in terms of retraining people, getting people the mobility they need so they can actually feel that they have a place in the new economy.\n\nI was thinking about this question about technology and you think about the U.S. farm sector. You think about how many people in the United States worked on farms in 1900 and how few people work on farms today. Same kind of tech, same science and process of technological transition, but the good news is we were able to find things for those people to do.\n\nPeople always have for many, many years, talked about how technology is going to put everyone out of work, and everyone's just going to have a lot of leisure. That has not panned out up to now at all, and so I'm just a little bit skeptical that now we're at that critical turning point. I could be wrong. This time could be different. But if you think about how long we've had these conversations about technology obsoleting everyone's skills and leading to massive unemployment, this has been a conversation that we've been having for hundreds of years, literally.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nIt's tricky now, though, isn't it? I mean in the past, I think you used to think about technology as taking away some of the lower-skilled jobs, and yet now we're seeing it kind of marching its way up. I think it'll be awhile before it gets to Fed presidents. But I know\u2026\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, there are some people in Washington that would like to make us conduct monetary policy by a rule.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nAnd there you go, a robot can do it. \n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWe don't think that's such a good idea, by the way.\nMaureen O\u2019Hara\n\nIt's an interesting challenging, and particularly here I saw some numbers the other day that the high school graduation rate in New York state is somewhere in the 70 percentage points. And again, as you think about the technology creating winners and losers, you know, obviously we\u2019re in education, all of us are committed to education, you know. Is that kind of crucial to the technology solution? What do we do with the people who don't?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think \u2013 I mean look, I think education is absolutely essential. Giving people the skills they need to sort of navigate in the 21st century economy.\n\nAnd the second thing we need to do a better job is actually retraining people so that the only education you get shouldn't just be when you're 18 to 22 years old or 25 years old. We need to have a better system where people can sort of retool themselves.\n\nI think a third thing we can do is a better job of matching the skills that people get in universities to the business needs. One of the things that we've been talking about for a long time is that the New York Fed has tried to have better partnerships between businesses and education, so that the skills that people are getting when they go to the university match the opportunities when they actually graduate.\n\nAnd I think we've made a lot of progress on that, but that's something that I think we could even do better on going forward.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nCan you turn us back to monetary policy again for a minute because, you know, one could argue that one of the major forces that helped us get through the crisis was monetary policy, with its expansive, you know, quantitative easing with the role that the central bank took up and really helped keep the financial markets from collapsing, and now also keeping the economy from collapsing.\n\nNow we have, as you mentioned earlier, the prospect for more fiscal stimulus, which in some ways makes it a little better\u2026\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nPotentially.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nBecause it's not just monetary policy, we\u2019ll have fiscal policy. But we also have a variety of other factors that may influence monetary policy. One of which is the possibility that we as a country are going to become more isolationist. And that has implications, doesn't it?  For your monetary policy and how you implement it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think we \u2013 as I said before, I think we have a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen on immigration and trade. Most economists \u2013 the overwhelming number of economists \u2013 think that open and free trade is a good thing, comparative advantage, you want to produce the goods and services that you're best at producing and let other people produce the goods and services that they're best at producing, and that actually generates gains for both sides. That's really the theory of trade.\n\nSo I think that\u2019s \u2013 so I think we don't want to lose sight of that. Obviously, to the extent that we \u2013 I think it's very \u2013 it's way too soon to sort of see how this is going to evolve. It could evolve in the direction where we negotiate hard and we get somewhat better trade deals for the U.S. and trade barriers around the world don't go up very much at all, if at all. That's probably not a bad outcome for the U.S., and I don't think it's a bad outcome for the world. Or you could go down the path that was quite a bit more pessimistic than that.\n\nSo, I think it's just too soon to sort of see which direction. You know, the Federal Reserve is going to obviously take the world as it is. I mean we \u2013 our objectives are set by Congress. Very clearly, maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. So we have two goals: employment and inflation.\n\nAnd if the world is a really good place, it maybe makes it a little easier to achieve those goals. And if the world is at a more difficult place, maybe it makes it a little harder to achieve those goals. But it doesn't change our goals, and it doesn't change our monetary policy mission.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nLet me turn that, our focus, just a tiny bit. You've been a leading critic of culture in the banking industry, and I kind of have a two-part question here. Do you think the era of bad behavior in banking is behind us? And here's the second part of the question:  some people would argue that the behavior wasn't really that bad but instead the regulators\u2026\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWho are those people?\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nThere was Elizabeth Warren, I'll say that, I think she\u2019s convinced. But some people would argue that the regulators used the opportunity to extract excessive fines from banks for behavior that maybe wasn't ideal but wasn't so horrible. There's two different perspectives. I think no matter how we look at it, some of the behavior of the banks was sort of unacceptable. Are we past that, do you think?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, first thing I would say is a lot of the behavior was just totally egregious, totally unacceptable. Not in the gray area. You know people talk about, well, it's hard to know where to operate in a gray area, I think a lot of the behavior was way over the line. \n\nWhen people are getting together in chat rooms trying to talk about how they can collude to rig a market, that's not in the gray area. That's way over the line.\n\nWhen people are consciously doing things to evade any money laundering rules and sanctions, that's not in a gray area, that's way over the line.\n\nSo I feel that most of the things that have resulted in fines can be tied to things that are not in a gray area. They're just way over the line.\n\nNow the question of whether the fines are excessive \u2013 I mean it's hard to know how you take the behavior and then map it back onto the fine. I think the important thing, though, is to make the fines big enough so that the senior management of these institutions doesn't just say, \"Well, I can just write a check, accept the bad behavior, and move on.\"\n\nIf the fines are substantial, then it actually gets some senior management\u2019s attention, and I think that's one of the reasons why banks are working harder on the issues of culture in their institutions.\n\nI've actually been very \u2013 you know, you asked me the question, is bank bad behavior over? I expect not because I think there's always people that test the limits of the law and regulation and are always trying to see where they can go. And there are obviously going to be bad apples in any really large organization.\n\nWhat I hope is that, one, the banks will sustain their effort to improve their cultures. Banks really are working on this. I spoke at a bank industry conference about a month ago, where they brought in all their very high potential mid-level people to talk about culture, and it was really them talking about bank culture and I came in for a very short period. I think I was the only person from the official sector that spoke there.\n\nAnd I thought the fact that they were taking all these people that are high-performers and spending a day trying to inculcate them with the importance of culture maybe suggests that we've passed a tipping point. So, that's important.\n\nI think the other thing that I'm hoping to see is the banks start to cooperate a little bit more with each other and share best practices on bank culture. Up to now it's been most banks working sort of on their own thing alone. I think if they actually shared best practices, shared survey results, to see how they were doing relative to their peers, that would also help them perform.\n\nAnd the last thing I would say on culture, I think we've got to continue to work on incentives. I have a very simple mantra. Incentives drive behavior. Behavior sets social norms. And those social norms define culture. So if you have the wrong incentives, you're probably going to have bad culture. If you have the right incentives, you're probably going to have a much better culture.\n\nOne thing that Preet Bharara said when he came to a conference we had at the New York Fed, he said one of the big challenges that he sees is that people don't speak up early enough when they see something wrong going on. He said that if people spoke up early, a lot of these big things would never have been big things. They would have been little things.\n\nAnd so, the important thing also is to really educate people that it's okay if you see something that bothers you, that you're not comfortable with, raise your hand. You're not doing anybody a favor by keeping silent, hoping it will go away. You're not doing anybody a favor by thinking, well, if I raise my hand, I'm sort of tattling on my colleagues. That is not the right way to think about it.\n\nBad behavior is not good for you, it's not good for the institution. And so, if you do see bad behavior, or something that you're not really sure whether it's bad behavior or not, raise your hand and raise it to your manager, and have a conversation about it.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nWell, I think, I hope you're right that we're reaching a new awareness of the fact that some behaviors just can't be accepted. You know, I don't care whether they're legal or not. They're over any kind of ethical lines. And we shall see, it's a new world, isn't it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYeah. It's very important that people understand that the idea is not to just perform to the regulation and the legal law. And one of the things we have, because we have a very legalistic system with lots of regulations with banks \u2013 people sometimes feel like, \"Oh, well, given that, I can do anything within those parameters.\"\n\nWell, the world changes faster than the regulations and law can sort of keep up. And so, using that as your guide in terms of what's good behavior, permissible behavior, I think is a very bad, bad guide.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nWell let me turn to one last question, and then we'll open it up to all of you. Would repeal of parts of Dodd-Frank, the Volcker Rule, be a good thing for the financial system? Any predictions about what's going to happen with financial regulation going forward?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think that it's certainly going to be looked at, and obviously we'll have to see how it makes its way through the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. I'm perfectly \u2013 I think it makes sense to look at the Dodd-Frank Act, to see which parts are working and which parts are not working so well.\n\nI mean, when I sort of think about the Dodd-Frank Act, I think there's really two things that we're trying to accomplish here. Number one, we're trying to make the probability of failure of large complex financial institutions a lot lower than it was before. So that means more capital, more liquidity, better governance, better risk management. And we want to keep all those things.\n\nAnd the second thing we're trying to do is that if a firm does get into trouble, we can actually allow it to fail without it threatening to take down the rest of the financial system. So that means you need good resolution regimes, and you need a financial system where you don't have a lot of vulnerabilities.\n\nYou know, one thing, for example, that we've accomplished over the last year is we've had money market fund reform. Money market funds were one of the accelerants of the crisis after Lehman Brothers failed.\n\nSo, fixing the financial system to address some of those structural weaknesses is also important. So I think keeping that part of Dodd-Frank, central clearing of derivatives, I think is something that makes the financial system more robust. Keeping all those parts I think makes a lot of sense.\n\nVolcker Rule? You could probably do the Volcker Rule in a more efficient way to achieve the same objectives without the burden of regulation that you have right now. You know, right now, if you're an equity trading desk and the equity market falls very violently, you really aren't supposed to go in and buy equities unless you actually have customer orders. So, you actually have this crazy situation where the equity desk can't actually buy equities to support the market.\n\nSo, I'd like to see the Volcker Rule looked at to see if there's a way of doing it in a way that \u2013 if you're a client-facing business, and you're trading your own asset class, you have a little bit more freedom to buy and sell when markets are volatile and maybe provide actually a little liquidity support in the market. But also make it a lot easier, I think, to enforce the Volcker Rule.\n\nThe other thing I would say is relief for smaller banking institutions. The financial crisis was not about small banking institutions. It was about large banking institutions and particularly it was about large broker-dealers. And so I think the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a lot of compliance and regulatory costs on smaller banking institutions.\n\nAnd I think \u2013 we have about 6,500 smaller banks in the United States plus a lot of credit unions and other financial intermediaries. Relief for those guys I think would be really, really valuable because the burden on them, they feel that burden disproportionately because they don't have as big an asset base to spread all those compliance costs across. And I think it has more of a real consequence because a lot of these institutions support small business lending, which I think is really important to have a vibrant economy.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nSo given the two goals you said that there were for the Dodd-Frank Act, it does make you wonder how the Congo Minerals Relief Act ever got into the Dodd-Frank. But maybe we'll leave the Congo Minerals for another night. Well, I think the issues we've talked about here have covered a wide range of areas, and let me turn it open to the audience here and see if we can come up with some other questions. How about you? Yes.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYou alluded to China and the concerns we had about it last year that have now gone away. Why do you think the narrative changed on that, why do you think China is doing better? Also, you know, we're seeing more about rising inflation, so is this really about rising inflation or is it about the end of the disinflationary-deflationary scare? Thank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell I think last January, early February, the markets were under a lot of distress. There was a big flight to risk aversion and markets went down pretty hard around the globe. I think part of the story was China, but I think part of the story was also worries about the slowdown in China leading to a big commodity bust, and that commodity bust then putting a lot of pressure on especially emerging market economies that were actually selling a lot of the products to China.\n\nChina's been on a much more sort of stable growth path this year. They've also clarified what their foreign exchange rate regime is. So I think people are a lot more comfortable in terms of how they're managing the renminbi.\n\nI think there are still challenges in China and they're still trying to reorient their economy from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. They're still an economy that I think that credit is growing quite rapidly and so you sort of worry about how sustainable that is over the long-run.\n\nBut I think it's much less of a focus of the markets today than it was a year ago, and I think the anxiety about the emerging market economies is much more focused on individual countries rather than sort of broad like it was a year ago.\n\nI mean financial conditions really, if you look at the financial markets post-election, we've seen stocks up, we've seen the dollar a little bit firmer. We've seen credit spreads narrow quite a bit, and we've seen bond yields up a little bit. But net-net, financial conditions haven't actually changed very much post-election. That was very different a year ago. Financial conditions were actually tightening quite sharply a year ago. And it wasn't really clear how far that was actually going to run.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nThere we go, question?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nCan you talk a little bit about balance sheet normalization, how you think about that in the context of monetary policy? In the September FOMC, you guys talked about thinking about balance sheet normalization in terms of when your rate hikes are well under way. What does \"well under way\" mean, how are you thinking about that?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI'm sure \"well under way\" means different things with different people. I think the -- we made it pretty clear in terms of our statements that we sort of want the active tool of policy to be short-term interest rates. And the balance sheet to be sort of in the background. We've also said that we wanted to get some room off the zero bound before we actually start to normalize the balance sheet, to end the reinvestment.\n\nNow I think my own personal view is, how soon you want that process to start depends not just about how much margin you have between the current federal funds rate and zero, but also how confident you are that you're actually not going to need to reduce the federal funds rate in the near-term.\n\nSo, to the extent that we become more confident, if we become more confident about the economic outlook, that the recovery will be sustained, then I think that for me \u2013 speaking for myself, and only myself \u2013 that might make me a little bit more comfortable to proceed with balance sheet normalization a little bit more quickly.\n\nI think the important thing here is that when balance sheet normalization occurs and we start to end the reinvestment, don't think of it as an active tool of policy. Think of it as a passive tool, number one. And number two, to the extent that we then do decide at some point in the future to taper or end the reinvestment, that will also be a way of removing accommodation. And so that would be a bit of a substitute for raising short-term interest rates.\n\nSo, I would guess, my own personal view, is if we move to balance sheet normalization, that might actually stretch out the process of raising short-term interest rates a little bit because the two are substitutes for one another in terms of removing monetary policy accommodation.\n\nThe Chair said in her testimony that this is something we're going to be looking at over the coming meetings. We want to make sure that we know exactly what we want to do long before we have to do it, and so obviously the discussion and contemplation of what the right strategy is here needs to start relatively early, so it can be done absolutely as soon as you actually might want to do something.\n\nPeople sometimes think that when we start talking about something in the minutes that that means that we're going to do something momentarily. Usually it takes a while for us to develop those themes and issues, and reach a consensus.\n\nSo, I wouldn't take a lot of signals just because it was in the minutes last time and something here is imminent.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nWell, you'll have a few openings, too, in the FOMC that have to get filled in before you'll get full strength. So again, a slightly different Federal Reserve Board going forward, too.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nAn excellent point, an excellent point. What have we got?  Here we go.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nIf the new Administration continues with this isolationist policy, is able to successfully put tariffs on imports, would that have an inflationary impact and would the Fed have to address that?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, again, I don't think that's \u2013 I don't really think that's the professed goal of the Administration. I think the Administration wants better trade deals and not \u2013 I think the question is whether they'll get better trade deals without actually having to put, you know, higher trade barriers in place.\n\nObviously to the extent that trade barriers go up and that would tend to raise import prices, that would feed into price level in terms of inflation, and so obviously, we had to take that into consideration in terms of how we do monetary policy.\n\nBut going to be happening in a dynamic world where a lot of other things are going on. So, I wouldn't want to take one thing and say, \u201cOh, if that happens, we're going to do X,\u201d because it really depends on, one, it\u2019s highly speculative what's going to happen on trade policy, and two, even if it happened, it would depend on magnitude and it would depend on a lot of other things that are going on.\n\nSo I think it's really hard to speculate about something like that.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nOkay, I see some hands way back there. So if you can hand the microphone to someone who's got their hand up, way back there, that'd be great.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nRecently, it's been speculated that the Trump trade policy actually will evolve into a border tax. It's been in the works in the Republican Party for the last several years. This would simply entail an increase across-the-board in taxation on imports and an equal proportional across-the-board decrease on all exports.\n\nFirst question would be, what do you think of this type of proposal? And second, if this were implemented, what do you forecast the impact to be?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, there's been a lot of discussion in Washington about this border tax adjustment. If you were starting with a corporate tax code from scratch, it would be, I think, quite attractive in a lot of ways because it basically eliminates a lot of the incentives to engage in games of transfer pricing. It reduces a lot of the incentives to book your intellectual property abroad.\n\nSo, it actually has a lot of attractive features. I think the challenge is that it's very different than the current tax regime, and so there really would be some pretty significant adjustment costs and frictions of moving from the current regime to that new regime.\n\nAnd so, I think the question is really going to be: do people think those adjustment costs are a price worth paying for what I would agree is probably a better corporate tax regime. Certainly, a much better tax regime than the one we have today.\n\nBut you know, there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be worried about how that adjustment is going to affect their particular industry. If you're an importer, you're going to be worried that your price of imports is going to go up.\nSome people argue that the dollar will move proportionately with the size of the import tax, so the import prices won't go up at all in dollar terms.\n\nBut, you know, that's theory, and people worry about how it will actually work in practice. So, I think this is just going to be a very heavily debated topic in Washington in the coming weeks and months.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nI think we have time for maybe one or two more. Let's let some people in the back again.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nHi, Mr. Dudley, nice to hear from you. I've got lots of questions, but I guess everyone gets to only ask one.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou can ask more than one, but I'll only answer one.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nOkay, so, I was going to ask some sort of structuralist post-Ricardian question, but I'll set that one aside.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nOn a similar vein, to what degree do you think that this challenging of facts and these threats about what is truth and, you know, journalistic integrity, to what degree did this affect the financial system and to what degree did this confidence in what the Wall Street Journal might say or the New York Times might say as a fact can affect confidence in financial institutions? And what remedies do you have, or does the Fed have, to combat that?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don't think I have any good real answers to that. I'll just have to say that I'm fact-based. New York Fed is fact-based. And I hope we stay that way.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nDo you have alternative facts? Just checking, just checking.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I think a healthy debate is a good thing about what facts matter and how the world works. You know, people can have different models about how the world works and what's important, and what's not. But I think that they have to be based on real evidence. So, I'm going to continue to live in my world, which is very much fact-based.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Hara:\n\nI think we have time for one more question, and we have someone back there who's got a mike.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYeah, Mr. Dudley, I have a question. You mentioned that there was some nefarious behavior by banks. I heard you mention that there was some nefarious behavior going on by banks during the financial crisis.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, the employees of banks.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nOk, employees of banks. My question is, there was \u2013 some of the big banks, including J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, basically bailing out the government and the FDIC, buying institutions like Countrywide, Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual.\n\nIn some of these cases, they were given winks and nods by the government that they were not going to be held accountable for let's say the sins of these institutions that they took over.\n\nBut then what happened, they did this, and then later on, these institutions were fined billions of dollars by the government. And I guess my question is would you call this nefarious behavior on the part of the government to do this to these companies that basically helped out the government and the FDIC, in taking over these insolvent institutions?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I wasn't part of any of those conversations, so I don't know what winks or nods were actually exchanged.\n\nLook, I think the banks are, people are, managers are big boys and girls. And I think when they were making these transactions, they had the ability to negotiate whatever terms and conditions that they wanted to negotiate.\n\nNow, I understand that there's some bad feelings after the fact, to the extent that the sins of the institutions that were acquired went along with those entities. But it'd be a little bit sad if you can have institutions do lots of bad things and then have them acquired and then have their sins sort of automatically forgiven because they were acquired by another institution. That would be a sort of \"get out of jail free\" card. And so I'm not sure that's necessarily the right approach either.\n\n[END OF SESSION]"

    "content": "Good morning.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this year\u2019s gathering of the National Retail Federation.  Retail activity plays a key role in the U.S. economy, with consumption comprising about two-thirds of total gross domestic product.  As such, understanding what is happening in your sector is critical in assessing the economic outlook\u2014and, with that, the outlook for employment, inflation and interest rates.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1  \n\nThis morning, I will be focusing on retail spending\u2014an important element of household consumption.  But, I will do so in a way that\u2019s perhaps somewhat different from the usual approach, focusing in particular on the connections between housing and retail sales.  I will argue that there have been some dramatic changes that have taken place in the way that households finance their consumption.  I believe\u2014and  hope to convince you\u2014that changes in the housing and mortgage markets have affected the willingness and ability of households to borrow, and that this, in turn, has had important consequences for the dynamics of consumption over the last decade.  It is an important reason why the economic recovery and expansion have been weaker than we would like, despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic activity.  It also matters as we look forward.  The good news is that, while the current expansion is quite old in chronological terms, it is still relatively young in terms of the health of household finances.  Later in my remarks, I will talk a bit about the outlook for consumer spending in 2017 and beyond.\n\nIt\u2019s worth starting off with some background in order to develop the linkage between housing wealth and retail spending.  Household incomes tend to increase as individuals grow older and become more skilled in their work and better matched to their employers.  This tends to continue until they approach retirement age.  This means that incomes are much higher later in life than when people first enter the workforce.  Ideally, households would like to be able to even out their consumption based on their lifetime incomes, raising consumption in their early adulthood years.  In general, this would mean that young people would consume a relatively high share of their incomes, while older people would save more. Indeed, young people might even wish to borrow against some of their future income so that they can enjoy some of those benefits earlier in their lifetimes.\n\nHowever, there are limits on the ability to shift consumption to earlier in life through borrowing.  One problem is that lenders don\u2019t have a reliable way to compel repayment of such debts.  Consequently, the young may not have access to the credit they need to even out consumption to the extent they would like.  A pledge of assets\u2014collateral\u2014can help to solve this problem, since it can be claimed by the lender in the event of a loan default.\n\nFor most households, the main form of wealth is human capital\u2014the value of the wages that the household members can earn over the course of their lifetimes.  But human capital cannot always be credibly pledged as collateral.  For funding of educational investments, government intervention in the form of the federally-guaranteed student loan program helps address this problem.  While private student loans exist, they typically require a co-signer with a strong credit record.  Moreover, these borrowing sources are broadly restricted to education-related spending only.\n\nThe second most important asset on the balance sheet of many households is housing equity.  So, in addition to being a source of shelter, housing can be a major form of collateral for borrowing for many households.  In fact, for those households that have collateral available to secure loans, housing equity is by far the most important form of collateral.\n\nWhat this tells us is that the performance of the housing and mortgage markets are important to the retail business.  When home prices are rising and housing equity can easily be converted into cash, we can expect to see relatively high levels of consumption, all else equal.  Conversely, when home prices are flat or declining, or mortgage credit is tight, this will put a damper on retail spending.  Events of the last decade have driven this point home in a very clear way.\n\nIt is well known that beginning in the mid-1990s and intensifying in the early 2000s, there was a massive U.S. housing boom that dramatically increased the value of residential real estate in the United States.  Over the period from 1995 to 2006, the aggregate value of real estate owned by households and nonprofits nearly tripled, rising from $8.6 trillion to nearly $25 trillion.\n\nA remarkable, yet not widely-known, fact about this boom period is that while home values were rising very quickly, borrowing was growing almost exactly as fast.  Rather than saving the extra wealth that was being generated by the housing boom, households were diverting a large share of it to other purposes.  Indeed, the fraction of every additional dollar of households\u2019 housing wealth that was consumed seems to have been higher than that for financial wealth\u2014such as investments in equities and bonds\u2014suggesting that they viewed the increase in home prices as permanent.\n\nIn order to be able to assess the evolution of household finances more precisely, we worked with Equifax\u2014a major credit bureau\u2014to create a new database that tracks the credit files of a random sample of households over time.  From this consumer credit panel data, we conclude that between 2004 and 2006, households were increasing their cash flow by over $200 billion a year by borrowing against their housing equity collateral.  They supplemented that with another $185 billion through non-mortgage borrowing.  So, at the height of the boom, annual consumption was being supplemented by around $400 billion in cash flow from debt, much of it collateralized by housing.\n\nAs we now know, homeowners were mistaken in viewing the home price increases during the boom as permanent.  Things turned quickly as housing supply increased, home prices softened and mortgage underwriting standards tightened sharply as credit losses on residential mortgage lending climbed.  The rise and fall of mortgage securitization activity marked by tranching mortgage cash flows into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) exacerbated the downturn.  Home values began to fall in mid-2006.  By 2008, we saw a massive reversal in the way people used their housing equity to finance consumption.  People went from borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars per year and increasing their mortgage debt, to paying back hundreds of billions dollars and reducing their mortgage debt.  Households deleveraged even apart from the decline in household debt associated with the charge-offs from foreclosures.  Instead of $400 billion in net cash flow from increased borrowing, this net cash flow sharply reversed to negative $150 billion by 2010, with increased residential mortgage debt pay-down being the main source.  This rapid swing\u2014a reduction of more than $500 billion on an annual basis\u2014in the resources available for household consumption was associated with a sharp and prolonged slump in personal consumption expenditures during the Great Recession.  Typically, consumption growth slows but remains positive during a recession.  In contrast, consumption actually contracted by over $300 billion during the Great Recession.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, households continued paying down debt of all kinds\u2014with the exception of student loans, which behave differently from most other forms of consumer borrowing.  Ultimately, housing prices stabilized and began to increase again in 2012.\n\nHowever, since that turning point in home prices over five years ago, something surprising has happened.  Nationally, home values have risen over 40 percent since 2012, and are now very close to their pre-crisis levels on average\u2014just 4 percent below their all-time peak reached in early 2006.  Most other kinds of debt\u2014first auto, and now, credit card debt\u2014have joined student debt by starting to rise again, resuming their traditional role in financing consumption.  The surprising development is that housing debt has stayed virtually flat.  The previous behavior of using housing debt to finance other kinds of consumption seems to have completely disappeared.  Instead, people are apparently leaving the wealth generated by rising home prices \u201clocked up\u201d in their homes.\n\nThe implications of this development have been quite significant for the retail sector.  As I noted earlier, housing debt during the boom was rising at essentially the same pace as home values, leaving household leverage ratios more or less constant.  If housing debt had risen apace with home prices since 2012\u2014rather than staying flat as it has\u2014then we would once again be seeing housing debt producing cash flows available for consumption of about $200 billion a year.  Instead, households continue to divert about $200 billion annually to paying down their housing debt.  That\u2019s a difference of roughly $400 billion per year, or about 3 percent of total consumption.  Relative to historical patterns the household saving rate currently seems quite high, given the ratio of household net worth to disposable income.\n\nSo, why has household behavior with respect to housing debt apparently changed so much?  As always, the data reflect the result of the interaction between the demand and supply sides of the credit market.  One obvious demand-side candidate is that consumers may have become more cautious about housing\u2019s value as a financial investment, or its value as collateral for borrowing to finance consumption.  That is, households may have come to view housing wealth as more similar to financial wealth in that changes can be transitory rather than permanent.  Consequently, it may be viewed as prudent not to spend too much out of increases in these sources of wealth.  Additionally, the deep job losses that occurred during the Great Recession may have also impressed on households the need for precautionary savings against adverse income shocks.\n\nIn fact, the lessons from the housing boom and bust may have been even more traumatic.  There are many versions of this story, and most have a word like \u201cscarring\u201d in them.  Perhaps some potential homeowners, having seen the wild gyrations in home prices during the 2000s, have soured on homeownership altogether.  This would result in a reduced homeownership rate due to a loss of confidence in housing as a good financial investment.  Data indicate that homeownership has declined, especially among younger workers.  However, households in our Survey of Consumer Expectations continue to report that they believe that housing is a sound financial investment.  So, the explanation for our declining homeownership rate doesn\u2019t appear to be that homeownership has lost its luster as an investment.  And, reduced homeownership doesn\u2019t explain why people who still own homes have become less likely to tap their available equity to finance consumption.\n\nOther households may have been scarred by the experience of seeing their neighbors who borrowed heavily during the boom lose their homes and have their credit ratings badly damaged. Observing these consequences may dissuade current homeowners from making themselves vulnerable to foreclosure by borrowing against rising home values.  This would lead to an increase in a household\u2019s precautionary demand for savings in the form of higher housing equity.  This increased equity cushion would guard against the risk that the household could find itself in a negative equity position in the event of a future decline in home prices.  With an equity cushion, even if the household were to experience a job loss during a future housing downturn, they would be able to sell their home, pay off the mortgage and avoid any damage to their credit.\n\nHomeowners\u2019 desire to finance consumption by borrowing against housing equity might also be diminished by their desire to retain their ability to move easily.  The decline in home prices during the bust eliminated many households\u2019 home equity, which is traditionally the source of down payments for households that wish to move and remain homeowners.  This mobility might be associated with a change of labor markets or an upgrade of your home or residential location.  It is possible that households have saved their newly recovered equity in order to rebuild the capacity to make future down payments and therefore restore this option to move.  It is certainly the case that mobility has declined since the housing bust, a fact consistent with this hypothesis.\n\nMany homeowners also took advantage of the Federal Reserve\u2019s accommodative monetary policy stance to refinance into very low fixed-rate mortgages.  As mortgage rates rise, there is a higher financial cost to extracting housing equity through a cash-out refinancing.  The pace of cash-out refinancing has indeed been very low even as housing equity has risen, consistent with this hypothesis.  But, owners have other ways of tapping equity, like taking out a second mortgage or a home equity line of credit (HELOC).  Interestingly, these forms of housing debt have been paid down even more aggressively than first mortgages.  So, the fluctuation in the level of mortgage rates also does not explain the change in household behavior.\n\nA final factor that may be reducing the demand for home equity extraction is a change in the distribution of housing equity in the population.  Even though aggregate home equity is back to pre-crisis levels, the data indicate that the growth in equity since 2012 has gone disproportionately to older, wealthier households.  Presumably, these households have less demand for credit to fund their consumption plans.  In contrast, those who would like to convert housing wealth into retail purchases have not yet seen their housing equity restored to its earlier levels\u2014reflecting, in part, slower rates of mortgage balance paydown.  In addition, younger and less credit-worthy households also experienced higher relative declines in homeownership rates.\n\nWhile some of these demand-side factors seem to be playing a role in reducing home equity extraction, there is undoubtedly a strong supply-side effect in operation as well.  Our consumer credit data indicate that lenders\u2019 adoption of minimum credit scores for mortgage lending and their considerably more rigorous underwriting standards for HELOCs have played a very important role in limiting consumers\u2019 ability to convert home equity into new consumption.  The drivers of this change in lender behavior are complex, but are likely to include a combination of more regulation and stress testing of banks\u2019 portfolios, more conservative practices by the government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2014which tend to dictate underwriting practices for a large part of the market\u2014and banks\u2019 own experience from the crisis period, when so many lenders faced extreme stress and residential real estate seemed to be the main culprit.\n\nThe fact that housing prices declined so much and that the foreclosure process was so often drawn out may also have caused lenders to reassess how much to rely on the housing collateral as security for their loans.  In response, lenders may have shifted their underwriting to put more weight on the creditworthiness of the borrower rather than relying mainly on the value of the collateral.  This is consistent with the fact that mortgage credit is now much harder to get for lower credit-rated borrowers than during the housing boom.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next? When and to what extent will households again start tapping home equity to fund their consumption?  Answers to these questions will determine the degree to which housing equity growth will add to income growth as a fundamental driver of consumption.  We do not want to repeat the experience from the housing boom, but there are prudent ways for households to access their housing equity.\n\nIt is hard to predict when the recent trends might change, given that some milestones have passed that could have reignited lenders\u2019 and borrowers\u2019 appetite for home lending.  First, home prices stopped falling in 2010, which could have been taken as a signal that a complete collapse was not imminent and that the worst was behind us, yet mortgage borrowers continued to divert cash to paying down their debts.  Second, home prices\u2014and home equity\u2014resumed their growth in 2012, indicating that the market was recovering.  Yet, far from extracting this equity, borrowers continued to pay down their mortgages thereby reinforcing the effect of the home price increases in terms of rebuilding housing equity.  Aggregate home prices and home equity have almost reached their previous peaks.\n\nTime will tell if there is a renewed appetite, on both lenders\u2019 and borrowers\u2019 parts, to convert housing wealth into consumption.  Perhaps, we will soon see a recovery in cash-out refinancing and in HELOC borrowing as a means for households to expand their consumption.  In this case, the household saving rate will begin to decline.  Or, we may need to wait longer for households to feel confident enough to extract some of their home equity, and for lenders to decide that expanding such lending is safe enough for their balance sheets.  Whatever the timing, a return to a reasonable pattern of home equity extraction would be a positive development for retailers, and would provide a boost to aggregate growth.  In the meantime, consumption growth will largely be determined by income growth, the trajectory of wages and the strength of the labor market.\n\nThe U.S. expansion is now in its eighth year.  By historical standards, it is long in the tooth.  Despite this, I am optimistic that the economic expansion will continue over the next few years.  First, it is important to note that economic expansions don\u2019t simply die of old age.  Usually, they end either because inflation climbs and the Federal Reserve responds by shifting to a much tighter stance for monetary policy, or because the economy gets hit with a large unanticipated shock that the Fed and the fiscal authorities cannot respond to quickly enough, or with sufficient force, to prevent an economic downturn.  While economic shocks are, by their very nature, difficult to forecast, the risk that the Fed will snuff out the expansion anytime soon seems quite low because inflation is simply not a problem.  Not only are underlying inflation trends very subdued\u2014for example, the core personal consumption expenditures deflator has risen at only a 1. 7 percent annual rate over the past year\u2014but the economy is not growing much above its sustainable long-term pace.  Thus, while pressures on labor resources have been increasing, but quite slowly.  Finally, the recent strengthening of the dollar will put downward pressure on import prices and limit the ability of domestic producers to raise their prices.\n\nSecond, the household sector\u2019s financial condition is in unusually good shape for this point in the economic cycle.  Household indebtedness is relatively low, debt service burdens relative to household income have fallen to levels not seen since at least the early 1980s.  Moreover, household incomes are rising at a moderate pace, supported by continued job gains and some modest strengthening of wage compensation trends.  If households and lenders again become comfortable with financing consumption with debt in addition to income, this will provide additional support to household spending and to the current economic expansion.   \n\nThe challenges in the retail space over the near term, therefore, are not likely to be a shortfall of aggregate demand from households.  Instead, it seems to me the challenges lie more in how to satisfy households\u2019 changing demands for goods and services, and the medium through which these demands are satisfied\u2014whether it be brick and mortar or  online.  Also, there is the important issue of how to retain brand loyalty in a world where information is ubiquitous and always near at hand, and it is easy to shift purchases among participants in the retail marketplace.    \n\nThank you for your kind attention. \n\n1 Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparing these remarks."

    "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170111",
    "content": "I very much appreciate having the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s program. Improving the culture of financial services is an important issue for me and my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as for many senior policymakers both domestically and abroad. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nWhy should we seek better culture in the financial services industry? We do this to achieve better outcomes in terms of conduct and behavior\u2014and, with that, greater trustworthiness in our nation\u2019s financial system. Greater trustworthiness will make it easier for the financial industry to perform its role in supporting economic activity and rising living standards. Greater trustworthiness will also make it easier to attract top talent into the industry. Without that, the industry will suffer.\n\nThe focus of today\u2019s event is the role you can play as future leaders of the industry. Your firms selected you to attend because of your career success thus far and your potential for senior leadership. It is timely, therefore, for you to consider what type of leader you want to be, what type of firm you want to lead, and what type of industry you want to work in and influence. I have some views on all three, which we will get to in a moment.\n\nI am encouraged that members of the industry have convened here today to engage on these issues. I think it is important that the industry tackle this together. You can learn from one another. And, given the scandals of recent years, you really do have to sink or swim together.\n\nBefore the recent spate of conduct problems, there were times when one might be secretly happy when a competitor stumbled through some sort of misconduct. All the better if such a stumble generated negative publicity and headlines. Today, the situation is vastly different. When each new scandal emerges, the industry is painted with the same broad brush. This underscores the importance of taking both individual and collective responsibility for reform. You have a personal stake in improving bank culture. Your firms have a stake too. And so does the industry.\n\nThere are three messages I am going to focus on today:\n\nFirst, stay in banking and be good role models of the behaviors and conduct that we all want to see. It\u2019s important. The banking industry needs your talents. And, if done the right way, it will result in a fulfilling career.\n\nSecond, banking does not have its own ethics\u2014nor should it have its own ethics. The qualities that you value in other aspects of your life should be the same qualities you apply at work and encourage in your colleagues.\n\nThird, candid assessment is critical to improving culture. I invite you to think in particular about the incentives and norms of behavior within your organizations. Do they support or impair the qualities and principles that guide you and that your firm espouses?\n\nBefore expanding on those points, let me explain why I believe that reforming culture is important, and justifies the time and effort of not only of today\u2019s program, but of the ongoing work at your institutions and collectively across the industry.\n\nThe manipulations of LIBOR and foreign exchange rates prompted the New York Fed\u2019s work on culture. Of course, widespread misconduct did not originate with either episode. The timing, however, was significant. Despite the near-death experience of the financial crisis, new rules and regulations, and\u2015in some cases\u2015large fines and penalties, the LIBOR and FX events made clear that serious ethical and behavioral problems had persisted in the industry. I was particularly struck by how the manipulation of foreign exchange rates occurred even after the LIBOR fixing was widely known. The appropriate lessons from the LIBOR scandal did not seem to have been learned. That was both surprising and profoundly disappointing to me.\n\nThe LIBOR and FX collusions were not occasional atonalities in an otherwise harmonious financial system. They were not two remote tail risks that both happened to materialize, or just a bad coincidence. There have been too many examples of other misconduct to list. Wells Fargo is the most recent example, but serious misconduct is not confined to a single jurisdiction or a business model. The evidence, which now stretches over a decade, has only reaffirmed my initial belief that there is an industry-wide problem.\n\nIn light of these continuing and widespread failures, my colleagues and I recognize the importance of culture\u2014that is the unwritten norms and accepted practices of an organization. The culture of each firm will necessarily be its own. But the pervasiveness of problems\u2014across firms and countries\u2014points to common, industry-wide norms that need attention.\n\nAn industry-wide problem needs an industry-wide solution. I also think that, when the problem is cultural, any solution must be industry-driven. It is the public sector\u2019s job to establish and enforce rules, but rules face some inherent limits in shaping conduct and behavior. It is natural to adapt to the behaviors that we observe around us. A common illustration of this point is the speed limit. Most drivers move with the flow of traffic. They pay less attention to a number posted on a sign.\n\nThis is not to deny the necessity and importance of regulation, or to criticize any of the particular rules imposed in response to the financial crisis. But, we also must recognize that it is impossible to create a rule for every situation. Also, rules tend to be reactive rather than proactive. Rulemakers\u2014whether they be members of Congress, regulators or judges\u2014are almost always responding to events. And, even if rules could cover every situation, having a rule does not mean that people will always follow it. In many recent examples, the behaviors we observed violated rules already on the books. Thus, more rules and penalties alone will not cure the industry\u2019s underlying problems. They are necessary, but not sufficient.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, establishment of too many brightline rules may prove counterproductive in encouraging a good culture. For one thing, intricate and detailed rules can be construed as implying that the responsibility for good conduct rests with supervisors and regulators. For another, rules may create opportunities or incentives for legal or regulatory arbitrage\u2014finding creative ways around rules. And this activity may, in itself, have insidious effects on culture.\n\nAs I see it, the problem occurs when an organization\u2019s culture equates \u201cwhat is right\u201d with what is legally permissible, and when \u201cwhat is wrong\u201d becomes equivalent to what is legally impermissible. The technical legality of the rule, not the propriety of our conduct, becomes the arbiter of our actions. A proliferation of rules may prompt us to ask first what we can do, not what we should do. Legal arbitrage is intellectually energetic, but ethically lazy.\n\nAnd, as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara has observed, if you spend your time thinking about how close to the line you can get, it is inevitable that you will at some point cross that line. No one gets the arbitrage right 100 percent of the time.2 When you make that mistake, you will not only have a bad culture, but you will also have to deal with Preet Bharara\u2019s office.\n\nTherefore, what\u2019s needed is a better culture. Culture can help to fill in the spaces between and beyond rules. Culture also shapes our attitude toward rules. A strong, ethical culture is one in which individuals within an organization demonstrate to each other a commitment to certain first principles. These principles must align with both the private purpose of the organization and the public rules governing its operations.\n\nOf course, it is possible for principles to conflict. When that occurs, determining the right course will be difficult. But, the more you wrestle with that conflict, the better you will become at resolving ethical quandaries. Aristotle called this aspect of ethics \u201chabit,\u201d but I prefer to think of it as ethical muscle memory. The more practice you have in thinking about it, the better you will be at determining what is right.\n\nBankers will be more likely to think about what is right, as opposed to what is merely legal, the more often they observe their colleagues doing the same. I doubt that rules alone can accomplish this. Telling people to be ethical doesn\u2019t make it so. Seeing others engage in ethical decision-making is, by contrast, quite powerful.\n\nWith that prologue, let me turn to my first message: Stay in banking. This might be a surprising message in light of my introduction. Nonetheless, banking is important work. Society relies on its financial system to \u201ccreate substantial value for our society.\u201d3 As investor and author John Bogle has written:\n\nTo fulfill its potential for creating value for society, the financial system needs talented and dedicated people at the helm. This is especially true for banks, which are indispensable to our economic system.\n\nAs the philosopher Onora O\u2019Neill has observed, banking requires more than just technical competence.5 Bankers must reproduce their efforts and results with reliability. And, above all, bankers must be honest. They must do what they say and say what they mean. This is necessary for the financial system to be viewed as trustworthy. Without that, the financial industry cannot be effective in performing its key roles.\n\nCultivating these three traits emphasized by Onora O\u2019Neill\u2014competence, reliability and honesty\u2014will help enable you to have a personally fulfilling career. The best doctors or lawyers do their work not only because it pays well, but because it is interesting and contributes an important service to society. I hope you feel the same about what you do. And if you don\u2019t, I urge you to consider how your industry can become more professionally fulfilling. What is needed for you to feel better about your work, to sleep more soundly, to worry less about the risk posed to your business by potential misconduct?\n\nYour professional fulfillment will grow if you also contribute to promoting these qualities in others\u2014that is, by helping to improve the culture of financial services. It is easier to be smart, dependable and trustworthy when you are surrounded by other people who also fit that description.\n\nMy second message is to reject the idea that a separate regime of ethics or morality applies in banking. I\u2019m sure you have heard this, or perhaps even thought this, at some point in your career. Let it end there. We often teach our children by asking them if they would engage in that type of behavior at home. This is good professional advice as well.\n\nBankers have been criticized for their ethical and moral shortcomings. That criticism has legitimate grievances at its roots. There have been far too many instances in which bankers have not lived up to expectations. But it is also true\u2014and I\u2019m sure you have experienced this\u2014that you have advanced in your careers because you have demonstrated personal attributes that anyone would be proud to possess. I mentioned before honesty, competence and reliability. You could add to that list hard work, perseverance and responsiveness.\n\nMoreover, if you are like me, your careers will have benefitted from teamwork\u2014the good fortune to work with capable colleagues. Individual effort is essential, but success often depends as well on the contributions of others.6 Whatever list you have come up with, make sure that teamwork is among your core personal principles.\n\nI would also like to make a slightly different observation on banker ethics. What\u2019s missing is not so much a personal commitment to good conduct, but rather a commitment to call out bad conduct observed in others. You might think it is a paradox or a contradiction to praise teamwork in one breath, and then in the next breath to call for raising the red flag when you see bad conduct in others. I do not see it that way.\n\nWe hear often that integrity is a corporate value. I think what is often meant by this is honesty\u2014doing what you say, and saying what you mean. But integrity, to me, has an additional meaning. It means operating according to a single, internally consistent set of principles. If you are honest only in some places or circumstances, but not others\u2014or only with some people, but not others\u2014then honesty is hardly integral or integrated into your life and work.\n\nThe importance of this particular meaning of \u201cintegrity\u201d was made apparent to me on a recent visit I made to the United States Military Academy at West Point. The faculty and students there believe that strong individual ethics are what make large organizations like the U.S. armed forces succeed. The commitment of cadets to living the ideals of the institution was impressive and humbling. They embodied the word integrity\u2014alignment of word and deed in all aspects of life.\n\nAnother lesson that I took from West Point is that cadets commit to integrity because their careers\u2014and, in combat, their lives\u2014depend on others. We are in this together\u2014this city, this industry, this country. And if we\u2019re in it together, we all have to behave in ways that benefit the group.7 We have to behave in ways that merit the trust of others.\n\nWhether we are citizens or soldiers, the most important relationships in our lives are built on trust. In our personal lives, we take action when our trust has been betrayed. To reform financial services, we need to bring the same expectations of trust\u2014and the consequences of a breach of that trust\u2014to the office each day. If you would not tolerate a practice in your personal life, do not tolerate it in the office.\n\nCalling out bad conduct is not easy. Let me share with you another observation from Preet Bharara. A common element in many of the frauds his office has prosecuted is the failure of colleagues to call out bad conduct by raising their hands. This is so telling of a culture that condones or promotes misconduct. People see something, but do not say something. And, it is so shortsighted. It prevents problems from being addressed while they are small. By not raising their hands, these colleagues are \u201cquietly adding risk to your books [and] invisibly enlarging your liabilities.\u201d8 They are also tacitly encouraging bad conduct by skewing incentives.\n\nThere may be many reasons for choosing silence over raising your hand. You may face a conflict of loyalties. It\u2019s uncomfortable to tell on a colleague. You may think that the problem will just go away, or that calling attention to a problem will harm the firm. Raising your hand is difficult. But, it is also absolutely necessary. As rising leaders in the industry, you need to lead by example. In doing so, you will make it easier for others to follow your lead.\n\nMy final message is a request that each of you commit to a candid assessment of yourselves, your firms and your industry. For Adam Smith, candid observation was a cornerstone of economic behavior:\n\nCandid self-assessment is essential to knowing where you stand and how you are progressing toward your goal. Industry groups here and in other financial centers are working on useful ways to measure culture\u2014consistent with the maxim, \u201cif it\u2019s important, you will measure it.\u201d But, assessment cannot stop there, and it cannot be the job of someone else\u2014such as management, compliance, audit or a regulator. Each of us must also be reflective about our own faults. We must also commit to do better going forward.\n\nWhen it comes to making a candid assessment of your group, your firm and your industry, I would like to suggest that you devote significant attention to incentives. I believe that incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture. If you want a culture that will support your long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors that will sustain your business over the long haul.\n\nThere are many ways of encouraging certain behavior through incentives. Promotion is quite powerful, as is compensation. They are powerful, in part, because they convey values and community esteem. People work hard to earn money. But, most also work hard to earn the trust and respect of colleagues, peers, subordinates and seniors. If you want to know what behaviors are valued or esteemed in reality, look to see who is promoted and well-compensated and the behaviors that they embody. Do the results match what is said? Do they match your expectation of fairness? Do you aspire to be one of these individuals, not because of their status and compensation alone, but because of the esteem you hold for them and their values?\n\nOver the long haul, the economy needs a vibrant and trustworthy financial sector in order to thrive, just as the financial sector needs a vibrant economy to thrive as well. You are the rising leaders of your firms. You can help accomplish these aims. A strong and ethical culture in the banking industry will make it more trustworthy, and therefore more effective in performing its mission. It will also help the industry be held in higher esteem and this will help attract the talent needed to sustain the industry. I am encouraged by today\u2019s gathering, and hope you will take heart that an improved culture in the financial services industry is both necessary and possible. Thank you for your continued efforts and your kind attention.\n\n1 Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Thomas Noone, Joseph Sommer and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See Criminal Accountability and Culture, Remarks by Preet Bharara, Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry: Expanding the Dialogue, October 20, 2016.\n\n3 See John C.
