    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to the New York Fed. We are so pleased to be co-hosting this conference with the Bretton Woods Committee.\n\nMy remarks today will focus on the economic picture in the United States, including the monetary policy actions we are taking and my outlook for the economy. Before I go further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dual Mandate\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate, set by Congress, to achieve maximum employment and price stability. We are doing well on the employment side of the mandate. The unemployment rate has been below 4 percent for the past 21 months. That\u2019s the longest stretch since the 1960s. And it\u2019s in line with my 3-3/4 percent estimate of the unemployment rate expected to prevail in the economy in the longer run.\n\nBut the imbalances between supply and demand that have persisted since the onset of the pandemic have contributed to unacceptably high inflation. As measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, inflation surged to a 40-year high of just over 7 percent in June of last year. Since then, we have seen the inflation rate fall to 3 percent. This is a significant and welcome decline. Nonetheless, inflation is still too high.\n\nPrice stability is the bedrock upon which our economic prosperity stands and is essential to ensure maximum employment over the long term. The FOMC is committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.\n\nThe Inflation Onion\n\nTo understand why inflation rose so much and why it\u2019s moderating, I\u2019ve been using the metaphor of an onion for the past year.1 Each layer represents a different sector of the economy.\n\nThe outermost layer of our inflation onion represents globally traded commodities. As demand for commodities soared at the onset of the pandemic, inflation surged, then rose again when Russia invaded Ukraine. By late June of last year, food price inflation had increased to over 10 percent, and energy price inflation had skyrocketed to over 40 percent.\n\nOver the past year, global demand has come into better balance with supply, thanks in part to restrictive monetary policy from many central banks around the world. Commodity price inflation has come down significantly. Food price inflation has dropped to about 2-1/2 percent\u2014even the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner was cheaper than a year ago.2 And energy prices have been falling over the past year, pulling down the overall inflation rate rather than pushing it higher.\n\nThe onion\u2019s second layer is made up of core goods that exclude food and energy. Here, too, we\u2019re seeing the effects of a rebalancing of supply and demand. And global supply-chain bottlenecks, which triggered widespread shortages of goods during the pandemic, are mostly a thing of the past. The New York Fed\u2019s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which measures the extent of supply-chain disruptions, attained its most favorable reading on record in October, based on data going back to 1998.3\n\nAs a result of the rebalancing of supply and demand and an easing of supply-chain bottlenecks, core goods inflation is now running around 1/4 of a percent. And it appears to be on its way to returning to pre-pandemic rates.\n\nWhile the outer layers of our onion have seen the fastest and largest improvements, the inner layer is making progress, too. After peaking at about 5-3/4 percent earlier this year, core services inflation is now around 4-1/2 percent, and more recent readings point to further slowing of inflation in this category.\n\nA big driver of the surge in core services inflation has been sharp increases in the price of shelter. Shelter price inflation was boosted by strong demand and limited supply during much of the pandemic and in its aftermath. More recently, rents for newly signed leases have been increasing at closer to pre-pandemic rates. As these data are incorporated into the official statistics, the inflation rate for shelter should continue its downward trend. Inflation for services excluding housing and energy is also beginning to move in the right direction. Over the past six months, inflation in this category has slowed to about 4 percent, well off the 5-1/4 percent peak we saw in December of 2021.\n\nFuture Indicators\n\nThat summarizes what\u2019s happening with the various layers of the onion. But what does it mean for inflation going forward?\n\nInflation expectations are one important indicator of future inflation. And longer-run inflation expectations are at levels consistent with the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent goal. According to the New York Fed\u2019s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations, medium-term expectations, which were elevated during 2021-2022, are now fully back to pre-pandemic levels.4\n\nMeanwhile, one-year-ahead inflation expectations have fallen dramatically since peaking at nearly 7 percent last June. They are now only about three quarters of a percentage point above average levels seen over 2014-2019.\n\nA second useful indicator for inflation trends is the New York Fed\u2019s Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation. After reaching nearly 5-1/2 percent in June of last year, the MCT was 2.9 percent in September. Other indicators of underlying inflation are similarly showing significant declines since last year.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nLet me now turn to the other side of our dual mandate: employment.\n\nAfter the recovery from the pandemic recession, the labor market turned red hot. Demand far exceeded supply. And this imbalance contributed to rising wage growth and higher inflation.\n\nNumerous indicators point to a gradual return to balance. Job openings continue to trend downward. The quits and hires rates are back to pre-pandemic levels. So are perceptions of jobs availability and the ability to fill jobs. Wage growth, although still elevated, has slowed considerably.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen meaningful improvements in the supply side of the labor market. Labor force participation has increased significantly. And immigration rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels. But there are limits to how much supply can increase, and some further reduction in demand is needed to fully return balance to the labor market.\n\nA Restrictive Monetary Policy Stance\n\nThe FOMC has reached a restrictive stance of monetary policy. This is working to bring demand into balance with supply and inflation back to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Earlier this month, the FOMC kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.5\n\nAlong with our restrictive policy actions, financial conditions have tightened, driven in part by an increase in longer-term Treasury yields since the summer. While statistical models of Treasury yields generally attribute most of the increase to a rise in the term premium, financial market participants have expressed a wide range of views, with little conviction around any single explanation. The rise in yields and the elevated volatility likely reflect heightened uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and future interest rates.\n\nTaking into account tighter financial and credit conditions, I expect GDP growth to slow next year to about 1-1/4 percent, and the unemployment rate to rise to around 4-1/4 percent.\n\nI expect inflation to continue to move down to our 2 percent longer-run goal. As I mentioned earlier, slowing shelter price inflation should help bring the inflation rate down. And, based on New York Fed research that shows a strong relationship between the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index and goods price inflation, I expect to see additional disinflationary pressures on this layer of the inflation onion as well.6 My forecast is that PCE inflation will be around 3 percent for 2023 as a whole, then decline to around 2-1/4 percent next year, before closing in on 2 percent in 2025.\n\nAll of that said, the future remains highly uncertain, and our decisions will continue to be data dependent. The risks are two-sided, with the possibility of inflation remaining stubbornly persistent weighed against the risk of a weaker economy and employment.\n\nIn balancing these risks, and based on what I know now, my assessment is that we are at, or near, the peak level of the target range of the federal funds rate. Based on model estimates of the longer-run neutral interest rate that incorporate forecasts for the current quarter, the stance of monetary policy is quite restrictive; indeed, it is estimated to be the most restrictive in 25 years.7 I expect it will be appropriate to maintain a restrictive stance for quite some time to fully restore balance and to bring inflation back to our 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.\n\nI will continue to carefully watch the totality of the data to assess whether the current stance of policy is sufficient to achieve our inflation goal. If price pressures and imbalances persist more than I expect, additional policy firming may be needed.\n\nBefore I close, a word on our balance sheet. At our last meeting, the FOMC said it will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, according to the framework announced in 2022. The strategy and implementation of the reduction in our security holdings is working exactly as designed.8 We have so far reduced our securities holdings by over $1 trillion, with no signs of adverse effects on market functioning.9\n\nCommitted to Our Goal\n\nSince I first started to unpeel the inflation onion a year ago, we have seen meaningful progress on bringing inflation down and restoring balance to the economy.\n\nBut our work is not nearly done. I am committed to achieving our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal, creating a strong foundation for our economic future."

    "title": "Remarks at the New Jersey Bankers Association Regional Meeting",
    "date": "Nov 28, 2023",
    "speaker": "Dianne Dobbeck",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/dob231128",
    "content": "Thank you for having me here today. It\u2019s a pleasure to be speaking at the regional meeting of the New Jersey Bankers Association. In my remarks, I\u2019ll share some supervisory perspectives on current conditions in the banking sector. In our discussion to follow, I look forward to hearing more from you about the opportunities and risks facing your banks. I want to note that my remarks today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThis past spring, the banking sector faced significant stress as some banks experienced large and extremely rapid deposit outflows. Since the spring, the pressure on the banking sector has abated, and the banking system remains sound and resilient. Banking organizations maintain regulatory capital in excess of regulatory requirements.1 Profitability for the sector in 2023 has remained above its 10-year average.2 Delinquency rates remain low, although some loan sectors have seen limited deterioration year-to-date.3\n\nWhile the banking sector remains resilient, conditions have changed since last year. Loan growth has slowed, falling from 11% last year to 1% through 2023 so far.4 The slow-down is consistent with the tighter loan standards and weaker demand reported in recent Senior Loan Office Opinion Surveys.5 Funding profiles have also changed. Reliance on wholesale funding remains low but has increased from its historically low levels at the beginning of 2022.6 Liquidity remains ample overall, but liquid assets as a share of total assets has declined from its peak in 2021.7\n\nAs Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr recently said, \u201cpreserving a sound and resilient banking system requires continued attention to address identified vulnerabilities and vigilance to changing conditions.\u201d8 I\u2019ll discuss a few of the vulnerabilities we\u2019re focused on at the New York Fed. I\u2019ll then close with some remarks on updates to the Community Reinvestment Act.\n\nLiquidity and Operational Readiness\n\nThe rapid deposit outflows experienced by some banks this past spring demonstrate the importance of contingency funding planning. While deposits have stabilized since May, it is critical that all banks have in place contingency funding plans that are actionable, with contingent funding sources that can be accessed when they are most needed.\n\nAs supervisors, we often discuss with banks the concept of operational readiness, particularly for discount window borrowing. Steps that support operational readiness include ensuring borrowing agreements are in place, pre-pledging collateral, and conducting test transactions with discount window staff.9 During March and April 2023, I alongside other New York Fed colleagues spoke with many of you to discuss the importance of operational readiness, to provide background on the Bank Term Funding Program, and to offer follow-up conversations with our discount window colleagues. In July, the Board issued updated guidance on liquidity risks and contingency planning.10 I encourage you to review this important resource.\n\nCapital and Interest Rate Risk\n\nOne area we\u2019re focused on is the interlinkages between liquidity and bank capital. Concerns about solvency can drive deposit outflows. At the same time, deterioration in a bank\u2019s regulatory capital position can also reduce access to certain funding sources. For example, a bank that falls below well-capitalized levels may face limitations on its ability to fund itself with brokered deposits.11 Both large and small banks have increased their reliance on brokered deposits since the beginning of 2022. Reductions in regulatory capital can also limit access to contingent funding. My request is for all banks to review these interlinkages and understand how reductions in capital, including through significant earnings losses, could adversely impact access to existing funding sources.\n\nThe effects of higher interest rates are another watch point. Higher interest rates have resulted in reductions in the fair value of assets, especially investment securities and fixed-rate loans.12 Even when not recognized on bank balance sheets or regulatory capital, unrealized losses on assets can create risks for banks.13 One clear impact of higher interest rates has been reductions in banks\u2019 tangible capital. Tangible capital is another important metric that funding providers routinely review.\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial real estate (CRE) lending is an important part of many banks\u2019 business models, especially in the second district. Given stress in the CRE market, this is another area we are closely monitoring. While delinquency rates in CRE currently remain low, there has been some recent deterioration, especially in the office category.14 Community and regional banks would be most affected by losses in the sector given CRE loans make up a greater share of their loan portfolios.\n\nFor some CRE borrowers, deterioration in financial condition, such as reduced value of collateral and lower operational cash flows, could hinder repayment. This past summer, the banking agencies issued an update to previous guidance which encourages financial institutions to work \u201cprudently and constructively with creditworthy commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\u201d15 In certain cases, accommodations and workouts with borrowers may be a prudent course of action.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\n\nI\u2019ll now turn to the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. On October 24th, fifty years after the Community Reinvestment Act\u2019s enactment, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they do business. Vice Chair for Supervision Barr shared some of the key objectives of the CRA, which I\u2019ll reference.16\n\nFirst, the revisions strengthen the core purpose of the statute so that CRA is a strong and effective tool to address inequities in access to credit and enhance financial inclusion.\n\nSecond, the final rule modernizes the CRA to reflect the major changes that have occurred in the banking sector since 1995, including mobile and online banking.\n\nThird, the final regulation provides greater clarity and consistency in application of the regulations, including through the adoption of evaluation metrics and public benchmarks. It also provides clarity around which activities qualify for CRA credit through the adoption of clear criteria, a public list of qualifying activities, and a process for banks to confirm whether an activity is eligible.\n\nFourth, the revisions tailor the requirements of the CRA based on bank size and type.\n\nThis is a significant milestone. Examiners across the three banking agencies will continue to work closely together to ensure consistent implementation of the CRA.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the banking system remains sound and resilient. As supervisors, we remain attuned to vulnerabilities and fast-changing conditions affecting the sector. Thank you, and I look forward to our discussion."

    "title": "Disentangling Messages from the Treasury Market",
    "date": "Nov 16, 2023",
    "speaker": "Roberto Perli",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/per231116",
    "content": "Thanks very much for the opportunity to offer closing remarks after yet another fantastic U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Before proceeding, I want to thank staff from the Joint Member Agencies for convening a diverse and thoughtful group and putting on an engaging event.1\n\nThis annual discussion is a highlight of the New York Fed calendar, both for its ability to bring together a range of different participants\u2014including policymakers, academics, regulators, dealers, traders, and others\u2014and for the opportunity it provides to step back and think holistically about market design and structure. The Treasury market is critical for a robust and vibrant U.S. economy. But the Treasury market can only serve this purpose when it functions smoothly and its signals are not distorted by extraneous or idiosyncratic factors.\n\nMuch of the conversation today centered around how to ensure a well-functioning and resilient market. That is a fundamental goal, and I want to thank all of today\u2019s participants for their very valuable contributions in that area. In my remarks, I will focus on how a well-functioning Treasury market can be helpful for understanding the economy and informing monetary policy decisions.\n\nBefore proceeding, I will of course make the usual disclaimer: these views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.2\n\nThe Treasury market is particularly important from a monetary policy perspective for many reasons. I will mention just three here. First, changes in the prices of Treasury securities provide important signals about the economic outlook; these signals are inputs into policymakers\u2019 decisions, and it is crucial that they are as clear and uncontaminated as possible and that they are interpreted correctly. Second, short-maturity Treasury securities and Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) are an integral part of money markets and thus affect the implementation of monetary policy. And third, Treasury securities at all maturities are instrumental to the transmission of monetary policy, as many other market prices and loans are influenced by the prices of those securities.\n\nWe readily observe Treasury yields at all available maturities. For example, we can easily see that Treasury yields have increased sharply between July and October and have partly but abruptly retraced so far in November. The important question is, how should we interpret those swings?\n\nFirst, and most importantly from the point of view of what was discussed here today, the Treasury market appears to be functioning smoothly. Although a number of commonly used metrics indicate that liquidity is worse than it was in years past, those same measures are also broadly consistent with what one might expect given the current high levels of volatility (Panel 1).3 We see no evidence of market dysfunction. This generally means that we can take Treasury prices and their signals as an accurate reflection of the views of market participants.\n\nThat being the case, we must be equipped to decode that valuable information. In particular, it\u2019s not enough to just look at Treasury yields, because those can change for different reasons. Conceptually, observable Treasury yields are comprised of two unobservable components: the expected path of the policy rate over the life of the security, and the so-called term premium, which reflects potentially many factors that are separate from policy expectations. It is these unobservable components that are most useful to disentangle in order to understand the signals that the Treasury market is sending about the state of the U.S. economy. Precisely because these components are not observable, we need ways to estimate them from the available information.\n\nOne straightforward way to separate policy expectations from term premiums is to look at survey measures of the future path for the federal funds rate, call those \u201ctrue\u201d policy expectations, subtract them from observed Treasury yields, and call the difference the term premium. This method has the advantage of being simple and devoid of assumptions that necessarily have to be made when dealing with models. Still, it leaves something to be desired for a host of reasons. Survey results may not actually reflect underlying expectations because of inertia and other biases in responses. Moreover, surveys summarize the views of a limited number of respondents that often are not actively trading, and most likely are not the marginal investor. So, if we were to rely solely on survey results to determine the term premium component of Treasury yields, we would risk misinterpreting the message embedded in those yields.\n\nAn alternative method is to use models to split Treasury yields into their unobservable components. As one might expect, there are quite a few ways to do this\u2014including several models constructed by economists within the Federal Reserve System.4 Because models are constructed differently and rely on different assumptions and data inputs, they also produce results that at times can vary significantly from each other. And models tend to produce larger fitting errors at times of substantial volatility and uncertainty, which is precisely when we need them the most. But on the positive side, models don\u2019t suffer from the same drawbacks of the simple method based only on survey data that I just described and are instead based on theoretically sound economic and financial principles.\n\nSince the two broad methodologies have their own pros and cons, I find it useful to look at all the information available\u2014from models and from surveys\u2014to form a view of what the Treasury market is telling us. Luckily, while individual methods produce different point estimates of the level of policy expectations and the term premium component of Treasury yields, they often agree on which component is more important in driving changes in Treasury yields at any given time. This kind of kitchen-sink-approach helps us better understand recent moves in Treasury yields.\n\nI will take a brief detour to the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis to put current moves into a better context. For long stretches of the post-2008 period, policy rates were pinned at the effective lower bound. Investors understood the Fed\u2019s forward guidance, and policy expectations did not move a lot over these periods. As a result, most of the changes in short-term interest rates\u2014and even a meaningful fraction of changes in long-term interest rates\u2014were attributable to shifts in term premiums. Long-end term premiums, while still volatile, were in fact estimated to be quite low for most of those periods.\n\nThat has changed significantly over the past two years. Above-target inflation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic shock has put policy expectations firmly back in play as a driver of rates across the curve. Policy expectations appear to have increased throughout most of the cycle, as investors progressively adjusted up their estimate of how much the federal funds rate would have to be raised and how long policy would have to remain restrictive in order to bring inflation down.\n\nModel estimates of term premiums, while still volatile, appeared to have been rangebound at a low level for most of the hiking cycle to date. More recently, however, they have become significantly more important as a driver of Treasury yields. From the beginning of July to the end of October this year, 10-year Treasury yields increased by over 100 basis points. While the models we monitor produce different point estimates, on average, they suggest that term premiums accounted for the bulk of the change in yields over that period, with only a modest fraction attributable to policy expectations (Panel 2). Survey-based decompositions land us in a similar ballpark.\n\nThese recent fluctuations highlight the importance of disentangling the unobservable components of Treasury yields. If policy expectations had been the main driver of these recent swings in Treasury yields, one would have to conclude that investors believed that the underlying momentum in the economy was much stronger than anticipated over the summer and early fall and then suddenly changed their mind earlier this month. That would have contrasted sharply with recent economic and inflation data, which indicate robust growth but also show evidence of moderating inflationary pressures. And it\u2019s equally hard to see why policy expectations would have so quickly turned around in early November.\n\nSo, what drives term premiums? The broad uncertainty that surrounds the outlook is an important factor. Conceptually, higher uncertainty is a main determinant of term premiums. Sources of uncertainty abound these days, from questions about the longevity of the recent uptick in growth, to the likelihood of further inflation or disinflation. There is also discussion about the reduced demand relative to the past from buyers who are less price sensitive\u2014banks, insurance companies, central banks, and pension funds, for example. At different points in time, these buyers have served as an important source of demand in volatile environments. Market commentators have also discussed the changing relationship between fixed income and equity returns as the economic effects of tighter policy play out with the usual long and variable lags.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the recent changes in Treasury yields have been concentrated in forward rates at horizons beyond the next couple of years. This suggests that, whatever has led to such sharp reassessments of term premiums, it is something that affects longer-term perceptions of risk rather than something that might be around the corner. Market participants point to several sources of that longer-run uncertainty, from changes in the underlying structure of the U.S. and global economy, to the risk of a secular widening in the federal fiscal deficit, to fundamental shifts in the geopolitical balance of power. All of these factors can affect long-term interest rates in ways that are not directly tied to the longer-run outlook for monetary policy.\n\nImportantly, most of the move in Treasury yields has been driven by real interest rates (Panel 3). Based on market pricing as well as survey data, including our own Desk Surveys, it\u2019s hard to conclude that longer-run inflation expectations are anything other than well anchored. At current levels, forward measures of inflation compensation are well within historical ranges, while spot measures are at the high end of pre-pandemic ranges (Panel 4). And a significant portion of the changes we observed earlier can arguably be attributed to risk and liquidity premiums in inflation-linked markets as well as swings in oil prices.\n\nTreasury yields, and therefore term premiums, are important drivers of financial conditions. Since financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy\u2014as Chair Powell said during his most recent press conference\u2014it\u2019s important to monitor and understand these movements and put them into the right context.\n\nA key question is whether higher term premiums will prove temporary or persistent. Estimating unobservable term premiums is hard enough, as I mentioned, and forecasting them is even harder. But, in general, if factors such as the longer-run fiscal balance or the prevalence of supply shocks over demand shocks going forward will be the drivers of term premiums, it is possible that term premiums will stay higher than they used to be for some time. In that case, financial conditions are likely to remain tight, and in particular tighter than implied by monetary policy rate expectations. Conversely, if the drivers of the recent swings were more short-lived and those sources of uncertainty dissipate, term premiums may revert back to lower levels, and financial conditions may ease some. Because it takes time for financial conditions to propagate to the real economy, temporary episodes of tightening, no matter how pronounced, matter a lot less than episodes of sustained tightening.5\n\nIn sum, going beyond observable Treasury yields is crucial to disentangling the message that the Treasury market is sending about the outlook for the U.S. economy. The unobserved components of those headline yields give us critical insight into the nature of changes in market expectations. These insights not only inform policymakers, but also are an important aspect of how monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy. As I noted at the outset, these channels and signals are only useful to the extent they are derived from prices that accurately reflect the views of market participants. That emphasizes the critical role a well-functioning Treasury market plays, not just as a benchmark for other instruments and a store of liquidity, but as a tool for monitoring the health and evolution of the broader economy, as seen from the perspective of market participants. A substantial benefit of this conference is its contribution to safeguarding the efficacy of Treasury market price signals, ensuring the FOMC has as much accurate information as possible to determine the course of policy and fulfill its dual mandate.\n\nThat brings today\u2019s conference to a close. I hope those of you here in person can join us for a reception downstairs. Thank you.\n\nPresentation"

    "content": "Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak with you today at the 2023 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. I appreciate the opportunity to engage with so many thought leaders across the industry. This is a unique forum for the diverse set of Treasury market investors to engage with the official sector and academics.\n\nIn my remarks today, I would like to discuss the important role of one subset of that diverse investor base: the foreign investor. I will explain how the key properties of Treasury securities, specifically their liquidity and safety, attract foreign official and private investors alike, and how this relates to the role of the U.S. dollar as a primary international reserve and investment currency. I\u2019ll then conclude by reviewing the Federal Reserve\u2019s repo facility for the foreign official sector and how it supports Treasury market functioning.\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nForeign Holdings of U.S. Treasury Securities\n\nAccording to Treasury International Capital (TIC) data, foreign investors hold about $8 trillion of Treasury securities, which is about 30 percent of the market\u2014a large share. This high degree of foreign interest reflects the liquidity, reliability, and insurance value of Treasuries in a diversified portfolio.\n\nForeign Treasury holdings are split nearly equally between the official sector\u2014mostly central banks and sovereign wealth funds\u2014and the private sector, which includes institutions such as banks, insurers, hedge funds, and pension funds.\n\nSo, why are these various foreign investors drawn to U.S. Treasury securities?\n\nThis diverse set of foreign institutions are attracted to Treasuries for an equally diverse set of reasons.\n\nFor one, the liquidity of the Treasury market is critical for reserve managers and is highly valued by all investors that seek to maintain a diverse securities portfolio. Many reserve managers have liquidity as the primary objective for their foreign reserves to ensure ready access to funds.\n\nTrading conditions in the Treasury market have been front of mind this past year as high levels of market volatility have resulted in intermediaries adjusting how they provide liquidity. Even so, it is important to recognize that this adjustment appears largely commensurate with the increased level of market volatility and without interruption to market functioning. Investors have been able to transfer risk effectively across both on- and off-the-run securities.\n\nIn addition to trading liquidity, Treasuries offer safety since they are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, with recourse to the independent U.S. legal system. For reserve managers, maintaining a high degree of safety is essential for ensuring foreign reserves are reliably available to meet liquidity needs.\n\nLastly, U.S. Treasuries provide a diversification benefit and insurance value to investors that pays out in an uncertain world. The future is ultimately unknowable, and time and again we are reminded that allocating to safe and liquid assets can protect portfolios from the unexpected.\n\nTrends in the Foreign Allocation to U.S. Treasury Securities\n\nThe liquidity and safety provided by Treasuries to investor portfolio is real. To this, I want to highlight that during recent periods of high market volatility, foreign investors as a group actually increased their allocations to U.S. Treasuries.\n\nFor example, we can see that the foreign private sector has increased its share of U.S. Treasury holdings for the last three years after controlling for market valuations. This high degree of interest is occurring despite FX hedging costs eroding most of the yield gain earned by buying Treasuries. We think that this is a testament to the fundamental value of Treasuries within a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nWhile the share of U.S. Treasuries held by the foreign official sector has declined slightly in recent years, this change appears to largely reflect idiosyncratic factors\u2014with some reserve managers decreasing and others increasing their holdings as global FX reserve levels have plateaued.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Relevant Backstop Tools\n\nThe Federal Reserve plays a key role in promoting financial stability and supporting the smooth global use of the dollar. To this end, the Fed maintains a repurchase facility for foreign and international monetary authorities, also known as the FIMA Repo Facility, in part to support a well-functioning Treasury market. These foreign account holders can temporarily exchange Treasury securities for dollars to meet potential liquidity needs through repo transactions with the Fed rather than relying solely on the market. \n\nDespite limited and sporadic usage, there is evidence that the facility demonstrates its capacity to effectively serve as a timely liquidity backstop and minimizes the need for asset sales to address dollar liquidity needs.2 This facility also expands the reach of the Federal Reserve\u2019s provision of U.S. dollar liquidity overseas beyond its network of dollar liquidity swap lines.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs I wrap up, I want to emphasize that the liquidity and safety of the Treasury market is what makes it unique within the investment world, and the strong presence of the foreign investor is a testament to those qualities. The large-scale participation of foreign private and official investors helps make the market resilient across many states of the world.\n\nThank you very much."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nThis is the ninth year that our joint member agencies have come together for this conference. It\u2019s been a wonderful five-way partnership. But the honorific of \u201cgreatest crossover of all time\u201d must be awarded to the theme and corresponding title of my remarks today.\n\nFor those who know of my proclivity to lace my speeches with music references, no, I am not referring to the crossover of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Instead, I\u2019m referring\u2014of course\u2014to the epic 29th episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, titled \u201cElementary, Dear Data,\u201d in which 221B Baker Street meets Enterprise-D in a brilliant Sherlock Holmes-style mystery. It\u2019s a perennial fan favorite for Trekkies and Sherlockians alike. But the reason I mention it today is that I\u2019d like to speak about how data\u2014transactions-based, transparent, and well documented\u2014is elementary to our collective understanding and decision-making at the Federal Reserve and beyond.\n\nBefore I get in any deeper, and rest assured I will, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nData Dashboard\n\nSherlock Holmes stressed the importance of \u201cdata, data, data.\u201d I, too, have been often quoted emphasizing the need to be \u201cdata dependent.\u201d1 In Sherlock\u2019s world, data means fingerprints, footprints, handwriting, and ciphers. In our world, data means economic indicators like gross domestic product, the Consumer Price Index, and the unemployment rate. These numbers make up the dashboard of what\u2019s happening in the economy.\n\nThese are numbers we can trust. Government agencies in the U.S. and abroad put an enormous amount of effort into developing the methodology, implementation, and design of these official statistics. While no specific data series is without its limitations, we have an excellent understanding of how these numbers come together and behave over time.\n\nFinancial markets have their own data dashboards too. Equity indexes, bond yields, and the value of the dollar are just a few aspects of understanding what\u2019s going on in markets.\n\nAnd policymakers like me aren\u2019t the only ones who are data dependent. Businesses, households, journalists, and so many others rely on data to support their understanding of the world around them.\n\nCapital Mistake\n\nTo be clear, having access to an abundance of data is a wonderful problem to have. Think about the plethora of data you can pull from a terminal and the endless ways to use it. Many of us have spent more hours than we\u2019d like to admit analyzing, plotting, and running regressions on data. And while we assume that most data are \u201cgood,\u201d there are, unfortunately, \u201cbad\u201d data, too. The very same terminal that gives you access to numbers that are supported by millions of transactions could also give you access to numbers that have not seen a transaction in quite some time, if ever. And it can be very hard\u2014too hard, in fact\u2014to spot the difference.\n\nThis is dangerous. I will echo the warning of our detective friend Sherlock Holmes: \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\u201d I\u2019ll go a step further and say that it is a capital mistake to theorize before one fully understands the origins of the data one has downloaded.\n\nLIBOR No More (But Still Important)\n\nOf course, the prime example of a capital mistake of this nature is LIBOR. Which, by the way, officially ended 139 days ago, not that I\u2019m still counting.2,3 Good riddance! OK, I had to slip in one music reference, but that\u2019s all.\n\nThe lesson of LIBOR is that there are times when what we think of as strong financial market data is only a mirage. LIBOR was one of the most widely used benchmarks in the world, underpinning hundreds of trillions of dollars\u2014that\u2019s trillions, with a \u201cT\u201d\u2014of financial instruments and contracts. We all know how that ended: LIBOR was inherently fragile and subject to manipulation. It is astonishing to think about the entire global financial system relying on the small set of transactions underlying LIBOR. In fact, during periods of financial market stress, LIBOR was based on no transactions, which is what opened the door to the fraud and bad behavior we now associate with it.\n\nLIBOR was a wake-up call. It led to the collective realization that things we think of as data may be merely smoke and mirrors. That\u2019s why the Federal Reserve, the Financial Stability Board, and many others invested heavily in the transition off of LIBOR and on to robust reference rates\u2014like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)\u2014that are accurate, carefully constructed, and transparent.\n\nGood Data\n\nAs we move forward in the post-LIBOR era, it\u2019s important that we continue to prioritize transparency and clarity in data, especially financial market data. This is particularly true in the age of AI, when the sources of data are harder to trace.\n\nSo, in addition to SOFR, what do \u201cgood data\u201d look like? How can we, as Captain Picard would say, \u201cMake it so\u201d?\n\nTo start, I\u2019d point to the Principles for Financial Benchmarks set forth by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which established a very stringent and specific model for reference rates. As an administrator and producer of reference rates, the New York Fed is committed to producing rates aligned with this gold standard.4\n\nOther examples include our regular market surveys.5,6 Questions for both the Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants are readily available on our website, as are the respondents and aggregated responses. Our Survey of Consumer Expectations follows a similarly demanding standard.7 If data are worth using, it\u2019s absolutely worth the effort to make sure people know what they are getting.\n\nWe have also increased transparency with Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) data. This initiative, which was started in 2017 to fill in the gaps on Treasury transaction data, is a significant component of a broader interagency effort to enhance understanding and transparency of the Treasury securities market. This has proven valuable as it has allowed the official sector to closely track developments in the cash Treasury market. Also currently underway are efforts to further increase the transparency of this data to the public, including plans to share transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.8,9\n\nCan\u2019t Make Bricks Without Clay\n\nEfforts like these are important because increased transparency and clarity around data leads to better decision-making. \u201cI can\u2019t make bricks without clay,\u201d Holmes said in The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. He understood that he first needed to compile the facts before building out the case. I argued a similar point in 2021 about LIBOR. If you try to build on a foundation that is not absolutely sound, you are risking trouble at some point in the future.10\n\nUnfortunately, this issue is frequently underappreciated by users of financial market data, as transparency and information on the sources of data are often scant.\n\nI will use my favorite example of inflation options to illustrate the broader point. During the recent bout of high inflation, some journalists, researchers, and analysts have trumpeted the \u201cmarket\u2019s estimate\u201d of the probability of certain high inflation outcomes using \u201cdata\u201d on the prices of inflation options. These so-called \u201cprices\u201d are easily downloaded from data platforms.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: based on our market contacts and public reporting of derivatives transactions, these aren\u2019t data at all. There have been no trades reported in the U.S. inflation options market since early 2021. The so-called data that people are citing are generated by a model, not from investors putting real money on the line as is frequently claimed. The situation is similar in Europe. Although there are scattered trades in euro area and UK inflation options, market contacts tell us that liquidity in that market is extraordinarily thin, and most of what little activity there is in this market is related to complex financial products and the risk of deflation and not hedging higher inflation.\n\nMore broadly, there is an opportunity for central banks, governments, and the private sector to come together to improve data transparency and accuracy. It takes a global village\u2014regulatory groups, industry groups, and global standard setters like IOSCO all have a role to play. We must use forums and collaborations like these to think through the opportunities to further develop data transparency and make improvements. One benefit of this conference is the partnerships it has fostered. Participants have accomplished so much by working together. And given our collective reliance on data, this must continue to be a priority moving forward.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that increasing transparency in some cases may face challenges. But that is not a reason to hinder our work in this space. Past experiences have proven that there are solutions that allow for greater transparency and confidence in data, without distorting or undermining the markets themselves.\n\nClosing\n\nI hope that you took two things away from my remarks today. The first is that you\u2019ve been inspired to go home and dust off your Star Trek DVDs. The second is to heed my call to action. We must continue to work together to increase data transparency and understanding, so that we can have greater market confidence and make better decisions.\n\nIt is elementary, my dear colleagues."

    "content": "Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to welcome you all, including those joining us through the livestream, to the 2023 U.S. Treasury Market Conference.\n\nOn behalf of the New York Fed and also our conference co-hosts\u2014the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014thank you all for participating in today\u2019s ninth annual conference.\n\nAs we\u2019ve often noted in this forum, the U.S. Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. It plays a critical role in the global economy, serving as the primary means of financing the U.S. federal government, a safe investment instrument and hedging vehicle for global investors, a risk-free benchmark for other financial instruments, and an important market for the Federal Reserve\u2019s implementation of monetary policy.\n\nOver the course of the day, we will be highlighting key developments, policy issues, and recent trends in the Treasury market, including considerations to encourage continuous improvements in this critical market\u2019s functioning and resilience.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Market Conference is an important annual forum for information sharing and dialogue between the official sector and the public, which is key to advancing our common understanding of the Treasury market. Today, as part of that dialogue, I would like to provide some brief remarks on the important role data transparency plays in supporting market functioning and resilience and thoughts on the future. Before I go any further, let me please remind you that the views I express here are my own, and not the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nIncreased transparency of Treasury market transaction data can help build knowledge around trading dynamics in the market and can improve investor confidence by allowing investors to analyze executed transactions instead of observing indicative quotes. The reporting of executed prices improves price discovery, which can reduce trading costs, improve liquidity, and potentially attract new entrants to the market.\n\nRecently, there have been some important steps toward increased data and transparency in the U.S. Treasury market. Earlier this year, FINRA began releasing daily aggregate data on Treasury market transactions, and at this conference last year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced plans to release TRACE transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons. However, even with this progress, gaps in transparency remain.\n\nIn March, the Treasury Markets Practices Group (TMPG), which is sponsored by the New York Fed, put out a white paper on data availability and transparency in the U.S. Treasury market that identified several gaps, particularly in the dealer-to-client cash market and the repo market. Looking at the gap in the cash market specifically, there appears to be opportunity for improvement in providing transparency around transaction-level data. \n\nI am looking forward to the increased transparency in on-the-run transaction data that I mentioned earlier. Looking further ahead, we should consider whether to take additional steps toward increased transaction transparency across the Treasury universe, especially for the less liquid segments of the Treasury market, such as the off-the-run market, where transparency is currently limited. The off-the-run market was the center of much of the dash-for-cash selling of Treasuries that occurred in March 2020, yet there is little data on off-the-run trading available to the public, making it challenging for academics and others to study such stress events in detail.\n\nAs we think about increasing transparency, it is important to exercise continued prudence, as there can be reasonable concerns about public transaction data, such as potential challenges that data may create around intermediating certain large trades. However, the success of public TRACE data transparency in the mortgage-backed securities and corporate bond markets provides guidance on how data can be shared without negatively impacting the market, such as displaying data with appropriate mitigation measures like time delays and capped trade sizes. In fact, academic research has generally found that the introduction of TRACE data transparency in these markets resulted in increased competition and reduced transaction costs. Additionally, we can learn more about how to structure public releases of data on less-liquid securities by studying the future release of on-the-run transaction data.\n\nGreater transparency into Treasury market activity can support the market\u2019s many important roles: as a risk-free benchmark for financial instruments; as a liquid investment and source of safe collateral; as a channel for the implementation of monetary policy; and, of course, as a cost-effective mechanism to help finance U.S. government activities.\n\nToday\u2019s conference provides an excellent opportunity to discuss topics like this one, and to bring together diverse perspectives from across the Treasury market and the official sector to consider the best path forward to promote Treasury market resilience. Thank you all for joining us today."

    "title": "The Dual Transformation of R&S and Monetary Policy",
    "date": "Nov 8, 2023",
    "speaker": "John C. Williams",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/wil231108",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nI\u2019m so pleased and honored to speak at this event commemorating the Research & Statistics Centennial. It\u2019s great to see so many friends, colleagues, and\u2014especially\u2014the many mentors who have had such an impact on this institution, and on me personally.\n\nResearch & Statistics\u2014affectionally known as R&S\u2014is almost as old as the Federal Reserve itself. It has certainly made its mark over the past 100 years\u2014and it continues to do so today. This is a testament to the leadership, high professional standards, and dedication to the Federal Reserve\u2019s mission ingrained in generations of R&S employees.\n\nOther speakers will discuss key aspects of the evolution and contributions of R&S over the past century. I will focus my remarks on the past 30 years. This corresponds to my own time as a researcher and policymaker\u2014as a member of R&S for the first seven years, then as a consumer of R&S products while at the San Francisco and New York Feds. In that time, the theory and practice of monetary policy have changed dramatically. Equally striking are the ways that transformation has influenced R&S research and analysis, and the ways the work of R&S has, in turn, influenced monetary policy.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt Was 30 Years Ago Today\u2026\n\nTo get a full appreciation of all that\u2019s happened in the past 30 years, I want to take you back to 1993. On a personal note, that was when I first interviewed for a job at the Board as a wet-behind-the-ears, 31-year-old grad student.\n\nFrom the perspective of monetary policy, 1993 seems like a world away. Back then, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet totaled about $400 billion. Now? It\u2019s nearly $8 trillion.\n\nSo many things we take for granted weren\u2019t even a \u201cthing\u201d back then. There were no FOMC statements . . . no press conferences . . . no dot plots . . . no longer-run forecasts in the SEP . . . no policy rules, optimal control, or flexible inflation targeting. In fact, there was no inflation target at all!\n\nThere was no QE or QT, no LSAPs . . . no forward guidance, Odyssean or Delphic . . . no ZLB, ELB, or shadow rates . . . no ample or abundant reserves . . . no IORB, ON RRP, or SOFR . . . no DSGE, EDO, or SIGMA . . . no FRB/US model . . . and, most shocking of all, no r-star!\n\nReading through this extensive list, I admit I have some sympathy for why central bankers occasionally pine for the simpler times of yesteryear (except for the r-star part, of course).\n\nThe Taylor Rule: Systematic Monetary Policy\n\nBut change was already afoot.\n\nI\u2019ll start with one development that, in important ways, connects them all: the birth of the famous \u201cTaylor rule,\u201d in 1993, from John Taylor\u2019s \u201cDiscretion versus Policy Rules in Practice.\u201d1\n\nInstead of approaching policy as a one-time tactical decision of whether rates should be higher, lower, or stay the same, the Taylor rule laid out an overall strategy for setting interest rates in any circumstances in terms of a reaction function. And it spawned research on a vast collection of monetary policy rules and optimal control policies.\n\nThe Taylor rule transformed monetary policy research. The areas of study broadened from short-term analysis and impulse response functions to key longer-term issues. This included the principles of effective policy strategies, trade-offs between policy goals, effects of the zero lower bound, and the roles of the so-called \u201cstar\u201d variables\u2014the inflation target, potential output, and yes, the neutral interest rate, or r-star\u2014that all appear in the policy rule.\n\nThe Taylor rule not only altered the way monetary policy is conceptualized, but also changed the way R&S and the other research divisions approached questions related to the economic outlook and monetary policy.\n\nAt the Fed, the wheels of change may sometimes turn slowly, but the Taylor rule helped get those wheels spinning.\n\nIt Takes a Model\n\nA second transformative change in the past 30 years was the development of macroeconomic models designed to study longer-run issues, such as monetary policy strategy. Earlier macroeconomic models were often used primarily for short-term forecasting and analysis. But these new models allowed researchers to explore longer-run questions related to policy strategies using empirically founded models.\n\nThe FRB/US model in R&S and FRB/Global in the International Finance division represented a watershed moment in the early 1990s, and they supplemented other models in use at the Board.2 Later, a generation of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models were added to the stable of tools for analysis, including the Estimated Dynamic Optimization model in R&S and the SIGMA model in International Finance.3\n\nTransparency\n\nSo far, I have highlighted developments underway in economics in the early 1990s. But there was also a transformation underway in monetary policymaking, with a goal of increasing transparency, especially in public communications about policy goals, strategies, and actions. In late 1989, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand rocked the central banking world by introducing inflation targeting. The Bank of Canada and the Bank of England soon followed suit. Two key tenets of inflation targeting are the communication of a clear, numerical description of the inflation goal and central bank accountability for achieving that goal.\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve did not formally adopt a version of inflation targeting until 2012, the FOMC took several steps to increase clarity and transparency in the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s. It started issuing policy statements after meetings . . . expedited the release of FOMC minutes . . . added longer-run FOMC projections . . . and increasingly used forward guidance about future policy actions.4\n\nThis trend toward transparency accelerated dramatically in 2012, with the formal announcement of a 2 percent longer-run inflation target and policy strategy and, for the first time, the publication of FOMC projections of the federal funds rate.5\n\nThree Case Studies: ZLB, Policy Frameworks, and R-star\n\nThis combination of the Taylor rule, a new generation of models, and growing transparency spurred R&S research into a range of monetary policy topics, and it identified new issues to explore. This was a two-way process, with new research contributing to policymakers\u2019 thinking on issues, and policymakers\u2019 interest in greater transparency and inflation targeting influencing the questions researchers studied.\n\nThere are numerous examples from the past 30 years, each with important contributions from R&S economists, many who are in this room. But, given the constraints of time, I will focus on three that stand out for me.\n\nThe first is the zero lower bound, or ZLB. For a long time, the ZLB was viewed as more of a historical curiosity than a relevant issue for U.S. monetary policy. But in the early 1990s, Jeff Fuhrer, building on work done while in R&S, and Brian Madigan, from the Monetary Affairs division, analyzed the effects of the ZLB on nominal interest rates for different policy rules and inflation targets.6 This was a groundbreaking paper at that time. It made the simple, yet powerful insight that if you follow a policy rule like the Taylor rule, and a big enough negative shock comes along, the nominal interest rate will be constrained at the lower bound, with negative effects on the economy and inflation. My work with David Reifschneider on the ZLB in the late 1990s, which we presented to the FOMC in January 2002, developed these insights further.7\n\nIn the subsequent 20 years, numerous contributions from R&S researchers and others have added to our understanding of the consequences of the ZLB, and of alternative tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance.\n\nMy second example is the analysis of alternative policy rules and approaches in describing the set of choices and outcomes policymakers face, including analysis of the trade-offs between policy objectives.8 Alternative scenarios based on different policy strategies regularly appear in the Tealbook prepared by Board staff for the FOMC. This line of research is also exemplified by the set of papers and analysis that contributed to the FOMC Policy Framework review, announced in 2018 and completed in 2020, with important contributions by R&S economists.9\n\nMy third and final example is, of course, r-star. R-star sits right at the center of policy rules, macro models, the ZLB, and longer-run strategy. In remarks at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in May, I recounted how Thomas and I started working together on the estimation of r-star in 2000, spurred by questions from policymakers and senior leaders at the Board.10 But work in R&S began even earlier, with Antulio Bomfim estimating r-star using the MPS model, the predecessor of FRB/US.11 And it continues to be a relevant and timely topic of R&S research and policy analysis to this day.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nA critical component of any strategy is a focus on the future, and that is true with monetary policy.\n\nThirty years ago, R&S was very much about the here and now. The staff forecasts in the Greenbook usually extended only through the end of the next year. And medium-term five-year-ahead forecasts were reported only twice a year. Policy analysis was generally short-term and rather mechanical: What would happen if the FOMC increased the funds rate by, for example, 100 points for the next year?\n\nThe world has changed. The analytical tools we have at our disposal have changed. And R&S researchers have not only kept up with those changes, but, in many cases, have also been the first to recognize them and contribute to our understanding of their implications, often well in advance of academic economists. My three examples illustrate this, but there are many more to draw from.\n\nRecently, macroeconomic models used at central banks like the Fed have been blamed for missing the rapid and sustained rise in inflation that began in 2021. But models don\u2019t make staff forecasts or policy decisions. That\u2019s not their purpose. The purpose of models\u2014whether simple heuristics or multicountry models with hundreds of equations\u2014is to help organize, quantify, and communicate our understanding of the how the economy works. Any shortcomings in the models reflect shortfalls in our collective understanding, rather than the cause of our misunderstanding. And it is the job of researchers to learn from experience as they revise existing models and build new ones.\n\nIn that regard, the models and analysis created and refined by generations of R&S researchers have done exactly that. In so doing, they have added immensely to the understanding of issues critical to the Federal Reserve\u2019s mission.\n\nI will finish where I started. In looking back over the past 30 years, it\u2019s remarkable how dramatically the theory and practice of monetary policy and the work of R&S have jointly evolved. The Fed of 1993 seems far distant from that of today. I wonder if, 30 years from now, they\u2014by which I mean the AI robots running things\u2014will look back at our current understanding of monetary policy and economics with amusement. And I imagine they will wonder how we managed without all the new things that are about to be discovered."

    "title": "The FX Global Code: Progress Made and The Path Ahead",
    "date": "Oct 17, 2023",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/nor231017",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to speak with you today at FX Markets USA. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and engage with so many thought leaders across the foreign exchange (FX) industry.\n\nThis year marks half a century since the advent of flexible exchange rates. Over that time, the FX market has evolved considerably. FX traders of the 1970s would hardly recognize the market landscape today, as trading practices have become more complex, market participants have become more diverse, and electronification has transformed the way the market functions.\n\nFrom my vantage point as a central banker, the FX Global Code is one of the most significant advancements for the FX market in recent years. As you know, the Code is a set of global principles of good practice designed to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale FX market for all participants.\n\nMy remarks will focus on how the FX Global Code contributes to a more efficient, fairer, and more transparent FX market, as well as ongoing work between central banks and the industry to ensure the Code remains fit for purpose as the market evolves. I\u2019ll then conclude by highlighting key issues that bear watching.\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nDevelopment of the Code\n\nSupporting a well-functioning and efficient FX market has been a long-standing priority at the New York Fed. In 1978, the New York Fed established the Foreign Exchange Committee, an industry group we sponsor that is dedicated to developing best practices in the FX market.2\n\nNearly a decade ago, central banks called upon the industry to strengthen the integrity of the FX market, which is largely self-regulated.3 To this end, under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Markets Committee, the FX Working Group was convened to help facilitate the establishment of global best practices, which culminated in the publication of the FX Global Code in 2017.4 At that same time, the Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC) was launched to bring together central banks and industry representatives to promote good practice in the marketplace and to keep the Code fit for purpose.5\n\nThe FX market plays a pivotal role in facilitating the flow of capital in support of international trade and investment. Because the FX market is a public good, its integrity is critical to maintaining the public\u2019s trust in the financial system. To promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent FX market, the Code lays out 55 principles of good practice. For those principles to remain relevant to current market practices, active engagement with a diverse range of market participants is essential. And since Code adherence is voluntary, the public and private sectors must work together closely to encourage widespread take-up. Many financial institutions and other market participants have adopted the Code\u2019s principles as part of their internal processes and procedures. This ensures that the Code becomes embedded in the marketplace and has an enduring impact on trading practices.\n\nMilestones in Code Adoption\n\nIn the six years since it was established, the Code has expanded its reach across the FX industry. Over 1,000 market participants from around the world have now signed on to the Code. Whereas the initial adopters were bank dealers, platforms, and technology providers, we have seen greater adoption by the asset management community more recently. Among the top 15 U.S. asset management firms by size, 11 firms, representing about $36 trillion of assets under management, now adhere to the Code. While there is still more work to do to encourage even broader adherence in the market, we believe this represents significant progress.\n\nThe Code is clearly having a meaningful impact on trading practices. Many trading venues have reduced the maximum length of their \u201clast look window,\u201d a significant number of large bank dealers have announced an end to additional hold times, and several electronic trading platforms now offer trading venues from which non-Code-compliant liquidity providers are excluded. These achievements demonstrate that the Code's principles-based approach can have a meaningful impact on the behavior of market participants.\n\nThe Code\u2019s influence is set to increase further as we expand engagement with the industry on Code adoption and awareness. For example, the Chartered Financial Analyst program will reference the Code in its Level 1 reading materials, and a GFXC working group has been engaging with rating agencies to explore the possibility of recognizing the Code within their Environmental, Social, and Governance criteria. Developments like these are helping to increase the Code\u2019s visibility and promote a broader appreciation of its benefits.\n\nAs the Code\u2019s influence continues to grow, the GFXC has made strides to ensure that all parts of the FX industry have a voice in shaping the Code\u2019s development. We recognize that every market participant, regardless of its size and complexity, has an interest in contributing to a fair and effective market. While the Code is intended for all FX market participants, the relevance of the principles can differ, and it can be challenging to identify which parts of the Code are most applicable to specific business lines. To address this, the GFXC recently introduced the FX Code Proportionality Self-Assessment Tool.6 Through a series of questions, the tool can help market participants identify which of the Code\u2019s 55 principles are most relevant to them. This should simplify the adherence process, particularly for participants with a smaller, less complex profile in the FX market.\n\nThe Code Embarks on a New Chapter\n\nWhile the last several years have brought major achievements, more work is necessary to ensure the Code remains relevant and effective for the market as a whole. The GFXC continues to engage with the industry to ensure that the Code is a living document that evolves in step with changes in the market. To this end, the GFXC leads a regular review and update of the Code.\n\nThe most recent Code review in 2021 included enhancements to existing principles and guidance papers that provide clarity on some specific practices. The GFXC also developed Disclosure Cover Sheets to provide greater transparency to market participants so they can better understand how their counterparties implement the Code\u2019s principles. These cover sheets have provided greater clarity and visibility into a firm\u2019s approach to practices such as \u201clast look\u201d and pre-hedging, which in turn help liquidity consumers make more informed decisions about which counterparties to trade with and how the trade should be executed. The Disclosures Cover Sheets can also be used to inform discussions with counterparties to help market participants better understand their approach to implementing best practices. While there is still more to be done to provide greater clarity around Code practices, this work represents an important initial step.\n\nWith the next review about to begin in early 2024, the GFXC is seeking to expand industry engagement further to ensure the Code reflects the diversity of FX market participants, represents different types of institutions, and remains fit for purpose. As such, the GFXC distributed a survey, which closes tomorrow, seeking feedback on the Code\u2019s effectiveness, the impact of the previous review, and priority issues in this upcoming review period. The survey provides an important opportunity for market participants to make their voices heard and continue to shape the Code in a way that reflects diverse viewpoints.\n\nThe Path Ahead\n\nLooking ahead, an important GFXC priority is FX settlement risk. Given the size of the FX market, the implications of one party failing to deliver to another can be significant and systemic. To better address this risk, the Continuous Linked Settlement Group\u2014known as CLS\u2014was established just over 20 years ago by the private sector in cooperation with central banks.7 As you know, CLS is now active in 18 major currencies, has more than 35,000 indirect participants, and settles more than $6.5 trillion in payments each day on average. However, because many FX transactions are not settled through CLS or do not involve alternative settlement risk mitigation measures\u2014such as netting and \u201con us\u201d settlement\u2014there is still a substantial share of payments that are not covered.\n\nThe GFXC sought to address these issues in its last Code review by strengthening principles for managing FX settlement risk and gathering industry input to help identify ways to better monitor or reduce principal risk. The GFXC also determined that more frequent collection of FX settlement data through semi-annual surveys distributed by regional FX committees can shed light on industry progress in reducing these exposures. To this end, to ensure that supervisory or policy decisions are made on the basis of sound data, the GFXC launched a working group led by the Bank of England to enhance the current FX settlement data collection template.\n\nFX settlement risk is particularly topical now as U.S. securities are set to move to T+1 settlement, which I see will be discussed in depth later this morning.8 While this regulatory change is aimed at securities, it has important implications for the FX market. The shortened settlement window means that market participants will need to more closely coordinate the timing of settlement for securities and associated FX trades. This transition will require significant preparation in the FX market given time zone differences, mismatched operating hours, and the diversity of existing settlement and confirmation processes, many of which rely on manual procedures.\n\nAs we prepare for a world where the time window for U.S. security settlement is halved, FX market participants will need to carefully analyze their operational and liquidity management practices to avoid disrupting market functioning. Stakeholders may also need to make substantial improvements to their existing operational systems and reconfigure FX settlement processes. An additional consideration is how T+1 will affect the values and volumes that currently settle through payment-versus-payment arrangements.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and other central banks have a long-standing interest in reducing FX settlement risk by encouraging the use of payment-versus-payment mechanisms to settle FX transactions, such as those provided by CLS. While CLS can support this change and settle FX trades on a T+1 and to some extent a same-day basis, there could be an increase in bilateral settlement outside of CLS and a reintroduction of settlement risk if market participants are unable to adapt internal processes to meet the condensed deadlines set by nostros that support settlement in CLS. As leaders in the FX industry, it is imperative that you make sure your firms are prepared to manage this industry change well in advance of the May 28, 2024 compliance date. While this regulatory change is still seven months away, I strongly encourage you to begin reviewing and updating your operations and settlement processes now to avoid potential difficulties later.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the evolution of the FX market in the 50 years since the advent of flexible exchange rates has been truly astounding. Given the importance of the FX market to the global economy, the official sector will continue to work with the industry to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent market that benefits all participants as well as the broader public. Much of this work will occur through the evolution of the FX Global Code.\n\nAt the same time, the job of expanding the Code\u2019s reach is not done. I expect our discussions and deliberations during the upcoming review to be illuminating and productive, as it is an important opportunity for market participants to make their voices heard and continue to shape the Code. I hope you will all join us as we bring the FX Global Code into its next chapter.\n\nThank you for your time and continued active engagement."

    "speaker": "Roberto Perli",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/per231010",
    "content": "Thank you for the introduction and thank you to NABE for the invitation to speak today.1 As Manager of the Federal Reserve\u2019s System Open Market Account, I am excited to share some perspectives from the New York Fed\u2019s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at this unique moment.  The Desk plays a central role in implementing monetary policy.  Looking at just the past few years, in 2020, the Desk was instrumental in carrying out the Federal Reserve\u2019s response to the pandemic.  More recently, it has played a key role in implementing the sizable increase in the federal funds rate and the reduction in the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities holdings directed by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nIn my remarks today, I want to draw some lessons on monetary policy implementation from recent experience and discuss my perspective on money markets and reserve conditions going forward.\n\nBefore going further, I would like to mention the typical disclaimer that these remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Ample Reserves Framework\n\nI will start off by briefly reviewing our current operating framework.  In January 2019, the FOMC communicated its intention to maintain an ample supply of reserves.2  When reserves are ample, interest rate control is achieved primarily through administered rates rather than active management of the supply of reserves.  This approach is typically described as a \u201cfloor system.\u201d3  In their discussion of implementation frameworks, policymakers noted that maintaining an ample reserves operating framework provides for good control of the policy rate under a variety of conditions as well as good transmission to other money market rates and broader financial markets.4  A floor system is an alternative to the \u201cscarce reserves\u201d system used before the global financial crisis, which involved controlling the policy rate through the active management of reserves.  Maintaining a scarce reserves operating framework was seen as having some notable disadvantages, particularly considering the likely much larger levels and variability in reserve demand and supply since the crisis.5\n\nObviously, the supply of reserves since the global financial crisis greatly increased due to the necessity of easing policy by conducting asset purchases when the target range was at the effective lower bound.  Two important structural changes in reserves markets since the crisis supported the decision to maintain an ample reserves operating framework instead of the prior framework.\n\nFirst, whereas reserve demand by banks prior to 2008 was primarily driven by reserve requirements, since that time a more diverse and variable set of factors\u2014including regulatory and supervisory considerations, statutory changes, and shifts in intraday liquidity management strategies\u2014have taken on a more prominent role.6  That has increased the baseline level of reserves demanded by banks and has rendered shifts in that demand harder to forecast on a day-to-day basis.7 Maintaining an ample supply of reserves is a simple and efficient way of accommodating that variability.  Ample reserves have the added advantage of more straightforwardly accommodating large shifts in non-reserve liabilities, such as the Treasury General Account, for example.\n\nThe second important structural change has been the expansion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet after 2008, which also made it less likely that individual depository institutions found themselves short of their target holdings of reserves on any given day.  As a result, trading in the federal funds market has become much more subdued.  In recent years, activity has been driven largely by overnight borrowing patterns among a narrow set of banks.  Lending is provided almost exclusively by the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which by statute do not earn interest on their deposits with the Federal Reserve.8 The borrowers are instead predominantly branches of foreign banking organizations (FBOs), which are not eligible for federal deposit insurance and thus do not owe insurance premiums.  Further, FBOs often view federal funds as an attractive source of liquidity for regulatory requirements.  These incentives allow FBOs to monetize the spread between the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and the interest rate on reserve balances, or IORB, to the extent that the former is lower than the latter. \n\nDespite the decline in fed funds trading volumes, there is still a strong link between the EFFR\u2014the targeted rate for monetary policy implementation\u2014and other money market rates; other mechanisms such as repurchase agreements (repo) and FHLB advances have emerged to facilitate the redistribution of liquidity across the system as needed.\n\nIn this environment, rate control is achieved via two administered rates that work together to maintain the EFFR within the target range indicated by the FOMC.  The IORB sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate their lending and borrowing opportunities.  The interest rate on the overnight reverse repo facility (ON RRP) provides a soft floor for overnight money market rates for a broader set of market participants.  It supports control of the federal funds rate, particularly when the supply of reserves is abundant, and the availability of alternative investments is relatively limited.  Currently, the IORB is set 10 basis points below the top of the target range, while the ON RRP rate is set five basis points above the bottom of the target range.9\n\nWhen reserves are abundant, as is currently the case, overnight rates may fall somewhat below IORB.  That so-called leakage reflects limits on how many reserves banks may want to borrow, even when overnight unsecured rates are below IORB.  Under those circumstances, the ON RRP offering rate has a direct influence on the distribution of rates in the federal funds market and provides a strong floor.  For instance, when market interest rates are above the ON RRP rate, money market funds (MMFs) are incentivized to pull funds from the ON RRP facility to lend in private markets, which pressures all front-end market rates lower.  Conversely, when rates are below the ON RRP rate, MMFs are incentivized to reduce their lending in private markets in favor of the facility, pressuring market rates higher.10  We can say that, while both IORB and the ON RRP work together to steer the rates at which money market participants are willing to lend federal funds overnight, the IORB has a greater influence over the median rate while the ON RRP rate has a greater influence over the left tail of the effective fed funds rate distribution.11\n\nSo, it is clear that both the IORB and the ON RRP rate play important and complementary roles in maintaining rate control.  Usage of the ON RRP facility has been very large for a time, but that should not be surprising.  In fact, the facility worked as expected, responding strongly to changes in private market conditions.  When market rates were below the ON RRP rate, take-up at the facility was elevated.  As the supply of alternative investments increased and money market rates moved up, even marginally, ON RRP usage has diminished notably, as we have seen recently.  Over time, as these dynamics continue, we should see ON RRP usage decline even more, possibly to low levels, and, everything else equal, the liquidity previously absorbed by the ON RRP should be released into the banking system in the form of reserves.\n\nAt the same time, the runoff of the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities holdings continues to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet; at some point, reserves will gradually transition from abundant, where they are today, to ample.  In an abundant reserves regime, reserves are so plentiful that market prices are largely unresponsive to changes in supply\u2014in other words, the system is operating in the flat portion of the demand curve, as shown in Panel 1.  In a regime in which reserves are ample, instead, banks in the aggregate will need to more actively manage a smaller quantity of reserves.  As that occurs, money market rates will drift somewhat higher\u2014that is, the system would be operating in the \u201cgently\u201d upward-sloping portion of the demand curve.12  Under those circumstances, usage of the ON RRP facility should be very small, and the IORB alone will play a direct role in anchoring the federal funds rate and other money market rates.\n\nWhat Can Recent Events Tell Us?\n\nRecently, our implementation framework has confronted a number of stress tests and performed quite well.  The past three years have seen a once-in-a-century pandemic, inflationary pressures necessitating a rapid increase in policy rates, significant demand for precautionary liquidity from some banks, investor uncertainty ahead of the recent suspension of the federal debt limit, and a subsequent rapid increase in short-term government debt.  Despite all this, the Federal Reserve has maintained strong rate control, even though the size and composition of its balance sheet has varied a lot (Panels 2 and 3).  Indeed, not only has the EFFR remained well within the target range since the start of the pandemic and subsequent events, but its volatility relative to administered rates has been historically low (Panel 4).\n\nI would like to say a few words about two recent episodes in particular.\n\nFirst, this past spring some banks reported significant deposit outflows which, in turn, reduced the reserve holdings and overall liquidity position of the affected institutions.  These outgoing funds were primarily transferred to larger banks at first and eventually migrated to money market funds.  Most of the affected banks turned to private markets, particularly advances from the FHLB system, to replace outflowing deposit funding.  Many used the same instruments to source precautionary liquidity as well.  In total, private markets supplied around $250 billion to domestic commercial banks over just a one-week period, a significant portion of which appeared to be provided by the FHLB system (Panel 5).13 FHLBs funded that credit expansion primarily by issuing short-term debt, including discount notes, at a modest premium to the ON RRP rate.\n\nOver those critical days, private funding markets were able to achieve significant redistribution of liquidity while continuing to function smoothly.  Rate control remained flawless throughout this episode.  Moreover, the ON RRP worked as intended, with usage declining in response to higher private market rates, even as total money market fund assets increased due to bank deposit outflows.  MMFs were responsive to relatively small price incentives, reallocating their activity away from the ON RRP and toward FHLB debt, thereby channeling much needed liquidity back into the banking system at a reasonable cost relative to other wholesale alternatives.  At the peak of the stress period, roughly half of that liquidity came out of the ON RRP (Panel 6).\n\nSecond, consider the recent debt limit episode and its aftermath.  Ahead of the suspension of the debt limit in early June, there was notable volatility in short-dated Treasury bill yields as certain cash investors shied away from some bills perceived to be at risk of payment delays.  After the debt limit was suspended, the Treasury issued new bills at a very fast pace to rebuild the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance (Panel 7).  Since June 3, the TGA has increased by over $600 billion.  Once again, money market fund reallocations out of the ON RRP were important in allowing markets to accommodate the rapid increase in Treasury debt. Money funds continued to be responsive to small price incentives, purchasing Treasury bills trading at only a modest premium to other market rates (Panel 8).  Rate control remained flawless throughout this episode as well.\n\nThese two examples show that our monetary policy implementation framework operates as intended even at times of stress, with ON RRP and IORB rates anchoring money market rates.  It also shows that price incentives for nonbank intermediaries facilitate efficient movement between different Federal Reserve liabilities.  These characteristics have helped us maintain strong rate control despite clear and significant variation in reserve demand and other forms of liquidity.  That is a critical feature of any monetary policy implementation framework designed to operate in an uncertain and dynamic market environment.  Our system works well.\n\nFrom Abundant Liquidity to a Future State\n\nI\u2019d now like to turn in more detail to the topic of balance sheet runoff and our monitoring of reserve conditions.\n\nIn May 2022, policymakers noted their desire to ensure a smooth transition from abundant to ample reserves.14 Importantly, that transition entails slowing and ultimately stopping balance sheet runoff somewhat above the level believed to be consistent with ample reserves.  Since the start of runoff in June 2022, SOMA securities holdings have declined by over $1.0 trillion, with the reduction in Federal Reserve assets partly offset by a rise in lending after the March bank stress, as shown in Panel 9. On net, the overall balance sheet has shrunk by around $950 billion.  Notably, on the liabilities side of the Fed balance sheet, this has been concentrated in non-reserve liabilities, with reserve balances experiencing only a modest decline. \n\nConsistent with the Committee\u2019s objectives, the implementation of balance sheet runoff has been proceeding smoothly.  We have seen no significant disruptions to financial or funding markets.  The principles and plans for runoff were based in part on lessons from the previous experience of 2017-19.  In particular, the use of passive redemptions subject to caps (Panels 10 and 11) enables a smooth and predictable process.\n\nAt some yet unknown point in the future, reserves will approach a level beyond which the FOMC would prefer to not allow further declines.  We are cognizant of the challenges that transition can present, and the experience of September 2019 exemplifies them well.  At that time, a confluence of factors contributed to a scarcity of reserves that put considerable pressure on short-term interest rates.  That episode has been the subject of extensive discussion and analysis which I will not review here.15  But, although the current situation is different in several ways, it is worth reflecting on the policy implementation lessons that can be drawn from that experience.\n\nFirst, as noted earlier, demand for reserves is not static.  Indeed, it can be highly variable and difficult to observe in real time, and even more difficult to forecast. \n\nSecond, demand for reserves is not only time-varying but also non-linear.  That means that under some circumstances, small changes in the quantity of reserves can generate a large change in federal funds rates relative to administered rates.\n\nThese two considerations argue strongly in favor of a floor system and are also the reason why the FOMC has indicated its intention to slow and stop balance sheet runoff when reserve balances are somewhat above the ample region.  We know that the transition from abundant to ample will occur at some point, but we don\u2019t know when.  For now, that moment does not seem to be on the horizon.\n\nThere is a third consideration that is important to keep in mind and that should mitigate the associated uncertainty.  In July 2021, the FOMC established the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) for primary dealers and eligible banks to act as a backstop in money markets and support the effective implementation and transmission of monetary policy.16 The SRF underscores the FOMC\u2019s commitment to the smooth functioning of money markets and is available to provide reserves should there be a sudden and unexpected shortage.17\n\nAnd of course, the Desk also has other tools to provide reserves, such as standard open market operations.  These were used effectively in the fall of 2019, when key money market rates came under considerable pressures\u2014it\u2019s worth noting that, thanks to those tools, the EFFR was outside the target range for only one day during that stressful episode.\n\nBoth the introduction of additional tools like the SRF and the Desk\u2019s demonstrated ability to use its tools to quickly relieve stress episodes support market participants\u2019 confidence in the ability and willingness of the Federal Reserve to respond as conditions warrant, thereby promoting the smooth transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.\n\nI will turn now to the last point I want to make today.  As I mentioned, the FOMC has communicated its intention to slow and stop balance sheet runoff before reserve supply clearly transitions from abundant to ample.  What information can we rely on to tell us when that point is approaching? \n\nHow Will We Know?\n\nOf course, elements of this question are difficult to answer, and we are well aware of the significant uncertainty involved.  A key issue is that the reserve demand curve, as illustrated by the historical observations in Panel 12, may have changed over recent years, and maybe even recently following the spring bank stress episode.  The current point of transition between abundant and ample reserves is uncertain.  Consequently, early warning signals will be important.\n\nWhile reserves currently are clearly abundant, the Desk will continue to carefully monitor market conditions.  We have complementary information sources at our disposal that should act as warning signs of when reserves are approaching a point at which banks start actively competing for them (Panel 13).  These include quantitative readings on money market conditions (that is, the realized slope of the demand curve for reserves) as well as Fed balance sheet usage, survey-based information on reserve demand from the Senior Financial Officer Survey, and ongoing market intelligence-gathering from the Desk\u2019s many contacts. \n\nFrom my perspective, the pricing and composition of money market activity will offer particularly important signals.\n\nSome of the quantitative market indicators that the Desk will follow to inform an assessment of reserve conditions include:\n\nThis is certainly not an exhaustive list.  We will also rely on other broad types of qualitative information we can gather from markets, market participants, and other contacts.  However, we believe that these objective and quantitative indicators cover a broad range of possible sources and manifestations of demand for reserves.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhere does this leave us? \n\nFirst and foremost, all indications are that reserves today remain abundant.  We see no clear evidence of stress in either the pricing of overnight interest rates or the usage of backstop facilities. \n\nSecond, our operating framework has proven its capacity of redistributing liquidity as needed and at a relatively low cost.  This is clear from the ability of private markets to draw funds out of the ON RRP at just a modest premium over the offering rate for that facility. \n\nThird, we can maintain rate control and the smooth functioning of money markets under a wide range of conditions and through material stress.  Although activity in the federal funds market has not been particularly elevated throughout a couple of stress episodes this year, our implementation framework in conjunction with private markets has demonstrated an ability to redistribute reserves quickly to alleviate acute demand for precautionary liquidity in response to broader stress in the banking system. \n\nThis is all encouraging, but we remain cognizant of the risks and uncertainties ahead.  The FOMC intends to slow and then stop runoff when reserve balances will be somewhat above levels consistent with ample reserves.  The Committee will make that judgment based on careful analysis and market monitoring that incorporates price signals from money markets as well as extensive market outreach and intelligence.  Experience has also given us confidence in the efficacy of our tools should short-term stress arise. \n\nThe combination of a resilient and flexible operating framework and the constant vigilance of the extraordinarily talented and dedicated professionals on the Desk gives me confidence that balance sheet normalization can be accomplished without significant disruptions to short-term funding markets.\n\nThank you.\n\nPresentation"

    "speaker": "Michelle Neal",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/nea230921",
    "content": "Thank you to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association for inviting me to this event. It is an honor to join you today to discuss Treasury market resiliency.1 In my role as head of the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, ensuring resiliency in the Treasury market is a key priority. The New York Fed supports continued study and improvement in related areas such as advancing the resilience of market intermediation, improving data quality and availability, and evaluating expanded central clearing. In my remarks, I will talk about the significance of a strong Treasury market, the role of the Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) and the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG) in bolstering Treasury market resilience, and key current focus areas. As always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Role of the Treasury Market\n\nThe U.S. Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world and is critical to the functioning of both the domestic and global financial system. It is a key market where the U.S. Department of the Treasury finances the federal government and where monetary policy is implemented. Additionally, the Treasury market serves as a domestic benchmark for housing and corporate finance and as a global benchmark for a range of international markets. As of August 2023, there is a total of $25.5 trillion of Treasury securities outstanding, with year-to-date daily average volumes in the cash market of roughly $700 billion and an average of over $4 trillion outstanding in the Treasury repo market. In the three years since the onset of the pandemic, the Open Market Trading Desk in the New York Fed\u2019s Markets Group has executed $3.2 trillion in outright purchases in the Treasury market, and has seen roughly $1.2 trillion in average daily repo transactions and $5.1 trillion in rollovers at Treasury auctions in its work to implement monetary policy.\n\nThe Role of the IAWG and TMPG\n\nGiven the importance of the Treasury market, the New York Fed has a long-standing investment in working with industry and government partners to ensure the market\u2019s efficiency and integrity. The New York Fed contributes to the work of the IAWG, which is led by the Treasury Department with staff participation from the New York Fed, Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Initially formed in 1992 in the wake of the Salomon Brothers auction bidding scandal, the IAWG has tackled many key topics in the Treasury market over the years, ranging from auction design and the primary dealer system in the early 1990s to the current focus on ways to improve market resiliency.2 As part of our work with the IAWG, since 2015, the New York Fed has hosted an annual flagship conference on the U.S. Treasury market, co-sponsored by the other IAWG entities. That conference brings together market practitioners, academics, and members of the official sector to discuss emerging issues in the Treasury market and to advance initiatives to promote its robustness.\n\nIn addition to the IAWG, another important body that focuses on the Treasury market is the TMPG, which is a representative group of market participants committed to supporting the integrity and efficiency of the Treasury, agency debt, and agency MBS markets. Sponsored by the New York Fed, the TMPG includes members from a range of institutions, including securities dealers, banks, buy-side firms, and market utilities. Formed in 2007, this group\u2019s initial focus was a compilation of voluntary best practice recommendations designed to promote efficient market making, market liquidity, a robust control environment, recognition of obligations associated with managing large positions, and efficient market clearing.3 Like the IAWG, the TMPG\u2019s work has evolved over the years, and most recently has focused on clearing and settlement as well as data availability and transparency. Several events over the past decade have reinforced the need for ongoing collaboration by all market stakeholders to safeguard the Treasury market, including the \u201cflash rally\u201d in October 2014, stresses to repo markets in September 2019, and the \u201cdash for cash\u201d in March 2020 in the early stages of the COVID pandemic.\n\nKey Focus Areas to Enhance Treasury Market Resiliency\n\nIn its 2022 Staff Progress Report, the IAWG identified five workstreams for improving the resiliency of the Treasury market: 1) Improving resilience of market intermediation; 2) Improving data quality and availability; 3) Evaluating expanded central clearing; 4) Enhancing trading venue transparency and oversight; and 5) Examining the effects of leverage and fund liquidity risk management practices.4 In the rest of my remarks, I will focus on the first three workstreams, touching on the contributions of the IAWG, TMPG, and work the New York Fed is leading.\n\nImproving Resilience of Market Intermediation\n\nFirst, with regard to market intermediation, recent and ongoing research on market structure highlights how new methods of trading could increase Treasury market resiliency. The New York Fed has long been a trusted expert on Treasury market structure. One notable contribution to this body of research was our critical role in producing a 2015 Joint Staff Report on the \u201cflash rally\u201d that occurred in October 2014.5\n\nMore recently, in October 2022, staff from the New York Fed, Federal Reserve Board, and Treasury Department released a New York Fed Staff Report about all-to-all trading in the Treasury market.6 In theory, all-to-all trading\u2014whereby any market participant would be able to trade with any other market participant\u2014would effectively merge the now separate dealer-to-customer and dealer-to-dealer market segments. Such a trading model could improve liquidity and price transparency. The paper noted that an organic move to all-to-all trading could be more likely to occur in conjunction with increased central clearing and greater price transparency. The authors noted that the evolution of all-to-all would likely occur gradually and only if market participants found it valuable. Amidst this potential shift, active engagement by dealer intermediators would be required. Of course, shifts in trading conventions could occur through financial innovation. While fintech has fostered ongoing innovation in the broader market landscape over recent decades, the potential exists for new or existing Treasury market participants to introduce trading innovations that increase the adoption of all-to-all and expand the reach of such trading to less-liquid sections of the Treasury market.\n\nLooking ahead, the IAWG\u2019s market structure workgroup\u2014a subgroup that studies potential resiliency-improving aspects of Treasury market structure\u2014has turned its attention this year to a deeper investigation of the off-the-run market. In this work, IAWG staff are conducting empirical research to describe off-the-run trading as it occurs today, looking at both trading dynamics in the off-the-run market and the resulting liquidity, leveraging official sector Treasury TRACE data. This work will be a key complement to existing research and will support ongoing improvements in market functioning.\n\nImproving Data Quality and Availability\n\nSecond, regarding improving data quality and availability, I believe that both the official sector and the public should have access to high-quality data on the Treasury market, given the role of the Treasury market as a global benchmark. In its 2022 Staff Progress Report, the IAWG highlighted official sector proposals to enhance data collection, in support of the IAWG staff\u2019s principle of \u201ctransparency that fosters public confidence, fair trading and a liquid market.\u201d\n\nIn March 2023, the TMPG released a white paper on data availability and transparency in the Treasury market. The paper highlights the importance of data transparency, suggests principles for assessing transparency, and identifies current gaps in the market.7 It reiterates the importance of data transparency in supporting official sector market monitoring and surveillance as well as broader price discovery and market efficiency. In light of these principles, the paper highlights the relative strength of data availability and transparency in the futures markets and identifies gaps in the dealer-to-client cash market and the repo market. As I will now discuss, ongoing initiatives will drive progress toward increased data availability and transparency.\n\nThere have been helpful steps toward increased data and transparency in this market: the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has begun releasing aggregate TRACE transaction data daily, the Treasury Department has announced plans to release transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, and the OFR has conducted pilot data collection on non-centrally-cleared bilateral repo transactions and has proposed ongoing collection of this data. However, the gaps in data availability and transparency identified by the TMPG indicate the need for continued and concerted official sector action to drive progress. As an example, the OFR\u2019s bilateral repo pilot data collection showed that the uncleared bilateral repo market is an area where both the official sector and market participants have little visibility and where margining and settlement practices are bespoke and opaque. This is an area where further understanding is needed, and the TMPG is studying risk management in this market as one of its current priorities.\n\nEvaluating Expanded Central Clearing\n\nThe third workstream identified by the IAWG is the evaluation of expanded central clearing. From a regulatory standpoint, in September 2022, the SEC released a proposed rulemaking that would expand central clearing in the Treasury market.8 The release of any further proposed or final rules is an important watchpoint and is something that we are closely following.\n\nOver many years, the TMPG has studied the fragmented clearing and settlement framework for the cash and secured financing segments of the Treasury market. Most recently, a 2022 white paper summarized the fragmented nature of settlement and associated risks in repo and securities lending markets, following up on TMPG work related to the cash market.9,10 While noting that under normal market conditions, the credit, liquidity, and counterparty risks may be small, gaps in risk management may present themselves in times of market stress, testing risk management frameworks. As noted in the white paper, this could be an exceptionally acute issue for non-centrally-cleared bilateral trades, where opaque risk management practices may create uncertainty about the levels of exposure across market participants. This contrasts to centrally cleared repo, where the clearing and settlement process is transparent, thereby making it easier for market participants to evaluate and manage risks.\n\nMoving beyond the conceptual, a 2021 New York Fed Staff Report looked to quantify the potential impact of central clearing by considering what would have happened if all outright trades in the first four months of 2020, as collected via TRACE, were centrally cleared.11 The authors found that if they assumed that all trades, both interdealer and dealer-to-customer, are netted and settled via a centralized counterparty, gross settlement obligations would fall dramatically, with an outsized impact in times of market stress, when the decline would have been near 70 percent.12 The authors also found that central clearing would have led to a notable decline in settlement fails. It is possible that a move to greater central clearing could increase intermediation overall, particularly during stressful periods.\n\nBuilding on these conclusions, a recent New York Fed Staff Report shows a significant loss in U.S. Treasury market functionality results when intensive use of dealer balance sheets is needed to intermediate bond markets, as in March 2020.13 Although yield volatility explains most of the variation in Treasury market liquidity over time, when dealer balance sheet utilization reaches sufficiently high levels, liquidity is much worse than predicted by yield volatility alone. This aligns with prior research and suggests that increased central clearing could have a positive impact on market liquidity. It indicates that, as more trades are centrally cleared, strains related to spikes in settlement fails could be avoided or reduced, easing a constraint on dealer intermediation capacity.\n\nWhile this workstream is independent of the other IAWG workstreams, achievements in relation to central clearing would likely impact other areas of work. As I noted earlier, increased central clearing could impact the speed with which trading models evolve, as market participants are increasingly connected by central clearing. Increased central clearing could also lead organically to greater data availability and transparency. As noted in the TMPG white paper on data availability, data tends to be more reliable and accessible in markets that rely largely on a single exchange for trading, such as Treasury futures, compared to markets where trading occurs in a wider range of venues.\n\nConclusion"

    "content": "Eoduard, thank you for that very kind introduction. Before I start, I wanted to thank the Banque de France for hosting and Chairwoman Zilioli and the members of the committee for inviting me to participate in the conference this weekend. I feel very honored to be here and am looking forward to our discussion on recent challenges in the banking sector.\n\nToday I will share an attorney\u2019s perspective on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Bank Term Funding Program (or the BTFP), which helped stabilize the banking system following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (or SVB) and Signature Bank. I will also offer some observations based on those failures, and will assume familiarity with facts already in the public record. Specifically, I will propose three areas of improvement: (i) contingent liquidity preparedness, (ii) follow-up on supervisory findings, and (iii) the importance of effective challenge in corporate governance.\n\nThroughout, the views that I express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nBank Term Funding Program\n\nThe New York Fed, which is my client, did not supervise either SVB or Signature Bank. We actively monitored both situations, and were involved with Signature as a lender of last resort. When the Federal Reserve established the BTFP, the lawyers of the New York Fed played an important role in facilitating its rapid implementation. I was responsible for coordinating among my team of attorneys at the New York Fed and the Board of Governors to ensure that our actions complied with applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nOver the weekend of March 11 and 12, the Fed designed the BTFP to support the stability of the broader financial system by providing a source of financing for banks with Treasury, Agency and other eligible holdings whose market value had significantly diminished given interest rate increases. Market participants were very focused at the time on banks with large, unrealized losses in their holdings of these sorts of securities. The rapid deposit growth of both SVB and Signature in the wake of the pandemic resulted in these banks holding quite large Treasury and Agency positions relative to their overall balance sheet. Where a bank is holding securities on its books as \u201cheld to maturity\u201d, changes in market value do not affect book equity or regulatory capital.2 However, the unrealized losses may\u2014and in recent cases, did\u2014affect the ability of the bank to sell or pledge those securities to generate liquidity. Selling these securities, as we saw with SVB, creates a realized loss on the balance sheet. Borrowing against the securities would not have forced the bank to realize a loss, but the value of these securities as collateral would have been calculated using market value, not face value. Accordingly, these securities may not have generated as much liquidity as the bank needed, desired, or anticipated. BTFP was an innovative way to create an additional source of liquidity using these high-quality securities, calming market fears over the consequences of fire sales.3\n\nAlong with the goal of enabling financing up to the face value of these securities, the Fed concluded it would be helpful to the borrowers for the term of the loan to be set at one year. The thinking was that committed financing of these securities would significantly mitigate any concerns market participants had that a bank would need to realize losses on these securities. If a bank decided it did not want the financing for a full year, the BTFP loan could be repaid before maturity without penalty.\n\nHaving decided the facility should be set up to lend against the face value of the securities and for up to a year, the next question was, \u201cHow could the program be up and running by Monday morning?\u201d\n\nNot exactly a small ask.\n\nThere was not enough time to set up special purpose vehicles as the Fed had done for some of the pandemic programs. The only way to have the program up and running so quickly was to leverage our discount window facilities. However, our discount window authority\u2014Section 10B of the Federal Reserve Act\u2014does not authorize reserve banks to lend for a period greater than four months.4 In addition, under traditional discount window policies, loans are extended against collateral that is assigned a lendable value by the reserve bank based on a haircut applied to the asset\u2019s fair market value.5 Under the circumstances we faced, traditional discount window operations could not fully meet the acute needs of the banking sector.\n\nAs a result, we turned to Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which authorizes specialized lending in unusual and exigent circumstances.6 The BTFP extends the maximum term of lending from the Section 10B limit of four months up to a special limit of one year. Additionally, unlike traditional discount window operations, the BTFP authorizes banks to borrow against eligible holdings up to their par value rather than their market value less a haircut. By limiting eligible BTFP collateral to essentially Treasury and Agency securities, the BTFP was targeting issues arising from interest rate-driven mark-to-market losses. Allowing other forms of collateral would have potentially introduced questions about the credit or underwriting of the collateral, which would have unnecessarily complicated and increased the risks of the program. To reduce arbitrage opportunities, only securities owned by the pledging bank as of March 12 are eligible for BTFP loans.7\n\nBTFP loans are recourse to the borrowers, so the lending reserve bank is not limited to just looking to the BTFP collateral for repayment in the event of a default. Instead, the reserve bank would have a claim for repayment in full against the borrower. After applying BTFP collateral, the lending reserve bank may also recover against other assets, if any, pledged in connection with regular discount window arrangements or otherwise.8 If this additional collateral is inadequate and the borrower cannot otherwise repay the BTFP loan, the Treasury Department has agreed to reimburse the Federal Reserve for aggregate losses on BTFP loans up to $25 billion.9\n\nAs I previously mentioned, the U.S. banking sector stabilized thanks, in part, to the BTFP assuring markets that banks with underwater government securities portfolios can use those to generate liquidity on the basis of their par value. It helped avoid a fire sale. As of May 31, the total outstanding amount of advances under the Program was approximately $107 billion, while the collateral pledged to secure the loans was approximately $129 billion.10\n\nThree Lessons for Banks and Supervisors\n\nWhile I consider the BTFP to be a necessary and successful short-term response to the events in the U.S., there are different measures we should begin to incorporate over the longer term into the architecture of banking and supervision. I want to focus today on three, drawn from the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, and offer my views on a path forward.\n\nContingent liquidity preparedness\nThe first lesson is to prepare for contingencies\u2014especially given the speed and magnitude of recent bank runs. In past practice, small and midsize banks have often relied primarily upon a single contingency funding source. Under modern economic and technological conditions, reliance on a single source carries too great of a risk that borrowers will be unable to generate sufficient liquidity from their investment positions in a short window of time. Instead, modern banks of all sizes need multidimensional, regularly tested funding sources to ensure emergency access to credit. This is not just for the benefit of individual banks, but also for the stability of the financial system.\n\nI draw this lesson principally from the collapse of Signature Bank\u2014which, in my view, was too reliant on the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York as its main source of contingency funding. When Signature reached a critical point in its fight for survival, its personnel were unfamiliar with the operational processes and requirements to use the New York Fed\u2019s discount window. It had been five years since Signature last tested its discount window operations. Staff at Signature did not understand the discount window collateral eligibility and diligence standards. It had not worked through the diligence requirements necessary to pledge its commercial real estate loans. Signature was also unfamiliar with the process and time constraints to transfer pledged securities from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York to its pledge account at the New York Fed.\n\nWith Signature facing multiple friction points, my team at the New York Fed identified an ad hoc solution that enabled Signature to borrow late on Friday, March 10. Under Section 10B, discount window loans must be sufficiently secured.11 Normally, the Fed establishes and perfects its security interest in Fedwire-eligible securities, such as Treasuries, Agencies, and Agency MBS, by requiring the borrower to transfer them to the borrower\u2019s pledge account at the New York Fed. In this case, however, we worked with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and with Signature to enter subordination and pledge arrangements that provided the New York Fed with a perfected priority security interest without transferring the securities.12 This satisfied the Section 10B requirement.\n\nThough we tailored a solution under these circumstances, banks would be very unwise to assume the Fed will be able to provide special, individualized attention and creative solutions in the event of another liquidity crisis. Bank management must take ownership of their operational preparedness before a liquidity crisis occurs. At a minimum, banks should conduct tabletop exercises to identify gaps in their capabilities. Banks should refamiliarize themselves with the requirements to access the discount window. Most important, I urge banks to take the extra step of exercising these borrowing capabilities regularly to facilitate access to funds should the need arise.\n\nOn our end, the New York Fed has begun a constructive dialogue with small and midsize banking firms centered on emergency liquidity preparedness, including contingency fundraising and borrowing. New York Fed staff have been meeting with banks to explain discount window operations and the BTFP. We actively promote use of the discount window as it offers the most reliable source of liquidity in a crisis.\n\nUnfortunately, the discount window remains stigmatized in the banking community.13 I hope that, in light of recent events, banks will take advantage of this moment to establish a regular practice of using the discount window. It would redound to the benefit of banks and their customers if we overcome discount window stigma and prioritize sound risk management.\n\nFollow-up on supervisory findings\nThe second lesson from these events is that supervisory findings need to resonate with bank leadership\u2014the board and senior management in their respective roles.\n\nVice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr\u2019s report on the failure of SVB (the Barr Report) concluded, in essence, that internal governance and risk management failures at SVB contributed substantially to conditions that fomented the run on the bank.14 His report also faulted supervisors for not having done more to draw attention to those problems and compel their remediation.\n\nAs a threshold matter, I want to note that it is not at all clear that SVB would still be in business even if Fed examiners had acted sooner or more forcibly. Regulators and supervisors can minimize the impact and probability of bank failures, but they cannot prevent all banks from failing. The decisions of bank managers will ultimately play the most important role in determining the success or failure of a given bank.\n\nFrom what I can tell based on the public record, it appears that SVB management was, in a word, complacent. I find it fascinating that in his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, when asked why action was not taken with respect to a finding on interest rate risk, the former CEO of SVB downplayed a \u201cMatter Requiring Attention\u201d (or MRA) as the \u201clowest level\u201d of supervisory finding. The fact that an issue becomes a supervisory finding at all means it is important! Moreover, at the time of its failure, SVB had 31 outstanding findings\u2014that is, MRAs and \u201cMatters Requiring Immediate Attention\u201d (or MRIAs)\u2014on safety and soundness issues. This leads me to conclude that supervisory findings did not create a sufficient sense of urgency in SVB management.15 A key lesson from SVB\u2019s failure, then, is that management can become desensitized over time to the seriousness of findings\u2014especially where they are allowed to linger without consequences.\n\nFor supervisors, this is an opportunity to assess how we issue and monitor supervisory findings, and to embolden supervisors to employ extraordinary remedies when risk management deficiencies threaten a firm\u2019s safety and soundness. There is, understandably, a good deal of self-reflection on why supervisors with an understanding of the severity of these MRAs failed to follow-up more tenaciously. Looking ahead, perhaps supervisors should prescribe more exact timetables for addressing MRAs and MRIAs\u2014deadlines that are realistic, but firm. And, when we set those timelines, we could be clearer about the consequences if matters are not resolved on time. Finally, if findings linger, we need to actually impose the consequences we forecasted. The severity of those consequences\u2014which could include a ratings downgrade or enforcement action\u2014would depend on the nature of the finding and the reasons for delayed remediation. These are case-specific determinations, of course, best entrusted in the first instance to the judgment of experienced examiners and, ultimately, to the Board of Governors.\n\nI believe there is a complementary oversight role for bank boards. Directors need to understand how bank management addresses supervisory findings, and hold managers to account\u2014for example, through decisions about compensation and promotion. Directors might ask how the remediation of supervisory findings factors into variable compensation for those responsible for the finding\u2014ultimately, senior management. If the answer is, \u201cNot at all,\u201d perhaps it is time to reassess. More generally, directors might want to assess their institution\u2019s internal mechanisms for accountability to avoid the complacency that undermined SVB. And that leads me to my third and final point.\n\nEffective challenge in corporate governance\nThe recent failures of SVB and Signature should remind us about the importance of effective challenge in corporate governance.\n\nBoth SVB and Signature enjoyed long runs of growth and profits. I can\u2019t help but think that sustained success made it more difficult for their boards and senior management to recognize weaknesses. I don\u2019t know enough about the internal workings of those firms to be more specific than that, and I\u2019m not an organizational psychologist. But I\u2019ve been a lawyer long enough to know that one of the most valuable contributions a lawyer can make is asking the questions that others want to avoid. Lawyers add a lot of value to organizations as \u201cdevil\u2019s advocates\u201d\u2014not only instructing clients what\u2019s permissible, but challenging assumptions and questioning whether business decisions are wise.\n\nWithin SVB, for example, I wonder, who was asking the tough questions? Who was challenging decisions about the bank\u2019s balance sheet and interest rate risk\u2014in particular, its reliance on large, uninsured deposits and the ballooning of longer-duration investment securities as a percentage of its total assets\u2014and asking, candidly, can this hurt us? If so, how much? And how can we fix it?\n\nThis is, perhaps, where the lack of a chief risk officer translated into a real, negative impact on the bank. Though SVB had a risk function, it was headed in the absence of a chief risk officer by the chief executive officer. That does not strike me as an effective way to challenge the risks undertaken to promote growth, since growing a business is a chief executive\u2019s job. I question whether, lacking a leader, SVB\u2019s risk management team had a clear, credible voice capable of communicating critical feedback to the management team and, ultimately, to the board. The chief risk officer plays that role. Without that officer, perhaps no one was in a position to encourage the bank to slow down and focus on managing some important risks in the midst of its rapid growth.\n\nLooking ahead, the lesson from SVB is not to undervalue effective challenge and the individuals who provide it. This is also an observation raised repeatedly over the nine years of the New York Fed\u2019s culture initiative\u2014our effort to focus industry attention on group norms that affect individual behavior within financial institutions. I realize it can be inconvenient to hear critical feedback, and it is easy to discount effective challenge when everything seems to be going well. But that can be when professionals like risk officers, compliance officers, and lawyers are most valuable\u2014pointing out risks that are obscured by profit. Don\u2019t assume your organization can do without a chief risk officer\u2014someone with the stature to raise concerns about risk management at the highest levels of the organization.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn closing, it is clear that banks and supervisors can learn important lessons from the demise of SVB and Signature Bank. The Barr Report is evidence of the Fed\u2019s eagerness to learn and willingness to grow\u2014which makes me optimistic about our ability to deter or minimize similar problems in the future. I hope the industry follows suit, and that banks assess themselves against the examples of SVB and Signature Bank. I am also confident that, when problems arise in the future, the Fed will have gained valuable experience through the BTFP on how to minimize stability risks to the financial system.\n\nAgain, thank you very much for the opportunity to join you all today."

    "content": "Thank you, Trevor. And good morning, everyone. It is a special privilege to participate in this conference honoring my dear friend, colleague, and co-author, Thomas Laubach.\n\nMany of you knew Thomas personally, and all of you knew him through his work. He was a brilliant economist, trusted colleague, and an inspiring leader. We miss Thomas' dedication, good cheer, and sense of humor, and his impact on everyone he touched endures.\n\nOur collaboration started in the fall of 2000 with a shared interest in figuring out how to measure the elusive natural rate of interest, otherwise known as r-star. At the time, neither of us had any idea that our research on this topic would continue for 20 years.\n\nKathryn Holston and I are carrying on this work. It's one of the many ways we can honor Thomas and his memory. Because of the unprecedented, pandemic-related shocks to the economy, we paused our regular publication of r-star estimates in late 2020. This conference is the perfect venue to announce that we are resuming them. But first, I want to take some time to share r-star's origin story, which is how I came to know Thomas.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nQuestioning the Assumption\n\nThe idea of a natural rate of interest has been around ever since the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell wrote about it in 1898. Early on, it was recognized that it's not something that can be directly observed or measured. As the economist John H. Williams wrote in 1931:\n\nThe topic gained renewed relevance in 1993, following John Taylor's famous description of a monetary policy rule that incorporated an assumption of a natural rate of 2 percent.2 For policymakers, the natural questions\u2014pardon the pun\u2014were: Is 2 percent the right number? Does it change over time? And how would we know? Those were the very questions than then-Federal Reserve Governor Larry Meyer posed to Board staff back in 2000. And that's what brought Thomas and me together.\n\nA Meeting of Minds\n\nIn July of that year, I returned to the Board from a stint at the Council of Economic Advisors, shortly after Thomas joined the Board staff from the Kansas City Fed. We hit it off immediately. It just so happened that both of us had been thinking about the natural rate of interest. And since Governor Meyer had raised the subject, we moved quickly to develop an approach to answer his questions.\n\nAlthough we didn't know it then, we were following exactly the problem the other John Williams laid out in 1931.3 Simply put, Thomas had a hammer. And we found a new nail. The hammer was the Kalman filter, which is about inferring the behavior of an object from its effects on other objects. And the nail was r-star.\n\nA Fast Start\n\nOn December 14, 2000, after a few short months of working together, we wrote our ideas and results in a memo to the Board of Governors.4 The memo started with the bold declaration:\n\nAnd the Laubach-Williams (LW) model was born. Starting in May 2001, r-star estimates made their way into the staff Bluebook prepared for the FOMC.5\n\nLooking back, I am struck by how quickly these ideas came together. I must also acknowledge the unwavering support we received from senior leadership to bring this new research to policymakers.\n\nWithin a year of writing the memo, we put out the academic version of this work.6,7 The original paper included a section on time-varying r-star's implications for monetary policy. But the editor cut it, leaving it \"for future research.\"\n\nWhat's Past is Prologue\n\nFast forward a decade, and an entirely new question about r-star arose: Why had estimates of r-star fallen so low? It's a topic Thomas and I explored in our \"Redux\" paper.8 And in 2017, Kathryn, Thomas, and I expanded the set of economies for which we estimated r-star.9\n\nIndeed, before the pandemic, historically low estimates of r-star characterized advanced economies across the globe. This is illustrated by the Holston-Laubach-Williams (HLW) estimates of r-star for the United States and the Euro Area using data through 2019, shown in Figure 1. Both were around \u00bd percent before the onset of the pandemic, far lower than estimates from preceding decades.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nOne of the features of the LW and HLW models is that both are designed to be flexible and to \"let the data speak\" in measuring changes in the natural rate of interest. Even this flexibility, however, has its limits. And the economic turmoil brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic went far beyond what the models were originally designed for.\n\nIn particular, the pandemic violated two key assumptions about the nature of macroeconomic disturbances underlying the models.10 First, the Kalman filter statistical method that serves as the models' workhorse assumes random disturbances to the economy follow a normal, or bell-shaped, distribution. Relative to historical experience, COVID-19 represented an extremely rare tail event in terms of its effect on the economy. Second, the models assume that these disturbances are serially uncorrelated, which is at odds with the sequence of shutdowns and reopenings associated with COVID-19.\n\nThe highly unusual nature of the effects of COVID-19 is illustrated by the model auxiliary residuals for the output gap, shown for the United States and the Euro Area, in Figure 2. These residuals are related to the difference between the data and the model's prediction for the data. The dashed lines in the figure indicate two standard deviations. For the United States, these residuals are as large as 15 standard deviations, and for the Euro Area, they exceed 20 standard deviations in some periods. In a purely statistical sense, the probability of such an event occurring even once, much less twice, is infinitesimally small.\n\nAfter the onset of the pandemic, we suspended publication of r-star estimates due to this extreme economic volatility and the elevated uncertainty about how the pandemic would evolve.\n\nThe Relaunch\n\nI am pleased to report that starting today, we are relaunching regular publication of the LW and HLW estimates of r-star. The estimates, along with model documentation, are available on the New York Fed website and will be updated each quarter.11\n\nTo address the two violations of the original model assumptions caused by the pandemic, we made two modifications to the estimation of both models. I should note that this is described in detail in the paper, \"Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest After COVID-19,\" that was posted this morning on the New York Fed's r-star web page.\n\nFirst, we incorporated an additional persistent supply shock related to the effects of the pandemic that directly reduce the economy's potential. We measure this shock using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index for each economy.12 This index aggregates measures of government containment and shutdown policies. Because the index is no longer being produced, we assume that in each case, it declines smoothly to zero over 2023-24.\n\nSecond, we use a statistical procedure that accounts for outliers in the model's estimation. Specifically, from the second quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimate a time-varying process for the variance of the shocks hitting the economy. This procedure places a lower weight on periods when there are very large outliers.\n\nOur results show that outliers are particularly large in 2020, as seen in Figure 2. By comparison, the estimated magnitude of outliers is relatively modest in 2021 and 2022. Starting in 2023, we assume that the distribution of shocks is no longer affected by the pandemic.\n\nLetting the Data Speak\n\nEstimation of the modified model reveals three key findings. First, the modified estimation procedure yields results that are overall quite similar to those from the original model during the pre-pandemic period. Second, the current estimates of r-star are similar to those estimated directly before the pandemic. Third, the estimates of the natural level of output at the end of 2022 are much lower than predicted before the pandemic.\n\nThe current HLW estimates of r-star in the United States are shown in Figure 3. For comparison, the figure also shows estimates using a version of the model that is not adjusted to take into account COVID or outliers and holds the parameter values fixed at estimates using data through the end of 2019.\n\nThe two sets of estimates are very similar through 2019. They differ sharply during the acute period of the pandemic, however, when the estimates from the unmodified model exhibit large swings due to the presence of sizeable outliers. Interestingly, the two estimates are very close to each other at the end of the sample. That is, the modifications to the model do not interfere with \"letting the data speak.\"\n\nA Modest Imprint\n\nBased on the new r-star estimates for Canada, the Euro Area, and the United States, we see no signs of a significant reversal of the decline in r-star estimates evident in prior decades.13 In fact, in all three economies, the r-star estimates in 2022 are within two-tenths of a percentage point of the corresponding estimate in 2019.\n\nThe largest differences between model estimates pre- and post-pandemic relate to the level of each economy's potential output. Figure 4 compares the model's measure of the natural level of output based on estimates using data through the fourth quarter of 2019 (the blue line) to current estimates. At the end of 2022, the COVID-adjusted level of potential output (the black line) is 4.2 percent below the pre-pandemic projection for the fourth quarter of 2022, with nearly half of that shortfall explained by the COVID shock measure and the remainder a permanent change in the natural level of output (the gold line).\n\nIn summary, according to the model estimates, the main longer-term consequence from the pandemic period is a reduction in potential output, but the imprint on r-star appears to be relatively modest. Importantly, there is no evidence that the era of very low natural rates of interest has ended.\n\nThe Future of R-star?\n\nThese estimates indicate that r-star today is about where it was before the pandemic. But where is it headed in the future? Of course, this is impossible to know with any certainty.\n\nOne way to gauge how forecasters perceive the future of r-star is to use forecast data to estimate it. Figure 5 shows the HLW-based estimates of r-star in the U.S. through the end of 2024. It uses published data in the first quarter of 2023. The May 2023 Blue Chip forecasts for inflation, GDP, and interest rates are used as proxies for data from the second quarter of 2023 through the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe resulting estimate of r-star is about \u00bd percent in the first quarter of 2023, and subsequently falls to slightly below zero. Evidently, the value of r-star implied by private forecasts is, if anything, even lower than today's estimate. Time will tell whether this turns out to be the case.\n\nNo One Right Answer\n\nLet me conclude by sharing something I learned from Thomas and hold dear. It's actually hidden in the last line of the abstract from our first published paper. It says: \"Estimates of the natural rate of interest, however, are very imprecise and subject to real-time measurement error.\"14\n\nTo some, that may sound like a negative statement. But it's also what makes empirical research so exciting and challenging. There is no one right answer and no single way to view the world. Empirical research is a process of continuous learning and adaptation\u2014fueled by perseverance. People come up with different approaches, and we learn from all of them.\n\nSo, while we started with the problem of how to estimate r-star, it didn't end with that first Board memo. Rather, it opened the door to new questions, which led to further challenges and even more research. This is the legacy of Thomas Laubach, and it's what brings us all together today.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the second annual conference on the International Roles of the U.S. Dollar. I want to thank you all for participating today. It's great to see so many of you were able to make it in person as we host this conference in New York for the first time. Given the excellent discussion topics and speakers lined up, I have no doubt that we are in for an engaging and thoughtful discourse.  I would also like to thank the organizing committee\u2014Linda Goldberg, Patrick Douglass, and Robert Lerman from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Ricardo Correa and Juan Miguel Londono from the Federal Reserve Board International Finance Division\u2014for their diligent work putting this event together.  Before I begin, I want to note that my remarks today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe overarching theme of this conference is of critical importance, as the U.S. dollar plays a central role in foreign exchange (FX) markets and the international financial system more broadly. Indeed, the latest Bank of International Settlements triennial survey shows that the U.S. dollar remains the most widely used currency in FX transactions by a considerable margin. It is also the world's most widely used currency in official FX reserves, cross-border loans, international debt securities, SWIFT payments, and trade invoicing.\n\nThe ubiquity of the U.S. dollar in global transactions reflects several key factors, including the depth and liquidity of U.S. capital markets, the size of the U.S. economy, the dollar's convertibility, and an enduring confidence in our legal system and institutions.\n\nThis predominance of the dollar in international transactions has multiple benefits domestically and internationally. The widespread use of the dollar reduces transaction and borrowing costs for U.S. households, businesses, and the government. In addition, it helps reduce the cost of hedging for domestic households and businesses, since they do not face direct exposures to currency risks.\n\nThe dollar's international role also benefits the global economy. Dollar assets offer foreign investors stability in value and relative safety, as the dollar tends to appreciate during periods of market stress. It also provides access to the liquidity of U.S. financial markets, such as the U.S. Treasury market, which is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. \n\nThe Federal Reserve plays a key role in promoting financial stability and supporting the use of dollars internationally. Our strong commitment to our price stability mandate has contributed to confidence in the dollar as a store of value.\n\nWe have also supported dollar usage through our dollar liquidity facilities, which are managed here at the New York Fed.  First, the central bank liquidity swap lines, which we maintain with several major central banks, are designed to improve liquidity conditions in dollar funding markets in the United States and abroad by providing foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions during times of market stress.\n\nIn addition, the Foreign and the International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility allows FIMA account holders to temporarily exchange U.S. Treasury securities for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions.  As a backstop source of temporary dollar liquidity for FIMA account holders, the FIMA Repo Facility can help address pressures in the U.S. Treasury Market and global dollar funding markets that could otherwise affect U.S. financial market conditions. It also helps support the smooth functioning of dollar asset markets and broader financial markets more generally.\n\nBoth the swap lines and the FIMA Repo Facility enhance the standing of the dollar by giving holders of dollar assets and participants in dollar funding markets confidence that liquidity backstops are available in times of market strains. Indeed, during the period of banking stress this March, we increased the frequency of swap line 7-day maturity operations from weekly to daily.  This enhanced provision of liquidity provided an important backstop to global funding markets.  Usage of the swap lines in March were relatively low compared to prior periods of market stress over recent years, indicating little systemic stress in dollar funding markets.\n\nMoreover, the FIMA Repo Facility had its first sizeable draw for an extended period in March.  This activity demonstrates that FIMA accounts can quickly leverage their existing U.S. Treasury holdings to acquire dollar liquidity, minimizing the need for asset sales.\n\nThe critical role of both these liquidity facilities in global dollar funding markets will be discussed later this morning, during a panel moderated by our colleague Fabiola Ravazzolo. The engagement between dollar liquidity and dollar use in financial transactions and international portfolios will be discussed later today as well in a keynote by Professor Darrell Duffie, and a discussion moderated by Linda Goldberg.\n\nThe New York Fed has several other key responsibilities that tie directly to the importance of the dollar in the international monetary system. We facilitate the shipment of physical dollar cash across the globe given the international demand for hard currency. We manage the U.S.'s official portfolio of foreign currency assets on behalf of the System Open Market Account and the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund. We provide a range of services to foreign international monetary institutions, acting as a custodian of some of their reserves and engaging in transactions on their behalf as directed. We also conduct technical research and experimentation, including with tokenization and digital assets, at the New York Innovation Center. We look forward to publishing research results from Project Cedar and the Regulated Liability Network, two projects experimenting with new technologies related to cross border payments. Finally, as a member of the Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), we work closely with other U.S. agencies to improve the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market, the stability of which supports the continued use of the dollar as a reserve currency across the world.\n\nSumming up, the U.S. dollar continues to play multiple critical roles in the global economy, with significant benefits to households and businesses both domestically and abroad. But as the global financial system continues to evolve, there is frequent discussion of potential ways these roles can be challenged.  Recent years have been characterized by investor interest in other reserve currencies, less traditional alternatives, such as central bank digital currencies and other digital assets, and even commodities, such as gold.  With this in mind, the central role of the U.S. dollar should not be taken for granted.  For the dollar to maintain its status, it is important for U.S. elected officials and other policymakers to make decisions that instill confidence in our economy and institutions. \n\nThank you again for joining us over the next two days. We look forward to learning from your insights."

    "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction. As chair of the Economic Club of New York, I often have the honor of introducing speakers to our forums. It's a special privilege for me to speak to the Club today.\n\nI'm also pleased to be here during my favorite month of the year. The weather is warmer\u2026 Baseball season is well underway\u2026 And it's the month when people around the world celebrate \"Star Wars,\" one of the all-time great franchises. I am often asked whether I am fan of \"Star Trek\" or \"Star Wars,\" and my definitive answer is, \"yes.\"\n\nNow, I promise I won't spend my time talking about the weather or baseball. What I do want to talk about is inflation.\n\nInflation remains too high, and high inflation is hardest on those who can least afford to pay higher prices for food, shelter, and transportation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to bringing inflation down. As the Mandalorian would say, \"Price stability.\n\n\"This is the way.\"\n\nBefore I continue, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntrinsically Linked, One with the Force\n\nThe FOMC is mandated by Congress to promote maximum employment and price stability. The goals of our dual mandate are intrinsically linked. Specifically, price stability is essential for the economy to reach its full potential and to sustain maximum employment over the long term.\n\nSince the pandemic, imbalances between demand and supply have persisted throughout the economy, leading to high inflation and a tight labor market. Although we have seen some signs of a gradual cooling in the demand for labor\u2014as well as for some goods and commodities\u2014overall demand continues to exceed supply.\n\nI'll first discuss what this means for employment. At the national level, job growth has been robust, with monthly job gains averaging about 220,000 over the past three months. Other indicators show that labor demand is gradually slowing, yet remains very strong. For example, job openings have come down from their peak level in March of last year. Still, the ratio of job openings to unemployed far exceeds levels prevailing before the pandemic, when the labor market was very strong. Similarly, quit rates have been gradually declining, but are above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn addition, the unemployment rate is at a historically low level of 3.4 percent. And in April, the employment-to-population ratio for those between the ages of 25 and 54 reached the highest level since 2001.\n\nThe strength of the labor market is evident in parts of the Federal Reserve's Second District. Fairfield County in Connecticut has fully recovered from the pandemic. Northern New Jersey is above where it was in 2019. And New York City has also shown remarkable progress, with employment closing in on pre-Covid levels.1\n\nNationally, we are also seeing improvements on the supply side of the labor market. As you'll recall, when businesses reopened after the 2020 pandemic shutdowns, many faced a dire shortage of workers.\n\nSince then, we have seen a rebound in labor force participation, with the 25-to 54-year-old age group slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Although overall participation is below where it was before Covid, economists at the New York Fed have found that this shortfall is more than fully accounted for by the aging\u2014or what I prefer to call \"maturing\"\u2014of the workforce.2\n\nThis increase in labor force participation has helped alleviate some of the imbalance in the labor market. But with baby boomers increasingly reaching retirement age, population aging will continue to put downward pressure on participation in the medium term. Increases in the labor force from immigration, which has picked up from its pandemic lows, can partially offset this, but it is unlikely to fully undo the impact.\n\nThe Force Is a Balance\n\nAchieving balance on the inflation side of our mandate has been more challenging.\n\nLast June, inflation spiked to a 40-year high of 7 percent, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. Since then, inflation has moderated to 4.2 percent, in large part due to a decline in energy prices. That's much better than 7 percent, but still more than double our longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nThis inflation target is an important bedrock principle for the FOMC. It provides a \"North Star\" for policy decisions and helps improve the public's understanding of our goals and actions.3 It has also helped to keep various measures of longer-run inflation expectations remarkably well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent longer-run goal.4\n\nAlthough short- and medium-term inflation expectations rose during the pandemic, these measures have since come down. Indeed, based on the latest reading of the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations, three-year-ahead expectations have returned to a level nearly identical to its average between 2014 and 2020. Although one-year-ahead inflation expectations in the survey remain elevated, they have declined considerably from the peak level reached in June 2022.5\n\nTo understand why inflation remains too high, it's instructive to examine inflation developments in various sectors of our economy. So far, inflation has declined in many categories of commodities and goods, which tend to be more sensitive to interest rate increases.\n\nIn addition, supply chains, which were severely constrained after the pandemic's onset, have improved considerably. This is something I hear from business leaders from across the Federal Reserve's Second District. And the New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index has declined to a level that indicates supply chain pressures are now actually somewhat lower than normal.6\n\nAt the same time, the March price data indicate some moderation in overall rent inflation. And rents for new leases have been showing slower rates of increases, which should bring down shelter inflation in coming months. This is important because shelter inflation had been a significant driver of higher inflation over the past year.\n\nBut the most persistent area of inflation is in core services excluding housing, which has been running around 4-1/2 percent since last August . This is driven by a continued imbalance in overall supply and demand, and it will take the longest to bring down.\n\nBringing Back the Balance\n\nIn \"The Rise of Skywalker,\" Anakin urged Rey to \"bring back the balance.\" The FOMC has been taking strong actions to do just that.\n\nLast week, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5-1/4 percent, its tenth consecutive rate increase. In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC indicated that \"in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\"7\n\nIn addition, the FOMC indicated it will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, according to the framework announced a year ago.8\n\nThe FOMC also said that the \"Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy.\" I will be particularly focused on assessing the evolution of credit conditions and their effects on the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation.\n\nAlways in Motion Is the Future\n\nBecause of the lag between policy actions and their effects, it will take time for the FOMC's actions to restore balance to the economy and return inflation to our 2 percent target. I expect inflation to decline to around 3-1/4 percent this year, before returning to our longer-run goal of 2 percent over the next two years.\n\nAs tighter monetary policy continues to take effect, I expect real GDP to grow modestly this year, with growth then picking up somewhat next year.\n\nAnd I anticipate slow growth will continue to cool the labor market, with unemployment gradually rising to about 4 to 4-1/2 percent over the next year.\n\nKnowledge Lights Our Way\n\nI am confident we are on the path to restoring price stability. As always, I'll be monitoring the totality of the data and what it implies for the achievement of our goals.\n\nTo paraphrase the wise philosopher Yoda, \"A little more knowledge lights our way.\""

    "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction. Good evening, everyone. It's great to be here with the Money Marketeers.\n\nOne of the big issues facing the economy is inflation. Inflation is far too high, and high inflation is hardest on those who can least afford essentials like food, shelter, and transportation.\n\nSo today, I'm going to talk about the actions the Federal Reserve is taking to restore price stability. I'll also give my views on the economic outlook.\n\nBut before I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dual Mandate\n\nFor a group like the Money Marketeers, the economic and financial events of the past few months\u2014and even years\u2014have provided a lot to talk about. In fact, the high inflation we see today stems from imbalances between demand and supply that started with the pandemic.\n\nA more recent issue has been the stresses that emerged last month in parts of the banking system. Conditions in the banking sector have stabilized, and the banking system is sound and resilient. Nonetheless, these developments will likely lead to some tightening in credit conditions for households and businesses, which in turn will weigh on spending. It is still too early to gauge the magnitude and duration of these effects, and I will be closely monitoring the evolution of credit conditions and their potential effects on the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. These goals are intrinsically linked\u2014price stability is essential to sustaining maximum employment over the long term and for the economy to reach its full potential.\n\nRight now, while there are some indications of gradual cooling in the demand for labor, the labor market remains very tight. Job growth continues to be robust. Job openings far outnumber applicants. And at 3.5 percent, the unemployment rate is near 50-year lows.\n\nThat brings us to inflation. Inflation soared to a 40-year high of 7 percent last June, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. It has since moderated to 5 percent, and the most recent data indicate that this trend of slowing inflation is continuing. Still, inflation is well above the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nThis inflation target is an important bedrock principle for the FOMC. It provides a \"North Star\" for policy decisions and helps to improve the public's understanding of our goals and actions.1 We are committed to attaining\u2014and maintaining\u2014a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to achieve our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nIndeed, throughout this period of high inflation, one of the bright spots is that various measures of longer-run inflation expectations have remained remarkably well anchored and consistent with our 2 percent target.2\n\nImbalances Endure\n\nOur most important policy tool is the setting of the target range for the federal funds rate, which influences demand for goods and services by affecting borrowing costs.\n\nSo far, tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and central banks around the world is helping to bring a better balance between supply and demand. Inflation has declined in a number of sectors, particularly for many categories of commodities and goods.\n\nIn addition, the supply-chain bottlenecks that had constrained the supply of goods have largely dissipated. For example, the New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index has declined to a level that indicates supply pressures are now actually somewhat lower than normal. 3 I hear the same from business leaders from around the Federal Reserve's Second District, who confirm that supply chains have improved considerably.\n\nAt the same time, data on rents for new leases provide early signs of slowing inflation for shelter. This is important because shelter inflation had been a significant driver of higher inflation over the past year.\n\nHowever, despite the moderation of inflation, imbalances endure, with overall demand still exceeding supply in the economy. This is seen in the inflation rate for core services excluding housing, which has been running around 4-1/2 percent since last August.\n\nFOMC Actions\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the FOMC has taken decisive actions to curb demand, restore balance to the economy, and bring inflation down.\n\nLast month, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-3/4 to 5 percent, its ninth consecutive increase. In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC said it \"will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy.\"4\n\nThe Committee also said it \"anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.\" According to the median projections in the FOMC's March Summary of Economic Projections, the stance of monetary policy remains restrictive this year and next year.5\n\nIn addition, the FOMC said it will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, according to the framework announced last May.6\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nBecause of the lag between policy actions and their effects, it will take some time for the FOMC's actions to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target. With inflation expectations well anchored, I expect inflation to decline to around 3-1/4 percent this year, before moving to our longer-run goal over the next two years.\n\nTurning to GDP, the data flow for the first quarter indicates that the economy continues to expand at a solid pace. I expect real GDP to grow modestly this year as tighter monetary policy continues to take effect, with growth picking up somewhat next year.\n\nIn addition, we are beginning to see some signs of cooling in the labor market. I expect slow growth will likely lead to some softening, with unemployment gradually rising to about 4 to 4-1/2 percent over the next year.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, inflation is still too high, and we will use our monetary policy tools to restore price stability. I am confident that we will attain and maintain a sufficiently restrictive stance to bring inflation down to our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nAnd now, I look forward to our discussion."

    "content": "Thank you. It\u2019s great to be here at Housatonic Community College today. Fairfield County in Connecticut is part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Second District, which also encompasses New York State, Northern New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAn important, and enjoyable, aspect of my job is to meet with members of the community\u2014students, educators, and business and civic leaders\u2014from throughout the Second District, so I can hear firsthand about their experiences on issues like the economy, housing, and, of course, inflation.\n\nHigh inflation hurts everyone, but it\u2019s hardest on those who can least afford to pay more for groceries, rent, and gas. Persistently high inflation also undermines the ability of our economy to reach its full potential.\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to talk about inflation, which remains a top concern. I\u2019ll also give my views on the economic outlook and monetary policy.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2014what we call the \u201cFOMC\u201d\u2014or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Series of Events\n\nOver the past three years, our economy has endured a remarkable series of events that have added to economic uncertainty. First came the pandemic, which caused huge and prolonged imbalances between demand and supply that are still with us today. Then Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine fueled higher global energy and food prices.\n\nMore recently, stresses in parts of the banking system are likely to result in a tightening of credit conditions that will in turn reduce spending by businesses and households. The magnitude and duration of these effects, however, is still uncertain.\n\nThe FOMC is responsible for setting monetary policy. We are mandated by Congress to promote maximum employment and price stability. On the employment side, the U.S. labor market has been extremely resilient. Job growth has been strong, job vacancies are plentiful, and at 3.6 percent, the national unemployment rate is near half-century lows. I should also note that Connecticut\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to a low level of 4 percent.\n\nInflation is another story. The FOMC defines price stability as 2 percent inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.1 Our commitment to 2 percent inflation is an important bedrock principle, providing a \u201cNorth Star\u201d for policy decisions and helping to improve the public\u2019s understanding of our goals and actions.\n\nInflation reached a 40-year high of 7 percent this past June. While it has since moderated to 5 percent, it is still well above our longer-run goal. Without price stability, we cannot achieve maximum employment on a sustained basis. That is why it\u2019s so important for the FOMC to use its monetary policy tools to bring inflation down.\n\nThe Inflation Gears\n\nOur most important policy tool is the setting of the target range for the federal funds rate, which influences demand for goods and services by affecting borrowing costs.\n\nTo show how this is helping to reduce inflation, I\u2019ve been using an analogy of a mechanism, such as a watch, that is powered by gears.\n\nThe watch represents the economy, and its gears are different sectors. To keep time accurately, the gears need to turn at the right speed. But the ones that drive inflation have been spinning at different rates.\n\nThe first inflation gear relates to globally traded commodities, such as lumber, steel, and grains. Thanks in part to tighter monetary policy here and abroad, demand has eased, and commodity prices have moderated.\n\nThe second gear, which represents goods such as cars, appliances, and furniture, is turning nearer where it needs to be, as higher interest rates have helped curb demand. Supply-chain bottlenecks that plagued the economy earlier in the pandemic have receded, which is also helping bring goods price inflation down.2\n\nThe gear that\u2019s having the most trouble turning represents non-energy services excluding housing. It\u2019s influenced by the balance of overall supply and demand for these services and labor, and it will likely take the longest to bring inflation in this sector down fully.\n\nWell-Anchored Expectations\n\nOne aspect of inflation that\u2019s important for achieving and sustaining price stability is the anchoring of inflation expectations. Various measures of longer-run inflation expectations have remained well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent goal.3\n\nInflation expectations for the next few years, which increased as inflation was rising, have come down in recent months. The New York Fed\u2019s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that three-year-ahead inflation expectations are back to where they were in early 2021, and one-year-ahead expectations have decreased sharply.4\n\nFOMC Actions\n\nWith all this in mind, last week, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-3/4 to 5 percent, its ninth consecutive increase. The FOMC said it \u201cwill closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy.\u201d It also said it \u201canticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.\u201d 5,6\n\nI will be particularly focused on assessing the evolution of credit conditions and their effects on the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWhile the FOMC has taken decisive steps to bring inflation down, lags exist between policy actions and their effects. It will take time for all of our inflation gears to move at a pace that takes us to our 2 percent target. I expect inflation to decline to around 3-1/4 percent this year, before moving closer to our longer-run goal in the next two years.\n\nI expect real GDP to grow modestly this year and for growth to pick up somewhat next year. Slower growth and tighter monetary policy will likely lead to some softening in the labor market. So, I anticipate unemployment gradually rising to about 4-1/2 percent over the next year.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe economic outlook is uncertain, and our policy decisions will be driven by the data and the achievement of our maximum employment and price stability mandates. I am confident that our actions will bring inflation down to our 2 percent longer-run goal."

    "content": "Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to take part in the Hudson Valley Regional Meeting of the New York Bankers Association. It is a pleasure to join you today. Let me begin by noting that vibrant and diverse banks of all sizes that serve communities across the country are critical to our nation\u2019s economy.\n\nIn our time together, I\u2019ll discuss the present environment and emphasize the importance of contingency planning. I\u2019ll also provide an overview of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which is a temporary lending facility recently created by the Federal Reserve Board with the Treasury Department\u2019s approval. I want to note that my remarks today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said just yesterday, our banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity.1 The Federal Reserve, working with the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, took decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system. These actions demonstrated that we are committed to ensuring that all deposits are safe. We will continue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our tools for any size institution, as needed, to keep the system safe and sound.\n\nA changing economic environment poses new risks to banks, and we remain attuned to those risks from a supervisory perspective. The management of interest rate risk is one example.2 The composition of deposits is another example. Key risk management considerations will vary with the types of deposits. A bank needs to consider the funding implications of any type of deposit and planning for funding contingencies is paramount.\n\nLet me spend a few moments on the Bank Term Funding Program. To support American businesses and households, the Federal Reserve established the temporary program to help banks meet the needs of all their depositors.3 The BTFP allows banks to borrow against safe Treasury and agency securities at par for up to one year. It is an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution\u2019s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress.\n\nEligible borrowers that have discount window borrowing documentation in place and are eligible for primary credit can borrow from the BTFP immediately. Advances can be requested under the BTFP until at least March 11, 2024, when the program is currently scheduled to end. As outlined in a set of Frequently Asked Questions available on the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s website, the Federal Reserve will disclose information concerning the facility, including amounts borrowed by individual institutions, one year after the program ends.4 Depository institutions should contact Reserve Bank staff in their District\u2014for many of you in this room, that would be my colleagues at the New York Fed\u2014to determine whether any additional documentation is necessary or to initiate an advance.\n\nIn closing, I\u2019d like to note that use of the BTFP will not raise bank supervisory concerns. We believe banks\u2019 use of the program can be part of sound liquidity risk management. Together with banks' internal liquidity and stable deposits, other external sources, and discount window lending, the BTFP provides ample liquidity for the banking system as a whole. And again, I\u2019d reiterate the recent comments from Vice Chair Barr that our banking system is strong and resilient.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to our discussion."

Specifically, the initiative aims to reduce incidences of misconduct; promote healthier cultures within firms and across the industry; and to increase public trust in the financial services sector.\n\nToday I'll discuss how we undertake our work; highlight a few key themes and learnings that emerged through our efforts last year; and then provide a preview of what's ahead for the Culture initiative.\n\nFirst, through our continued events and engagement with multi-disciplinary experts, firms, and the public, we explore culture-related topics such as trust, psychological safety, and speaking up, as well as consider the intersection of financial services culture with developments like hybrid work or the rapid growth of technology and digitization. In recent years, we have produced a series of webinars and podcasts \u2013 which are available online \u2013 and this year on June 20th, we will host our first in-person culture conference since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nNext, on the education and research front, we lead the Education and Industry Forum \u2013 the EIF. Our goal is to integrate ethics and commercial decision-making in the education of the next generation of the financial services workforce. To do that, the EIF develops case studies that highlight some of the ethical dilemmas that early career bankers may encounter in the workplace. The case studies and accompanying teaching guides, which are freely available, help instructors facilitate classroom discussions about how to practically address ethical issues when they arise. This year, the EIF will publish a new round of case studies that will cover \u2013 among other issues - communications with regulators, internal reporting systems, risk management, internal investigations, and cyber security. \n\nFinally, we convene the Supervisors Roundtable for Governance Effectiveness, where we, along with regulatory agencies from around the world, discuss and share governance, culture, and behavior supervisory practices. Our collaboration with these agencies has yielded a suite of resources for supervisors to use in work focused on governance, culture, and behavior at firms.\n\nNow I'd like to share with you some of the most compelling learnings from our work last year.\n\nFirst, the past year has reinforced for us that through shared interactions, it is culture that determines how decisions get made and business gets done. As one of our webinar speakers stated, \"decisions are socially produced.\"1 As individuals, we may not have access to all the data necessary to make the best decision. We need the knowledge, views, and queries of others \u2013 especially when dealing with the complex problems and issues posed by financial services. An effective culture, implied another of our speakers, is one which will \"facilitate the necessary sharing of knowledge in a way that no individual could discover by themselves.\"2 Of course, one important pre-condition for such sharing is a work environment of psychological safety.\n\nAnother recurring theme that emerged last year was the importance of experimentation in bringing about culture change. Several of our speakers urged less focus on all-encompassing theories and more on practice, trial and error, and the gathering of data and experience within firms. It's experimental application that really matters, both for finding out how people in the organization are truly behaving and to motivate them to change.\n\nTo gain the most from such experimentation, we also learned that it is useful to begin by identifying individuals or teams that are willing to apply new values and skills to work challenges or opportunities that mean the most to them. \"Go deep before you go wide,\"3 advised one speaker. To be effective, experts advise targeting those who are open to change and give them reason to support it based on data drawn from their own concrete experience. Especially if these people are the hubs of social networks, they will be able to then help establish new norms and influence others.\n\nNext, in choosing this cohort of influencers, consider that middle management is where culture change largely succeeds or fails. Middle managers have a special opportunity to be role models for change, given that they are more visible and consequential to junior staff than top management. Middle managers are also well-positioned to navigate a \"transitional ground\" between the parts of an organization resistant to change, and others that are advocating for it. I suggest we retire the phrase \"the frozen middle\" and recognize the power of middle managers as part of the solution to better culture change outcomes.\n\nAn additional lesson that was prevalent last year \u2013 relevant to effective knowledge sharing, experimentation, and the role of middle management in culture change \u2013 is the need for a learning culture. Mistakes are inevitable. They are part of being human and any organizational endeavor. Unfortunately, the reaction to mistakes by leaders can sometimes lead to finger-pointing. A better approach would be to acknowledge them, understand their context, learn from them, and not be overly punitive in response. Resolving mistakes in this way creates a more open environment, avoids incident-specific solutions, and can help an organization move from a culture of blame to one of accountability and collective learning.\n\nDrawing on these lessons of the past year, we've selected the following three topics to drive our work in 2023:\n\nFirst, we will continue to explore how the growing digital transformation of financial services business models affects culture across the industry. For example, we will consider how new entrants to financial services might influence decision-making within firms. We are also interested in learning from previous periods of transformation and their aftermaths, which often included manias for new products and services.\n\nNext, we will look at the impact of financial and non-financial incentives on employee behavior. While compensation is the most obvious tool that can be used to motivate employees, it is not the only one \u2013 nor is it necessarily the most effective in the long term. We will delve into a wide range of individual motivations such as status and adherence to community norms, and how they inform individual and group behaviors.\n\nFinally, we will delve deeper into learning cultures. Experimentation and a willingness to learn from mistakes is generally not a cultural norm in financial services. Yet there are industries that embrace it, even in the context of highly regulated and high-stakes environments (for example, medicine, pharma, aviation, and others). These industries aim to address errors and remain uncompromising on safety, while remaining open to the learning opportunities that mistakes and experimentation afford. We will look at what constitutes a learning culture and what these other industries can teach us about building cultures that balance innovation, safety, and learning.\n\nThrough our exploration of these three themes, we aim to draw out timely insights to help equip leaders as they work to build healthy cultures in the post-pandemic era. While much has changed in the world over the last few years, our work continues to reinforce the notion that poor behaviors and norms cannot simply be wished or ordered away. Instead, they need to be replaced with more desirable norms that account for complex motivations and influences. Through ongoing dialogue and partnership, fostered at forums like this, I'm determined that together we will continue to make strides towards healthier and more trustworthy cultures in the financial services industry.\n\nThank you."

    "title": "Lessons from the Market Functioning Purchases of Early 2020: A Practitioner\u2019s Perspective",
    "date": "Mar 3, 2023",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/wue230303",
    "content": "I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important topic with such accomplished panelists.1 I would like to share some of what the New York Fed's Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) learned implementing market functioning purchases in the Treasury and agency MBS markets in the spring of 2020. Before going further, I would like to note that these remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me start with a brief background on the conditions that led the Federal Reserve to launch market functioning purchases. The emergence of the pandemic in early 2020 brought about an extreme demand for liquidity\u2014a \"dash for cash\"\u2014due to uncertainty in the economic outlook. U.S. Treasury securities are held by many investors for their money-like properties, and the Treasury market was the recipient of massive waves of selling as these investors sought to convert their holdings to cash. The sales quickly surpassed end-user purchase demand and the capacity of intermediaries to warehouse the imbalance, leading to the breakdown of two-way markets and strains that spilled over into other related markets, including agency MBS. In response, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took extraordinary actions to address the market dysfunction, first by directing the Desk to increase the daily offerings of overnight repurchase agreement transactions (repos) and offering new term repos. The temporary financing provided by these operations, while helpful, could not meet the permanent liquidity needs of all investors, and soon after the Desk was directed to purchase Treasury and agency MBS securities to support market functioning at what became an unprecedented pace.2\n\nToday I will share three main lessons I took away from our experience implementing market functioning purchases in March 2020: first, the importance of being able to adapt purchases to changing conditions; second, the use of the purchases themselves to assess market pricing; and third, the importance of continuing to pursue regulatory and market structure initiatives that support resilience in government debt markets.\n\nReal-time Radar: Adapting Purchases to Changing Indicators of Market Functioning\n\nIn periods of sharp market dysfunction, policymakers inevitably find themselves making rapid decisions with imperfect information. The first lesson I take from our experience is that adapting market functioning purchases in response to real-time indicators of market functioning, including market intelligence from participants and the signals from the operational results themselves, is essential to their effectiveness.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, a variety of market indicators suggested markets were becoming increasingly illiquid. We observed selling pressure escalate dramatically through analysis of Treasury transaction data (TRACE), other flow data, and reports from market participants. Primary dealers, whose holdings were already at elevated levels, had limited capacity to intermediate the massive flows and were faced with increased risk as volatility spiked. Bid-ask spreads widened dramatically, particularly for deep off-the-run notes and bonds.3 However, our visibility into some of these important trends was limited, in part due to the lack of real-time and comprehensive cash market data on positions and leverage, in areas like the uncleared bilateral repo market.4\n\nGiven these factors, the Desk initially targeted a broad range of Treasury securities for purchase, announcing plans to spread all of our previously planned $80 billion in monthly purchases across the curve. Although the purchases were scheduled to occur over the course of mid-March to mid-April, it soon became apparent that the demand for immediate \"cash liquidity\" necessitated a more rapid response, and we subsequently front-loaded $37 billion of those purchases to one day (Friday the 13th). Those operations received over $100 billion in offers from primary dealers, indicating an enormous and immediate demand for liquidity. On March 15, the FOMC announced large-scale purchases of both Treasury securities and agency MBS, followed by an announcement on March 23 where the purchase amounts were expanded to \"the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\" Daily Treasury purchases alone reached a peak pace of $75 billion, equivalent to the highest pace of purchases we had ever previously conducted on a monthly basis.5 By the end of the first four weeks of purchases, the Desk had bought over $1 trillion in Treasury securities and nearly half a trillion dollars in agency MBS.6\n\nIn addition to adjustments to the timing and amounts of purchases, the Desk frequently adapted the specific parameters of the purchase operations. At the end of each purchase day, the Desk assessed the outcome of the purchase operations, the status of market indicators for liquidity and relative value, data on positioning and flows, and the market intelligence we gathered, and used these variables to adjust our plans for coming purchases. For example, we typically do not purchase the cheapest-to-deliver securities for active Treasury futures contracts to avoid exacerbating scarcity in those issues. However, given the large unwinds that were occurring in the cash-futures basis trade at the time, we chose to include these securities in our operations to help absorb those sales. In the MBS market, we purchased securities for near-term settlement to help reduce pressure on dealer balance sheets, a deviation from our typical strategy of purchasing for forward settlement.\n\nOf course, having access to better data would be beneficial in making these judgments, and there are many critical efforts underway to enhance data availability.7 But even with the best data, designing such purchases in a crisis will require judgment and adaptability, and use of real-time indicators, operational results, and market intelligence will remain critical for helping inform those decisions.\n\nMaking Sure the Price is Right: Using Operations to Assess Market Prices\n\nDysfunctional markets pose a particular problem for central banks as they evaluate the appropriate price for the securities they purchase: in the absence of liquid, two-way markets, market pricing sources may not be reliable. A second lesson from the Desk's pandemic purchases is that, to get the price right, the purchase operations themselves provide important information.\n\nHistorically, the Desk has chosen to purchase securities by conducting large-scale auctions, with offers on particular securities selected on the basis of their offered price relative to prevailing market prices and, in the case of Treasury purchases, measures of theoretical value according to our proprietary model. For Treasury purchases, this approach generally worked well during the pandemic, with market measures of prices tracking fairly closely to prices received in our operations. From March through June of 2020, during the height of the market dysfunction, nearly all of the Desk's Treasury purchases were executed cheap to market prices.\n\nBy contrast, agency MBS market price sources were more volatile. In the Treasury market, high-speed electronic trading is widely used for trading the most recently issued securities, while most trading in agency MBS is done via request-for-quote (RFQ) systems where dealers and customers transact at slower speeds. The major agency MBS trading platforms provide approximate price levels at which a trade is likely to occur. In normal conditions, these \"indicative\" prices closely approximate the actual bid and offer levels at which market trades are conducted. However, at the height of the dysfunction, the offered prices we received in our operations diverged significantly from these indicative prices \u2014at times by more than one-quarter of a percentage point, either higher or lower than what might have been expected. Given the size of our operations relative to overall market volumes, Fed purchase operations became important opportunities to identify prevailing market prices for agency MBS.\n\nAs a result, we developed a variety of methods for using the prices offered to us in the operations to establish an effective market price for each security, which aided us in selecting which securities were being valued as cheap by the market and should be targeted for purchase. For example, one measure of pricing used was the second-best price we received on a security from a dealer other than the dealer that offered the best price (a measure commonly known in the market as a \"cover\").8 As two-way market activity picked up, we continued to adjust these approaches and integrated market price feeds back into the evaluation of security pricing.\n\nDon't Forget the Dog Just Because It Didn't Bark\n\nFinally, we should take some lessons from the \"dogs that did not bark\" during the pandemic. Despite the unprecedented flow of government securities in the market, we were fortunate to not see cracks in the market infrastructure\u2014the financing, clearing, and settlement systems that undergird the markets for U.S. Treasuries and agency MBS. Some have used this as evidence that these processes need not be priorities in the work to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market. Let me be clear: that is not the lesson we should take.\n\nWe know that the financing, clearing, and settlement processes of the government securities markets can be more resilient.9 In recent years, the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG) has highlighted the risks in clearing and settlement in the Treasury market, finding that market participants may not be applying the same risk management rigor to the financing, clearing, and settlement of U.S. Treasury securities that they do in other markets.10 For example, the TMPG found that the share of the Treasury cash market that is centrally cleared has shrunk over the last two decades to under 25 percent , reducing the portion of the market that is subject to standard risk management processes like margin, default processes, and liquidity resource requirements.11 Similarly, the TMPG found that the large, uncleared bilateral repo market has inconsistent risk management practices, including zero haircuts. This is a practice that many counterparty risk management professionals would find questionable at best.12 More work should be done to ensure that these transactions effectively manage counterparty credit risk, and I am glad that both public and private sector groups have work planned in this area.13\n\nImportantly, we do not know how the financing, clearing, and settlement of Treasuries and agency MBS would have fared had the Fed not offered unprecedented amounts of Treasury repurchase agreements and purchased extraordinary amounts of these securities. Had there been a default by a large market player, particularly in the uncleared market segment, it could have reverberated through the pipes of the system. It is essential to guard against both bilateral and systemic risks in financing, clearing and settlement processes, which can generate counterparty losses, fire sales, fails, and even possible risk to institutions that sit at the center of funding, clearing, and settlement for the U.S. Treasury and agency MBS markets.\n\nThe lesson is that we should not forget the dog simply because it did not bark. Efforts to bolster the resiliency of the U.S. Treasury and agency MBS markets\u2014including the financing, clearing, and settlement mechanisms\u2014are essential to reducing the frequency and severity of events like those of March 2020 and ensuring that the extraordinary interventions of central banks around the world remain extraordinarily rare. As part of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance, or IAWG, the New York Fed has been working steadily with counterparts across the official sector to advance policy proposals and research to support the fundamental soundness of the Treasury market.14 Finally, I invite you to join the IAWG's ninth annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference this fall, either virtually or in person. This forum has become an essential focal point for resiliency efforts.\n\nThank you again for welcoming me here today. I look forward to a productive panel discussion."

    "content": "Thank you, Tom. It's a pleasure to share the stage with you today.\n\nAs a member of the New York Fed's Board of Directors, Tom Murphy represents the Federal Reserve's Second District. Our directors ensure that a diversity of viewpoints on economic and banking conditions are represented, so we can better understand and anticipate developments in our economy, both locally and nationally. As you well know, a lot has occurred since Tom joined our board two years ago. And we have benefited immensely from his thoughtful insights and perspectives.\n\nToday, it should come as no surprise that I'll be spending much of my time discussing inflation, which remains my No. 1 concern. I'll also talk about how we are using our monetary policy tools to restore price stability. And, I'll give you my economic outlook.\n\nBefore I go further, I'd like to do three things: First and foremost, I want to thank the New York Bankers Association for inviting me here. Second, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System. And third: I'd like to wish everyone a happy Valentine's Day. As Rihanna sang at the Super Bowl, I hope you all have someone to stand under your umbrella.\n\nInflation Is Still Too High\n\nEconomic developments over the past three years have been extraordinary. The pandemic contributed to dramatic swings in our economy \u2014 and economies around the world\u2014that we are still grappling with today. At the onset, we experienced the deepest \u2014 but also the shortest\u2014recession in U.S. history, as well as an immediate spike in unemployment, the highest since the Great Depression.\n\nThen, along with Russia's war against Ukraine, the pandemic contributed to skyrocketing inflation, which reached 7 percent last June, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index . That's a level we had not seen for four decades, and one that is well above the FOMC's longer-term goal of 2 percent.\n\nHigh inflation hurts everyone, but it's hardest on those who can least afford essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Persistently high inflation also undermines the ability of our economy to reach its full potential. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate, set by Congress, to promote price stability and maximum employment. And price stability is essential for the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis.\n\nOver the past year, the FOMC has taken strong actions to bring inflation down. Although we have seen some moderation in recent months, the inflation rate remains far too high at 5 percent.\n\nIn addition, measures of underlying inflation also remain elevated and well above our 2 percent longer-run goal. For example, after declining earlier in 2022, the New York Fed's Multivariate Core Trend has been hovering around 3-3/4 percent for the past few months.1 Similarly, both the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate and core inflation that excludes food and energy prices averaged around 3-3/4 percent over the past six months.\n\nSo, our work is not yet done. Inflation is still well above our 2 percent target, and it is critically important that we reach that goal.\n\nSupply and Demand Misalignment\n\nTo help illustrate how tighter monetary policy is working to reduce inflation, I like to use an analogy inspired by a mechanism that consists of different gears.2 In this case, I'll hearken back to a time before rechargeable batteries, and even before quartz, to the age of the mechanical watch.\n\nOur watch represents the economy, and its gears are different sectors. Some gears spin quickly; others turn slowly. They need to turn at the right speed to keep time accurately\u2014or, in this example, to maintain balance in the economy.\n\nThe gears are propelled by supply and demand, which act as the mainspring of our watch. But they have been misaligned since the onset of the pandemic. At first, when people were home and factories were shuttered, demand shifted strongly from services to goods, which were scarce due to supply-chain bottlenecks. Then, once people got out of their homes and businesses reopened, we saw a rotation in demand away from goods and back to services. But even with this rebalancing and the contributions of tighter policy, overall demand still exceeds supply.\n\nSimilar imbalances exist in the labor market. After the pandemic forced mass shutdowns, unemployment surged. But as businesses reopened and the demand for workers rebounded, suddenly there weren't enough people to fill jobs. Today, the labor market remains extremely tight. Job gains are robust. Job openings are near all-time highs. Quit rates and wage gains remain elevated. And the unemployment rate, at 3.4 percent, is the lowest since 1969. As some of you may recall, that was the year \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" was the best-selling album. And the title track is, of course, another great Valentine's Day song.\n\nTurning the Inflation Gears\n\nInflation has its own set of gears, and some are spinning faster than others. The one that's turning quickest relates to globally traded commodities\u2014such as lumber, steel, and grains\u2014that are sensitive to international economic and financial conditions. Thanks in part to tighter policy in the United States and around the world, those prices are below the levels we saw following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe gear that represents many other goods\u2014such as cars, appliances, and furniture\u2014has also started to turn. Higher interest rates, both here and abroad, are damping global demand for goods. In addition, the severe supply-chain bottlenecks that initially affected this category began to improve last year, which likely contributed to the easing of prices for some durable goods in recent months.\n\nHowever, there are factors that may throw sand in this gear going forward. The economic resiliency of Europe and a rebound in growth in China following the end of COVID restrictions will likely increase global demand for goods. And further improvement in global supply-chain disruptions has stalled over the past few months. For example, the New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe slowest gear to turn is the one that represents non-energy services. It's influenced by the balance of overall supply and demand, and it will take the longest to rotate at the right pace for low and stable inflation. One area where we are seeing signs of this gear turning is in shelter costs. After a sharp rise, we have seen a steep decline in the rate of increase in new lease rents. Assuming this trend continues, we should see a slowing of overall rent inflation during this year. That said, we have yet to see the gears turn for inflation of non-energy services excluding housing, which is still quite elevated, averaging 3-3/4 percent over the most recent six months.\n\nTightening Monetary Policy\n\nTaking into account the different speeds the gears are moving, it is clear that overall demand remains well in excess of supply, and inflation is running far above our 2 percent target. When it comes to monetary policy, we must restore balance to the economy and bring inflation down to 2 percent on a sustained basis.\n\nEarlier this month, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent, the eighth consecutive increase. The FOMC said it anticipates \"ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\"3\n\nThe Committee also said it will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, according to the framework it announced last May.4\n\nOne aspect of inflation that's important for achieving and sustaining price stability is the anchoring of inflation expectations. Since 2012, the FOMC has clearly and consistently communicated its resolute commitment to its 2 percent longer-run inflation goal and the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations consistent with that goal. 5 This provides a \"North Star\" for our policy decisions and has helped keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.6 According to our most recent Survey of Consumer Expectations, three-year-ahead inflation expectations are now where they were before the sharp increase in inflation that started in 2021, and one-year-ahead expectations have been trending down since the middle of last year.7\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nDeclines in commodity and goods prices will not be enough to bring inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. We need all the gears turning at the right pace to restore balance between demand and supply in the entire economy. We still have some way to go to achieve that goal. And it will likely entail a period of subdued growth and some softening of labor market conditions. As a result, I expect real GDP growth to come in around 1 percent for 2023. And I anticipate the unemployment rate to edge up over the next year to between 4 and 4-1/2 percent.\n\nAs tighter policy actions continue to work to restore balance to supply and demand, I expect PCE inflation to fall to 3 percent in 2023, before moving closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal in the next few years.\n\nConclusion\n\nI am confident that the gears of monetary policy will continue to move in a way that will bring inflation down to 2 percent. We will we stay the course until our job is done."

    "title": "Remarks at the Next Step FX Event",
    "date": "Feb 8, 2023",
    "speaker": "Michelle Neal",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/nea230208",
    "content": "Thank you to the GFXD for inviting me to this event today.  It is an honor to join you to discuss market developments.\n\nThe FX market, with an estimated $7.5 trillion in average daily turnover, is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world. By enabling the efficient transfer of funds across borders, the FX market plays an important role in price discovery and facilitates transactions in goods, services, and financial assets.\n\nAs I reflect on my own personal career, two consistent themes emerge. First, an ongoing focus on driving and navigating the evolution of the financial markets and with an emphasis on emerging innovation and regulation; and second, the importance of partnering with dynamic and inspiring individuals, some of whom are in the room today. In my remarks, I will delve further into these themes. I will talk about how the FX market has been impacted by ongoing innovation and cross-border collaboration, how it might evolve, and the importance of best practices to support a well-functioning and efficient FX market. As always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEvolution of the FX Market\n\nOver the course of my career, I've seen firsthand how financial markets have grown and evolved on a global basis, having had the vantage point of being based in the UK and the US and managing teams and businesses that span no less than 13 global locations with different market characteristics, different cultures and different regulatory regimes. Trading in major financial markets, much as the rest of our day to day lives, has been dramatically impacted by digital forces and electronification over recent decades.  Like most assets classes, trading in the FX market was traditionally dominated by transacting over the phone and post trade procedures conducted by fax.  Today, it's fair to say that FX has led the way in electronification for non-equity products, utilizing a range of platform types and protocols. Participation in the FX market has also broadened considerably. Whereas the market was previously dominated by banks and bank-affiliated dealers, \"other financial institutions\"\u2014a category that includes non-reporting banks and other kinds of financial institutions, such as institutional investors, hedge funds, and proprietary trading firms \u2013 are significant contributors to liquidity in the market. This change has been partly driven by technological advancements, which have reduced barriers to entry and trading costs and increasing the speed with which transactions take place.\n\nWhile nothing is certain, I think it is fair to state that the FX market will continue to evolve, in both expected and unexpected ways. We might see much shorter settlement times\u2014potentially moving from T+1 or T+2 to instant and autonomous settlement. Further electronification of the FX market could bring greater efficiency, more customized client services, greater competition, and potentially better pricing and liquidity for consumers. As certain barriers to entry are lowered further, we could also see even more diversity in the types of liquidity providers in the FX space. A more diverse set of players would allow for firms with different comparative advantages to operate in the space.\n\nWe could also see the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in some jurisdictions. Central banks are now starting to innovate by building expertise and investing in technology to examine the potential applicability of CBDCs. Some of the work currently underway includes wholesale-focused experiments by the BIS Innovation Hub's Project Helvetia and Project Jura, which have explored settlement of tokenized assets and foreign exchange transactions in CBDC.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve has made no decision on whether or how to issue a CBDC, we are actively conducting research and technical investigations into both retail and wholesale CBDC designs to improve our understanding of the risks and opportunities inherent to a U.S. dollar CBDC.\n\nOur Role in a Rapidly Changing Market\n\nIn global financial markets where the speed and scope of innovation is increasing, how do we think about the role of the Federal Reserve?  Through the recently created New York Innovation Center (NYIC), we are collaborating with a range of market players to generate insights into implications of these new technologies for central banks, enabling stakeholders and the central bank community to enhance the functioning of the global financial system. Established in 2021 as a strategic partnership with the Bank for International Settlements, the NYIC partners with experts across the Federal Reserve System, academia, and the public and private sectors on technical research, experimentation, and prototyping.\n\nThe NYIC's inaugural project, Project Cedar, zeroed in on two of the topics I mentioned earlier: the settlement of FX transactions and CBDCs. As a first area of investigation, Project Cedar considered FX spot transactions, which are critical in the context of cross-border payments, and serve as a building block for longer, more complex transactions. By demonstrating that a CBDC facilitated by a modular ecosystem of ledgers could provide improvements in settlement time of FX spot transactions, phase one of Project Cedar shed light on ways that distributed ledger technology might improve speed and access and reduce risk for the broader cross-border market.\n\nFor the second phase of Project Cedar which is currently underway, the NYIC partnered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to investigate modes of interoperability between CBDC ledgers to facilitate a more complicated transaction: a multi-leg, cross-border, cross-currency payment. By investigating this, the NYIC seeks a better understanding of a future that may include a CBDC-based FX market. We plan to publish the findings of the phase two experiment in the coming months. Ongoing research and experimentation, in collaboration with a range of financial market participants, will be the key to ensuring that markets continue to evolve responsibly in order to safeguard the stability of the global financial system.\n\nThe Role of the FX Global Code\n\nTaking a step back, regardless of where innovation takes us, it will be important to collaborate across markets and international borders. Given the central role of the FX market in the global economy, a well-functioning and efficient FX market is critical. To support this, we at the New York Fed have, for many decades, actively partnered with market participants through our sponsorship of the Foreign Exchange Committee (FXC), an industry group that works to promote an FX market that is robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent.\n\nIn recent years, we've reinforced this work at a global level through our participation in the Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC)\u2014a forum comprised of both public and private sector representatives--and the establishment of the FX Global Code. The FX Global Code is a set of principles that play a pivotal role in upholding the conditions for an open marketplace where diverse participants can operate in a fair and transparent way. Market participants demonstrate their commitment to the Code and good practices in the wholesale FX market by publishing a signed statement of commitment. The Code challenges organizations to think critically about their role in the market and places a spotlight on the importance of good conduct. It also serves as an international benchmark against which firms can assess not only their own internal practices, but also those of their FX counterparties, platforms, and vendors. We, ourselves, have signed a statement of commitment to the GFXC Global Code to show our commitment to these ideals.\n\nAs the FX market evolves over time, it is vital that the Code adapts along with it. In July of 2021, the GXFC completed its first comprehensive review of the Code since it was launched in 2017. Critical to this process was input from the full spectrum of market participants \u2013 including buy-side contributions from asset managers, hedge funds, and corporations. The updated Code further promotes disclosures and transparency and introduced debate on important topics resulting in the advancement of good practices, including how to best reduce settlement risks within the FX market.  In this environment of rapidly changing financial markets, the Code will be revisited and revised every three years to ensure that it remains fit for purpose amidst ongoing innovation.\n\nConclusion\n\nInnovation is by its very nature both exciting and daunting, as rapid changes present both opportunities and risks. Looking back to the inception of digital innovation in markets, I might have found it hard to believe we would have come this far so fast. We now have a market and financial system that is faster, more robust, and more inclusive than ever before. Through close partnerships across the full spectrum of market participants, we can continue to harness and channel innovation to further strengthen financial markets and the global economy."

    "content": "Albert Einstein famously said, \"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.\" While charming advice to live by, it is also particularly salient when it comes to the rebalancing and movement taking place in the U.S. economy today.\n\nIn my remarks this evening, I'm going to discuss inflation, the continued imbalances between supply and demand, and the effects that monetary policy is having on different sectors of the economy. I'll share what this means for the economic outlook in the United States, and how the Federal Reserve's policy actions support our bedrock commitment to price stability.\n\nBefore I do that, I want to thank the Fixed Income Analysts Society for putting together this wonderful program. It's great to stay local, even if it means dodging rush hour traffic in Midtown. Although times like these make me wonder if I should take Einstein's bike riding advice more literally!\n\nI should also give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInflation Indications and Implications\n\nI'll start by saying that although we are seeing some signs that inflation is moderating, it remains far too high, and it is my No. 1 concern going into 2023. Rapidly rising prices continue to have an immense impact on families and businesses, especially when it comes to essentials like food, utilities, and housing.\n\nHigh inflation is a new reality for many people. For the three decades preceding the pandemic, the inflation rate averaged almost exactly 2 percent, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. But that changed dramatically in the spring of 2021, when inflation suddenly soared, ultimately reaching a 40-year high of 7 percent last June. While the inflation rate has since come down to 5-1/2 percent, it's still higher than any pre-pandemic reading since 1982 and far above the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nPersistently high inflation undermines the ability of our economy to perform at its full potential, so it is critical for the Federal Reserve to bring inflation back down to our goal . We are firmly committed to doing so.\n\nShifts and Realignment\n\nThose who have been following my speeches lately will know that I've been quite devoted to a recurring theme: using the layers of an onion to describe inflation.1 But with the new year, I thought I would switch gears. I didn't have to look too far, because the mechanism of shifting gears is exactly what's going on in the economy. It also explains the effects that monetary policy is having on the economy and how that's helping to bring inflation back down.\n\nDuring the pandemic and its aftermath, we saw an enormous swing in demand, away from services like travel and entertainment and toward goods and housing, as people adjusted to work from home and avoided contact-intensive activities. More recently, we are seeing a rotation in demand from goods back into services. But through all these shifts, overall demand has remained very strong and has far exceeded supply.\n\nThis misalignment of supply and demand is true for the labor market as well. Although several indicators of labor demand\u2014such as job openings, quits, and hiring\u2014have stepped down from their very high levels of the first few months of 2022, they show that demand still far exceeds available supply. And the unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is historically low.\n\nThe same dynamics play out in the Federal Reserve's Second District, the region that the New York Fed represents. Our regional business surveys indicate that activity is slowing, with an especially sharp decline in the manufacturing sector. That said, many businesses continue to add staff, and consumer confidence is strong. Overall, inflationary pressures in the region are moving downward, but are still quite high.\n\nGears Are Turning\n\nWith inflation running persistently above its longer-run goal of 2 percent, the FOMC has taken strong actions to align demand with supply in the economy and bring inflation down. You can think of monetary policy as a large gear that is connected to smaller gears representing different sectors of the economy. But not all gears move at the same pace. Some turn more quickly, while others are slower, meaning they experience longer lags between policy actions and effects.\n\nThese effects of monetary policy are showing up in prices at different speeds. For example, the prices of globally traded commodities have already declined and are now well below levels we saw earlier last year. This reflects in part the effects of lower demand resulting from tighter monetary policy here and abroad.\n\nSimilarly, prices for many goods have started to plateau or even decline, reflecting weaker demand, lower import costs, and an easing of global supply disruptions that developed during the pandemic. For example, prices of used cars\u2014a big driver of inflation during the first year of the pandemic\u2014have been retreating toward more normal levels over the past few months. The combination of the general rotation of demand from goods to services and the effects of higher interest rates on demand for goods should contribute to further downward pressure on the prices of many goods this year.\n\nOne gear that is moving at a far slower pace is the price of non-energy services. The ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in this sector continues to contribute to inflationary pressures. But there is some good news on this front as well. One of the biggest drivers of the rise in inflation for services has been shelter costs, which soared as demand for housing increased during the pandemic. Recent data for newly-signed leases indicate that the tide is turning on rents, and we should see shelter cost inflation start to slow later this year. That said, inflation for other services besides shelter has remained high, and this gear is only starting to turn.\n\nInflation expectations represent another gear that is turning at an encouraging speed. Longer-run inflation expectations remain remarkably stable at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.2 After rising moderately last year, households' three-year-ahead inflation expectations are now back to where they were in January 2021, and one-year-ahead inflation expectations have started to reverse the rise seen over the past year and a half.3\n\nThe FOMC's Policy Actions\n\nWith inflation still high and indications of continued supply-demand imbalances, it is clear that monetary policy still has more work to do to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal on a sustained basis.\n\nAt its meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent, the seventh consecutive increase. The FOMC's December 2022 Summary of Economic Projections showed that a large majority of participants saw the federal funds rate reaching a level between 5 and 5-1/2 percent by the end of this year .\n\nThe FOMC statement indicated that \"the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\"4\n\nBringing inflation down is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. But restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer term, and it is critical that we stay the course until the job is done.\n\nI'll also add that the framework announced last May for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is working well, and the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities as planned.5\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWe are seeing the shifting gears of tighter monetary policy having the desired effects. Broad indicators show that financial conditions have become significantly less supportive of spending. As a result, I expect real GDP growth to be modest this year at around 1 percent.\n\nRobust hiring, low unemployment, and strong nominal wage growth mean the labor market remains remarkably tight. But with growth slowing, I anticipate the unemployment rate to increase from its current level of 3-1/2 percent to around 4-1/2 percent over the next year.\n\nTurning to inflation, I expect cooling global demand and supply improvements to result in declining inflation for goods. These factors should contribute to inflation slowing further from its current rate to around 3 percent this year. While services inflation is still a sticking point, I expect overall inflation to come back down to 2 percent in the next few years as further tightening of monetary policy realigns the balance between demand and supply.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll close by saying that the monetary policy gear is turning. But it will take time for supply and demand to come back into proper alignment and balance, so we must keep moving. While the route ahead is still uncertain, I am fully confident we will return to a sustained period of price stability."
