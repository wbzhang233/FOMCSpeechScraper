        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  In my remarks, I will focus on the 2015 economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.  In general, I will paint a reasonably positive picture—an economy that is likely to make further progress towards the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.  In fact, if my own forecast is realized, I would expect to favor raising the FOMC’s federal funds rate target sometime in 2015.  This would be a welcome development, because it would signify that the economy has healed sufficiently to warrant a somewhat less accommodative monetary policy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nThe Growth Outlook Is Improving\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.3 percent annualized rate.  Several times over that period, it appeared that growth was breaking out on the upside, but each time such hopes were disappointed.  We are again at a similar junction.  Over the past few quarters, the pace of economic growth has picked up and the broad consensus is that the U.S. economy will grow at about a 2 ½-3 percent annual rate over the next year.1\n\nWill these forecasts once again turn out to be too optimistic?  Subject to a few caveats that I discuss later, my view is that the likelihood of another disappointment has lessened.  The consensus forecast seems like a reasonable expectation, in part, because several of the “headwinds” restraining U.S. economic activity in recent years have subsided.  First, the housing sector is currently in much better balance.  The overhang of housing associated with the housing boom has largely been absorbed, and a recovery in housing prices has significantly shrunk the proportion of borrowers that are underwater on their mortgages—that is, those households that have outstanding mortgage balances higher than the value of their homes.  Also, measures of distress such as mortgage delinquencies and homes entering the foreclosure process have fallen.  \n\nSecond, consumers are in better financial shape.  Households are carrying less debt, with total household liabilities roughly $500 billion below their cyclical peak in 2008.  Moreover, lower interest rates have facilitated significant mortgage debt refinancing, which has lowered the household debt service burdens.  Depending on the particular measure used, household debt service burdens relative to income have fallen back to levels last seen in the 1980s and 1990s.  In addition, household net worth has recovered sharply, boosted primarily by higher financial asset valuations, but also by some recovery in home prices. \n\nThird, the fiscal restraint that has held back growth in recent years has ended, with the federal budget deficit now at a level consistent with a stable to slowly declining federal debt-to-GDP ratio.  In the aggregate, state and local governments have also ended their retrenchment.  One important piece of evidence in this regard is the fact that state and local government employment is now rising at between 5,000 and 10,000 per month, after generally contracting during the 2009 to 2012 period.  \n\nNow that these headwinds have subsided, buoyant financial market conditions spurred, in part, by a very accommodative monetary policy should do more to support economic activity.  In particular, compared to historical patterns, the current household net worth-to-income ratio is high relative to the personal saving rate.  This suggests some scope for a decline in the household saving rate.  If this were to occur, consumption growth would outstrip income growth.  Similarly, financial market conditions are conducive to sustained gains in business fixed investment.  Equity prices are high, borrowing costs are low, cash flows are strong and corporate balance sheets are healthy.  \n\nAnother positive development for both the U.S. and the global economy is the sharp decline in energy prices.  Let’s start with the U.S. perspective.  Despite the impressive recent gains in natural gas and crude oil production, the U.S. still is a net importer of energy.  As a result, falling energy prices are beneficial for our economy.  In economist parlance, falling energy prices are a positive “terms of trade” shock for the U.S.  Over the near-term, this will lead to a significant rise in real income growth for households and should be a strong spur to consumer spending.  Since energy expenditures represent a higher proportion of outlays for lower income households, falling energy prices disproportionately raise their real incomes.  Also, because such households are more liquidity constrained, with budgets that often bind paycheck to paycheck, they have a higher tendency to spend any additional real income.  As a result, much of the boost to real household income from falling energy prices is likely to be spent, not saved.  \n\nMore broadly, the decline in energy prices also will be supportive to the global growth outlook in two other ways.  First, by pulling down inflation in many countries it will spur more expansive monetary policy.  We are already seeing this response in Europe and Japan.  Second, the decline in energy prices is also likely to ease the global fiscal stance.  Over the near-term, for oil exporting governments, falling revenue will not be fully offset by reduced expenditures.  This will cause major oil exporters to run either smaller budget surpluses or bigger budget deficits.  In the aggregate, the swing from oil producers to consumers is quite large.  For example, a $20 per barrel decline in global oil prices results in an income transfer of about $670 billion per year from producers to consumers.2  This understates the total effect because it does not include any knock-on reductions in other energy prices—such as for natural gas—that, outside the U.S., often are linked to oil prices.     \n\nObviously, if the oil price declines were to both intensify and persist, this would have negative implications for oil and gas investment in the U.S.  At a minimum, as cash flows fall, some producers will cut back on their drilling activity rather than plug the shortfall with outside financing.  \n\nNevertheless, there are several reasons why I don’t think this risk should be overstated, especially if oil prices stabilize around current levels.  First, even after the large gains in recent years, oil and gas investment remains a small fraction of GDP.  Second, domestic natural gas investment should be relatively unaffected because U.S. natural gas prices are largely insensitive to global energy price developments.  This reflects the high costs associated with exporting natural gas and the fact that most of our oil production is used for transportation purposes.  Thus, the ability to substitute lower cost natural gas for oil is limited.  Third, extraction costs vary appreciably across the different major oil fields.  There is not a single critical price that will constrain production or investment.  Fourth, with respect to oil produced by fracking, productivity gains have cut drilling costs and raised oil production, so breakeven costs per barrel have been falling.  Finally, if oil investment were to soften, this would lead to lower breakeven costs as resources currently in short supply—e.g., water, welders, housing and transport—became more available and less expensive.  \n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will turn out to be either weaker or stronger than expected.  However, I believe that the risks around this forecast are reasonably well balanced.  The subsiding headwinds that I discussed earlier are the primary reason for seeing the downside risks as limited.  In contrast, the ongoing geopolitical risks remain substantial. \n\nAt the same time, several factors suggest that growth is unlikely to turn out to be substantially stronger than the consensus forecast.  First, the upside from housing relative to the forecast is likely limited.  Although there has been an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years, single-family housing starts are growing only slowly and are unlikely to climb much faster over the next year or two.  The demand for new homes is still hindered by tight credit conditions for homebuyers.  Mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse in extending new credit, and mortgage availability to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  I don’t anticipate that this situation will change in a material way any time soon.   \n\nSecond, because motor vehicle sales are now close to their pre-recession levels, the future growth impetus from this cyclical sector will likely also be restrained going forward.  Third, growth in the rest of the world has slowed slightly and the dollar has appreciated somewhat.  This will limit the growth in U.S. exports, and suggests that the trade sector is unlikely to provide much support to growth over the next year or two.    \n\nInflation: Lower Now, but Likely to Drift Gradually Higher Next Year\n\nLet me now turn to discuss the inflation outlook.  Inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve’s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  For example, over the past twelve months, the overall PCE deflator has risen by 1.4 percent, and the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy, has increased by 1.6 percent.  Recently, the overall index has been pulled down by sharply lower oil and gasoline prices.  Also, I expect that core goods prices will be held down somewhat over the near-term by the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar.  Nevertheless, I expect inflation will begin to move back towards our 2 percent objective in 2015.  As the economy expands and the labor market continues to tighten, resource slack should decline and this should gradually exert some upward pressure on prices.  Also, despite some softness in market-based measures of inflation compensation, inflation expectations still seem well-anchored and this should also work to pull inflation gradually higher.  \n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this assessment of the growth and inflation outlook imply for monetary policy?  Since the September 2012 announcement of the Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities asset purchase program, there has been substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  Recognizing its success in meeting the FOMC’s stated objectives, the FOMC decided to end the asset purchase program at the end of October. \n\nNow that we have ended our asset purchase program, attention has turned to the monetary policy normalization process.  There are four important questions regarding this process: When to begin? How to begin? How fast to go? And, how far to go? Let me consider each question in turn. \n\nWith respect to the question of when to begin, it is still premature to begin to raise interest rates, that is, to “lift off” from the zero lower bound.  As the FOMC concluded in its most recent statement: “The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month.”  \n\nBut this sentence should not be viewed as an iron-clad commitment unaffected by economic and financial developments.  The statement goes on to say: “However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.”  In other words, the FOMC’s monetary policy actions and the timing of lift-off will depend on how the economic outlook evolves, particularly with respect to the labor market and inflation.  \n\nIn considering the appropriate timing of lift-off, there are three important reasons to be patient.  First, the Committee is still undershooting both its employment and inflation objectives.  Unemployment is too high and inflation is too low.  Thus, monetary policy needs to be very accommodative in order to close these gaps relative to the Committee’s objectives.  Second, when interest rates are at the zero lower bound, the risks of tightening a bit too early are likely to be considerably greater than the risks of tightening a bit too late.  A premature tightening might lead to financial conditions that are too restrictive, resulting in a weaker economy and, in turn, an aborted lift-off.  This would be problematic in that it would harm the Fed’s credibility and, more importantly, would be difficult to rectify.  The U.S. experience during the Great Depression and the Japanese experience over the past two decades illustrate the risks of raising interest rates too soon, especially when inflation is running below the central bank’s objective.  Finally, given the still high level of long-term unemployment and the outlook for inflation, there could be a significant benefit to allowing the economy to run “slightly hot” for a while in order to get those that have been unemployed for a long time working again.  I believe this can be done without jeopardizing our price stability objective.  If the long-term unemployed are not employed relatively soon, their job skills will erode further, reducing their long-term prospects for employment and, therefore, the productive capacity of the U.S. economy.  This would be a very unfortunate outcome for them, their families and the country. \n\nMarket expectations that lift-off will occur around mid-2015 seem reasonable to me.  Although that could change depending on how the economy evolves, my views on “when” do not differ appreciably from the most recent primary dealer and buy-side surveys undertaken by the New York Fed prior to the October FOMC meeting.3\n\nI hope the economic outlook evolves so that it will be appropriate to begin to raise interest rates sometime next year.  While raising interest rates is often portrayed as a difficult task for central bankers, in fact, given the events since the onset of the financial crisis, it would be a development to be truly excited about.  When the FOMC begins to raise its federal funds rate target, this would indicate that the U.S. economy is finally getting healthier, and that the Committee believes it is on a sustainable track to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  That would be very good news, even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.  \n\nSo, when the appropriate time comes, how is the process of monetary policy normalization likely to unfold?  In this regard, the revised policy normalization principles and plans that the FOMC released following the September FOMC meeting are informative.4   In particular, the Committee will begin to normalize monetary policy by first raising its target range for the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates will be the primary tool used for tightening monetary policy.  After lift-off looks sustainable and the federal funds rate is somewhat above the zero lower bound, the Committee will cease to reinvest those funds generated by maturing Treasury securities and prepayments of agency MBS securities.  The Committee anticipates that the balance sheet will gradually normalize passively as these assets run off, not actively via asset sales. \n\nThe effective federal funds rate will be pushed into a higher target range by raising the interest rate paid on excess reserves (IOER).  The overnight reverse repo repurchase (ON RRP) facility will play a secondary role, in the sense that it will be used “only to the extent necessary” to help put a floor under the federal funds rate, and it will be phased out when it is no longer needed.  \n\nWith respect to “how fast” the normalization process will proceed, that depends on two factors—how the economy evolves, and how financial market conditions respond to movements in the federal funds rate target.  Financial market conditions mainly include, but are not necessarily limited to, the level of short- and long-term interest rates, credit spreads and availability, equity prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  When the FOMC adjusts its short-term federal funds rate target, this does not directly influence the economy since little economic activity is linked to the federal funds rate.  Instead, monetary policy affects the economy as the current change in short-term interest rates and expectations about future monetary policy changes influence financial market conditions more broadly.  \n\nDevelopments in financial market conditions are thus an important element in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy.  Changes in financial market conditions influence economic growth through a number of channels.  For example, a stronger equity market raises household wealth and lowers the desired personal saving rate—lifting consumer spending. A stronger equity market also reduces the cost of capital for business, which may help encourage greater investment spending.  Lower long-term interest rates push down business financing costs, which also supports investment spending.  At the same time, lower mortgage rates support housing demand and reduce household interest outlays.  A weaker dollar supports growth by making imports more expensive and by increasing export competitiveness.  The combined effect is to increase net exports. \n\nIf the linkage from the federal funds rate to financial market conditions were stable over time, there would be no need to focus on financial market conditions.  In a world in which the linkage was solid and unchanging, adjustments to the short-term interest rate and communication about future policy would have a predictable and reliable effect on financial market conditions.  Central bankers, then, could keep their focus narrowly on their policy rate. \n\nHowever, as has been very clear, especially in recent years, this linkage is not stable.  Thus, how much one pushes on the short-term interest rate lever depends, in part, on how financial market conditions respond to such adjustments.  Imagine driving a car where the connection between the gas pedal and the engine speed was variable and uncertain.  The driver would have to constantly monitor and adjust the pressure on the gas pedal to achieve the desired speed.  Similarly, we will have to monitor and adjust short-term interest rates to achieve financial market conditions consistent with achieving our labor market and inflation objectives.  All else equal, less responsiveness implies larger interest rate adjustments and vice versa.  \n\nQuickly, let me give two examples that illustrate how variable this linkage can be.  First, during the 2004-07 period, the FOMC tightened monetary policy nearly continuously, raising the federal funds rate from 1 percent to 5.25 percent in 17 steps.  However, during this period, 10-year Treasury note yields did not rise much, credit spreads generally narrowed and U.S. equity price indices moved higher.  Moreover, the availability of mortgage credit eased, rather than tightened.  As a result, financial market conditions did not tighten.  \n\nAs a result, financial conditions remained quite loose, despite the large increase in the federal funds rate.  With the benefit of hindsight, it seems that either monetary policy should have been tightened more aggressively or macroprudential measures should have been implemented in order to tighten credit conditions in the overheated housing sector.    \n\nSecond, during the financial crisis, especially during the fall of 2008, financial market conditions tightened dramatically even as the FOMC was cutting its federal funds rate target to zero.  Monetary accommodation turned out to be insufficient to produce an easing of financial market conditions, and the economy fell into a deep recession.  \n\nOver time, financial market conditions have become a much more important factor in evaluating the appropriate setting of monetary policy and the level of short-term interest rates.  This reflects several factors.  First, over the past few decades, as the U.S. capital markets have grown in size and scope, the U.S. financial system has become much less bank-centric.  This has loosened the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial market conditions.  Second, the U.S. economy and financial markets have become more interconnected globally.  Thus, the impact of U.S. monetary policy has become more diffused, and financial market conditions have come to depend increasingly not only on developments in the U.S., but also on developments elsewhere.  As an example, the low level of U.S. 10-year Treasury yields presumably is due, in part, to the fact that long-term interest rates in Europe and Japan are much lower. \n\nSo, if the effect of short-term rate changes on financial market conditions has become less predictable and more variable over time, what implications does this have for U.S. monetary policy?  From my perspective, there are three major implications that deserve attention.  \n\nFirst, when lift-off occurs, the pace of monetary policy normalization will depend, in part, on how financial market conditions react to the initial and subsequent tightening moves.  If the reaction is relatively large—think of the response of financial market conditions during the so-called “taper tantrum” during the spring and summer of 2013—then this would likely prompt a slower and more cautious approach.  In contrast, if the reaction were relatively small or even in the wrong direction, with financial market conditions easing—think of the response of long-term bond yields and the equity market as the asset purchase program was gradually phased out over the past year—then this would imply a more aggressive approach.  The key point is this:  We will pursue the monetary policy stance that best generates the set of financial market conditions most consistent with achievement of the FOMC’s dual mandate objectives.  This depends both on how financial market conditions respond to the Fed’s policy actions and on how the real economy responds to the changes in financial conditions.  \n\nThe second major implication is to be cautious about overreliance on simple monetary policy rules, such as the Taylor Rule, that do not include measures of financial market conditions in their formulation.  As you may recall, in a Taylor Rule the nominal federal funds rate depends on an equilibrium or neutral real rate of interest—which is assumed to be constant over time—the deviation of the level of economic activity from estimates that would be consistent with long-run price stability and the deviation of inflation from the central bank’s target. \n\nAs I have noted elsewhere, the Taylor Rule formulation has a number of characteristics that make it a useful input into the policy-setting process.  First, it very explicitly focuses on the two parameters—the long-term inflation objective and the level of potential output consistent with that objective—that map directly to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Second, standard Taylor Rules are self-equilibrating.  They respond to economic shocks and forecast errors in a way that pushes the economy back toward the central bank’s objectives.  Market participants incorporating information about the rules in their price-setting decisions helps keep inflation expectations well-anchored.  Third, academic research shows that Taylor-type rules typically perform quite well across a wide range of economic models.  This is important because we want guides to policy that are robust; that is, guides that are not overly sensitive to model-specific assumptions about how the economy works, or how households and businesses alter their expectations and behavior in response to changes in monetary policy.5\n\nDespite these attractive features, I do not believe that simple policy rules can take the place of in-depth analysis of economic and financial market conditions.  While simple policy rules provide useful benchmarks to policymakers, their very virtue—their simplicity—is also a significant shortcoming.  Policy rules cannot capture all of the information that is relevant for policymaking.  In particular, such rules do not capture the fact that the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial market conditions can be very loose.  This is a critical shortcoming because this looseness affects the stability of the relationship between monetary policy and economic outcomes.  If the relationship between monetary policy, financial conditions and the real economy were stable over time, then following a relatively simple and unchanging policy rule would likely generate acceptable results.  However, if the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is more variable and uncertain, as I believe it is, then an approach that takes this explicitly into consideration will be more effective. \n\nThe third implication that stems from the fact that financial market conditions matter in the conduct of monetary policy pertains to the so-called “Fed put” with respect to equity prices.  The notion here is that because the Federal Reserve cares about unanticipated and undesired changes in financial market conditions, the Fed will respond to weakness in equity prices by easing monetary policy—essentially providing a put to equity investors.  The expectation of such a put is dangerous because if investors believe it exists they will view the equity market as less risky.  This will cause investors to push equity market values higher, increasing the likelihood of an equity market bubble and, when such a bubble bursts, the potential for a sharp shock that could threaten financial stability and the economy.    \n\nLet me be clear, there is no Fed equity market put.  To put it another way, we do not care about the level of equity prices, or bond yields or credit spreads per se.  Instead, we focus on how financial market conditions influence the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.  At times, a large decline in equity prices will not be problematic for achieving our goals.  For example, economic conditions may warrant a tightening of financial market conditions.  If this happens mainly via the channel of equity price weakness—that is not a problem, as it does not conflict with our objectives.  In contrast, when we want financial market conditions to be extremely accommodative—as has been the case in recent years when we have been far away from our employment and inflation objectives—then we will take into consideration a broad set of developments with respect to interest rates, the stock market and other measures of financial conditions in choosing the appropriate stance for monetary policy.  \n\nBecause financial market conditions affect economic activity only slowly over time, this suggests that we should look through short-term volatility and movements in financial markets.  We should not respond until we become convinced that the movements will likely, without action on our part, prove sufficiently persistent to conflict with achievement of our objectives.  Often, financial markets can be quite volatile and move a lot without disturbing underlying economic performance.  \n\nFinally, let me turn to the issue of “how much,” in other words, what federal funds rate target over the long term is consistent with our employment and inflation objectives.  This issue is more difficult to judge for a number of reasons.  First, it depends on how financial conditions evolve in response to our monetary policy adjustments.  Second, it depends on other factors, such as potential real GDP growth, which in turn, depends on the growth of the labor force and productivity growth trends.  My current thinking, in this regard, is that the equilibrium federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent inflation will be somewhat lower in the future than in the past.  In part, this reflects the likelihood that potential real GDP growth will likely be somewhat lower going forward due to slower growth in the labor force.  But my confidence in this conclusion may change on the basis of incoming empirical evidence.  In fact, I suspect my views will evolve as I see how the economy responds over time to higher interest rates and tighter financial market conditions.   \n\nConclusion\n\nIn my remarks today, I have provided my current thinking about the U.S. growth and the inflation outlook, and the implications for monetary policy.  To sum up, the U.S. economic outlook looks brighter, with growth likely to be somewhat above the trend of the past five years.  The risks to growth appear generally balanced, without unusually high risks that growth will either be much stronger or weaker than my forecast.  On inflation, I remain confident, despite the recent softening, that inflation will begin to move up towards our 2 percent objective next year.  This move will not likely happen immediately, however, given the recent weakness in energy prices and the fact that non-energy import price trends are also likely to soften a bit over the near-term. \n\nWith respect to monetary policy, I believe that market expectations as captured by the most recent New York Fed’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants are reasonable—with lift-off expected to take place sometime around the middle of next year.  But, life is uncertain and my judgment of the appropriate timing could change in response to incoming data and other factors that change the economic outlook.  When we do begin to tighten monetary policy, the pace of tightening will depend not only on the outlook but also on how financial market conditions respond as we begin to remove monetary policy accommodation.  Financial market conditions are an important transmission mechanism of monetary policy.  This is why I don’t favor indiscriminately adhering to simple policy rules that exclude financial market conditions.  \n\nI hope the FOMC can begin to raise its federal funds rate target next year.  This would signify that the economy has made sufficient progress towards the FOMC’s objectives and that the time had finally come to begin to unwind the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation.  \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 See, for example, the latest Blue Chip consensus survey (volume 39, no. 11, November 10, 2014).

        "title": "Testimony on Improving Financial Institution Supervision: Examining and Addressing Regulatory Capture",
        "content": "I. Introduction\n\nChairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to testify on the effectiveness of financial institution supervision and the issue of regulatory capture.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009 our country faced its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  I mention those years as a touchstone for my remarks today.  Despite the passage of time and an economy that is steadily improving, the financial crisis is hardly something that happened in the remote past.  For the too many people who are still unemployed or underemployed, or who otherwise continue to struggle financially, it is living history.\n\nWhile the causes of the crisis remain subject to debate, it is undeniable that banking supervisors could have done better in their prudential oversight of the financial system.  This conclusion raises two fundamental questions:\n\nThe Federal Reserve is working diligently to improve both stability and supervision.  The two concepts are linked.  Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has made significant changes to the substance and process of supervision.  As a result, the financial system is unquestionably much stronger and much more stable now than it was five years ago. \n\nII. Substantive changes\n\nSince the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has redoubled its attention to bank capital.  Capital is the financial cushion that banks hold to absorb loss.1  It provides an economic firebreak that helps prevent systemic stress from turning into a full-blown crisis. \n\nBefore the crisis, capital requirements were too low and inconsistent across jurisdictions.  Moreover, too much of the capital held by banks was of poor quality, and their internal capital assessments were not forward-looking.2  Since the crisis, new regulation and heightened supervision have increased both the quantity and the quality of equity capital at the largest financial institutions that we regulate and supervise.  The Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulators implemented so-called “Basel III” international capital standards in July 2013, which raised the minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.  Federal regulation also now requires stricter criteria for instruments to qualify as regulatory capital and higher risk weights for many classes of assets.  And the Federal Reserve mandated a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that includes off-balance sheet exposures for the largest, most internationally active banking organizations and a leverage surcharge for large U.S. banking organizations. \n\nIn support of these new regulations, capital assessment has become a focus of supervision since the financial crisis.  Examiners monitor capital reserves and put banks through periodic stress tests that are evaluated on a cross-firm basis.  This has been one of the great advancements of bank oversight following the crisis.  These evaluations enable supervisors to assemble a composite assessment of the nation’s banking sector, which materially assists the Federal Reserve in its statutory mandate to promote financial stability.3\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act mandates supervisory stress tests that assess whether large bank holding companies have a sufficient level of capital to absorb losses during adverse economic conditions.4  The Federal Reserve also conducts a capital planning exercise, called the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or “CCAR.”  This evaluation combines the quantitative results from the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests with a qualitative assessment of whether the largest bank holding companies have vigorous, “forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks.”5  The criteria for both sets of stress tests are dynamic and change in response to evolving risks.  For example, past tests have assumed a sharp, sudden, and widespread drop in markets triggered by, say, a large Eurozone shock.  The tests also evaluate market interconnectedness, including the risk of major counterparty default. \n\nTo increase public transparency, the Federal Reserve now publishes the overall results of its stress tests.  This helps rebuild confidence in the strength of the financial system.  The most recent round of stress tests concluded in the first quarter of this year.  In my view, the results were encouraging, although not uniformly satisfying.  In general, “firms participating in CCAR have more than doubled their Tier 1 common capital since 2009, an increase of $500 billion of additional, high-quality capital in the U.S. financial system.”6  This impressive statistic notwithstanding, the Federal Reserve objected to capital plans from five of the 30 participating firms.  Four of those five firms submitted plans that raised firm-specific, qualitative concerns.  The remaining firm failed to meet a minimum quantitative requirement.7 \n\nThe consequences of failing to pass a stress test can be severe.  If its capital plan has been rejected, the Federal Reserve may, among other things, restrict a bank holding company from paying or increasing dividends on its common stock or increasing any repurchase of its common stock, or both.8  For example, as a result of this year’s CCAR, Citigroup was not permitted to begin a new common stock repurchase program or to increase its quarterly common stock dividend.9\n\nAs a companion to improved capital, the Federal Reserve also assesses liquidity—that is, how quickly a bank can convert its assets into cash.  Prior to the crisis, liquidity practices did not generally anticipate the possibility of severe drops in the prices of saleable assets.  Following the crisis, the Federal Reserve imposed new liquidity regulations, including the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio.  The objective of these new regulations is to require large firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil.  We have also implemented liquidity stress test assessments for systemically important financial institutions.  These assessments provide important insight into the adequacy of liquidity positions and bank preparedness for upcoming regulatory standards.\n\nBeyond capital and liquidity, the Federal Reserve has increased its focus on risk management practices at the largest and most systemically important financial institutions.  We learned from the crisis that risk management in the financial services industry had not always kept pace with changing market practices.  We have responded in several ways.\n\nFor example, we have paid greater supervisory attention to corporate governance.  We significantly increased the depth and frequency of interaction between senior supervisors from the Federal Reserve and directors and executives at banks.  This supplements our ongoing assessment of management’s oversight of risk.  Our review entails a critical analysis not only of firm policies, procedures and limits, but also of the quality of the risk reports escalated to senior management, the capabilities of the firm’s risk monitoring program, and the adequacy of control functions. \n\nWe have also increased our enforcement activity for violations of law or unsafe or unsound conduct.  Since 2009 the Federal Reserve has taken 36 public enforcement actions against institutions supervised by the New York Fed, which included $1.2 billion in fines.  On top of this, five firms supervised by the New York Fed paid $1.3 billion into a qualified settlement fund for mortgage borrowers, and the same five institutions were required to provide over $2 billion in other foreclosure prevention assistance.  These statistics do not include non-public enforcement actions, including restrictions on the further growth of banks that do not have satisfactory risk management regimes.  And, earlier this year, we assisted in consigning the concept of “too big to jail” to history when Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to criminal charges.  I am gratified that the Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York have acknowledged the work of the Federal Reserve in supporting our law enforcement partners.10\n\nThe New York Fed has also devoted significant resources and attention to the reform of bank culture and conduct.  Increased capital and liquidity are important tools to promote financial stability, but in the end a bank is only as trustworthy as the people who work within it.  I have personally delivered a strong message that the culture of Wall Street is unacceptable.11  Bad conduct by bankers damages the public trust placed in banks.  In my view, this loss of trust is so severe that it has become a financial stability concern.  If bad behavior persists, it would not be unreasonable—and may even be inevitable—for one to conclude that large firms are too big and complex to manage effectively. \n\nOur nation’s largest financial institutions need to repair the loss of public trust in banks.  This means a back-to-basics assessment of the purpose of banking, including duties owed to the public in exchange for the privileges banks receive through their bank charters and other functions of law.  Among these privileges are deposit insurance and access to a lender of last resort. \n\nAs part of this effort, I have proposed four specific reforms to curb incentives for illegal and unduly risky conduct at banks.  First, banks should extend the deferral period for compensation to match the timeframe for legal liabilities to materialize—perhaps as long as a decade.  Second, banks should create de facto performance bonds wherein deferred compensation for senior managers and material risk takers could be used to satisfy fines against the firm for banker misbehavior.  Third, I have urged Congress to enact new federal legislation creating a database that tracks employees dismissed for illegal or unethical behavior.  Fourth, I have requested that Congress amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to impose a mandatory ban from the financial system—that is, both the regulated and shadow banking sectors—for any person convicted of a crime of dishonesty while employed at a financial institution.\n\nIII. Supervisory process\n\nIn tandem with our attention to capital, liquidity, and risk management, we have made important changes to the process of supervision. \n\nFor starters, the Federal Reserve now makes its most consequential supervisory decisions on a system-wide level through the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee or “LISCC.”  The committee comprises representatives across professional disciplines from several Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.  The New York Fed supplies only three of its 16 members.  LISCC sets supervisory policy for the 15 largest, most systemically important financial institutions in our country and develops innovative, objective, and quantitative methods for assessing these firms on a comparative basis.  LISCC also coordinates the supervision of the largest supervised institutions through its Operating Committee, which reviews and approves supervisory plans for exams, receives regular updates on major supervisory issues, and makes material supervisory decisions regarding matters that affect the firms’ safety and soundness.  In this respect, the Operating Committee provides an important safeguard against regulatory capture by ensuring that no one person or Reserve Bank has the power to make a final decision on a matter of significance.\n\nAnother procedural change is our increased application of cross-firm, horizontal review.  This technique enables peer-to-peer comparison of banks, facilitates a better assessment of the overall health of the financial system, and safeguards against regulatory capture by providing insight from across the Federal Reserve System.  The analysis is done not only at the level of the Board of Governors—for example, through CCAR and Dodd-Frank stress testing—but also within the New York Fed.  We hold weekly discussions among senior supervisory and risk officers to identify developing concerns that may pose a systemic risk.  A current subject of horizontal analysis is leveraged loans—specifically, whether lax underwriting practices for such loans could pose a significant risk to financial stability. \n\nIn addition, we have reorganized the supervision group at the New York Fed in a number of ways that promote unbiased analysis and professional objectivity.  Many of these changes directly reflect the recommendations in a 2009 report that I commissioned from David Beim, which was featured in the recent This American Life program about supervision at the New York Fed.  For example:\n\nEach and together, these improvements to the substance and process of supervision contribute to financial stability by providing greater insight into bank resiliency and risk.  But these enhancements are not self-executing.  They depend on the hundreds of examiners who are dedicated professionals working in the public interest.  Our examiners fulfill their obligations with considerable care, mindful of the stakes to Main Street when something goes wrong on Wall Street.  I am grateful for their efforts.\n\nIV. Reasonable expectations\n\nBefore concluding, let me offer a broader view of what we at the Federal Reserve expect from prudential supervision.  Very briefly, I submit that supervision should be fair, conscientious, and effective. \n\nFair supervision means that the rules are applied consistently across the firms we supervise.  We all need to know the rules and follow the same rule book.  It also entails a commitment to independence from business or political influence, as envisioned by the Federal Reserve Act one hundred years ago.\n\nConscientious supervision means we must be committed to sustained and, if necessary, radical self-improvement.  The Beim report is an example of our willingness to commission and accept self-critical analysis and our commitment to improve.  But we cannot stop there.  To this end, we will be working with the Board of Governors on its upcoming review of whether the LISCC Operating Committee receives information that is sufficient to reach sound supervisory decisions.  One subset of this system-wide inquiry will analyze regulatory capture—specifically, how divergent views are presented to decision makers at the Board.  The review is expected to take several months. \n\nEffective supervision means tough supervision and demands a focus on large banks that pose systemic risk.  Bank supervisors cannot prevent all fraud or illegal conduct or forestall all undesirable behavior in large, complex financial institutions.  But we can help create more resilient, less complex, and better managed organizations that promote, rather than undermine, financial stability.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to improve its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.  We understand the risks of doing our job poorly and of becoming too close to the firms we supervise.  We work hard to avoid these risks and to be as fair, conscientious, and effective as possible.  Of course, we are not perfect.  We cannot catch or correct every error by a financial institution, and we sometimes make mistakes.  But in my view, a good measure of the effectiveness of supervision is the improved strength and stability of banks since the financial crisis.  Thanks in part to enhanced supervision and regulation, banks “have the ability to meet their financial obligations and continue to make a broad variety of financial products and services available to households and businesses even in times of economic difficulty.”12  I can promise you that we will always strive to improve and that we will work hard to earn and retain your trust. \n\nI look forward to taking questions.\n\n1 I use the terms “bank” and “financial institution” interchangeably, but note that the two terms are not synonymous in federal regulation.\n\n2 See Joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, “Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios, Capital Adequacy, Transition Provisions, and Prompt Corrective Action,” June 12, 2012, at 32.\n\n3 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 5365(a)(1).\n\n4 See 12 U.S.C. § 5365(i).\n\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Press Release, October 23, 2014.\n\n6 Daniel Tarullo, “Stress Testing after Five Years,” Remarks at the Federal Reserve Third Annual Stress Test Modeling Symposium, Boston, Massachusetts, June 25, 2014.\n\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 2014: Assessment Framework and Results, March 2014, at 7-8.\n\n8 See 12 C.F.R. §§ 225.8(c)(2) and (e)(2)(iv).\n\n9 See Citigroup, Inc., “Citi Statement on 2014 CCAR Results,” March 26, 2014.\n\n10 See U.S. Department of Justice, “BNP Paribas Agrees To Plead Guilty To Conspiring To Process Transactions Through The U.S. Financial System For Sudanese, Iranian, And Cuban Entities Subject To U.S. Economic Sanctions,” June 30, 2014.  \n\n11 See William Dudley, “Ending Too Big to Fail,” Remarks at the Global Economic Policy Forum, New York City, November 7, 2013; William Dudley, “Enhancing Financial Stability by Improving Culture in the Financial Services Industry,” Remarks at the Workshop on Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York City, October 20, 2014.\n\n12 Scott G.

        "title": "U.S. Monetary Policy and its Global Implications",
        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with you here today.   In my remarks, I will assess the outlook for the U.S. economy and the progress that the Federal Reserve has made toward its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment in the context of price stability.  I will argue that we are now closer to achieving these objectives.  That is the reason why the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ended its latest Treasury and agency MBS asset purchase program last month.  But we still have further to go.  Although the U.S. labor market has shown substantial improvement, there still is a meaningful gap between where we are and full employment.  Also, inflation continues to undershoot the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\n\nThis argues for patience with respect to the timing of lift-off of the federal funds rate and the beginning of the normalization of monetary policy.  Although patience is appropriate, if all goes well, I anticipate that we will begin to raise short-term rates sometime next year.  That would be a welcome development, because it would indicate that the U.S. economy has largely recovered from the damage caused by the housing boom and bust, and the financial crisis. \n\nHowever, we need to be mindful that this shift in policy most likely will be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence.  Moreover, the normalization of U.S. monetary policy could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies (EMEs) that have been the recipients of large capital inflows in recent years.  This leads to an important question: what can the Federal Reserve do to address these risks? \n\nI will make three observations about the potential international spillovers from normalizing U.S. monetary policy.  First, what we may see in terms of market strains and macroeconomic adjustment during this normalization process will not be new.  Changes in Fed policy, and especially the tightening of monetary policy, have often created challenges for countries abroad, especially EMEs.  Second, these EMEs, as a group, are better equipped today to handle those challenges than in the past.  This reflects the fundamental improvements and stronger policy frameworks that many of these countries have put in place over the past 15 years.  Third, given the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve has a special responsibility to manage U.S. monetary policy appropriately in order to promote global financial stability.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.3 percent annualized rate.  Several times over that period, it appeared that growth was breaking out on the upside and forecasts were raised, but each time such hopes were disappointed.  We are again at a similar junction.  Over the past two quarters, the pace of economic growth has picked up.  In particular, real GDP rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate last quarter, and is widely expected to grow at around a 2½ to 3 percent annual rate through the end of 2015.\n\nThis time, however, I believe that we are less likely to be disappointed.  That is because several of the various “headwinds” that have impeded U.S. economic activity in recent years have subsided.  This allows the improving underlying fundamentals to exert themselves more forcefully.  For example, fiscal restraint, which had a significant impact on economic growth last year, has abated, and is likely to disappear altogether next year.  Credit availability has also improved, reflecting healthier bank balance sheets and improving job and income prospects for potential borrowers.  In addition, the excess supply of housing that built up during the boom of the previous decade has been worked off. \n\nThis lessening of headwinds has allowed supportive financial market conditions spurred, in part, by very accommodative monetary policy to shine through.  As a result, I expect that both consumption and business investment spending will strengthen over the next few quarters.  On the consumer side, household balance sheets are now healthier, reflecting higher aggregate household net worth relative to income and less leverage.  Also, sturdy employment gains and falling energy prices are boosting real income growth.  Together with accommodative financial conditions, this should lend support to further gains in consumer spending.\n\nSimilarly, despite some recent market turbulence, conditions on the business side are supportive to sustained gains in investment.  Credit to businesses is generally readily available, cash flows are strong and corporate balance sheets are healthy. \n\nThe energy sector is another bright spot that has been supporting business investment and the U.S. economy.  New extraction technologies have had a dramatic impact on this sector, with natural gas production up 15 percent since 2010, and crude oil production up a remarkable 35 percent.2  Moreover, natural gas prices have fallen significantly in recent years and are far lower than those in most other industrialized economies.  These developments have dramatically boosted jobs and incomes in these industries, with beneficial spillovers to manufacturing competitiveness more generally. \n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will turn out to be either weaker or stronger than expected.  However, I believe that the risks around this forecast are reasonably well balanced, and that the likelihood that growth will be substantially weaker or stronger than the forecast is relatively low.  The subsiding headwinds that I discussed earlier are the primary reason for seeing the downside risks as limited.  At the same time, there are a few factors that suggest that there is a relatively low likelihood of growth ending up substantially above the forecast.\n\nThree considerations seem important for assessing the degree of upside risk to growth.  First, the upside from housing is likely limited compared to what one might expect under more normal conditions.  We have seen an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years.  In contrast, starts of single-family homes remain at low levels despite the fact that home prices have risen substantially over the past two years and mortgage rates have remained low.  A contributing factor is that mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse, and mortgage credit to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  There is little on the horizon that would lead me to believe that this situation will change in a material way any time soon.  Second, because motor vehicle sales are now close to their pre-recession levels, the future growth impetus from this cyclical sector probably will also be restrained.  Finally, growth in the rest of the world has slowed and the dollar has appreciated somewhat.  This will limit the growth in U.S. exports, and suggests that the trade sector is unlikely to be a strong wind at the back of the U.S. economy over the next year or two.   \n\nWith respect to prices, inflation has been running somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  For example, over the past twelve months, the overall PCE deflator has risen by 1.4 percent, and the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy, has increased by 1.5 percent.  Moreover, for the next few months, inflation is likely to moderate further as the impact of falling gasoline prices and the firmer dollar feed into the official U.S. inflation statistics.  Thereafter, I expect that inflation will begin to move back towards our 2 percent objective, pushed there as slack in the economy continues to diminish and pulled there by well-anchored inflation expectations. \n\nIn assessing inflation expectations, I currently put more weight on survey-based measures of inflation expectations as opposed to market-based measures.  Survey-based measures have been generally stable, consistent with inflation expectations remaining well-anchored.  However, market-based measures, such as those based on breakeven inflation derived from the difference between yields on nominal versus Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), have registered declines over the past few months, even on a 5-years forward basis.  Research done by my staff suggests that much of this decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation reflects a fall in the inflation risk premium—that is, what investors are willing to pay to protect themselves against inflation risk.  Adjusting for the fall in the inflation risk premium, inflation expectations appear to have declined much less than implied by TIPS inflation breakeven measures.  \n\nSo what does this assessment of the outlook imply for monetary policy?  Since September 2012, when the last program of asset purchases was announced, there has been substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  Because the asset purchase program had fulfilled the FOMC’s stated objectives, the FOMC decided to end the program last month.  At the same time, it still is premature to begin to raise interest rates—there remains slack in the labor market and the inflation rate is still too low.  Hence, the last FOMC statement states: “The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month.”  But this sentence should not be viewed as an iron-clad commitment.  As the statement goes on to say: “However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.”  In other words, what the FOMC does going forward will depend on how the economy evolves, and how this affects the labor market and the inflation outlook. \n\nIn considering the appropriate timing of lift-off, there are three important reasons to be patient.  First, the Committee is still undershooting both its employment and inflation objectives.  Unemployment is too high and inflation is too low.  Thus, monetary policy needs to be very accommodative in order to close these gaps relative to the Committee’s objectives.  Second, when interest rates are at the zero lower bound, the risks of tightening a bit too early seem considerably greater than the risks of tightening a bit too late.  A premature tightening might lead to financial conditions that are too tight, resulting in a weaker economy and an aborted lift-off.  This would be problematic in that it would harm the Fed’s credibility and, more importantly, would be difficult to rectify.  The U.S. experience during the Great Depression and the Japanese experience over the past two decades illustrate the risks of raising interest rates too soon, especially when inflation is running below the central bank’s objective.  Finally, given the still high level of long-term unemployment, there could be a significant benefit to allowing the economy to run “slightly hot” for a while in order to get these people employed again.  If they are not employed relatively soon, their job skills will erode further, reducing their long-term prospects for employment and, therefore, the productive capacity of the U.S. economy.\n\nAll that said, I hope the economic outlook evolves so that it will be appropriate to begin to raise interest rates sometime next year.  While raising interest rates is often portrayed as a difficult task for central bankers, in fact, given the events since the onset of the financial crisis, it would be a development to be truly excited about.  Raising interest rates would signal that the U.S. economy is finally getting healthier, and that the Fed is getting closer to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  That would be very good news, even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.\n\nGlobal Implications of U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization\n\nLet me now turn to the implication of U.S. policy normalization for foreign economies. Like other central banks, our monetary policy mandate has a domestic focus.  Our monetary policy actions, though, often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy and financial markets, and we need to always keep this in mind.  For most of us, the market volatility that we saw in the spring and summer of 2013 during the so-called “taper tantrum” still remains fresh in our minds.  EME financial markets were hit the hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points from early May before peaking in early September.\n\nMost commentary about the catalyst for these moves has focused on the shift in expectations with respect to U.S. monetary policy—and, in particular, to uncertainty about the timing and implications of Fed tapering.  This focus seems generally right to me, although other factors also played a role.\n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges that face EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing that was necessitated by hitting the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate.  Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past.  This time should not be fundamentally different.\n\nBut, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy, and this creates more potential uncertainties.  These uncertainties put a premium on keen listening skills on our part and clear communication among central bankers as well as between central bankers and market participants.  In my view, an important fact is that our large scale asset purchase programs affect the size of term risk premia globally.  This new set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble regarding what we claim to understand about this distinction.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on vulnerabilities that they might have ignored prior to the taper tantrum in 2013.  The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  There will be no one right answer in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and adjustment will sometimes be difficult.  We will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw last month is evidence enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic about the prospects for adjustment so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a single group.\n\nFurthermore, many EMEs generally appear to be better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were during past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms that EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons learned from past periods of market stress. Among the positives are:\n\nOf course, progress has not been uniform across EMEs, and more work remains to further strengthen institutional structures in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities remain in several important EMEs, and some EMEs are now being hit by a sharp adverse turn in their terms of trade due to the recent fall in global commodity prices.  Still, the fundamental improvements I’ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment becomes more difficult.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even further, to internationally coordinate policymaking.  As I’ve already noted, we are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.  Accordingly, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think it’s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy—an economy that might have required exceptional monetary policy accommodation for a much longer period of time?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of maximum employment in the context of price stability, and whether this support is consistent with a healthy global economy.\n\nMoreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or EMEs specifically.  Central banks face enough challenges in tailoring policies to their own domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  As an example, recent events demonstrate the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear, in retrospect, that our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  Market participants seemed to conflate the prospective tapering of asset purchases with monetary policy tightening, and pulled forward their expectations about the likely timing of liftoff and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better: market participants now seem to share the Committee’s current assessment that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time, even now that the asset purchase program has been completed. \n\nAs you know, we’ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of growth, inflation and short-term rate forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments.\n\nA second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act both early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps through new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, and the official sector is making progress in ensuring no financial firm will be too-big-to-fail.\n\nAll of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and enable us to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how to better fulfill their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us collectively to a better place.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Agria Sbordone, Thomas Klitgaard, Jonathan McCarthy and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing this speech.\n\n2 See Table 1.2 in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Monthly Energy Review, October 2014."

Moreover, we will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw last month is evidence enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic on the outlook so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a homogenous group.\n\nFurthermore, many EMEs generally appear to be better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were in past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms these EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons they learned from past periods of market stress.  Among the positives are:\n\nOf course, progress has not been uniform across EMEs, and more work remains to further strengthen institutional structures in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities remain in several important EMEs.  Still, the fundamental improvements I’ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment turns from welcoming to wary.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even further, to internationally coordinate policymaking.  As I’ve already noted, Fed policies have significant effects internationally, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.  In pursuing our policy responsibilities, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  We are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think it’s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of stable prices and maximum sustainable growth, and whether this support is consistent with a healthy global economy.\n\nMoreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or the EMEs specifically.  Central banks have challenges enough in tailoring policies to their own domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  As an example, recent events demonstrate the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear in retrospect that our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  In particular, markets seemed to conflate tapering with monetary policy tightening and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better: markets now seem to understand that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time even now that the asset purchase program has been completed. \n\nAs you know, we’ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings by the Fed chair; the publishing of growth and inflation forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments.\n\nA second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act both early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps reflecting both new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, compensation schemes for these institutions will be more focused on rewarding long-term results and the official sector is making progress in solving the \"too-big-to-fail\" dilemma.\n\nAll of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how to better fulfill their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us to a better place collectively.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor.\n\n1 Market participants also had to evaluate the possibility that growth in China and other EMEs might be slowing even as growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies was picking up. The subsequent market movements as investors withdrew funds from EME investments were an abrupt shock for these EMEs generally, especially after the long earlier period of abundant liquidity and ample inflows."

        "title": "Enhancing Financial Stability by Improving Culture in the Financial Services Industry",
        "content": "As I noted earlier at the start of today’s workshop, improving culture in the financial services industry is an imperative.  This endeavor is important in order to ensure financial stability over time, but also to ensure the public trust in our financial system.  In my remarks today, I will first talk about what I see as the culture problem.  Then, I will focus on how incentives could be improved within the financial services industry to encourage better culture and behavior.  This includes how we compensate employees of a financial institution, but it also extends to how these firms identify wrong-doers and punish them.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Existing Culture Problem\n\nIn recent years, there have been ongoing occurrences of serious professional misbehavior, ethical lapses and compliance failures at financial institutions.  This has resulted in a long list of large fines and penalties, and, to a lesser degree than I would have desired employee dismissals and punishment.  Since 2008, fines imposed on the nation’s largest banks have far exceeded $100 billion.2  The pattern of bad behavior did not end with the financial crisis, but continued despite the considerable public sector intervention that was necessary to stabilize the financial system.  As a consequence, the financial industry has largely lost the public trust.  To illustrate, a 2012 Harris poll found that 42 percent of people responded either “somewhat” or “a lot” to the statement that Wall Street “harms the country”; furthermore, 68 percent disagreed with the statement: “In general, people on Wall Street are as honest and moral as other people.” \n\nI reject the narrative that the current state of affairs is simply the result of the actions of isolated rogue traders or a few bad actors within these firms.  As James O’Toole and Warren Bennis observed in their Harvard Business Review article about corporate culture: “Ethical problems in organizations originate not with ‘a few bad apples’ but with the ‘barrel makers’.”3  That is, the problems originate from the culture of the firms, and this culture is largely shaped by the firms’ leadership.  This means that the solution needs to originate from within the firms, from their leaders.\n\nWhat do I mean by the culture within a firm? Culture relates to the implicit norms that guide behavior in the absence of regulations or compliance rules—and sometimes despite those explicit restraints.  Culture exists within every firm whether it is recognized or ignored, whether it is nurtured or neglected, and whether it is embraced or disavowed.  Culture reflects the prevailing attitudes and behaviors within a firm.  It is how people react not only to black and white, but to all of the shades of grey.  Like a gentle breeze, culture may be hard to see, but you can feel it.  Culture relates to what “should” I do, and not to what “can” I do. \n\nA number of factors have contributed to the cultural failures that we have seen.  An important question is whether the sheer size, complexity and global scope of large financial firms today have left them “too big to manage.”  Large problems can originate in small corners of these firms, as illustrated by the Financial Products Group experience at AIG, and the “London Whale” episode at JPMorgan.  Differences in attitudes and business practices across countries can also be difficult to reconcile within a firm’s overall compliance function.  Recent fines against BNP Paribas for violating U.S. sanctions programs and providing dollar funding to a country engaged in genocide and against Credit Suisse for facilitating tax evasion by U.S. citizens, point to these challenges.  Another important element affecting culture has been the shift in the prevailing business model away from traditional commercial and investment banking activities to trading; that is, from client-oriented to transaction-oriented activities.  Clients became counterparties—the other side of a trade—rather than partners in a long-term business relationship.  In general, interactions became more depersonalized, making it easier to rationalize away bad behavior, and more difficult to identify who would be harmed by any unethical actions.\n\nHigh-powered pay incentives linked to short-term profits, combined with a flexible and fluid job market, have also contributed to a lessening of firm loyalty—and, sometimes, to a disregard for the law—in an effort to generate larger bonuses.  Often allegiance to an external network of traders has been more important than the ties the trader has to his or her particular employer.  This is particularly evident in the illegal manipulations of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and with respect to reference rates in the foreign exchange markets.\n\nAlthough cultural and ethical problems are not unique to the finance industry, financial firms are different from other firms in important ways. First, the financial sector plays a key public role in allocating scarce capital and exerting market discipline throughout a complex, global economy.  For the economy to achieve its long-term growth potential, we need a sound and vibrant financial sector.  Financial firms exist, in part, to benefit the public, not simply their shareholders, employees and corporate clients.  Unless the financial industry can rebuild the public trust, it cannot effectively perform its essential functions.  For this reason alone, the industry must do much better.\n\nAs was discussed earlier, in the U.K., seven of its largest banking institutions have recently founded the Banking Standards Review Council under the leadership of Sir Richard Lambert, who joined us today.  I would strongly encourage the largest institutions based here in the United States to work to develop collaborative solutions aimed at improving culture and rebuilding the public trust.\n\nThe Key Role for Senior Leadership\n\nCorrecting this problem must start with senior leadership of the firm.  The “tone at the top” and the example that senior leaders set is critical to an institution’s culture—it largely determines the “quality of the barrel.”  As a first step, senior leaders need to hold up a mirror to their own behavior and critically examine behavioral norms at their firm.  Sustainable change at any firm will take time.  Turning around a firm’s culture is a marathon not a sprint.  Senior leaders must take responsibility for the solution and communicate frequently, credibly and consistently about the importance of culture.  Boards of directors have a critical role to play in setting the tone and holding senior leaders accountable for delivering sustainable change.  A healthy culture must be carefully nurtured for it to have any chance of becoming self-sustaining.\n\nFirms must take a comprehensive approach to improving their culture that encompasses recruitment, onboarding, career development, performance reviews, pay and promotion.  All of these elements need to be aligned with the desired culture.  Through our supervisory process, we have seen that a number of firms have started this process by developing or refining employee surveys and 360 feedback processes to target issues of behavior and culture.  Some firms are incorporating case study discussions into training programs to highlight ethical dilemmas and decision-making.  Some are revamping senior level promotion criteria to reinforce what are the desired characteristics and behaviors of leaders.  These efforts are at various stages in terms of their depth, breadth and maturity.  Supervisors will need to see how these frameworks evolve, and more importantly, see evidence of how these efforts yield results in the form of more open and routine escalation of issues, consistent application of “should we” versus “could we” in business decisions, rigor in identifying and controlling of conduct risk, and how compliance breaches factor into compensation.\n\nMeasurement and accountability for progress in developing a healthier culture across the industry is paramount to us as supervisors and central bankers.  An important measurement of progress is employees’ assessment of their firm’s culture.  To this end, we encourage the industry to harness the various individual efforts that have been initiated at a number of firms in order to develop a comprehensive culture survey.  This anonymous survey would be fielded across firms each year by an independent third-party and the results shared with supervisors.  Having a common survey instrument would promote benchmarking of, and accountability for, progress on culture and behavior. \n\nA core element of any firm’s mission and culture must be a respect for law.  Federal Reserve guidance advises that banks should strive to “[m]aintain a corporate culture that emphasizes the importance of compliance with laws and regulations and consumer protection.”4   To maintain such a culture, senior leaders must promote effective self-policing.  If audit uncovers an instance of fraud in one unit, the firm’s leadership should ask, “Where else could this behavior occur?”  If the press reports fraud at a competitor in a particular business line, the same self-assessment should apply.  “Could this happen to us, could we have a similar problem here?”  When fraud is detected, boards and senior leaders must ensure that they are informed promptly, and that a thorough inquiry is undertaken at once.  The senior leaders of financial firms, and those who report to them, must also be proactive in reporting illegal or unethical activity.  Early self-reporting sends a powerful message to employees and to regulators about a firm’s respect for law.  This is one important reason why those who self-report in a timely way should be treated preferentially, compared to those that drag their feet and whose bad behaviors are only uncovered by enforcement investigations.\n\nHow will a firm know if it is making real progress?  Not having to plead guilty to felony charges or being assessed large fines is a good start.  Firms should also pay closer attention to how they and the industry are broadly viewed by the public.  Internally, one important marker for progress is the frequency of problems, and whether small problems stay small, or instead, grow into large problems.  A healthy culture is one where problems are identified early and promptly addressed.\n\nIn addition to a strong compliance function, firms need to foster an environment that rewards the free exchange of ideas and views.  Individuals should feel that they can raise a concern, and have confidence that the issues will be escalated and fully considered.  This is a critical element to prevention.  A firm’s employees are its best monitors, but this only works well if they feel a shared responsibility to speak up, expect to be heard and their efforts supported by senior management.\n\nLet me give you an example to take this from the abstract to the more specific.  As I noted in a speech a few weeks ago on the issue of reference rate reform, in the case of the LIBOR setting process, the information barriers between the traders and LIBOR submitters were paper thin and porous.5  At times, traders and LIBOR submitters colluded to manipulate LIBOR for the gain of the traders and the firm. \n\nWhat should have happened instead goes like this:  A trader asks the LIBOR submitter to adjust the submitted rate.  The submitter says “no way,” tells the trader that this request is inappropriate and that the trader will be reported to compliance.  The submitter reports the trader’s attempt at manipulation to legal and compliance.  Compliance investigates to confirm the facts.  The trader is fired and is fully prosecuted for any criminal actions.  For this all to happen, a firm doesn’t just have to have the right rules and procedures in place, but it also needs the right culture to ensure that those rules and procedures are followed, that the bad behavior sees the light of day immediately and that the transgressors are punished in a way that is known broadly throughout the firm—that is, a clear example of the consequences is demonstrated to others.\n\nHow Can Better Incentives Help?\n\nIn my example, for matters to work properly, I think it is important that all the players—traders, compliance, risk and legal, have the right incentives to behave in the way that is appropriate and that aligns their interests with the broader interests of the firm in rooting out bad behaviors.  One way in which incentives can be shaped is through the structure of compensation.  I believe that a proper compensation system can be an important tool for enhancing culture, promoting financial stability and rebuilding the public trust in the financial industry.\n\nIncentives matter for individual behaviors and decisions in all industries, including the financial industry.  Some might argue, however, that risk-takers are drawn to finance like they are drawn to Formula One racing, and that regardless of risk or reward, these types of individuals will always want to push the boundaries.  This logic might lead one to conclude that incentives are unlikely to be an effective tool to limit excessive risk-taking and to promote more ethical behavior in the financial sector.  I disagree.  First, the degree to which an industry attracts risk-takers is not pre-ordained, but reflects the prevailing incentives in the industry.  After all, risk-takers have options.  Second, and, more importantly, incentives matter even for risk-takers.\n\nIn my speech on ending too big to fail, I stressed the importance of reducing the likelihood that large financial firms would face insolvency, as well as the need for a credible resolution plan that does not involve taxpayer money.  Compensation policies can play a useful role in reducing excessive risk-taking.  Similarly, compensation policies can complement an improved culture, and play a role in reducing unethical and fraudulent behavior.  Individuals who decide to bend the rules or to step over the line usually do this in the context of an assessment of the expected risks and rewards of their actions.\n\nThis implies that one objective should be to rebalance the scales so that the expected risks from unwanted behaviors are more likely to outweigh the expected rewards.  The expected risks are a function of the likelihood that an individual (or set of individuals) is caught and the attendant consequences.  The expected rewards include any financial and psychic benefits to the individual from the behavior if undetected.  Improved culture helps to tip the balance in the favor of better behaviors by increasing the likelihood that an individual will both feel an obligation to behave properly, and be prevented by others from carrying out bad behavior.  In addition, a strong culture can also reduce the rewards some employees may hope to enjoy.  In its simplest form, a strong culture means that individuals who get away with unethical or illegal activities will not have the satisfaction of “bragging rights” about their actions because there are no congratulations for breaking the law or outwitting compliance.  A strong culture will reinforce the simple reward of having done the right thing. A clear conscience can be a powerful reward.\n\nA well-designed compensation structure can also help favorably tip the balance by effectively extending the time horizon of senior management and material risk-takers, and by forcing them to more fully internalize the consequences of their actions.  There are two important dimensions of the structure of compensation—first, how much compensation is paid out immediately versus deferred into the future, and second, the form of the compensation that is deferred—cash, equity, equity options or debt.  For deferred compensation, the rules for how it vests and under what conditions it can be forfeited are important.  Getting the balance right is critical.  For my part, I believe that in order to improve financial stability and rebuild the public trust, more compensation in finance needs to be deferred and for longer periods.  Also, I think there needs to be a shift in the mix of deferred compensation away from equity and towards debt.\n\nThe optimal structure of deferred compensation likely differs with respect to the goals of providing incentives to support prudent risk-taking versus encouraging the right culture.  For example, consider trades that might appear to be highly profitable on a mark-to-market basis, but take some time to be closed out and for the profits to be realized in fact, not just on paper.  In this case, as long as deferred compensation is set at a horizon longer than the life of the trade, this can ensure the firm’s and the trader’s incentives are aligned and the “trader’s option” is effectively mitigated.  This component of deferred compensation could take the form of either cash or equity.\n\nHowever, in contrast to the issue of trading risk, unethical and illegal behavior may take a much longer period of time—measured in many years—to surface and to be fully resolved.  For this reason, I believe that it is also important to have a component of deferred compensation that does not begin to vest for several years.  For example, the deferral period might be five years, with uniform vesting over an additional five years.  Given recent experience, a decade would seem to be a reasonable timeframe to provide sufficient time and space for any illegal actions or violations of the firm’s culture to materialize and fines and legal penalties realized.  As I will argue below, I also believe that this longer vesting portion of the deferred compensation should be debt as opposed to equity.6\n\nI noted earlier that improving a financial firm’s culture will take sustained determination and commitment from its senior leaders.  Deferred compensation can play a useful role in reinforcing buy-in of senior leadership to this endeavor.  As I discussed last November, an important element of a Title II resolution under Dodd-Frank is that there is sufficient long-term unsecured debt at the holding company level to recapitalize a failing bank.  I indicated in my remarks that it would be useful if a meaningful component of this debt was contributed by the senior management and the firm’s material risk-takers.  That is, if a bank ran into solvency problems, this component of deferred compensation would be used to recapitalize the restructured bank.  The goal is to incent senior management and the material risk-takers to focus on maximizing the long-term “enterprise” value of the firm, not just the short-term share price.  In this framework, I would expect the relative size of the debt component of deferred compensation to increase as one moved up the management ranks to the senior managers of the firm.  That is, the individuals who have the greatest impact on a firm’s strategic direction should have the strongest incentives to maximize the firm’s long-term enterprise value.\n\nIf we have this deferred compensation structure in place for financial firms, then we can leverage it to strengthen the incentives for senior leaders to design and implement the necessary changes to improve their firm’s culture.  That is, this deferred debt compensation can be used as a “performance bond.”  Performance bonds are used in many situations such as security deposits on rental properties.  Today, when a financial firm is assessed a large fine it is paid by the shareholders of the firm.  Although senior management may own equity in the firm, their combined ownership share is likely small, and so management bears only a small fraction of the fine.  Now, having shareholders pay may create market discipline in that they have an incentive to better monitor the firm’s actions.  However, financial firms are not transparent enterprises, and it would be difficult even for a diligent shareholder to be able to know when these bad behaviors are taking place, much less to be able to take actions to prevent them.  This limits the potential effectiveness of market discipline exerted by shareholders.\n\nHow can we improve on this situation? Assume instead that a sizeable portion of the fine is now paid for out of the firm’s deferred debt compensation, with only the remaining balance paid for by shareholders.  In other words, in the case of a large fine, the senior management and the material risk-takers would forfeit their performance bond.  This would increase the financial incentive of those individuals who are best placed to identify bad activities at an early stage, or prevent them from occurring in the first place.  In addition, if paying the fine were to deplete the pool of deferred debt below a minimum required level, the solution could be to reduce the ratio of current to deferred pay until the minimum deferred compensation debt requirement is again satisfied—that is, until a new performance bond is posted.\n\nNot only would this deferred debt compensation discipline individual behavior and decision-making, but it would provide strong incentives for individuals to flag issues when problems develop.  Each individual’s ability to realize their deferred debt compensation would depend not only on their own behavior, but also on the behavior of their colleagues.  This would create a strong incentive for individuals to monitor the actions of their colleagues, and to call attention to any issues.  This could be expected to help to keep small problems from growing into larger ones.  Importantly, individuals would not be able to “opt out” of the firm as a way of escaping the problem.  If a person knew that something is amiss and decided to leave the firm, their deferred debt compensation would still be at risk.  This would reinforce the incentive for the individual to stay at the firm and to try to get the problem fixed.\n\nThis might work for senior managers, but what about those material risk-takers who are early in their careers at a firm and do not have much wealth tied up through deferred compensation to serve as an effective performance bond?  How do we provide strong incentives for these traders not to put the firm at risk by their potential illegal behavior?  In these cases, we can create the performance bond in a slightly different manner.  Individuals who enter finance have generally invested heavily to develop the specialized skills required in the field.  These skills typically have a higher return in finance than they do in any other occupation.  That is, workers in finance earn a premium relative to their next best alternative job outside of the industry.  Over the course of a career, this premium can be expected to add up to a significant sum of money.  This cumulative premium can act like a performance bond.  For this to be the case, however, an individual who is convicted of illegal activities, or who violates a firm’s code of conduct would need to face the risk of being permanently denied employment in the financial industry.  Rather than paying for the performance bond upfront, the bond is posted in terms of the privilege to continue to work in the industry.\n\nThere are several steps that can be taken to implement this concept.  The first step is to make it more difficult for employees in finance who cross ethical boundaries to be able to move from one firm to another in order to escape the consequences.  Currently, lenders who are considering making a loan to a borrower can look up the borrower’s credit score which reflects the borrower’s performance on past loans.  In a similar manner, it would be helpful if financial firms, prior to making a hiring decision, could look up a candidate’s “ethics and compliance score” that reflects the individual’s past performance at other financial firms.\n\nAlong these lines, one approach would be to create a central registry that tracks the hiring and firing of traders and other financial professionals across the industry.  There would be many details to sort out regarding how to do this in a manner that was both transparent and consistent with due process.  The database could be maintained by the official sector—specifically, by financial institution supervisors—based on information provided by supervised financial institutions.  A similar regime already exists in the broker-dealer context, in which supervised institutions are required to file U4 and U5 forms when they hire and part ways with licensed professionals.  Banking supervisors could consider whether it was appropriate to import these concepts to the banking industry.  To help support the completeness and accuracy of the filings, the filing firms could be subject to a safe harbor, akin to the civil immunity for filing a Suspicious Activity Report, so that employers do not fear liability for good faith reporting.  Under this approach, new regulations could also require that all financial institutions search the database prior to hiring any trader or financial professional; so that any prior reported events could be taken into account in the course of a hiring decision.  As I mentioned, there would, of course, need to be adequate safeguards for employees to challenge an entry, consistent with due process.\n\nFurthermore, as a complementary step to the registry, it would be helpful if individuals in finance who are convicted of an illegal activity were prohibited from future employment in the financial services industry.  Currently, Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits anyone convicted of a crime of dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering from working at an insured depository institution or bank holding company.7  One possibility could be to amend Section 19 to cover the entire financial services industry.  The precise formulation of an amendment would need to be worked out, but the application should be sufficiently broad so that it also covers asset managers, hedge funds and private equity funds.  Like the registry, a broad and permanent industry prohibition changes the time horizon for the perceived costs of misconduct—from a one-time fine, or perhaps a few years in prison, to a lifetime prohibition from earning a living in finance, regardless of the type of employer involved.  I would welcome the industry’s participation in developing this concept.\n\nConclusion   \n\nTo ensure the behavior that is required for a safe, sound and trusted financial system, we must also be effective in our role as regulators and supervisors.  As part of this, we as supervisors must continually work to improve our own cultures to ensure that we can successively carry out our responsibilities.  But it also requires good culture at the institutions that we supervise.  Supervisors simply do not have sufficient “boots on the ground” to ferret out all forms of bad behavior within a giant, global, financial institution.  Moreover, regardless what supervisors want to do, a good culture cannot simply be mandated by regulation or imposed by supervision.\n\nIn conclusion, if those of you here today as stewards of these large financial institutions do not do your part in pushing forcefully for change across the industry, then bad behavior will undoubtedly persist.  If that were to occur, the inevitable conclusion will be reached that your firms are too big and complex to manage effectively.  In that case, financial stability concerns would dictate that your firms need to be dramatically downsized and simplified so they can be managed effectively.  It is up to you to address this cultural and ethical challenge.  The consequences of inaction seem obvious to me—they are both fully appropriate and unattractive—compared to the alternative of improving the culture at the large financial firms and the behavior that stems from it.  So let’s get on with it.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n1 Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Steven Manzari, Hamid Mehran, Thomas Noone and Joseph Tracy contributed to this speech.\n\n2 Saabira Chaudhuri, “Banks’ Legal Tab Still Running Higher.” Wall Street Journal, July 23, 2014.\n\n3 O’Toole and Bennis, “What’s Needed Next: A Culture of Candor.” Harvard Business Review, June 2009.\n\n4 Supervisory Letter SR 12-17.\n\n5 Restoring Confidence in Reference Rates\n\n6 Given the length of the vesting of this component, firms might want to allow this vesting to continue even if an individual leaves the firm. That is, one may not want an individual’s accumulated deferred debt compensation to act as a friction to job mobility. However, even if an individual leaves the firm, the debt compensation would still be at risk of forfeiture.\n\n7 See 12 U.S.C. § 1829."

        "title": "Opening Remarks at the Workshop on Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry",
        "content": "Let me start by welcoming all of you to this workshop to discuss the issue of culture in the financial services industry.  This is an issue that has been on my mind for a long time.  In my view, the industry is not close to where it needs to be, and failure to address this situation should not be viewed as a viable option.  \n\nIn a speech last November, I argued that ending “too big to fail” is a prerequisite for ensuring financial stability and sustainable economic growth.1  For one thing, the excessive risk-taking undertaken by large and complex financial institutions was an important element of the financial crisis. For another, in terms of culture within these institutions, it doesn’t seem like things today are much better.  An “apparent lack of respect for law, regulation and the public trust” persists. I said that I believe that this reflects “deep-seated cultural and ethical failures.”\n\nWhy did I raise this issue, and why in a speech about too big to fail? Just as excessive risk taking can cause more damage when it occurs in large, complex and interconnected financial firms; the consequences of cultural and ethical failures in these same firms are also more severe and harmful to the economy. I suggested that breaking up these large financial institutions did not seem to be the most efficient means of making the financial system more stable. But, this view was predicated on the assumptions that both the too big to fail problem and the culture problem could be solved. Correcting one but not the other would still leave the financial sector and the economy vulnerable. Or, put another way, fixing the culture problem in the finance industry is also an imperative for achieving financial stability.\n\nToday’s workshop is a part of that effort. I thank all of you for your willingness to participate in what I expect will be frank and informative discussions.  Culture is not an easy thing to pin down and talk about.  Establishing and maintaining the culture of an institution takes work and constant effort, and is a journey as much as a destination—you will never be quite sure if you have gotten exactly where you wanted, but you have to stay committed to the path.  I think we’ll find that there are many different elements that have contributed to the current state of affairs and, likewise, an array of tools that will have to be brought to bear to move the industry’s culture to where it needs to be. \n\nThis morning will be aimed at putting some parameters around the problem—by looking at structural changes that have occurred in the financial sector, and at how compensation and other incentives have evolved over time. This afternoon will be focused on solutions—both those that are being led by the industry itself, and those that are available to the government through enforcement.  \n\nSo let’s get started.  I am now very honored to introduce Sir David Walker as our keynote speaker today.  David, as chairman of Barclays, a longtime member of the Group of Thirty, and in several other official capacities, has been at the forefront of corporate governance issues and efforts to reform of the industry.  David, we look forward to hearing your thoughts.  \n\n1 Ending Too Big to Fail"

        "content": "Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be here today at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).  It is always a pleasure to speak with members of the different communities that make up our region, and it is particularly exciting to have the opportunity to speak with the students and faculty here at the Lally School of Management and Technology.  Much of my day in the Albany area has been focused on the intersection of technology, the workforce and innovation, so it is a pleasure to speak with the people who are the future leaders in this fascinating evolution.\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy. Earlier on this trip, I met with government and business leaders to learn about some of the challenges the region faces as well as the collaborative efforts being taken to further economic development.  I listened to community leaders describe the problems in affordable housing, workforce development and employment facing many in the lower income communities.  I was also impressed by the potential innovations in energy production at the GE Global Research Center.  These could have large consequences not only in the United States but in developing nations as well.\n\nWe plan these trips so I can meet with a diverse array of representatives.  This allows me to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the region and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns. This is our fifth trip to Upstate New York in the past few years. Other recent trips have taken us to Northern New Jersey, the boroughs of New York City, Long Island and Fairfield County, Connecticut.\n\nMy outreach trips complement the ongoing efforts of the New York Fed to assess conditions in the Upstate New York economy and throughout our District. We monitor economic performance on a monthly basis through special indexes we have created and through our monthly surveys of New York State manufacturers and business leaders in the non-manufacturing sector. We also get important input on economic conditions from our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members play important roles in the Upstate economy. We conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  The results of one particular poll led us to develop a series of clinics for small businesses to help them take the next step to access capital and identify new sources of funding.  We have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of U.S. households and students. More recently, we extended this national analysis to include more detail about the states in our district, including a profile of households in New York State and the Albany area.  We look at how much consumers are borrowing, what they are borrowing for and if they are experiencing difficulties in making their payments. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are always eager to engage with students, and our commitment to the region includes a number of educational programs worth highlighting. First, Math x Economics, which encourages students attending schools serving lower-income families to consider a career in finance or economics. And, second, our yearly Fed Challenge competitions, in which teams of students from high schools and colleges in the District take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate what the appropriate next step is for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues fully engaged with the communities we represent.\n\nLet me now review recent developments in the national and regional economy, and at the end of my talk, I will be happy to answer questions you may have about the economic outlook.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.2 percent compound annual rate. Several times over that period it looked as though growth was breaking out on the upside, but each time such hopes were dashed.\n\nWe are again at a similar junction.  A wide array of economic indicators now suggest that growth in the U.S. has picked up and is widely expected to be around 3 percent during the second half of 2014 and in 2015. \n\nThese forecasts seem quite reasonable to me and are consistent with views I have expressed in the past.  Various “headwinds” have been impeding economic activity, but some of these forces have gradually subsided, allowing the substantially improved underlying fundamentals to exert themselves more forcefully. For example, fiscal restraint, which was a big factor last year, has subsided and is likely to disappear altogether next year.  Credit availability has also improved, reflecting healthier bank balance sheets and improving job and income prospects for prospective borrowers.  In addition, the excess supply of housing built up over the boom of the previous decade has been worked off, and both home prices and rents suggest that the supply of housing is not keeping pace with demand.\n\nThis has allowed supportive financial market conditions, spurred, in part, by a very accommodative monetary policy, to shine through.  As a result, aggregate household net worth has climbed relative to income and consumer balance sheets are healthier.  On the business side,  financial markets conditions suggest that risk aversion has  subsided,  leading to some firming in business investment spending. All of these developments help boost the confidence of consumers and businesses that this consensus forecast will in fact unfold.\n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will be either weaker or stronger than the point forecast.  While I believe that the risks around this consensus forecast are reasonably well balanced, I also believe that the likelihood that growth will be substantially stronger than the point forecast is probably relatively low. \n\nSeveral factors lead me to this conclusion. First, despite the fact that the household deleveraging process appears to be largely over and aggregate household net worth has been restored to pre-crisis levels, consumer spending is not as strong as one might expect given these conditions.  As a result, the personal saving rate is currently significantly above what the historical relationship between household net worth and personal saving would suggest.  There are several potential explanations for this development.  Access to credit, while certainly improved, is probably still not fully restored, particularly for those with less than sterling credit histories.  It is also quite likely that, in the wake of the deep recession and relatively sluggish growth of the past five years, households have higher than normal levels of precautionary saving. \n\nAnother reason for seeing less than normal upside risk for consumer spending is that the growth stimulus from the consumer durable goods cycle is likely to weaken going forward. For example, sales of light-weight motor vehicles have steadily recovered from a low of 9.4 million units (annual rate) at the depths of the recession to an average of nearly 17 million units over the three months ending in September.  The fastest pace of sales in the previous business cycle was 17 million units for all of 2005. While there may be some additional upside potential to these sales given the quite long period over which they were depressed relative to fundamentals, it seems unlikely that they will continue to grow at the rate they have over the past few years. \n\nHousing is another area where the upside risks are likely to be less than what we might expect under more normal conditions.  We have seen an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years. However, starts of single-family homes continue to languish at relatively low levels despite the fact that home prices have risen substantially over the past two years and mortgage rates remain quite low.  Mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse and mortgage credit to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  There is nothing on the horizon that would lead me to believe that situation will change in a material way any time soon.  \n\nLastly, over the past few months the exchange value of the dollar has appreciated while growth prospects of key trading partners, particularly the Euro Area, have dimmed.  Of course, the appreciation of the dollar is likely due in part to increasing confidence that growth prospects in the U.S. have improved.  Therefore, this development does not mean we should abandon the consensus forecast. Rather, as with the other issues I have discussed, I view this development as limiting the upside risk to that forecast. \n\nDespite the limiting factors discussed above, the pace of growth envisioned in the consensus forecast implies that overall labor market conditions will continue to improve. But there is a great deal of uncertainty about the resulting path of the unemployment rate, with some forecasters expecting a fairly steep decline to around 5 percent by the end of 2015, while others anticipate a much more gradual decline.  \n\nIn addition to how strong output grows, the ultimate path of the unemployment rate will also depend on the behavior of productivity growth and the labor force participation rate.  The labor force participation rate has declined a great deal since 2007, the previous cyclical peak, due to a combination of demographic factors and protracted cyclical weakness in labor demand. The behavior of the participation rate and its likely future path is an issue we continue to monitor and study intently.  While I still believe that the participation rate could move back up again as the demand for labor strengthens, I am less confident about this than earlier as the downward trend in participation rates has persisted even as the labor market has improved.  What I can say with greater certainty is that there still is a significant underutilization of labor market resources.  I come to this conclusion after assessing many labor market indicators, not just the level of the unemployment rate.  For example, the fact that the rate of growth of labor compensation costs remains so subdued is consistent with this conclusion.   \n\nWith respect to prices, inflation has been running somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  The latest Congressional Budget Office forecast has the four-quarter percent change of the core PCE deflator moving up from 1½ percent in the second quarter of 2014 to 1.9 percent by the fourth quarter of 2015. As with growth, I find this forecast to be quite reasonable, but would argue that the risks are on the side that inflation moves upwards more slowly than this. First, the appreciation of the dollar and weakening of foreign growth prospects that I mentioned earlier both act to dampen inflation pressures.  Second, energy production in the U.S. is rising much faster than I would have guessed just a few years ago, helping to reduce energy prices which in turn reduces a wide range of production and distribution costs.  Lastly, I would note that research suggests that inflation expectations play a very important role in the inflation process. Those expectations remain well anchored at the present time, despite concerns by some that the amount of slack in the economy has declined substantially.  I am quite confident that those expectations will remain well anchored in the future, limiting the increase in inflation set in motion by faster growth and further reductions in slack. \n\nSo what does this imply for monetary policy?  We have made substantial progress with respect to the labor market outlook since we began our current program of large scale asset purchases in 2012.  Because it looks very likely that the program will have fulfilled its objectives, I expect to support a decision to end the asset purchase program at the end of this month.  At the same time, it still is premature to begin to raise interest rates—the labor market still has too much slack and the inflation rate is too low.  The consensus view is that lift-off will take place around the middle of next year.  That seems like a reasonable view to me.   But, again, it is just a forecast.  What we do will depend on the flow of economic news and how that affects the economic outlook.  For example, firmer growth, higher inflation, and a more rapid tightening of the labor market could cause us to move earlier.  Conversely, should economic growth disappoint, the timing of lift-off could be pushed later.    \n\nI hope the economy cooperates.  If it does and lift-off begins sometime next year, that will be something to be very excited about.  It will signal that the economy is finally getting healthier and that the Fed is getting closer to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. That would be very good news even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.  \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me now turn to economic conditions a bit closer to home. While Upstate New York outperformed the nation during the Great Recession, it has now returned to its more typical pattern of modest growth. This is not unexpected as many regions in the Northeast have tended to grow more slowly in recent decades as the population has shifted to other parts of the country and as jobs in the once dominant manufacturing industry have diminished. That being said, some parts of the region are really struggling: Syracuse, Utica, Binghamton and Elmira have all yet to see a meaningful recovery in employment, which is troubling.\n\nThe Capital region, on the other hand, is a true bright spot. While Upstate New York as a whole has gained back only a little more than half of the jobs lost during the Great Recession, Albany is close to regaining all of the jobs that were lost. Though the Capital region’s public sector has exerted some downward pressure on job growth during the recovery, the education and health care sectors have been an ongoing source of stability and strength for the region. Employment in the education sector has climbed nearly 25 percent since the end of the recession, an increase of around 5,000 jobs, and the health care sector has added about 3,000 jobs.\n\nAnd there’s some especially good news to report from the Capital region’s manufacturing sector: jobs are growing, and growing quite strongly—a testament to the success of the area’s burgeoning high tech sector. Since the recovery began, the area has added over 4,000 manufacturing jobs, many of which are tied to computers and electronics. That’s an increase of nearly 25 percent. This pace of job growth is four times as great as the national pace. In fact, there are now more people employed in the Capital region’s manufacturing sector than before the recession. Not many places can say that, and this is certainly not true for the nation as a whole.\n\nIn part, the success of local manufacturing reflects the presence of strong partnerships between industry and higher education. These cooperative arrangements, which help in the creation, development and commercialization of new products and processes, drive innovation and put local companies at the leading edge of technology. Moreover, these partnerships directly support local jobs. Not only are students gaining real world experience by working in shared facilities while they are in school, but strong connections between local businesses and higher education institutions help workers train for jobs that are available, and help employers find the skilled workers they need. During my last trip to the region, I saw firsthand how universities and companies can successfully work together during my visits to the State University of New York Nanotech Center and the production facilities at Global Foundries.\n\nOf course, RPI has a long history of developing cutting edge technologies and fostering start-up companies. RPI’s Emerging Ventures Ecosystem initiative provides an excellent example of how a leading university can help local firms access the knowledge and intellectual property provided by its faculty and students. These types of collaborations are a key ingredient to improving the competitiveness of local businesses and increasing the relevance of the universities to the communities they serve.  We should take every opportunity to exploit these partnerships as much as possible to unleash their full potential. The strong foundation that has already been built has clearly been successful, and I expect these partnerships will support the region’s economic vitality going forward. \n\nCollege Graduates Finding Jobs\n\nFinally, I know that many of you here today are students, and you may be concerned about your ability to find a good job upon graduation. There is no doubt that this is a difficult time to be graduating from college and starting your career. While finding a job has gotten a bit easier over the past few years, finding a good job can still be a challenge. Indeed, research we’ve conducted at the New York Fed finds that underemployment among recent college graduates has continued to climb even as the unemployment rate has fallen. This is a troubling trend, and one we are actively trying to better understand.\n\nDespite the challenges now facing recent college graduates, I want to assure you that the value of a college degree remains high. While the Great Recession and its aftermath have made it more difficult to find a job out of college these past few years, those without a college degree have had an even tougher time. Students who major in technical fields—such as engineering, mathematics and computer science—have tended to have a much easier time finding a good job and have earned a high return on their educational investment.  Although it is true that the labor market has been difficult for college graduates in recent years, I am confident that most of you will find good jobs, especially as the labor market continues to improve.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I would now be happy to take some questions."

        "title": "Restoring Confidence in Reference Rates",
        "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.1\n\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on the development and use of reference rates for financial market contracts.  This is a story of both spectacular success, and at the same time, spectacular failure.\n\nTo borrow from Charles Dickens:2\n\n“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity.…”\n\nWhile Dickens was writing about events leading up to a political crisis, his words also are apt with respect to our recent financial crisis.\n\nOver a period of just a few decades, reference rates grew greatly in terms of their role and importance in financial markets.  For example, the use of one of the best known reference rates—the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR—has soared, so that it is now referenced by approximately $300 trillion dollars of financial contracts.  Reference rates have become a ubiquitous but largely hidden fiber in the fabric of financial markets.  They play a critical role in making financial markets more efficient by reducing information frictions, lowering transactions costs and mitigating the moral hazard.\n\nAt the same time, as recent enforcement actions and criminal investigations have made all too clear, some of these reference rates have been systematically manipulated by individuals at key financial institutions.  The assumption that the design in how these rates are constructed would be resistant to attempts at manipulation has turned out to be wrong, and the belief in the integrity of these rates has turned out to be misplaced.\n\nWhat this means should be obvious to all of us.  Reform is required if we are to restore confidence in the financial system.  In my remarks today, I will discuss the outlines of such a reform including those important steps that are already underway, and those steps that still must be taken.  As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe most recognized and prevalent of the reference interest rates is the London Interbank Offered Rate, typically referred to as LIBOR, which measures the cost of unsecured, interbank borrowing across different currencies and tenors.  The development of LIBOR goes back to the rapid expansion of the Eurodollar market in London beginning in the 1970s.  This was a market that developed, in part, as a means of circumventing the Regulation Q deposit interest rate ceilings in the United States.  This market provided a source of funds for international banks, and securities that referenced Eurodollars were issued and became actively traded.  This growing market gave birth to a new financial market product—the interest rate swap—to help investors and borrowers to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their financial exposures.\n\nIn 1984, as part of the “Big Bang” in U.K. financial markets, the British Bankers Association (BBA) assumed responsibility for developing a set of standards for these interest rate swaps.  One of these standards was for the reference rates used to fix the settlement of the contracts—this led to the birth of LIBOR.3   Additional standardization followed, including establishing  a fixed schedule of settlement dates for these contracts.  This further increased the liquidity in these contracts, but also significantly concentrated the timing of settlement activity.  At the same time, new reference rates were developed that extended the LIBOR-style methodology to many different currencies.\n\nHow LIBOR was designed to work\n\nLIBOR is a set of reference rates that measure large banks’ funding costs in different currencies and at different maturities.  For example, U.S. dollar LIBOR measures how expensive it is for a large bank to borrow U.S. dollars in the unsecured interbank market at different maturities.  For each currency, there is a designated panel of contributing banks that each submit an estimate of its own borrowing costs for each maturity.  For each panel, these estimates are aggregated to form LIBOR.  The LIBOR rates are then used as a basis for financial contracts ranging from adjustable rate mortgages to interest rate swaps and futures.\n\nTo make sure that the submitting banks have sufficient expertise in the funding trends in a particular currency, it is important that they be actively involved in that market.  For this reason, the contributing banks are the large banks that have been active in the London market and the panel of submitting banks varies across currencies.  The LIBOR reference rates were intended to capture on a daily basis borrowing costs along each currency-maturity combination based on the experience of the submitting banks.\n\nThe actual process for fixing LIBOR each day is quite straightforward.  Each morning the submitters from each contributing bank answer the following hypothetical question: “At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers at a reasonable market size just prior to 11 a.m.?”  The transmitted submissions are ordered by rate for each currency and maturity pair.  The ordered rates for U.S. dollar LIBOR, for example, are then trimmed by generally dropping the top and bottom 25 percent of submissions to remove any influence of outliers.  The average of the remaining individual submissions is calculated and then posted.  Prior to the recent reforms, all submissions were immediately made public.\n\nThe aim of the LIBOR-setting process has been to create a set of reference rates that would be credible and would generate robust measures of bank funding costs across a wide range of market conditions.  The credibility was based on the borrowing experience from the submitting banks represented through their submitters—those individuals responsible for actually submitting an answer each day to the administrator.  The potential conflicts of interest between the submitters and traders within the bank were typically handled through internal policies such as the presence of information barriers that were intended to prevent sensitive information from flowing between the traders and LIBOR submitters.  The robustness to market conditions would be maintained even in periods of market stress or a lack of transactions by the reliance on the hypothetical question instead of the use of actual transaction data.  That is, even if during stressed times when trading became sporadic in a particular currency-maturity pair, all submitters could still answer the question even if their bank did not happen to engage in any trades on that particular day in that particular pairing.   This ensured a large sample size even during stressed market conditions.  The trimming of the sample helped to minimize the influence of any outlier submission, but also limited the ability for any one submitting bank to influence the posted rate.\n\nAs is clear from the hypothetical question, LIBOR is meant to capture a bank’s cost of unsecured borrowing.  This means that the reference rate will reflect not only a risk-free component, but also counterparty credit risk related to the specific borrower.  This turns out to be important for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the growing popularity and liquidity of LIBOR indexed contracts led to an expanded use of LIBOR to circumstances in which the credit risk of large banks was not clearly relevant.   For example, a speculative position about the future of short-term rates is predominately based on one’s view about the path of short-term interest rates, rather than how bank counterparty risk might change and affect borrowing costs.  Despite this shortcoming, LIBOR remained popular because the benefit of its deeper market liquidity was viewed as more important than the added complication that LIBOR included an element of counterparty risk.4\n\nSecond, variations in LIBOR submissions across the submitting banks at a point in time for a given maturity should mainly reflect differences in the counterparty credit risk, since the risk-free component is common to all submitters.  This is important because it means that variations in submissions may be interpreted as reflecting variations in underlying counterparty risk.  This is particularly important when the LIBOR submissions process is transparent and the market is under stress, which was the case during the financial crisis. \n\nHow LIBOR worked in practice\n\nNow that I have described how LIBOR was intended to work in concept, how did it work in practice?  It turns out that unappreciated design weaknesses and incentive structures at certain large submitting banks, in combination with the phenomenal success of reference rates, undermined the system.  Conflicts and problems emerged both at the bank level and at the individual submitter level.  Investigations are on-going to determine the scale and full extent of these problems, but I would like to discuss a few of the well-documented problems.\n\nLet’s start at the level of banks that submit estimates.  The enforcement actions and investigations into potential LIBOR manipulation have shown that, at times, individual institutions faced incentives to understate their hypothetical borrowing rates in order to avoid the perception that they might have higher counterparty credit risk.  Some of the reported misdeeds occurred during the heart of the financial crisis when market participants faced considerable uncertainty about the health of particular institutions.  This uncertainty was manifest in a wide range of financial market prices for financial institutions—low and volatile equity prices, record CDS spreads and greater variation in borrowing costs across different LIBOR-submitting banks.  At that time, the BBA was publishing firm-specific contributions to LIBOR from submitting banks.  Given this publication process, some of the submitting banks reportedly became concerned about reporting a rate that would suggest that they were being treated by the market as a greater counterparty credit risk than their peers.  Accordingly, some banks were alleged to have lowered their LIBOR submission below their actual likely borrowing rate to avoid the stigma associated with posting a higher borrowing rate and the possibility that their funding costs could increase as a result.\n\nConflicts also reportedly abounded at the level of the individual submitters.  Again, these highlighted profound compliance problems at some of the submitting banks.  As I noted earlier, the intent was that the expertise of the submitter would be insulated from any internal pressures by the informational barriers within the submitting banks.  The hope was that these informational barriers separating the submitters from the traders were thick and impenetrable.  The investigations into LIBOR manipulation found that the reality was that they were often paper thin and porous.\n\nWe have learned that false reporting and manipulative behavior was pervasive across firms and over time, took many forms and was often conducted in a nonchalant manner.  This has been well-documented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in their published findings.  For example, interest rate swap traders routinely asked colleagues to submit rates with an explicit goal to have the adjusted submission benefit the value of specific derivatives positions they held.  As an illustration, investigations discovered that one “Senior Yen Trader” directly or indirectly made at least 800 requests in writing on UBS’s email and chat systems to their submitter.5  Requests often had a casual matter of fact nature to them.  To illustrate, an exchange in September 2007 from a trader at UBS to the submitter went as follows.6\n\n“Hi … could really do with a low 1M [one month] over the next few days as have 17.5m [million] fixings if ok with you?”\n\nSubmitting banks often facilitated this type of behavior—in some cases derivatives traders and submitters sat on the same desk, while in others the submitters were themselves traders, both circumstances obviously representing conflicts of interest.  Other investigations documented that traders at one bank would often shout across the trading desk to fellow traders to confirm that there were no conflicting requests before they sent their requests to their submitter.7\n\nThe investigations also found that not only were there conflicts within the submitting banks, but there were also active efforts by traders to collude across banks to affect the posted rates.  At times, the traders at the different banks might have similar positions and therefore a common interest to push the posted rate in particular direction.  In other times, cooperation could be incentivized through the use of “wash” trades that generated no profit or loss, but allowed the trader to generate commissions.\n\nWhy did this go so wrong?\n\nAs I discussed earlier, LIBOR setting involves a group of banks answering a hypothetical question.  This seemingly straightforward question actually embeds a good deal of ambiguity and room for potentially manipulative actions.  First, it is a hypothetical question—not what rate did you borrow at that morning, but what rate do you think you could borrow at.  This potential disconnect from actual borrowing activity builds in from the beginning a certain amount of judgment and room for manipulation.  Second, some of the parameters—“reasonable market size” or “just prior to 11 a.m.”—also allow for subjective interpretation.  This type of judgment is not inherently a problem, but it does open the door for improper behavior and also makes transgressions more difficult to identify.\n\nAt the same time, and partly in response to the lessons learned during the financial crisis, patterns of bank funding began to shift away from unsecured funding to secured funding markets.  Investors and other market participants grew to prefer holding specific collateral against their loans—even very short-term loans—than just trusting in the ongoing viability of the borrower.  This shift had substantive implications for money markets and the LIBOR fixing model, which was based on the assumption that there would always be regular activity in unsecured interbank funding markets.  As those markets dried up—in some cases there were essentially no transactions for longer-dated tenors—it became harder for banks to ground their LIBOR submissions in actual, observable transactions.  This put a greater premium on a submitter’s judgment, which increased the risk of further abuse and manipulation. \n\nWe have learned as well that compensation and hiring practices also helped to undermine the integrity of the reporting regime.  For example, we have seen that compensation and promotion within a bank are often tied to a trader’s market share and profitability.  In addition, traders often move between firms so having a network of external contacts and being viewed as a team player could help to support job mobility.  Consequently, one can conclude that even the loss of a job is not necessarily a permanent setback, and that market participants with allegations of improper behavior could potentially move on to other firms with the expectation that they would generate revenue and profits for their new employer.\n\nThese incentives were amplified by the structure of the markets that underlie the setting of LIBOR and those that use LIBOR.  The interbank cash borrowing market that LIBOR references is very small relative to the enormous markets that use LIBOR, for example interest rate derivatives.  The standardization of settlement dates further concentrated trading activity.  In this type of environment, relatively small changes in LIBOR submissions—either because the actual borrowing costs fluctuate or a submitting bank intentionally misreports its submissions—can have substantive effects on a trader’s profitability because the trader can hold large derivatives or futures positions that reference the cash LIBOR rate at the time these contracts settle.\n\nFinally, and I think perhaps most importantly, the questionable behavioral norms in the industry—along with the weak control environments and compliance processes—that were uncovered during the investigations, exacerbated and facilitated the misalignment of incentives that are specific to LIBOR.  It is a sad state of affairs if unethical behavior is socialized among new traders with the explanation that this is business as usual, and, if compliance and risk management are inadequate as a counterweight to prevent or identify wrong-doing.  It is untenable if people working in compliance and risk are treated as second-class citizens relative to the firms’ revenue generators.\n\nThe Official Sector Response\n\nThe international regulatory community began to address these issues when the U.K. government published the Wheatley Review8 in September 2012.  The Review recommended a ten-point plan, subsequently accepted in full by the U.K. government, for comprehensive reform of LIBOR.  This led to many changes including the statutory regulation of the administration and submission process with respect to LIBOR, the selection of a new administrator for LIBOR, new governance and oversight regimes for the administrator and submission guidelines as well as a code of conduct for submitters.  The BBA, the former administrator for LIBOR, for example, eliminated publication of certain currency and tenor rates and delayed the publication of bank-specific submissions.  Perhaps most importantly, LIBOR-related activities are now subject to formal regulation and supervision in the U.K.\n\nI support the changes initiated by the U.K. government and believe they have substantially strengthened LIBOR.  That said, I also believe that more work remains to be done to broaden the definition of LIBOR so that it represents the reality of new funding patterns for banks, and to also tie submissions more closely and systematically to observable transactions.\n\nA second notable development was the publication of an international set of principles for financial benchmarks developed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions9(IOSCO) in 2013.  These principles include a set of 19 specific standards across governance, benchmark quality, methodology and accountability that have emerged as the international standard.  IOSCO has rightly focused on tying benchmarks more closely to observable, arms-length transactions.  While a pure transactions-based rate will not solve all problems for all benchmarks, this is an important step toward eliminating excessive reliance on expert judgment.\n\nAs part of the international reform efforts, the Federal Reserve played a lead role in a set of recommendations for the reform of reference interest rates produced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB).  Former Governor Jeremy Stein, followed by Governor Jay Powell, co-chaired a working group with Martin Wheatley of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  This working group was charged with reviewing existing interest rate benchmarks, and for establishing and guiding a group of market participants to identify the feasibility and viability of adopting alternative reference rates. \n\nThe FSB report10 was released in July and Governor Powell11 has recently described the Federal Reserve’s plans to support the two primary components of the reform of LIBOR.  First, we are considering, in cooperation with the LIBOR administrator and other members of the official sector, ways to broaden the definition of LIBOR to more adequately represent current patterns of bank funding and to anchor it more firmly in observable transactions.  Second, we believe it is important for market participants to have access to a range of appropriately created and governed reference rates that best suit their particular business needs.  For example, some activities such as interest rate derivatives might be better served with a risk-free or near risk-free reference rate, rather than one that embeds a bank credit risk component.\n\nI would like to emphasize three points in support of the FSB recommendations and our own efforts.  First, the FSB recommendations make clear that there is not one single path for all jurisdictions to achieve the common objective of more robust and resilient reference rates.  Rather, each jurisdiction must take into account its own specific institutional, legal and market practices and arrive at its own best solution.  In the U.S., I believe it is important to identify alternative reference rates that are grounded in a strong governance framework as laid out in the IOSCO principles and that are supported by market transactions.  This brings me to my second point—given a set of robust reference rates that meet IOSCO standards, the choice among these reference rates should be left to market participants who can best identify the specific rate that is most appropriate for a specific business need.  Third, the Federal Reserve is committed to working with market participants of all kinds—dealers, end users, legal and accounting experts—to help develop robust reference rates that meet the needs of all types of market participants.\n\nIn addition to these specific efforts around improving and finding alternative benchmarks, the New York Fed is sponsoring other efforts related to the reform of market practices and benchmark rates.  The Foreign Exchange Committee (FXC) and Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), for example, are two groups of senior market practitioners sponsored by the New York Fed that are working within their markets to identify best practices for trading and behavior related to benchmark rates.  Both groups also have published broader sets of best practices for the foreign exchange markets, and for Treasury, agency debt and agency MBS markets.  I would ask all market participants to ensure that these and other best practices guide the behavior that we should expect from participants in financial markets.\n\nThis will not be easy, but I believe restoring confidence in reference rates is achievable and will greatly enhance the robustness and resilience of our financial system.  I have focused here on the reform efforts around LIBOR, which is only one reference rate, albeit one that is widely used and a core part of our financial system.  But, the need for stronger governance and more accountability spreads much further within the set of benchmark rates, and further to encompass a wide range of practices within the financial system.  For example, accusations have recently surfaced related to business practices within foreign exchange markets.  While the concerns are technically very different than the practices uncovered around LIBOR submissions, the common theme is the willingness of a small number of market participants to behave improperly and contribute to a decline in confidence in the integrity of benchmark rates specifically and of major financial institutions more generally.\n\nNext Steps\n\nI have discussed some of the observed problems in major reference rates that reflect egregious personal behavior.  Some individuals responded to poorly-designed incentives and weak controls at some of the largest financial institutions.  The regulatory community has already taken important steps to mitigate those concerns and real progress has been made.  While this has helped to restore some of the integrity of particular reference rates, such as LIBOR, more work needs to be done before confidence in these rates are put on a firmer foundation.\n\nI’ll conclude by emphasizing two of the next steps that I think are most essential for the successful reform of LIBOR.  First, the definition of LIBOR should be broadened so that it more accurately reflects the observed funding patterns of large banks and puts the rate on a broader, more stable base of observable transactions.  The LIBOR administrator is actively considering ways to do this while remaining true to the spirit of LIBOR and how it is used in financial contracts.  Accomplishing this will make markets that need a reference rate that embodies bank credit risk more robust and resilient and will strengthen the financial system.\n\nSecond, we still face the problem that the reference rate for a large stock of derivatives contracts is based on a relatively small, underlying cash market.  This means there still is a powerful incentive for individuals to attempt to manipulate the rate for their own gains.  One promising solution, outlined in Governor Powell’s recent speech on reference rates, is to work with market participants to find an alternative reference rate that is based on a deeper underlying cash market and that meets the needs of all market participants.  Of course, any rate that serves as a critical financial benchmark must meet the principles for good governance and production outlined by IOSCO.  \n\nThis combination—a more robust and resilient LIBOR for transactions that require a reference rate with a bank credit risk component and the development of an alternative reference rate for transactions like interest rate derivatives that don’t—will strengthen our financial system and help undo some of the damage caused by earlier transgressions.  But this is only a necessary and not a sufficient set of conditions.  To achieve the outcome desired, financial institutions also need to have in place the appropriate incentives and controls.\n\nThank you for your attention.

        "title": "Welcoming Remarks at Workshop on the Risks of Wholesale Funding",
        "content": "It is a pleasure to welcome you to the New York Fed today to discuss the important issue of wholesale funding.1\n\nAs you all know, the financial system plays an essential role in modern economies, and liquidity is in turn critical to the functioning of the financial system. Because financial intermediation is critical to economic activity and intermediation is dependent on funding and liquidity, disruption to funding and liquidity can cause severe damage to the economy. The experience of recent years revealed serious flaws in the system. Risk was mispriced and there was a build-up of excesses before the crisis. Structural weaknesses in the financial system then amplified the effect of the sharp decline in U.S. house prices, and the result was a widespread financial crisis and a deep recession both here and abroad.\n\nThe extensive use by financial firms of short-term wholesale funding was one critical factor in the crisis. Not only did this reliance on short-term funding create the potential for a firm to fail in an extraordinarily rapid manner when faced with a loss of market confidence, but it also served as a channel through which the effects of those failures were widely propagated throughout the broader financial system. \n\nI will focus my brief remarks on describing the structural vulnerabilities associated with short-term wholesale funding, laying the groundwork for our discussions at today's workshop.\n\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System. \n\nAs this audience knows, in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis, the global financial system underwent a rapid transformation. During this period, there was a shift from bank-based financial intermediation to capital markets-based financial intermediation, and an increase in the scale and complexity of securitization activities.\n\nIn the pre-crisis period, the growth of securitization was accompanied by an increasing reliance on short-term funds raised in wholesale markets to finance securities and activities essential to securitization. This ranged from the use of repo funding to finance inventories of securities held for market-making purposes to the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by conduits created to acquire and hold securities.\n\nBoth demand and supply factors drove the increased use of short-term wholesale finance. On the supply side, the growth of savings from corporations and institutional investors in need of deposit-like products in which to place their cash balances created a plentiful source of funds.  These products were viewed as \"safe\" since, after all, the funds were only exposed for a short period of time, and in the case of repo, they were secured by collateral. On the demand side, setting aside any possible instabilities in this funding source, it was more profitable to use shorter-term funds to finance longer-term assets.\n\nIn fact, the growing reliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets increased liquidity and maturity mismatch risk in the financial system. This was particularly dangerous because many of the assets being financed were structured-credit products, some of which were opaque, difficult to value and illiquid. In periods of market stress, these features increase the run risk by funding providers.\n\nShort-term funding of longer-term assets is inherently unstable, especially in the presence of information and coordination problems.  It can be rational for a funding provider to supply funds on a short-term basis, reasoning that it can exit if there is any uncertainty over the firm's continued ability to roll over its funding from other sources. But, if the use of short-term funding becomes sufficiently widespread, the firm's roll-over risk increases. In this situation, there is a strong incentive for each lender to \"run\" early if there is any uncertainty that could undermine the borrower's ability to continue to roll over its funding from other sources. This is the case even if the provider of funds believes that the borrower would remain solvent as long as it retained access to funding on normal terms. The cost of running when it turns out to be unnecessary is small relative to the cost of not running when it turns out to be prudent.\n\nOf course, this insight is not a new one. Prior to the establishment of a lender of last resort and retail deposit insurance for banks—which came with the quid pro quo of prudential regulation—bank runs were a regular and disruptive feature of our financial system. These innovations solved the coordination problem and stabilized this source of funding.\n\nWhat was new prior to the crisis was the extent to which maturity transformation and financial intermediation had migrated outside of commercial banks. The growth of what we call the shadow banking system occurred largely without the types of safeguards—robust prudential regulation, deposit insurance, lender of last resort—that have safeguarded the commercial banking system from the types of widespread panics and runs that are capable of destabilizing the financial system. The systemic risk created by this gap in coverage was not well recognized by regulators or the private sector prior to the global financial crisis. Market participants had little incentive to internalize the negative externality of the run-risk created by their collective choice of finance, and they made erroneous assumptions about the liquidity of asset markets and the capacity and willingness of banks to distribute central bank liquidity to the wider financial system during periods of stress. \n\nBecause the boom years resulted in strong earnings, low price volatility and few credit losses, firms were able to operate at extreme levels of leverage. When housing prices started to decline, the vulnerabilities of this type of business model soon became apparent.\n\nHeavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding exposed the system to a series of intertwined downward spirals in asset and funding markets. This spread in waves. It began in the market for asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by off-balance-sheet conduits, and spread via auction-rate securities to the repo, money market and financial commercial paper markets that formed the core financing for market-based financial intermediation.\n\nInitial declines in asset prices especially for mortgage related assets forced leveraged holders with maturity mismatches to sell assets. This increased price volatility and further reduced the value of the assets that collateralized other firms' borrowings. Higher volatility led banks and secured lenders to raise margins, while concern about counterparty risk and their own funding needs made banks reluctant to on-lend liquidity. \n\nThe resulting higher margins on repo and increased collateral calls due to credit ratings downgrades reduced the quantity of assets that could be financed in repo markets and elsewhere, prompting further asset sales. As wholesale investors started to exit, this set in motion a bad dynamic—a fire sale of assets that cut into earnings and capital. This increased the incentives of investors to run and for banks to hoard liquidity against the risk that they could themselves face a run. This downward spiral of fire sales and funding runs was a key feature of the financial crisis.\n\nThe inherent fragility of short-term wholesale funding was greatly aggravated by certain institutional shortcomings in these markets, particularly in the structure of the tri-party repo system and the U.S. money market mutual fund business. \n\nThrough the tri-party repo market, each day the two large clearing banks were providing a large amount of intraday credit to securities firms to facilitate the daily \"unwind\" of the prior day's transactions. In the run-up to the crisis, the daily \"unwind\" helped make tri-party repo look like a very liquid investment while still being an apparently highly durable source of funding. This masked the underlying risks and contributed to weak risk management practices.\n\nAs the concerns about the U.S. housing market escalated in 2007, participants in the tri-party repo market became increasingly concerned about the liquidity and credit risks that they faced. The clearing banks became uncomfortable with their large intraday exposures to their clients—broker-dealers, thrifts and others. If the risk that a client might fail became too high, a clearing bank could decide not to unwind that client's trades in the morning, leaving its investors with the collateral. Most of these investors lacked the operational or financial capacity to take possession of collateral and liquidate it in a gradual manner to recoup their investment; they had a strong incentive to run at the first sign of trouble to avoid getting stuck with the dealer's collateral. Alternatively, if a client were to fail suddenly after the mornings unwind, then the clearing bank would be stuck with huge loans to these counterparties that could have put their own viability at risk, backed by securities that were not necessarily high quality and liquid. \n\nThe \"breaking the buck\" by the Reserve Fund following the Lehman bankruptcy also made it clear that the monies provided to the money market mutual funds by their own investors were also inherently unstable. This made such funds, in turn, an unreliable source of finance in repo, commercial paper and other markets. Investors in a fixed net asset value (NAV) money market fund could take their money out on a daily basis at par value, with no redemption penalty. This could occur even if the money market fund did not have sufficient cash or liquid assets that it could easily sell to meet all potential redemptions. As with bank deposits prior to deposit insurance, this created an incentive for investors to be the first to get out whenever there was any uncertainty over the underlying value of the assets in the fund. By being first in line, they could exit while the fund could still repay at par, leaving others to bear any losses. The longer the investor waited, the greater the risk that the fund would be forced into the fire sale of assets to meet redemptions and end up breaking the buck.\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the Federal Reserve, the U.S.  Treasury and others took a series of actions to contain the spiral of funding runs and asset fire sales. First, the traditional lender of last resort function was strengthened through the introduction of the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and foreign exchange swaps with foreign central banks.\n\nThen, as the crisis intensified, the lender of last resort liquidity provision was extended to directly backstop key wholesale funding markets and made available to certain nonbank firms. The Federal Reserve created a direct backstop to the tri-party repo system through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). When the Reserve Fund broke the buck after the failure of Lehman Brothers, precipitating a run on money market mutual funds, the Treasury guaranteed money market fund assets and the Fed introduced the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidation Facility (AMLF).  The Fed also backstopped the commercial paper market (formerly funded in large part by money market mutual funds) by introducing the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). When wholesale funding for non-residential mortgage securitizations evaporated, the Fed rolled out the Term Asset-Backed Lending Facility (TALF). \n\nThese actions ultimately stabilized funding markets and crowded back in private funds. But, they were an emergency response, not a sustainable long-term solution. After all, because most of the special Fed liquidity facilities were authorized under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act, they were required to be temporary in nature and to end when times were no longer \"unusual and exigent.\"\n\nMuch has been done over the past few years to mitigate the structural flaws that make wholesale funding a point of weakness in the global financial system. The New York Fed, for example, has led a Federal Reserve effort to make the tri-party repo system more resilient to stress, while the SEC has taken steps to address risks associated with money market mutual funds.  Nonetheless, some important issues and vulnerabilities remain. Moreover, because the Dodd-Frank Act raised the hurdle for the Federal Reserve to exercise its Section 13.3 emergency lending authority, extraordinary interventions will be more difficult to undertake, perhaps causing investors to be even more skittish in the future. This is why it is essential to make the system more stable. To that end, I look forward to hearing the insights and suggestions that come out of today's workshop.\n\nThank you for your attention."

        "content": "Good afternoon.  I thank you for the opportunity to address your association.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up the Second Federal Reserve District and it is especially gratifying to be here in Puerto Rico. \n\nAs with other parts of our District, the New York Fed is dedicated to the people of Puerto Rico and to their future growth and prosperity.  Our commitment is reflected in our ongoing work with our many partners in Puerto Rico.  Over the past several years we have held three forums (cosponsored with the local Small Business Administration office, the Puerto Rico Small Business Development and Technology Center and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), which provided technical assistance to help small businesses access capital, procure government contracts, and export their products and services. We also continue to promote financial literacy through our ongoing partnership with the Puerto Rico Bankers Association, and we have cosponsored the Financial Awareness Video Festival working with students at local colleges to produce short videos highlighting aspects of financial literacy.  Let me just pause for a moment to say congratulations to this year’s winner: Pontificia de Ponce. \n\nIn addition to this work, our commitment is reflected in our research on issues of concern to the Island.  Our economists monitor and analyze local economic conditions.  A complement to our internal research is the outreach that I and other senior bank staff undertake to meet with our stakeholders—the leaders in the business community, members of professional organizations like yourselves, academics, students, elected officials and leaders of nonprofits—to hear firsthand about the issues and problems facing the people in our district. What we learn during these engagements also helps to shape our understanding of the issues facing the Puerto Rico economy and inform our efforts to support it.  Earlier on this trip I met with leading business owners from many different sectors of the economy, elected officials and several agency heads.  And from what I have learned so far, there are many important initiatives underway to effect change and to address what are clearly large and complex issues.\n\nOn my last visit to the Island in 2011, I saw examples of expansion and growth.  This gave me confidence that Puerto Rico has the capability to be an economic success story. However, my discussions with a range of stakeholders confirmed to me that conditions were not what we want them to be—in particular, growth and expansion were not happening either fast enough or broadly enough.  At the urging of several business and community leaders, I commissioned a team at the New York Fed to analyze the challenges facing the Puerto Rico economy and to put forth recommendations on how to capitalize on the Island’s strengths and restore growth.  Informed by consultations with local, national and international experts and stakeholders on the Island, we released that report in 2012.1  \n\nWe presented five recommendations:  (1) reduce barriers to labor force participation and job creation; (2) reform the energy industry, particularly, improve the efficiency of the electric utility’s operations; (3) lower the costs of doing business; (4) foster partnerships between industry and higher education; and (5) promote independent policy evaluation.  These recommendations were not presented as simple quick fixes, but rather as important steps to help improve the Island’s competitiveness over time. \n\nSince that report was issued, positive steps toward reform have been made in some areas.  The recent bill reforming the energy sector and related efforts to expand the use of alternative energy sources should over time help to reduce the Island’s high costs of electricity.  Additionally, the Commonwealth’s economic development strategy is seeking to capitalize on the strong pharmaceutical presence on the Island, to promote knowledge-based services and, importantly, to improve the general business environment on the Island. \n\nMore recently, though, serious fiscal challenges have surfaced that are closely interrelated with the Island’s ongoing weak economic performance.  Persistent deficits in the Commonwealth’s fiscal accounts as well as mounting deficits in the operation of the several major public corporations have substantially raised the Island’s overall level of public debt and led to serious concerns about whether the Island’s fiscal position is sustainable.  \n\nIn light of the fiscal pressures Puerto Rico now faces, the New York Fed is undertaking an update to our earlier report. In this new report, we plan to focus on Puerto Rico’s fiscal health.  We will examine the factors leading to the sizeable buildup of public debt on the Island and the key variables that will determine its future trend.  In some ways, the data on Puerto Rico’s public debt clearly define the fiscal problems the Island faces.  But meeting with a variety of stakeholders, as I have on this visit, will help to inform our analysis and will provide us with concrete evidence of how these issues are playing out across the Puerto Rico economy.  \n\nThe clear challenge going forward will be for the Commonwealth government to continue to make progress on its efforts to raise its economic growth rate while at the same time to take credible steps to constrain the buildup of debt.  The demanding choices Puerto Rico makes today will affect its long-run economic prospects and the future livelihood of its residents.   \n\nNow I would like to review recent developments in the Puerto Rico economy and then outline for consideration and discussion several steps to help put the Island on a path toward fiscal health. \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Puerto Rico\n\nLet me turn to economic conditions in Puerto Rico.  As you are well aware, the news has not been good.  Puerto Rico’s economy has been in a slump for nearly a decade. After declining for five straight years, real (inflation-adjusted) gross national product (GNP) rose 0.9 percent in fiscal year 2012 and only 0.3 percent in 2013, rates considerably below the respective U.S. mainland growth rates.  A monthly index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico paints a similar picture of an economy that has stabilized but at a depressed level.  We are finally beginning to see some signs of improvement in economic activity on the Island, though there is little evidence to suggest that the strong recovery that we seek has yet taken hold.     \n\nPuerto Rico’s labor market remains weak.  Overall payroll employment fell by about 10 percent between 2006 and 2010 and has leveled off since then.  Employment in the private sector has been increasing modestly, with some notable pockets of relatively brisk job creation in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services and private education and health services—employment in each of these sectors now far exceeds its prerecession levels. Cutbacks in government employment, however, have largely offset the private-sector gains realized over the past few years.  \n\nLow labor force participation rates and high unemployment rates remain perhaps the biggest challenges to the Puerto Rico economy.   Our earlier report cited low labor force participation among younger and less educated workers as one important factor limiting the Island’s competitiveness.  Since that report, overall labor force participation has continued to decline. The unemployment rate on the Island has consistently exceeded the rate on the mainland by several percentage points.  Although the rate has fallen by more than a full percentage point year to date, the gap with the mainland remains wide.  Moreover, poor labor market opportunities for many workers have contributed to a significant increase in the rate of out-migration of Puerto Rico’s residents, accelerating the Island’s population decline. \n\nThe prolonged period of weak economic growth has compounded Puerto Rico’s fiscal problems:  Puerto Rico’s public sector debt has been on an upward trend for a decade.  The stagnation of the economy and persistent fiscal deficits underlie this debt buildup.  The level of outstanding debt as a percentage of the Island’s annual GNP, a ratio used by many fiscal analysts, rose from about 60 percent in 2000 to more than 100 percent in 2013.   Debt ratios in this range can inhibit economic growth in that they generally lead to higher financing costs, which in turn, can lead to constraints on access to further financing.  The recent downgrading of Puerto Rico’s public debt to non-investment grade was a clear signal that the current fiscal situation poses serious risks to the Island’s economic future.  \n\nSteps toward Fiscal Sustainability \n\nNext, I will discuss the buildup of Puerto Rico’s public debt and then provide some thoughts on ways to improve the Island’s fiscal health.  To open this discussion, it is worth noting some key features of Puerto Rico’s fiscal institutional environment.  The Commonwealth has a close relationship with the U.S. government which, in many ways, is analogous to that of a mainland state.  Puerto Rico shares a common market and a common currency with the U.S. mainland leading to strong economic interdependencies.   Federal aid is a major source of revenue for the Commonwealth and Puerto Rican residents participate in large U.S. social insurance programs such as Social Security and Medicare.  In addition, Puerto Rican debt trades as a municipal security in the U.S. capital markets, and much of the interest earned on this debt is exempt from local, state and federal income taxes, regardless of where in the U.S. the investor lives.   And like all but one state, Vermont, Puerto Rico has a self-imposed requirement to balance its budget. \n\nIn many ways, however, the Commonwealth operates more independently than other jurisdictions on the mainland.  Residents of Puerto Rico, unlike those of the states, do not pay U.S. personal income taxes unless they are employed by the U.S. government.  The many large public corporations on the Commonwealth’s balance sheet also distinguish it from many states, although some states—New York is an example—also house a number of public corporations and authorities.  Finally, a notable difference from other mainland jurisdictions is that Puerto Rico’s balanced budget requirement, while found in the constitution and relatively stringent in form, appears not to have been effective in constraining the growth of the Commonwealth’s debt.    \n\nThe debt buildup reflects, in part, some of these unique features of Puerto Rico’s fiscal institutions, policies and practices.  In particular, the public sector in Puerto Rico comprises not only the Commonwealth government but also the municipal governments and a number of public corporations.  Prominent among these public corporations are the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA), and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA).  The public corporations are especially important both for the role they have played in issuing debt as well as the scale of the public services they provide to the Island’s population.  Currently, they account for almost 40 percent of the Island’s total debt and have been responsible for much of the debt buildup—of the roughly 43 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GNP ratio between 2000 and 2013, the public corporations accounted for almost 85 percent of that increase.  \n\nSeveral measures put the Island’s weak fiscal condition into perspective.  Total public debt in Puerto Rico is quite high—roughly 100 percent of GNP.  This is far higher than in any U.S. mainland state; among the states, the highest ratio is New York at 29 percent.2   \n\nHowever, since most Puerto Ricans do not pay federal income taxes, the large federal debt burden could arguably be considered not to be a burden to Puerto Rico, in contrast to the mainland states.  Ranking the states and Puerto Rico with the federal debt burden added for the mainland states, but excluded for Puerto Rico, pushes Puerto Rico down to 14th in the rankings.  However, even with this adjustment Puerto Rico still has a high debt burden.  \n\nIn addition to the growing stock of publicly issued debt, Puerto Rico faces large future contingent liabilities via unfunded pension system liabilities. While the Commonwealth has a variety of options for managing these liabilities, they are nonetheless obligations that are relevant in assessing the Commonwealth’s overall balance sheet. \n\nIt seems likely that any country in a similar debt situation to Puerto Rico would have faced difficulty in continuing to raise money in the bond market and would have faced questions about the sustainability of its debt level.  Debt sustainability is generally defined as a condition where government debt is at a reasonable level—one with acceptable risks to market confidence and long-term economic growth—and is not on a path to increase indefinitely relative to some measure of national income.  Stabilizing Puerto Rico’s debt as a share of the Island’s income and then reducing its debt to more sustainable levels should be a key goal of the Island’s fiscal and economic policy.  While the precise path toward lower debt burden is uncertain, the trend is largely determined by the interaction of three factors:  the government’s fiscal policy, the growth rate of the economy and the interest rate on the public debt.   \n\nRegarding the buildup of new public debt, the Commonwealth government has stated its intention that the general fund budget will be balanced in fiscal year 2015.  This intention, together with the stance of not using deficit financing to support public corporations, should greatly limit the issuance of new debt.  The measures put in place during this year have already had some success in cutting the projected budget gap for the current fiscal year.  \n\nBut what other steps can be taken to move the Island toward fiscal health?  Let me start by saying that Puerto Rico is not alone in facing fiscal problems like these. Governments frequently find that public sector management becomes especially challenging when their economies are undergoing major transitions of the sort that have been taking place in Puerto Rico in the last decade. In the mainland U.S., cities like New York, Washington and Philadelphia experienced major fiscal stresses as they adjusted to the transition from manufacturing to service-based economies. Those cities faced market pressures not unlike those facing the Commonwealth today, and when their leadership tackled the issues head-on, the cities emerged stronger.  The problems that these cities faced required the government and the private sector to work together to find solutions.  In all cases that required important changes and sacrifices.  This was most effective when the necessary adjustments were shared broadly rather than concentrated on a single group.  \n\nIn the spirit of assisting the Commonwealth in this endeavor, I want to preview how these issues appear to me, and to suggest some steps for improving fiscal outcomes on the Island.  I present these ideas in order to solicit your input, based on your deeper understanding of the situation. I present them not as quick fixes—as there are no quick fixes to these fiscal situations—but as changes to financial practices that over the next several years can help to restore fiscal health to the Island. \n\nThe first step would be for the Commonwealth government to reinvigorate its efforts to raise economic growth.  While Puerto Rico has a number of features that make it a potentially strong economy, economic growth on the Island has been weak for almost a decade.  To restore growth and raise living standards, it is critically important for policymakers to expand efforts to marshal the Island’s considerable strengths—a bilingual and well-educated adult population, an open economy occupying a central position in the Caribbean, a wide experience as a host to multinational corporations, and close ties to the U.S. mainland economy.  \n\nWhile the challenges to restoring growth are clearly complex, I want to highlight some key areas where policies to support efficiency and growth might be strengthened.  First, barriers to job creation and active participation in the labor market should be reduced.  The current structure of labor market incentives could be examined to ensure that firms do not face significant hurdles in creating jobs and workers are not discouraged from entering the labor force.  Second, policymakers should continue their efforts to create a more dynamic business environment, including the elimination of unnecessary costs of setting up and operating a business, particularly with respect to energy costs.  Third, economic development efforts should consider a more proactive approach to utilizing the Island’s educated workforce and well-established higher education system.  One possibility is to look for ways to expand the support for the formation of partnerships between higher education and industry, which have proven to be effective ways for regions to promote innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth.   Puerto Rico has many of the ingredients in place to harness the benefits of these industry-education partnerships and policymakers should begin to look for promising opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration. \n\nA second step is to comprehensively reform the Commonwealth’s tax system, which is heavily dependent on income taxes and tends to levy high rates on narrow bases. When rates are high, it increases incentives for activities to be shielded from taxes, perhaps by moving activity to the informal sector, or perhaps by halting the activity altogether. Either way, collecting the necessary revenue requires rates to be even higher on activities that remain in the base, reinforcing the problem. Typically, comprehensive reform is necessary to break the cycle by simultaneously broadening the tax base and reducing rates across a range of taxes. Such a reform would likely produce a significant bonus in terms of faster economic growth, particularly in the formal sector.\n\nA third step would be to improve the Commonwealth’s financial reporting.  Puerto Rico’s unique status means that it is one of few jurisdictions whose finances are not regularly surveyed by a public agency. The U.S. Census Bureau reports annually on mainland state finances and the International Monetary Fund generally reports on the finances of nations. These surveys provide significant transparency into the finances of those entities, which is invaluable for policymakers and citizens wishing to understand, monitor and exert control and discipline over the fiscal policies of their governments. They may also serve the purpose of increasing investor understanding of how the Commonwealth’s finances compare to other governments. \n\nNew York City’s experience in the 1970s shows the value of better financial reporting.  Prior to the City’s fiscal crisis in 1975 through 1977, New York had relatively poor financial reporting practices. As part of its recovery from that crisis, and a condition of accessing credit, the City’s reporting improved dramatically and has since won several awards. Along with those improvements, the City’s access to credit markets steadily improved.  Economic research indicates that more transparent budgets are associated with lower public sector funding costs.  \n\nA fourth step would be to look for ways to strengthen the performance of public corporations.  A major difference between Puerto Rico’s balance sheet and those of the states is the presence of large, heavily indebted, corporate-like entities that continue to lose money and increase borrowing. For any financial reform agenda to be successful, it must confront this issue head on. Key elements of a successful reform strategy might include strengthening the public corporations’ financial standing and controlling the future flow of liabilities.    \n\nPuerto Rico could also seek out the opportunity to benefit from outside management expertise, including the wide experiences of U.S. mainland states.  An independent regulator for utilities is the norm throughout mainland states.  By leveraging the expertise and reputation of existing independent regulatory agencies, Puerto Rico may improve the efficiency of its public corporations while reassuring investors.   \n\nAs a fifth step, the Commonwealth could benefit from adopting fiscal institutions more like mainland states.  Balanced budget rules are far from perfect, but by following the states’ model—splitting the budget into an operating piece that must be balanced and a capital piece that can be financed with debt—Puerto Rico could better align financing methods with its spending priorities.\n\nA sixth step is for the Commonwealth to implement a framework to help ensure that budget targets are met.  A key aspect of such a framework would require that the authorities implement multi-year budgeting, in which revenue and expenditure plans are articulated over a three to five year horizon.  Such a framework should also incorporate a review of the central government’s macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts by a non-partisan independent entity, the views and analysis of which could be published in coordination with the Commonwealth’s proposed budget for any given fiscal year.  New York City, for instance, uses this type of framework.\n\nThe steps should be viewed as potential ways to improve Puerto Rico’s finances over time and I present them to you for consideration and discussion.  The decisions are obviously up to you.  Other countries, U.S. mainland states and municipalities facing similar fiscal issues have been able to overcome them.  I believe the Island can develop a strategy that will enable a return to fiscal health. \n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions.\n\n1 Report on the Competitiveness of Puerto Rico’s Economy, Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 2012.

        "title": "What Kind of Jobs Have Been Created During the Recovery?",
        "content": "Good morning and welcome once again to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you.  This morning I want to focus on economic conditions in our region, giving particular attention to the kinds of jobs created in New York, Northern New Jersey and Puerto Rico during the recovery from the Great Recession.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhile the New York Fed has broad operating responsibilities on behalf of the FOMC and the Federal Reserve System, we are also deeply committed to our region.  That commitment manifests itself in several ways.  We produce monthly indices of economic activity that enable us to gauge the performance of the region’s economy.  We conduct a regular poll of small businesses in our region, and just last week, we hosted a summit examining new sources of credit for small businesses.  We developed block-by-block flood maps which were created after Superstorm Sandy to inform residents and businesses in Brooklyn of their vulnerability to future storms.  And, we work with area schools to improve students’ understanding of monetary policy, the Fed and economics.\n\nIt is also important to me that I visit different parts of our District on a regular basis and talk directly with the people who live and work here.  For example, last fall I visited Western New York and saw the many positive changes helping to revitalize what has been a slow growing economy for some time.  Earlier this year, I met with companies on a visit to Brooklyn and observed some of the new hi-tech jobs that are being brought to the City—a good precursor to today’s presentation.  While in Brooklyn, I also visited Brownsville, a neighborhood which underscores the reality of the challenges that many face and the fact that the economy is not improving for everyone.  Later this year, I have similar trips planned to Puerto Rico, the Bronx and Albany.  Obtaining on-the-ground intelligence is valuable and helps shape my view of the region, the economy and my outlook on policy.\n\nAs you may know, the District we cover is quite diverse.  It is not just a single regional economy, but rather many different local economies.  Let me talk a bit about how the different parts of our region have been doing.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nSince our last briefing in November, the economic recovery has been variable across the region—strong in some places but weaker in others.  Let me begin with the area that has struggled the most.  Puerto Rico’s economy has, unfortunately, been in a deep economic slump that has lasted for nearly a decade.  Over the past few years, public sector job losses have continued to weigh against modest job gains in the Island’s private sector.  And ongoing difficulties in the Island’s labor market continue, with labor force participation still alarmingly low, and unemployment stubbornly high at a rate well above the mainland’s.  The good news is that we are finally beginning to see some firming in economic conditions on the Island. \n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, New York City has been experiencing a robust recovery.  While the Great Recession was clearly the worst post-war downturn in U.S. history, New York City was not as badly affected as the rest of the country.  As of April, almost five years since the end of the recession, the nation has recovered nearly all of the jobs that were lost.  By contrast, New York City reached this milestone more than two years ago.  And, as we’ve highlighted in previous press briefings, this rebound has occurred despite the lack of any significant recovery in employment on Wall Street. \n\nThe recovery has generally progressed at a more moderate pace in the other parts of our region.  Consistent with historical patterns, Upstate New York as a whole has been growing modestly, with Buffalo and Rochester doing a little bit better than their upstate peers.  Binghamton, on the other hand, has really been struggling with no signs yet of any meaningful recovery.  Meanwhile, Northern New Jersey’s economy had been growing fairly steadily until this past winter when activity softened, probably due at least in part to the unusually harsh weather.  Now that spring is finally upon us, we hope to see economic conditions improve more significantly.\n\nWhat Kinds of Jobs Have Been Created During the Recovery?\n\nLet me turn to the topic of today’s press briefing:  how the types of jobs in the region have changed over the last business cycle.  Firms often change the way they utilize workers and the mix of skills they employ during recessions and recoveries.  The weakening demand during recessions forces firms to look for new ways to be more efficient to cope with hard times.  These adjustments do not affect all workers equally.  Indeed, it’s what we typically think of as middle-skilled workers—for example, construction workers, machine operators and administrative support personnel—that are hardest hit during recessions.  Further, a feature of the Great Recession and indeed the prior two recessions, is that the middle-skill jobs that were lost don’t all come back during the recoveries that follow.  Instead, job opportunities have tended to shift toward higher- and lower-skilled workers.\n\nAs we’ll show, these same trends have played out in our region.  While there’s been a good number of both higher-skill and lower-skill jobs created in the region during the recovery, opportunities for middle-skilled workers have continued to shrink.\n\nI believe it is important for us to highlight these job trends and to understand their implications for our region.  There have been significant and long-lasting changes to the nature of work.  As a result, many middle-skilled workers displaced during the recession are likely to find that their old jobs will never come back.  Furthermore, workers are increasingly facing higher skill requirements in order to land a good job.  These dynamics in the labor market present a host of challenges for the region to address.  However one thing is clear: workers will need more education, training and skills to take full advantage of the types of job opportunities being created in our region, as well as across the nation.  So, it’s important that we work together to find ways to help people in our region adapt to these changes.\n\nI will now ask Jaison Abel to provide an update of economic conditions in our region."

        "title": "The Economic Outlook and Implications for Monetary Policy",
        "content": "Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.  It always is a special pleasure to address my fellow economists.  In my remarks today, I am going to focus on the economic outlook and the implications of that outlook for monetary policy. \n\nMy views on the economy have not changed much since last fall.  Although economic growth stalled in the first quarter, some slowing was expected and unseasonably harsh winter weather appears to have done the rest.  The fundamental supports for a strengthening economy remain in place, and recent data seem to confirm that forecast.  On the price front, I expect inflation to drift higher over the remainder of the year as the effects of some temporary factors that have been holding inflation down dissipate and the labor market continues to tighten. \n\nIf my forecast is correct, as growth strengthens and inflation drifts higher, the focus will turn to monetary policy.  In particular, what will be the timing of lift-off?  And when lift-off occurs, how quickly will the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raise rates and to what level? \n\nAlso, with an exceptionally large balance sheet there will be considerable attention on the methods that the FOMC will likely use in order to exert control over the level of short-term rates.  I can’t tell you yet how we will do it, but I am fully confident that we have the necessary tools to control the level of short-term rates and the credit creation process, and I will share with you some of my own thoughts on the subject.  As always, what I have to say here today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nTurning first to economic activity, the trajectory of economic growth continues to disappoint.  Since the downturn ended in mid-2009, real GDP growth has averaged only 2.2 percent per year despite a very accommodative monetary policy.  This performance reflects three major factors—the significant headwinds resulting from the bursting of the housing bubble, the shift of fiscal policy from expansion toward restraint, especially in 2012 and 2013, and a series of shocks from abroad—most notably the European crisis. \n\nThe good news is that all three of these factors have abated.  With respect to the headwinds resulting from the financial crisis, they are gradually becoming less severe.  In particular, the sharp decline in household wealth due to the decline in housing prices and the weakness in equity prices has been largely reversed.  As housing prices have climbed, the number of homes moving into the foreclosure process and the number of households with mortgages underwater have fallen sharply.  Moreover, households have deleveraged their balance sheets.  Debt levels have declined and lower interest rates have cut financing costs.  As a result, the financial obligation ratio, which measures the debt servicing cost of households, has declined from a peak of 18.1 percent of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 15.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.  This is a level not seen since the early 1980s. \n\nOn the fiscal side, the amount of restraint has diminished sharply.  For 2014, the projected drag is about ½ percent of GDP, roughly half the level of 2013.  Moreover, much of this restraint was frontloaded into the beginning of the year, with the cessation of long-term unemployment compensation, the expiration of the bonus depreciation provisions and the higher tax rates that applied to final tax settlements for the 2013 tax year.  For the remainder of this year and next, the degree of fiscal restraint should be very modest. \n\nIn terms of the outlook abroad, the circumstances are more mixed.  Although Europe is doing better, Japan is digesting the large hike in consumption taxes that was implemented on April 1, Chinese growth is slowing and some other emerging market economies are coping with structural imbalances that are anticipated to lead to slower growth this year.  One obvious wildcard is the situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia.  How this will evolve is difficult to predict.  The big risk is that conditions deteriorate and the ultimate outcome is a disruption to energy supplies from Russia.  When all these cross-currents are considered, the impetus to growth from abroad appears little changed from last year.  \n\nNow a reasonable question would be: If the outlook is improving, then how does one explain the sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter?  My own view is that the principal factors behind the slowdown were transitory so we should not be overly concerned at this point.  Some slowing in the first quarter was nearly inevitable.  Foreign trade and inventories provided unsustainably large contributions to growth over the second half of last year and payback for those large gains was expected in the first quarter of this year.  Also, the expiration of extended unemployment compensation benefits and bonus depreciation at the end of the year was likely to take some of the starch out of consumer spending and business fixed investment.  Beyond these anticipated factors, we had unusually harsh winter weather, which likely depressed housing activity, manufacturing production and some aspects of household spending such as motor vehicle purchases. \n\nWith the fundamentals of the economy improving and fiscal drag abating, I expect the economy to get back on to a roughly 3 percent growth trajectory over the remainder of this year, with some further strengthening likely in 2015.  But, there remains considerable uncertainty about that forecast and, given the persistent over-optimism about the growth outlook by Federal Reserve officials and others in recent years, we shouldn’t count our chickens before they hatch. \n\nBusiness fixed investment and housing are two key areas where activity has been disappointing.  They need to kick in more forcefully for the economy to grow at an above trend rate for a sustained period. \n\nWith respect to capital spending, the recent trajectory has been very soft relative to the apparent strong underlying fundamentals.  Corporate cash flows have been strong, profit margins are high, balance sheets are healthy and financing generally appears readily available at low interest rates.  Moreover, the absolute level of capital outlays is low so that the capital stock is expanding only slowly.  Despite these positive fundamentals, real business spending on equipment and software has risen only 3.2 percent over the past four quarters and contracted in the first quarter.   This is a bit of a puzzle to me.  But, I expect it to be resolved by a pickup in capital spending.  Recent trends in durable goods orders and conversations I have had with businesses in my district suggest that such a pickup may finally be occurring. \n\nOn the housing side, residential investment has stalled out over the past few quarters.  Although I expected some slowing due to the rise in mortgage rates in the middle of 2013, the extent of the slowdown has surprised me given that the recent pace of housing starts—roughly  1 million per year—is far below what is consistent with the economy’s underlying demographic trends. \n\nI think housing has been weaker than anticipated because several significant headwinds persist for this sector.  First, mortgage credit is still not readily available to households with lower credit scores.  Second, some people are coping with higher student loan debt burdens that have delayed their entry into the housing market as first-time homebuyers.  This, in turn, makes it more difficult for existing homeowners to sell and trade-up.  Third, there may be some ongoing difficulties increasing housing supply.  The housing downturn was very deep and protracted.  It takes time to shift resources back into this area.  Also, in some markets house prices still appear to be below the cost of building a new home.  Thus, in those markets, it remains uneconomic to undertake new home construction.  Although I expect that the housing recovery will resume, the pace will likely be slow, especially relative to past economic recoveries. \n\nWith respect to the outlook for prices, I think that inflation will drift upwards over the next year, getting closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator.  Some of the factors holding down inflation—such as the cut in Medicare reimbursement rates last April—were one-offs and are now dropping out of the year-over-year figures.  In some other areas, such as owners’ equivalent rent, price pressures look likely to firm somewhat.  \n\nThat said, I see little prospect of inflation climbing sharply over the next year or two.  There still are considerable margins of excess capacity available in the economy—especially in the labor market—that should moderate price pressures.  Most notably, the trend of labor compensation is running at only about a 2 percent annualized pace.  This is far below the roughly 3½ percent pace that would be consistent with trend productivity growth of 1 to 1½ percent and the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective. \n\nRecently, some economists have argued that the amount of slack in the labor market may be smaller than suggested by the official unemployment rate of 6.3 percent.  They focus on the level of short-term unemployment—those workers unemployed for less than 27 weeks—which has returned close to its average long-term level—and argue that it is the short-term unemployed that are critical in driving compensation trends. \n\nMy own reading of this research suggests that one should not jump to such a conclusion.  Instead, I conclude:\n\nTo sum up, this isn’t likely to be a case of black (only total unemployment matters) or white (only short-term unemployment matters) with respect to compensation cost trends.  I suspect that the degree of attachment falls on average as one is unemployed for longer periods of time.  But, I don’t believe that this pattern of attachment is stable.  It is affected by the nature of the business cycle and how and why people have become long-term unemployed. \n\nBefore I turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy, let me leave you with a final thought on inflation and our inflation objective.  I think there is some confusion as to whether the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective is a ceiling or not.  My own view is that 2 percent is definitely not a ceiling.  Once we reach 2 percent, I would expect that we would spend as much time slightly above 2 percent as below it, recognizing that we will hardly ever be exactly at 2 percent because of the inherent volatility in prices.  If inflation were to drift above 2 percent, all else equal, then we would tend to resist such a rise.  But, if inflation were slightly above 2 percent even as unemployment remained far above levels consistent with maximum employment, then the unemployment consideration would dominate because we would be further from the unemployment objective than we are from the inflation objective.  This should not surprise anyone.  This is what our “balanced approach” implies. \n\nGiven my outlook for above-trend growth and inflation gradually drifting higher, the inevitable question is what this means for the monetary policy outlook.  Over the near-term, if circumstances evolve relatively close to my forecast, I would continue to favor gradually reducing the pace of asset purchases by staying on the same glide path of a $10 billion reduction in the monthly purchase pace following each FOMC meeting. \n\nAssuming asset purchases end sometime this fall, the focus will shift to the timing of lift-off, the pace of tightening once lift-off occurs and where short-term rates are ultimately headed over the longer-term.  The issue of how the Fed will manage its balance sheet will also be relevant, as well as how monetary policy will be conducted during a period when the amount of excess reserves in the banking system is unusually large.  I will give you some of my early thinking on each of these issues in the remainder of my remarks. \n\nTurning first to the timing of lift-off, how the outlook evolves matters.  We currently anticipate that a considerable period of time will elapse between the end of asset purchases and lift-off, but precisely how long is difficult to say given the inherent uncertainties surrounding the outlook.  If the economy is stronger than expected, causing the excess slack in the labor market to be absorbed sooner and inflation to rise more quickly than forecasted, then lift-off is likely to be pulled forward in time.  If, instead, economic growth disappoints, inflation stays unusually low and the labor market continues to exhibit evidence of considerable excess slack, then lift-off will likely be pushed back in time.1\n\nWith respect to the trajectory of rates after lift-off, this also is highly dependent on how the economy evolves.  My current thinking is that the pace of tightening will probably be relatively slow.  This depends, however, in large part, not only on the economy’s performance, but also on how financial conditions respond to tightening.  After all, monetary policy works through financial conditions to affect aggregate demand and supply.  If the response of financial conditions to tightening is very mild—say similar to how the bond and equity markets have responded to the tapering of asset purchases since last December—this might encourage a somewhat faster pace.  In contrast, if bond yields were to move sharply higher, as was the case last spring, then a more cautious approach might be warranted. \n\nIn terms of the level of rates over the longer-term, I would expect them to be lower than historical averages for three reasons.  First, economic headwinds seem likely to persist for several more years.  While the wealth loss following the financial crisis has largely been reversed, the Great Recession has scarred households and businesses­—this is likely to lead to greater precautionary saving and less investment for a long time.  Also, as noted earlier, headwinds in the housing area seem likely to dissipate only slowly. \n\nSecond, slower growth of the labor force due to the aging of the population and moderate productivity growth imply a lower potential real GDP growth rate as compared to the 1990s and 2000s.  Because the level of real equilibrium interest rates appears to be positively related to potential real GDP growth, this slower trend implies lower real equilibrium interest rates even after all the current headwinds fully dissipate. \n\nThird, changes in bank regulation may also imply a somewhat lower long-term equilibrium rate.  Consider that, all else equal, higher capital requirements for banks imply somewhat wider intermediation margins.  While higher capital requirements are essential in order to make the financial system more robust, this is likely to push down the long-term equilibrium federal funds rate somewhat. \n\nPutting all these factors together, I expect that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent PCE inflation over the long run is likely to be well below the 4¼ percent average level that has applied historically when inflation was around 2 percent.  Precisely how much lower is difficult to say at this point in time. \n\nThe fact that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is likely to be lower for a long time underscores the need for caution in applying the benchmark Taylor Rule as a guide to the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  As typically applied, the Taylor Rule assumes an equilibrium real rate of interest of 2 percent.  This seems much too high in the current economic environment in which headwinds persist, and somewhat too high even when these headwinds fully dissipate. \n\nThe next question I wish to consider is how the Fed will likely manage its balance sheet as the taper process is completed and lift-off eventually occurs.  Unlike previous normalizations of monetary policy, which only involved the level of short-term rates, this prospective tightening cycle also involves considerations with respect to the size and composition of our balance sheet.  The Committee stated in its June 2011 exit principles that changes in short-term rates will be the primary means for adjusting monetary policy post-liftoff, not discretionary shifts in the balance sheet.  In other words, the balance sheet will be set on automatic pilot.  I believe this approach still very much applies. \n\nHowever, the language in the June 2011 exit principles concerning agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) sales no longer applies.  As Chairman Bernanke noted in the press conference following the June 2013 FOMC meeting: “While participants continue to think that in the long run the Federal Reserve’s portfolio should consist predominantly of Treasury securities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage-backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy.”  The balance sheet would shrink post-lift-off as Treasury securities matured and mortgages were prepaid, but outright agency MBS sales are no longer contemplated during the process of monetary policy normalization. \n\nAlso, I think that the language in the June 2011 exit principles with respect to reinvestment needs to be revisited.  The exit principles state: “To begin the process of policy normalization, the Committee will likely first cease reinvesting some or all payments of principal on the securities holdings in the SOMA.”  There are two considerations that suggest to me that ending the reinvestments prior to lift-off may not be the best strategy.  First, such a decision might complicate our communications regarding the process of normalization.  Ending reinvestments as an initial step risks inadvertently bringing forward any tightening of financial conditions as this might foreshadow the impending lift-off date for rates in a manner inconsistent with the Committee’s intention. \n\nSecond, when conditions permit, it would be desirable to get off the zero lower bound in order to regain some monetary policy flexibility.  This goal would argue for lift-off occurring first followed by the end of reinvestment, rather than vice versa.  Delaying the end of reinvestment puts the emphasis where it needs to be—getting off the zero lower bound for interest rates.  In my opinion, this is far more important than the consequences of the balance sheet being a little larger for a little longer. \n\nWith respect to the issue of how the FOMC will control money market rates with an enlarged balance sheet, the Federal Reserve already has the necessary tool—the ability to pay interest on excess reserves.  However, the degree of control could be further buttressed.  Enhancing confidence in the Fed’s ability to control money market rates, and hence, inflation, might also help keep inflation expectations well anchored. \n\nOne method the Fed has been testing is an overnight, fixed rate, reverse repo (RRP) facility.  The Federal Reserve posts a fixed interest rate and accepts cash from counterparties, which include some banks, dealers, money market funds, and government sponsored enterprises, on an overnight basis in return for a security.  The repo facility is “reverse” because the direction in which the funds and securities move—participants are lending funds to the Fed rather than vice versa.  Users of the facility are making the economic equivalent of an overnight collateralized loan of cash to the Federal Reserve. \n\nIf implemented, the facility could be set up as “full allotment,” which means that there is no cap on the amount of funds accepted from any of its counterparties at the posted overnight interest rate.  Or, caps could be imposed on either an aggregate or per counterparty basis in order to limit total usage. \n\nThe amount of funds invested in the facility is likely to be sensitive to the spread between the posted interest rate and comparable money market rates and the level of caps placed on usage.  The narrower the spread to comparable money market rates, the greater the participation is likely to be.  In our ongoing tests with this facility, the New York Desk has varied the RRP rate from 1 to 5 basis points and the cap on usage by counterparty has gradually been increased to its current level of $10 billion.  As expected, narrower spreads to comparable money market rates and larger caps have led to greater usage. \n\nAlthough the testing process is still ongoing, early results suggest that the overnight RRP facility will set a floor under money market rates.  Treasury repo rates have generally traded no more than a basis point or two below the overnight RRP rate.2  Thus, the early evidence suggests that this facility would help strengthen our control over money market rates. \n\nTwo issues with the overnight reverse repo rate warrant careful consideration.  The first is how big a footprint the facility should have in terms of volume.  To the extent that the overnight RRP rate were set very close or equal to the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) without caps, then this might result in a large amount of disintermediation out of banks through money market funds and other financial intermediaries into the facility.  This could encourage further development of the shadow banking system.  If this were deemed undesirable, this would argue for a wider spread between the overnight RRP and the IOER in order to reduce the volume of flows into the facility. \n\nThe second issue is the facility’s potential impact on financial stability.  In particular, would such a facility make financial instability less likely?  And, when financial stress did occur, would such a facility amplify or dampen financial strains? \n\nOn the first point, it seems that such a facility would tend to make financial instability less likely.  The overnight RRP facility allows us to make a short-term safe asset more widely available to a broad range of financial market participants.  The provision of short-term safe assets by the official sector might crowd out the private creation of runnable money-like liquid assets.  This might enhance financial stability by reducing the likelihood of a financial crisis. \n\nHowever, if a financial crisis were to occur, the existence of a full allotment, overnight, RRP facility might exacerbate instability by encouraging runs out of more risky assets into the facility.  That is because the supply of a full allotment facility would be completely elastic at the given fixed rate.  Money market mutual funds and other providers of short-term financing could rapidly shift funds into the facility away from assets such as commercial paper that support the private sector.  In contrast, in the current regime, when financial crises lead to flows into less risky assets, their interest rates fall, limiting the appetite for these less risky assets.  Consequently, under a full allotment setup, runs could be larger and these runs could exacerbate the fall in the prices of riskier assets.  Note that the risk here is how quickly financial flows could reverse from one day to the next, not the average level of take-up of the facility over time. \n\nFortunately, this risk seems relatively easy to address.  One could design the facility to prevent rapid inflows during times of financial stress.  This could be done by building in circuit breakers such as caps on overall usage of the facility.  The circuit breakers would not affect the amount of take-up during normal times or prevent take-up from rising at moderate rates.  Instead, they would be in place to limit the pace and magnitude of inflows during times of stress. \n\nA second option to improve the Fed’s control over short-term rates is to drain reserves by offering banks term deposit accounts in which to invest funds for longer terms than overnight.  There are two issues that might make this option somewhat less attractive.  First, to strengthen monetary policy control significantly through this course, it might be necessary to drain most of the $3 trillion of reserves.  This could be done of course with effort, but is the effort worth it? \n\nSecond, the Fed would undoubtedly have to “pay up” to induce banks to hold term deposit accounts relative to keeping their monies in reserves at the excess reserves interest rate.  This would likely result in higher Fed interest expenses relative to relying on an overnight RRP facility to set a floor on money market rates. \n\nThe choices here are important and I expect that considerable testing, analysis and discussion will be necessary to reach firm conclusions about the appropriate course.  My goal would be to clarify our intentions later this year, long before we begin to contemplate raising short-term rates. \n\nI also think that the choices are about how to conduct monetary policy during the transitional phase, not about the long-term monetary policy framework.  Longer term, the issue will be whether to return to the type of corridor system that was in place prior to the crisis or to instead to stay with the type of floor system that will likely be the type of regime that is in place as the balance sheet gradually normalizes.  I expect that the choices made over the near-term can be implemented in a way so as not to forestall either a corridor or a floor system over the longer term.  The experience we gain with operating monetary policy effectively with a very large balance sheet will undoubtedly inform that choice. \n\nBut, that topic is putting the cart far before the horse.  First, we need an economy that is strong enough to more fully utilize the nation’s labor resources and to begin to push inflation back towards the Federal Reserve’s long-term objective.  Only then can the monetary policy normalization process proceed.  Although we are making progress towards our goals, we still have a considerable way to go. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions. \n\n1It is worth noting that the views of market participants as expressed in the Eurodollar futures market and those of FOMC participants as expressed in the March Summary of Economic Projections seem consistent with one another and indicate an anticipated lift-off sometime near the middle of next year.\n\n2The floor has been more solid since the testing was extended in January for a full year. In part, this is likely because the extension allowed market participants to plan ahead knowing that they could rely on the facility. Raising the caps has also been a factor in solidifying the floor."

        "title": "U.S. Monetary Policy and Emerging Market Economies",
        "content": "The scaling back of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program—both the prospect and the actuality—has created significant challenges for many emerging market economies. Although this shift in U.S. monetary policy was inevitable at some point, it seems to have triggered a broad-based sentiment shift in global markets.  Recent events are a reminder that U.S. monetary policy can have powerful effects abroad. What lessons should we draw from these events?   That will be the general theme of my brief remarks today.  \n\nBefore I go on, though, I first would remind you that the thoughts I offer today are my own, and should not be interpreted as representing the position of the Federal Reserve System.  I also want to call attention to Terry Checki, who is being honored today and has been at the center of events in global finance for more than three decades, and who has done so much to shape them.  I can't think of a better way of recognizing his many contributions—and kicking off what I know will be an exciting and fulfilling next stage of his career—than this roundtable which brings us together here today. \n\nLet me begin by highlighting some of the key points I will be making. \n\nFirst, what we've seen recently is not new.  Changes in Fed policy, and especially moves in the past to tighten monetary policy, have often created challenges for emerging market economies (EMEs).  Second, these countries, as a group, are better equipped today to handle those challenges than at perhaps any time in the past.  This reflects the fundamental improvements and stronger policy frameworks that many emerging market economies have put in place over the past 15 years.  Third, given the role of the dollar as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve has a special responsibility to manage policy in a way that helps promote global financial stability.  Fourth, I believe we need better international mechanisms to cushion the adjustment process for when capital flows abruptly change direction.  \n\nLike other central banks, our monetary policy mandate is domestic.  But, our actions often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy, and we need to always keep this in mind.  We also need to be careful not to underestimate the consequences of our actions.  Focusing only on direct channels, the effects that one would expect to ripple back to the United States from problems in one or two EMEs typically look quite small.  But, when all of the indirect channels of feedback are aggregated properly—which admittedly is difficult to do—the effects may be considerably larger.   My point is that we tend to underestimate these feedback effects. \n\nFor most of us, the market volatility of this past spring and summer still remains fresh in our minds.  EME financial markets were hit hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads, and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with 10-year rates rising by roughly 100 basis points from early May to early July, and rising by roughly another 30 basis points before peaking in early September. \n\nMost commentary has focused on the shift in expectations with respect to U.S. monetary policy—and, in particular, to uncertainty about the timing and implications of Fed tapering—as the catalyst for these moves.  This focus seems generally right, although other factors also played a role.  Market participants also had to evaluate the possibility that growth in China and other EMEs might be slowing even as growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies was picking up.  The subsequent market movements as investors withdrew funds from EME investments were an abrupt shock for EMEs generally, especially after the long earlier period of abundant liquidity and ample inflows. \n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges now facing EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing, driven by our coming up against the zero lower bound.   Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past.  But, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy and this creates more potential uncertainties.  This puts a premium on continued dialogue among central bankers, between central bankers and the market, and keen listening skills on our part.  In my view, the fact that our large scale asset purchase programs affect the size of term risk premia globally is important.  This set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble about what we claim about understanding the importance of this distinction. \n\nFor the period ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on vulnerabilities they might have ignored a year ago.  The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  There will be no one right answer in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and adjustment will sometimes be difficult.  Moreover, we will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw in January is proof enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic on the outlook so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a homogenous group. \n\nFurthermore, many EMEs generally appear better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were in past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms these EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons learned from past periods of market stress.  Among the positives are:\n\nOf course progress has not been uniform across EMEs and more work remains to strengthen institutional structures further in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities have built up recently in several important EMEs.  Still, the fundamental improvements I’ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment turns from welcoming to wary.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even that policymaking be internationally coordinated.  As I’ve already noted, Fed policies have significant effects internationally, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the leading global reserve currency.  In pursuing our policy responsibilities, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  We are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide. \n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think, it’s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of stable prices and maximum sustainable growth and whether this is consistent with a healthy global economy. \n\nMoreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or the EMEs specifically.  Central banks have challenges enough in tailoring policies to their domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Moreover, our last system of explicit coordination—the system of fixed exchange rates under Bretton Woods—broke down for a reason.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  One thing recent events demonstrate is the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear in retrospect that our attempts last spring to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  In particular, markets seemed to conflate tapering with monetary policy tightening and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better:  markets now seem to understand that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time even after tapering is completed. \n\nAs you know, we’ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings by the Fed chair; the publishing of growth and inflation forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  This last element, of course, goes along with our move to explicit forward guidance, as part of our efforts to provide stimulus at the zero lower bound.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments. \n\nA second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act either early enough or decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The United States was not alone in this, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps, reflecting both new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  Systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, compensation schemes for these institutions will be more focused on rewarding long-term results and the official sector is making progress in solving the too-big-to-fail dilemma. \n\nAll of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how better to fulfill their mandates. \n\nI also think there is another area we need to work on, an area where very little has been done to date.  We need to collectively devise a better international mechanism for facilitating adjustment when the direction of capital flows changes abruptly.  The current regime strikes me as inefficient and often ineffective.  Holding large cushions of foreign exchange reserves is expensive, drawing down those reserves is often unattractive because of the potential adverse signal that this sends, and EMEs are loath to turn to the International Monetary Fund for resources to cushion the adjustment process.  It seems to me that we could design a better global solution of collective insurance—access to liquid resources in times of stress that were not stigmatized and that could and would be used to facilitate adjustment.  This could help reduce market volatility and dampen the size of foreign exchange and other adjustments.  This is a topic, in my opinion, that deserves greater attention from central bankers around the world. \n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us to a better place collectively.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor.  This is what Terry Checki has worked for over his distinguished career.  We have been very fortunate for his service and must carry the mantle forward."

        "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up our region, and it is especially gratifying to have the opportunity to talk with you, our future leaders. \n\nI am especially pleased to be here at Brooklyn College, given the relationship that we at the New York Fed have developed with The City University of New York (CUNY). As an example, we collaborated this year on the College Fed Challenge, our yearly competition where teams of students from area universities take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate the appropriate next steps for U.S. monetary policy.  A number of CUNY schools competed and professors served as judges. Also, several CUNY schools had a strong showing in our annual Savvy Credit Video Festival which I’ll speak more about later. \n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy and to share what we are seeing.  At the Federal Reserve, we try to meet with a diverse array of people in order to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the regions we serve and a fuller understanding of the major issues.  Earlier today, I met with developers and local community leaders to learn about the redevelopment of the Atlantic Yards, was welcomed to a roundtable breakfast meeting with members of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and then traveled to Brownsville to learn about the challenges faced by that community.  Following this visit to Brooklyn College, I’m headed to Bush Terminal in Sunset Park to meet with city officials and learn about an important redevelopment project and then I’ll end the day at Etsy—a successful innovative start-up and a major private-sector employer here in Brooklyn. \n\nThese trips are only one of the many ways in which we seek to engage with the people and businesses in our region.  We also reach out to our local communities through web resources, workshops and conferences.  To assess the performance of the regional economy, we monitor economic activity on a monthly basis, we tap into the insights of the members of our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council and Upstate Advisory Board, and we have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of homeowners and students at the local level.  We conduct two monthly surveys—the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and the Business Leaders Survey of service firms—which help us monitor regional business conditions in close to real-time. We’ve also developed a “Regional Mortgage Conditions” analysis at the county and zip code level.  In addition, we conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  It is noteworthy that our most recent poll found that cash flow issues replaced credit availability as the number one concern of small companies. \n\nWe also have worked to support better financial decision-making by young consumers.  Every year the Bank conducts two competitions in which college students are challenged to produce a 30-second video promoting wise credit use.  The two contests, one held in Puerto Rico and the other in the tri-state region, provide students the opportunity to learn about the importance of personal finance while showcasing their filmmaking creativity.  The winning video is then shown at numerous local movie theaters, helping promote the value of the smart use of credit.  This year the judges, including Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business, Tamir Muhammad from the Tribeca Film Institute and Jim Rosenberg from UNICEF, selected a Brooklyn College entry, entitled “Elevate Your Credit” as the winner.  I am pleased to again congratulate Rasa Partin, Ben Remetz and Andrew Roder, and their coach, Jay Kim, for creating the winning video. \n\nNow I would like to review recent developments in the local and national economies, and at the end of my talk will be happy to answer any questions you have. \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee. \n\nRegional Employment and Economic Trends\n\nFirst, let’s talk about economic trends in New York City. The City’s economy showed resilience both during and after this last severe recession.  Payroll employment fell sharply in 2008 and 2009; it bounced back, slowly at first, but by July of 2011, the City’s economy had recovered to its pre-recession employment peak and, in November, it eclipsed its previous all-time peak of 1969.  Since then, employment has continued to grow strongly, rising at a roughly 2 percent annual pace and outpacing the national growth rate.  The demand for labor has been driven by start-ups, tech, health care and business services.  While Superstorm Sandy caused substantial damage to homes and the region’s infrastructure and severe economic disruptions in late 2012, the local economy as a whole bounced back quickly.  \n\nDespite the robust job growth, the unemployment rate among City residents has been persistently high—though it did fall to 8.0 percent in December, nearly a 5-year low.  Potential workers are not counted as unemployed unless they are actively looking for work, so this relatively high rate of unemployment, in part, reflects the relative strength in labor force participation, as the City’s residents remain engaged and looking for work.  In contrast, at the national level, the picture is quite different—job growth has been slower and proportionately more people have dropped out of the labor force.  \n\nPerhaps surprisingly, while historically a key driver of the local economy, the finance sector has not been a leader in terms of job growth recently.  Instead, employment in New York City’s finance sector and the securities industry specifically, has been essentially flat over the past two years.  The city’s job gains in this expansion have been broad-based across other sectors, indicating a healthy diversification within the economy. \n\nConditions in Brooklyn\n\nNow let’s focus on Brooklyn. The borough’s economy has been particularly strong in recent years.  Compared with the other boroughs, Brooklyn has seen generally stronger job growth, a stronger housing market, and stronger trends in wage and salary earnings.  This strength is exemplified by the transformation of industrial neighborhoods—such as DUMBO, Red Hook, Greenpoint, East Williamsburg, Gowanus and Bushwick—into increasingly diversified residential and commercial neighborhoods; and the recent development of the Atlantic Yards and Brooklyn Navy Yard.  This changing landscape has helped spur economic activity which has created many new jobs in the borough. \n\nIndeed, employment held up well during the recession, declining by less than 2 percent over a brief period in early 2009, and has averaged a nearly 3 percent annualized growth rate since then.  Job growth has been particularly strong at retailers, hotels and restaurants, and also service firms ranging from advertising to engineering.  That said, the employment picture does have some difficulties.  For example, there is concern over some well-paying health sector jobs given the financial strain at Long Island College Hospital and Interfaith Medical Center and the pressure to close those institutions. \n\nBrooklyn’s economic vitality is also reflected in the commercial real estate market, as both office and retail vacancy rates have fallen steadily over the past few years.  In fact, office vacancy rates are now lower in Brooklyn than in Manhattan.  The strength in the housing market is also evident, with the median home price up by roughly 10 percent in each of the past two years, and the rental market has shown similar strength.  \n\nHowever, these increasing prices also raise two other issues that acutely afflict many in Brooklyn and New York City more broadly: housing affordability and poverty.  Despite Brooklyn’s economic renaissance and growing affluence, a large swath of the Borough’s population—one in four residents—still lives in poverty, and many struggle to pay their rent or mortgage.  Even with the strong pace of job creation, Brooklyn’s unemployment rate has remained high, averaging more than 9 percent in 2013.  \n\nThere are also continued financial challenges for families here as indicated by the New York Fed’s measures of credit conditions.  As of the end of 2013, average debt per person was about $42,000 in Brooklyn—little changed over several years.  At the same time, the Borough’s delinquency rate on that debt is now 11.6 percent, much higher than the state average and more than double the national average.  What’s more, the mortgage crisis continues to take a toll on local homeowners.  As of the end of 2013, more than 11 percent of mortgage debt in Brooklyn was 90-plus days delinquent, again significantly higher than the New York State and national delinquency rate. \n\nI also want to make a few comments about the impact of Superstorm Sandy.  While areas of the New York City metropolitan region were hard hit by the storm, the devastation was particularly severe along the waterfronts of Brooklyn—and in particular in southern Brooklyn and neighborhoods like Red Hook.  We saw and heard about the devastation of the storm from many of those affected, including a number of our own employees as well as other residents we met at a series of assistance clinics we organized in response to the storm.  Those already living close to the edge financially were particularly vulnerable as were the City’s public housing residents.  Still, Brooklyn’s economy showed resilience: while employment did drop in November 2012, it bounced back strongly the next month and accelerated during the spring of 2013, reaching new highs. \n\nSandy was a catastrophe for many in our region and significant challenges remain in the years ahead.  Recently, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps that show a much larger number of Brooklyn residents and businesses at risk of a future storm.  While a once-in-a-hundred-year risk of flooding may not appear worrisome, many within this expanded zone may be required to purchase insurance.  The expanded flood zones, coupled with federal government efforts to have insurance premiums accurately reflect the risk, could create a serious affordability problem in the years ahead.  The New York Fed has created maps of community-level flood risk in Brooklyn.  \n\nNow I would like to turn my attention to recent developments in the national economy. \n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nFrom the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 through mid-2013, real Gross Domestic Product, or the aggregate value, after adjusting for inflation, of all the goods and services produced within the borders of the U.S., grew at a rather tepid 2 1/4; percent annual rate.  Then, in the second half of 2013, the pace of growth moved notably higher, reaching an annual rate of 3 1/4 percent.  Nonetheless, despite this pickup in the growth pace, the average monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment were somewhat lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half.  \n\nAt the same time, both total and core inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator, slowed in the second half of 2013 relative to the first half, and the overall PCE deflator index is currently running well below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent for total inflation. \n\nCombined with the still-elevated unemployment rate and the drop in the labor force participation rate, these conditions suggest that there continues to be a substantial underutilization of both labor and capital resources.  This implies, in turn, that the current, highly-accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time to come.  Let me elaborate on these points. \n\nWhile the timing and magnitude of the pickup of growth were earlier and somewhat stronger than our internal forecast, in qualitative terms the economy has performed much as we expected.  First, by several measures, households’ balance sheets are in much better shape, and this has led to faster growth of consumer spending, particularly for durable goods.  Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade.  Reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt, household net worth relative to disposable income has climbed back to its average of the previous decade.  Recently, banks have eased credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightening.  In fact, our own Consumer Credit Panel, a representative sample of the liability side of the U.S. consumer balance sheet derived from consumer credit reports, indicates that total household liabilities increased last quarter on a year-over-year basis, the first rise since mid-2008. \n\nIn addition to the firming in consumer spending, growth of exports was quite strong over the second half of last year.  Following a few years of lackluster performance, growth among our major trading partners improved, providing a boost to employment and output in our manufacturing sector.  Moreover, the important advances made in oil drilling technology have boosted U.S. energy production, cutting oil imports and boosting petroleum product exports and this is also leading to steady improvement in our trade balance.  The economy also received an important boost from quite strong inventory accumulation, which added nearly a full percentage point to the annualized second half growth rate.  This inventory investment was broad-based across sectors and types of goods.  In fact, all four quarters of 2013 saw a positive growth contribution from inventory accumulation, something that typically only occurs as the economy first emerges from recession.  I interpret this as a sign of increased confidence about the economic outlook within the business community.  \n\nFinally, federal fiscal restraint lessened over the second half of 2013.  This is in sharp contrast to the first half of the year, when the payroll tax cut expired, tax rates on higher income households were raised, a series of taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act took effect, and spending was reduced due to the sequester and the gradual winding down of foreign military operations.  Moreover, the sustained contraction in spending and employment by state and local governments appears to be nearing an end.  \n\nI wish that I could report that the improved pace of growth of economic activity led to a corresponding increase in the rate of improvement in labor market conditions.  But such was not the case.  As I noted earlier, the average monthly change of nonfarm payroll employment over the second half of the year, at 184,000 per month, was somewhat below the 204,000 average monthly increase of the first half.  In addition, growth of aggregate hours worked by private sector employees was somewhat slower in the second half than in the first.  The source of this apparent anomaly is the fact that labor productivity, or output per hour worked, rose rapidly over the second half of the year after being essentially unchanged over the first half.  This is a perfect example of the double-edged sword of productivity growth.  In the long-run, sustained strong productivity growth is what boosts real living standards.  However, in the short-run it can depress job creation.  \n\nWhile overall labor market indicators for the second half of 2013 were not particularly strong, the overall trend in unemployment showed some improvement with the unemployment rate falling sharply over that period, from 7.5 percent in June to 6.7 percent in December.  However, as has been the case since October of 2009 when the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent, this decline in the unemployment rate was driven in large part by a decline in the labor force participation rate.  Much has been written about the forces that are causing this decline of the labor force participation rate.  Researchers have shown that the aging of the population is playing a role, as are changes in behavior.  But our own analysis suggests that the cyclical weakness of demand for labor is an important contributing factor.  As a result, I conclude that the decline of the unemployment rate significantly overstates the degree of improvement in the labor market.   \n\nLooking forward, I believe that the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy have improved to the point where we can expect sustained growth above the roughly 2 1/4 percent annual pace that prevailed from mid-2009 through mid-2013.  Also, the amount of fiscal drag continues to diminish.  Another good piece of news is that Congress has raised the debt ceiling until March 2015.  This lessens the risk that political brinkmanship in Washington could harm consumer and business confidence.   \n\nThat said, I expect that growth, over the near term, will slow somewhat from the pace we saw during the second half of last year.  In particular, during the current quarter, unusually cold and snowy weather will undoubtedly depress activity somewhat—especially with respect to construction activity, but also to a lesser extent in areas such as retail spending.  Also, as mentioned above, some special, one-time factors, such as very rapid growth of exports and sustained inventory building, are unlikely to be repeated over the first half of this year.  Moreover, while there is now a much better balance between supply and demand in the housing market, that market is still adjusting to the roughly 100 basis point increase in mortgage interest rates that occurred in mid-2013. \n\nI do expect that growth will be strong enough to lead to continued improvement in labor market conditions.  I must caution, however, that the outlook for the unemployment rate is unusually uncertain.  If our assessment is correct, at some point an improving labor market should cause the labor force participation rate to stabilize or rise a bit as currently discouraged workers begin looking for work.  Such developments could result in a more muted rate of decline of the unemployment rate despite the faster growth. \n\nFinally, as the expansion continues, I expect inflation to gradually rise toward the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE deflator.  This forecast is based on the projected gradual increase in the levels of resource utilization, a firming in global demand, and the upward pull exercised by stable inflation expectations on actual inflation.  Underpinning the latter assumption is the broad stability of long-term inflation expectations across different financial and survey measures, combined with ongoing moderate growth of wages and unit labor costs—all observations consistent with anchored inflation expectations. \n\nOverall, I would characterize the outlook as reasonably favorable.  But I would very much prefer faster economic growth and more rapid progress towards our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  Hence, the continued need for monetary policy to remain highly accommodative to support the economic recovery to the fullest.   \n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  This is my first time in New Zealand (not counting a brief stop at the Auckland airport).  I’m delighted to be here and am heading down to the South Island tomorrow.  \n\nToday, I am going to talk about the challenges that face us in ensuring stability in the global financial system.  While we have made considerable progress in strengthening the financial system—for example, large global banks have considerably more capital and liquidity resources than prior to the financial crisis—there is still a significant amount of hard work ahead for all of us.  For example, we need to develop resolution mechanisms that will work on a global basis and we need to ensure that the clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives through central counterparties (CCPs) is done safely.  We also need to improve our ability to aggregate and share data.  We need to do this in order to develop a coherent view of the global financial system so that we can deal with emerging vulnerabilities in a timely and effective way.  As always, my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.  \n\nIn the years prior to Lehman Brothers’ failure, critical vulnerabilities built up within the global financial system.  Banks evolved from being local in their geographic footprint, to national and then international in scope.  Supervision and regulation did not keep pace with these changes and capital and liquidity requirements were underdeveloped during this period.  Our view into the operations of global banks was too limited due both to shortcomings of banks in aggregating their internal information and to difficulties in sharing information globally across supervisors. \n\nAt the same time, the so-called “shadow banking” system was growing in both size and complexity.  Particularly noteworthy was the proliferation of money-like instruments created outside of the traditional banking sector that were used to finance long-term, illiquid assets.  In the U.S., protections against bank runs that were put into place during the Great Depression did not extend to this new shadow banking sector.  \n\nPut simply, we did not have a good picture of the global financial system.  As a result, we were unable to observe its growing instabilities or respond preemptively to emerging vulnerabilities.  \n\nWhile the official sector has made considerable progress in addressing these weaknesses, important challenges remain.  In particular, we must eliminate the regime of having “too-big-to-fail” financial institutions.  I believe that a multi-faceted approach is needed involving four major components.  First, we need to minimize the risk that a large, complex financial firm fails in the first place.  Second, we need to have credible resolution regimes in place should such a failure materialize despite our best efforts.  Third, we need to strengthen the resiliency of our financial system so that the stresses associated with the failure of a major financial firm are not amplified across the system. Fourth, we need to build up our data capabilities so we can better monitor the global financial system as a whole.  For the full benefit from this multifaceted approach to be realized, public authorities must continue to work together in a coordinated manner. \n\nGlobal, systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) pose a significant challenge to financial stability on two fronts.  First, due to their size, complexity and central role in financial markets, a disorderly failure of a G-SIFI would directly cause major disruptions in markets, adversely affecting credit flows and real economic activity.  Second, such a disorderly failure would also indirectly place significant negative strains on other financial firms due not only to direct credit exposures to the failed institution, but also due to the fire sale dynamics that would ensue.  The lack of transparency in markets as to which firms would be most affected could result in a general pull-back by investors, which, in turn, could lead to additional deleveraging and further downward pressure on asset prices.  As we saw during the financial crisis, this amplification mechanism could quickly spread the strains throughout the global financial system.           \n\nPrior to the financial crisis, the risk to financial stability posed by G-SIFIs created a dilemma for policymakers when one or more of these firms found itself in danger of failing.  On the one hand, standing back and not intervening would enhance market discipline.  This market discipline would provide incentives for better decision-making by the management of financial firms and more vigorous monitoring by their creditors.  On the other hand, the risks to financial stability from a failure would have been extraordinarily high, creating pressure for the official sector to intervene in an effort to prevent a disorderly failure.           \n\nHistorically, in most cases when the relevant firms were very large and complex, this dilemma has led to official sector interventions.  A consequence is that market discipline was undermined for those firms perceived to be “too big to fail.”  To the extent that such actions cause creditors to anticipate future interventions that would shield them from losses, this reduces creditors’ incentive to monitor the management of these firms or respond forcefully in the case of early signs of deterioration.  In addition, because the expectation of official sector intervention lowers expected credit losses, this results in cheaper funding costs and provides G-SIFIs with a competitive advantage.  It also creates an incentive for such firms to take actions to maintain their too-big-to fail status to preserve this funding advantage.  As a consequence, the structure of the financial system has evolved towards larger and more complex firms than can be justified by economies of scale and scope.           \n\nThis is an unacceptable regime and this policy dilemma needs to be resolved.  Ideally, we want a regime in which we retain the benefits from the services provided by G-SIFIs to the economy, but not at the price of having to “bail-out” such institutions in order to preserve financial stability should they come to the brink of failure.  \n\nI believe that a credible solution involves two complementary goals.  First, coordinated steps must be taken to significantly reduce the likelihood that a G-SIFI ever reaches the point where it is at risk of failure.  This risk should be pushed well below the level for smaller and less complex financial institutions.  Second, home jurisdictions for these G-SIFIs need credible resolution mechanisms that can be implemented on a global basis so these firms can fail without large systemic consequences.  A resolution mechanism will be credible only if it reduces the negative externalities from such a failure to an acceptable level.           \n\nWhile progress has been made toward these two goals, additional work and coordination is still required.  Turning first to efforts to reduce the likelihood that a G-SIFI will be at risk of failing, the Basel international standards raised both the quantity and quality of capital for internationally active banks.  Banks also are required to capture more complex risks in their measures of risk-weighted assets.  To complement the stronger risk-weighted capital standards, an international leverage ratio requirement also has been adopted. \n\nIn addition, the Basel framework will require a capital buffer that increases with a firm’s size, complexity, interconnectedness and global footprint.  In addition to providing additional loss absorbing capacity, this capital buffer requirement will act to offset any funding advantages for G-SIFIs, helping to level the playing field with smaller, less complex financial institutions.  Together, when fully implemented, these changes should reduce the failure risk for G-SIFIs. \n\nTo complement the Basel framework, I believe that jurisdictions need to create processes and incentives for management of G-SIFIs to act earlier and more decisively in response to emerging risks facing their firms.  Proactive interventions by the senior management of banks will have a greater efficacy and a lower cost than reactive steps taken only in response to growing market pressure.  These proactive management interventions can take many forms including raising additional capital, cutting capital distributions, restructuring business lines and making difficult personnel changes.  Avoiding a hazard is easier if one’s focal point is kept well down the road. \n\nOfficial sector stress tests are an important tool that can facilitate this forward-looking management focus.  One example is the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process in the United States.  The goal of CCAR is to ensure that banks have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes, as well as sufficient capital to withstand severely stressed economic conditions while, maintaining their ability to perform their critical roles of credit intermediation.  In CCAR, each of the participating banks is required to project the impact of particular forward-looking stress scenarios on their operations over a two-year horizon.  Both the banks and the supervisors conduct independent assessments of the impact of the stress scenarios on the various business lines of the bank.  This approach provides a cross-validation of each bank’s analysis, while at the same time generating results that can be compared across the participating banks. \n\nAnother important feature of CCAR is that the scenarios and the key aspects of the banks results are made public rather than treated as confidential supervisory information.  This transparency is important for supporting market confidence in the banking system.  Finally, a critical aspect of the stress testing process is the supervisory review of the capital planning process for each participating bank.  This planning process is what reinforces and promotes a proactive stance by management to emerging risks. \n\nThe structure of bank management compensation also could be designed to provide incentives that reinforce a proactive, forward-looking risk management approach.  As I will discuss in a moment, sufficient long-term debt that can be converted to equity is an important element of an effective resolution mechanism for G-SIFIs.  While the magnitude of this long-term debt needs to be sufficient to ensure that public funds are not at risk in the event that a resolution of a firm is necessary, making this long-term debt a component of management compensation might also be used to help reduce the likelihood of a default.  Long-term debt provided by outside creditors exposed to risk of default can create useful market discipline.  However, outside creditors do not have the same information or decision rights as inside management.  Structuring a long-term debt requirement so that a meaningful component consists of deferred compensation held by senior management would presumably strengthen the incentives for proactive risk management.  In my opinion, more research is needed into how the structure of management compensation for financial firms could incentivize good risk management and limit the appetite for excessive risk.1\n\nEven if every jurisdiction were to successfully implement these types of initiatives and consequently reduce the default risks associated with their G-SIFIs, the risk of failure would not be fully eliminated.  This means there would always be some residual risk of major disruptions to financial markets due to a disorderly default of a large financial firm.  Consequently, the development and implementation of credible resolution mechanisms for G-SIFIs is the second key component of a global strategy to improve financial stability.  By credible, I mean that if the situation of an impending G-SIFI default arises, the home authorities will proceed with the resolution plan, rather than give in to pressure to intervene to prevent the failure.  This requires that the resolution mechanisms be capable of significantly mitigating the negative externalities associated with winding down a failing G-SIFI.  Although the specifics of the resolution mechanisms will necessarily vary to some extent across jurisdictions, reflecting differences in institutional structures, legal frameworks, and regulatory regimes, the goal is common—to be able to resolve any G-SIFI regardless of its home jurisdiction, even in periods of stressful financial market conditions, without taxpayer funds, in a way that minimizes knock-on effect to financial markets and other financial institutions. \n\nAs I have indicated in earlier speeches, I endorse the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) single point of entry (SPE) resolution framework for the United States.  For the SPE approach to be successful, firms subject to this resolution regime will need to have a sufficient amount of long-term debt at the parent company that the FDIC can convert into equity to guarantee that the new bridge company is adequately capitalized.  Counterparties at the subsidiary level need to be assured that they have no reason to pull back from the new bridge company. \n\nIn the international arena this type of requirement is referred to as GLAC, or “gone concern loss absorption capacity.”  The Financial Stability Board is working on a proposal for an international GLAC standard, with a target date for consideration this November. Finalizing this standard is an important to-do item.  As I discussed earlier, both the amount and the composition of additional resources are important.  The adequacy of the GLAC buffer mitigates the negative externalities from a default, while the possible use of management-held long-term debt as an element of GLAC could bolster incentives to reduce the risk of a default in the first place. \n\nThere are implementation details of the FDIC’s SPE resolution framework that still need to be worked out.  These arise from the challenge involved in operationalizing the framework with financial firms that conduct business across several jurisdictions and geographic borders.  In this international arena, one specific issue needs to be promptly addressed.  Due to parent guarantees or other cross-default provisions, the placement by the FDIC of the parent company into receivership may be treated by some counterparties as an event of default.  This could trigger the close-out of qualified financial contracts (QFCs) such as interest rate swap contracts at international subsidiaries, which could potentially be destabilizing.  To deal with this issue, the Dodd-Frank Act’s Title II one-day stay on the close-out of qualified financial contracts needs to be extended to cover contracts governed by non-U.S. law and involving non-U.S. counterparties.  Resolving this issue is important to ensuring a smooth transition to the new bridge company. \n\nAddressing the contract close-out issue can be accomplished in two ways that are not mutually exclusive.  First, existing derivative contracts could be amended and future contracts written to stipulate that the parent’s placement into a Title II resolution does not trigger the close-out option.  Second, legal provisions in other countries could be modified so that the one-day stay that applies to qualified financial contracts governed by U.S. law is also enforceable for those contracts governed by foreign law.  Either or both of these actions would help ensure that the FDIC’s SPE mechanism could be successfully executed without unduly disrupting financial markets and counterparty risk positions. \n\nGiven the cross-border activities of the G-SIFIs, the effectiveness of resolution mechanisms also will depend on the degree of coordination across national authorities.  For example, we do not know for certain how foreign authorities would react if the parent of a U.S.-based G-SIFI were placed into a Title II resolution proceeding.  Uncertainties exist regarding whether foreign authorities either might choose, or be required, to take defensive actions such as ring-fencing that could disrupt the smooth implementation of the resolution process.  An important task going forward is for authorities to work cooperatively and expeditiously to resolve these uncertainties. \n\nA well-crafted and well-executed resolution process for G-SIFIs can still be expected to create some strains in financial markets, especially considering the likely unsettled state of these markets at the time a resolution is being implemented.  This suggests that it is also important to work on improving the resiliency in financial markets so that any shocks associated with a G-SIFI resolution are dampened rather than amplified.  Two areas of work that show promise along these lines are new funding requirements and the move to central clearing for many OTC derivatives. \n\nAn important function of financial firms is to provide liquidity to the market.  However, this exposes financial firms to run risk.  Liquidity runs can be an accelerant to asset fire sales that can lead to downward price spirals where firms must sell assets to raise funds, with these sales putting more downward pressure on asset prices, leading to a renewed round of asset sales.  For solvent financial firms, protection against liquidity runs requires liquidity buffers and/or access to appropriately collateralized central bank liquidity support.  Financial firms on their own would likely choose to hold liquidity buffers that are smaller than socially optimal since these firms do not internalize the positive market externality that these liquidity buffers provide.  As a consequence, liquidity regulation is necessary to achieve the desired level of firms’ liquidity buffers. \n\nLiquidity buffer requirements are also needed to reduce the dependence of these firms on central bank lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) support.  There are several reasons this is desirable.  First, access to central bank liquidity can lead to moral hazard with respect to the behavior of financial firms.  This can be mitigated by requiring that firms with access to LOLR support hold sufficient liquidity buffers that must be used ahead of any central bank liquidity—the equivalent of liquidity “skin-in-the game.” Second, the line between illiquidity and insolvency often can become blurred, especially when markets are under stress.  Central banks are meant to provide liquidity support only to solvent firms so that the central banks avoid taking on credit risk.  An overreliance by firms on access to central bank liquidity can expose the central bank to the risk of loss.  Finally, in some cases, central bank liquidity provision can become stigmatized.  In this case, financial firms are prone to underutilize this source of liquidity—a decision that can have adverse consequences for markets and the availability of credit.  Liquidity buffers reduce the likelihood that this stigma constraint will become binding. \n\nThe on-going Basel discussions have focused on a short-term liquidity requirement—the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR); and a longer-term liquidity requirement, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).  The intention of the LCR is for banks to hold sufficient high-quality, liquid assets that can be easily and quickly converted to cash to cover expected liquidity outflows in a stress scenario over a 30-day period.  Unlike illiquid assets, the conversion of these high quality liquid assets into cash should not create any fire sale dynamics.  However, it is important that banks actually use this liquidity buffer when there are liquidity outflows, rather than attempting to maintain their LCR at 100 percent by selling other assets. \n\nThe OTC derivatives markets remain another important source of potential instability.  Recognizing this vulnerability, the Group of Twenty (G20) in its 2009 Pittsburgh Summit statement stipulated that all standardized derivative contracts would be moved to central clearing, and that the remaining non-standard derivatives would be subject to higher capital requirements.2  While there will inevitably be a residual share of derivatives that do not lend themselves to standardization, authorities need to continue to work collaboratively to keep this residual share to a minimum. \n\nWhy is standardization so important?  Standardization has advantages in terms of increasing transparency, price discovery and liquidity.  Standardization is also important because it allows the derivatives to be centrally cleared in a CCP.  Without central clearing, participants have bilateral credit exposures to each of their counterparties.  Moreover, they cannot fully assess their credit risk exposures in this framework since there is no information on the other derivative contracts that their counterparties have with other market participants.  Central clearing replaces this complex web with a single set of relationships between the firm and the CCP as its counterparty.  This allows for netting, so that a firm’s risk is limited to its net exposure to the central counterparty.  This both reduces risk and increases transparency.  Consequently, members of the CCP have less of an incentive to pull back in periods of stress and this makes the market more resilient. \n\nIn addition, international standards on margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives have been adopted.3  By definition, bespoke derivatives cannot be centrally cleared and so do not benefit from the risk reduction and enhanced transparency associated with central clearing.  To offset this, these derivatives will be required by regulation to have higher initial margin requirements, as well as variation margin. \n\nDespite these efforts, we still may not get the balance right in terms of the requirements applied to non-standard versus standardized, cleared contracts.  One worry is that CCPs that are shareholder-owned and operated for profit may compete for market share by offering lower margin requirements on standardized products.  This could strike the wrong balance between the private profit motive versus the public benefit of clearing.  For this reason, I believe that all CCPs need to have strong governance and regulatory oversight.  This must be harmonized on an international basis in order to prevent a potential race to the bottom. \n\nIt is important to recognize that increased use of CCPs for central clearing also creates potential financial stability issues that must be addressed.  While CCPs reduce aggregate risk, they also concentrate the remaining risk.  That is, CCPs create potential single points of failure in global derivatives markets.  CCPs need adequate capacity to absorb potential losses from the default of one or more of its members, and they need to have access to liquidity so that they can always fully settle their obligations.  \n\nTo address this concern, in 2012, international standard setters issued a set of minimum risk management standards for financial market infrastructures including CCPs.4  These principles, known as the “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures” (PFMIs), require that a CCP maintain sufficient liquid resources.  This includes the requirement that a CCP have a pre-funded default arrangement and that the CCP collects initial and variation margin.  In particular, the PFMIs stipulate that a CCP must be able to withstand, in a stress environment, the failure of the member having the largest exposure to the CCP.  In some cases, this requirement is strengthened to require the ability to cover the failure of the two largest members.  The PFMIs also require the CCPs to develop effective methodologies to estimate their funding exposures, so that they can better manage their liquidity risks.\n\nAnother important risk management task for CCPs is the on-boarding of new members and the monitoring of the condition of existing members.  The strength of the CCP is ultimately derived from the collective strength of its members.  The mutualization of the CCP’s net credit risk across its members creates an incentive for its members to only want well-capitalized and well-managed members as part of the CCP.  The CCP also must ensure that members are meeting their margin requirements and remain in good standing.  \n\nIt is also worth noting that these safeguards for CCPs will need to be put into place along with other reforms such as the use of multilateral trading platforms and trade repositories.  Seamless integration with these new trading processes is essential for CCPs to contribute to financial stability. \n\nThe financial crisis also highlighted the significant gaps that existed between the data collected and the data necessary to adequately monitor developments in the global financial system.  In addition, the crisis underscored an important limitation of the current data structure: the inability to combine data effectively across jurisdictions in order to develop a comprehensive view. As a consequence, policymakers often did not have timely access to key information that would have informed both the diagnosis of emerging problems as well as the likely efficacy of proposed interventions.  As we all know, it is difficult to safely steer a fast-moving car if outward vision is impaired by a windshield that is largely obscured.           \n\nIn response, the G20 in April 2009 instructed the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to detail these information gaps and to develop proposals for resolving them.  The Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) was the response to carry out this important work.  The DGI set out four broad objectives: (1) Better capture the build-up of risk in the financial sector, (2) improve data on international financial network connections, (3) monitor the vulnerability of domestic economies to shocks, and (4) improve the communication of official statistics.  Across these four objectives twenty specific recommendations were developed.5  In particular, the DGI effort included developing a centralized data center to pool relevant data for all globally systemically important banks (GSIBs).6 \n\nImplementing the DGI agenda involves more than simply defining common data templates and retooling bank information systems to populate these templates.  Rather, what is required is a deeper cultural change in how supervisors operate and interact with each other.  This transformation takes time and involves a process of building mutual trust.  To date, a new data center has been established at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) that is receiving data on G-SIB institution-to-institution counterparty credit exposures.  Work is underway to expand this data collection to include institution-to-institution funding dependencies, with additional work to follow on institution-to-aggregate credit and funding.  Home supervisors contributing data to the BIS data center are receiving reports based on an analysis of the pooled data.  Supporting this collaborative initiative is a multilateral framework signed by all of the participating supervisors that details confidentiality requirements, data sharing, and governance arrangements.  As this effort moves forward, the data will be available to support both enhanced micro-prudential supervision and macro-prudential supervision. \n\nMore work, though, needs to be done to facilitate a comprehensive data view of the important financial markets.  As an example, an increasing number of trade repositories are collecting valuable transaction data.  However, the full benefit of these data can only be realized if we can aggregate this information across the trade repositories, and if regulators have access to the data needed to support their respective mandates.7  The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have produced an analysis of some of the foundational steps that need to be taken.8  Again, implementing these steps will take time and will need our continued attention. \n\nThe goal of financial stability will remain elusive so long as we have financial firms that are judged as “too big to fail.”  Some might argue that this is reason enough to break up these firms.  I do not believe that this is the best course of action.  As I have outlined here today, I prefer a multi-faceted approach that strives to: (1) minimize the risk that a large complex financial firm faces default, (2) have in place a credible resolution regime if a default becomes imminent, (3) improve the resiliency of our financial system so that any shocks resulting from a resolution are not amplified across the system, and (4) build out a global data model for effectively monitoring global financial markets.  If we can execute on these four elements, then I believe that we can retain the economic benefits from having large financial firms that support the global economy while minimizing the risks that the activities of such firms might pose to the global financial system. \n\nThank you for your kind attention. \n\n1 Structuring this in a way to get the incentives right is critical.  For example, one would want to be certain that in no circumstance would management see a benefit from putting the firm into resolution in order to convert its debt holdings into equity.   \n\n2 See Group of Twenty (2009) The G20 Pittsburgh Summit Leaders’ Statement.\n\n3 See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Board of International Organization of Securities Commissions (2013) Margin Requirements for Non-Centrally Cleared Derivatives.\n\n4 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2012) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure.\n\n5 See FSB and IMF (2009) The Financial Crisis and Information Gaps.

        "content": "It is a pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity to talk about the role of economics and economists at the Reserve Banks.  Economics is a critical discipline at the New York Fed, just as it is at the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Banks. \n\nNevertheless, I expect that my perspective will differ a bit from that of Eric, Charlie, or Narayana1. In part, this is because my background is different.  Although I have a Ph.D. from Berkeley, unlike Charlie and Narayana, I never spent time in academia, and, unlike Eric, I spent most of my career not in public service, but working in the private sector.  My focus during my time in the private sector was also somewhat different than my colleagues, with an emphasis on those issues that affect financial markets. Don't get me wrong, I am very happy I got a Ph.D. in economics, the training has been invaluable.  It's just that my career path is a bit unusual relative to other central bankers, so that must influence my perspective. \n\nOf course, another important point of differentiation is where I am now and the unique role that the New York Fed performs within the Federal Reserve System.  All of the Federal Reserve Banks have their areas of specialization.  In my opinion, the New York Fed has at least four that are worthy of mention today because these affect the work of the New York Fed's economists. \n\nFirst, we are the operational arm of the Federal Reserve, responsible for the implementation of monetary policy.  This means we have a unique set of relationships with the securities dealer community and with respect to monitoring financial markets.  It also means that we work very closely with the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in implementing monetary policy.  \n\nSecond, we have a unique endowment and responsibility by virtue of our location.  New York City is a global financial center, and finance is a very important aspect of the Second District's economy. Most of the largest global financial institutions have a major presence here.  With delegated authority from the Board of Governors, we are responsible for the supervision of most of the major financial institutions headquartered in our district, as well as numerous foreign banking organizations that do business here.\n\nThird, we are the fiscal agent for the Treasury and conduct the Treasury debt auctions on their behalf.  Additionally, we are responsible for Fedwire, which along with Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), is one of the two large-dollar, real-time payment systems in the U.S. \n\nFourth, we have a unique set of international duties.  We provide banking services to foreign central banks, including investment of reserves and administration of foreign exchange swap lines.  We also have a seat at the table in Basel with respect to the activities of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), its various committees, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nAs I noted earlier, economics is a critical discipline at the New York Fed.   The New York Fed economists are not just theoreticians.  Most have a strong empirical orientation and work very closely with those in the Bank that are responsible for the execution of policy—be it with respect to monetary policy, financial stability, supervision or payments services.  What's special to me about the Bank is how the economists and non-economists work together to develop practical policy solutions to real-world problems and then implement those policies effectively.\n\nThe breadth of activities at the New York Fed means that our economists contribute to policy in many different ways, working closely with other areas of the Bank including those who execute on our supervision, monetary policy, and payments responsibilities.  We have about 60 Ph.D. economists in our Research Group.  But we also have many more in other areas of the Bank, such as part of our open markets desk, in our supervision group, and in our risk functions.  In fact, many of those with economics Ph.D.s elsewhere in the Bank started their careers at the Bank in the Research Group.  They moved to other areas of the Bank as their interests evolved and they became less focused on research and more focused on policy development.  This movement of economists throughout the organization has helped build a deep reservoir of human capital within the Bank and has fostered close collaboration between Research and other areas of the Bank. \n\nOur model with respect to attracting economists into our Research Group is to hire people with strong research skills, with the highest academic credentials and who already have or are likely to develop a policy orientation related to the Bank's work.  We give our economists plenty of time and opportunity to conduct independent research, and expect them to publish their research in the major academic journals and to engage with the economics profession outside the Bank.  As they progress in research capability, we require economists to apply the skills and techniques they use in research to policy issues.  We expect that, as their academic careers develop, there will be a natural convergence between their research interests and the Bank's policy agenda. This usually happens as a matter of course because the Bank has a rich agenda of policy issues to work on and the economists at the Bank often have unique access to data and information that would not be available elsewhere.  The convergence works in both directions: research informs the policy work and policy work generates research questions. The end result is that our economists have the ability to be both highly respected in their disciplines from a research perspective, and also to make a significant contribution to policy development and implementation.  There is an excellent value proposition both for the Bank and the economists that work here, as indicated by the publication record of our economists and their contribution to policy initiatives. \n\nLet me give you some more concrete examples of what our economists have worked on or are currently working on.  I will focus on three broad buckets: prudential policy and financial stability; monetary and macroeconomic policy; and microeconomic and regional economic policy.\n\nPrudential policy and financial stability\nNew York Fed economists, inside and outside our Research Group, provided substantial assistance to the design and development of the numerous emergency lender of last resort facilities implemented during the financial crisis.  This was done in conjunction with the Board of Governors, but the contributions from the New York Fed were critical because of our unique vantage point with respect to operational implementation, financial markets, and financial market infrastructures.\n\nIn a different vein, New York Fed economists assisted in designing, developing, and implementing supervisory stress testing, including the annual Comprehensive and Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress tests.  The New York Fed's economists perspectives and measurements on how downturns affect bank portfolio values was crucial to the design of these tests.  A critical aspect of CCAR was the development of independent detailed models for the key bank business lines to act as an independent check on the risk assessments by the banks. Of course, this effort also drew on work at the Board of Governors and the rest of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs well, our economists have played a role in developing international and domestic regulatory policy with respect to bank capital and liquidity standards.  For instance, measurement of capital losses over time, and various run-off rates of different types of liabilities by our economists informed this work.  Also, our economists' work on broker-dealer liquidity informed the design of the liquidity coverage ratio. \n\nFinally, our economists pay special attention to the emerging area of financial stability monitoring.  This takes place in a number of realms, including participation in the work of the Basel Committees, such as the Committee on Global Financial Stability (CGFS) of the BIS, that I currently chair, and the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS), which I once chaired, the numerous workgroups and committees of the Financial Stability Board, and ongoing contributions to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  With respect to the FSOC, for example, New York and Chicago Fed economists have played a key role in editing the FSOC annual reports.  \n\nA few other examples of our economists' involvement in prudential and regulator policy include:\n\nMonetary policy and macroeconomic policy\nEconomists provide invaluable input to the New York Fed President, who serves as Vice-Chairman of the FOMC, and to the Markets Group, which is responsible for the operational aspects of monetary policy implementation. \n\nThis work has many aspects, including: \n\nMicroeconomic and regional policy\nNew York Fed economists also have important opportunities supporting microeconomic and regional policy.  These include the survey of consumer expectations, which will launch this month, and the consumer credit panel, which, using raw data supplied by Equifax, allows us to develop insights into consumer indebtedness at the micro-level.  These panels give us and the public unique insights into household beliefs and behavior.  One example is the work highlighting the growing aggregate student loan debt balance and repayment burden.\n\nAn important responsibility for each of the Reserve Banks is coverage of economic development in its region. A significant aspect of this work at the New York Fed involves our regional press briefings, business surveys, and white papers.  One notable example has been the New York Fed economists' work in developing a white paper that highlighted some key choices that Puerto Rican policymakers might make to eliminate structural constraints that have impinged on the Island's economic performance. \n\nI'm very pleased by the contributions of our economists in the Bank, whether they sit in the Research Group or elsewhere in the Bank.  I think we have helped to contribute to the considerable progress made on a number of fronts, including making the financial system more resilient and robust and helping make monetary policy more effective, even at the zero lower bound.\n\nBut there is much more work to do.  In particular, I think we have just scratched the surface in understanding how developments in one area, such as capital and liquidity requirements for large, complex financial institutions, affect other areas, such as effective monetary policy implementation. We still don't have well developed macro-models that incorporate a realistic financial sector.  We don't understand fully how large-scale asset purchase programs work to ease financial market conditions—is it the effect of the purchases on the portfolios of private investors, or alternatively is the major channel one of signaling? \n\nThere are many other riddles that remain to be solved.  How does one design an effective reference rate that is informative, verifiable and not vulnerable to manipulation?  If you manage to come up with one, how do you migrate the trillions of dollars of existing contracts to the new standard?  The U.S. unemployment rate has declined more sharply than one might expect given the economy's growth rate over the past few years.  Is this permanent or will it reverse if the economy continues to grow and the pressure on labor market resources increases in the coming years?   How does one end “too big to fail” for large global firms operating across different jurisdictions?  The list goes on and on.  There is plenty to work on and think about.\n\nFinally, let me take up one other question that Stan has posed: Do I think you need to be an economist to be the President at the New York Fed?  I don't think so.  If you look at the past five Presidents—Volcker, Corrigan, McDonough, Geithner, and myself, some have been economists, some haven't.  Yet I think all my predecessors have been very effective. \n\nI think there are other attributes that are more important than being an economist: 1) An analytical orientation; 2) the ability to synthesize a broad range of material so as to understand the interactions of markets, financial institutions, and regulatory and macroeconomic policy; 3) open-mindedness and pragmatism—the world is complicated and ever changing; and 4) the ability to lead—that means identifying the key issues and motivating people to do their best work in order to develop new insights and approaches. \n\nHaving an economics background probably helps, especially on the analytics side, but, in my view, is by no means necessary and certainly not sufficient.  One point on which I am certain is that regardless of the background of the President, having a very strong research group is essential.\n\nThanks for your kind attention."
